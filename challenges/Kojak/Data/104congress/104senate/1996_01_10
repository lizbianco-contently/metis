Since we represented neighboring States, we worked \ntogether on a number of issues--especially those relating to \nagriculture.\n  Since Mike was a staunch Democrat, there were many other issues on \nwhich we found ourselves on opposite sides.\n  But Mike knew that you could disagree with someone without being \ndisagreeable.\n  And I never doubted for a minute that Mike was standing up for what \nhe believed.\n  He was, in the words of our former colleague David Boren, truly a \n``person of principle.''\n  I know I speak for all Members of this Chamber in extending our \ncondolences to Mike's family, and to his many friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S113-5", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S113-S114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STEALTH VETO OF WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in the State of the Union Address President \nClinton delivered nearly 1 year ago, he said--and I quote--``Nothing \nhas done \n\n[[Page S114]]\nmore to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed \nwelfare system.''\n  In just a few weeks, President Clinton will deliver another State of \nthe Union Address.\n  And he will do so with the knowledge that he bears total \nresponsibility for the continuation of that failed welfare system.\n  America heard a great deal of rhetoric in 1992 from candidate \nClinton, and a great deal of rhetoric since then from President Clinton \nabout ``ending welfare as we know it.''\n  But all the words in the world cannot obscure President Clinton's \naction of last night.\n  Given his promises, it is no wonder President Clinton used the cover \nof darkness to veto the truly revolutionary welfare reform bill which \nwould have kept his commitments.\n  This bill was, of course, the result of almost a year of hard work by \na bipartisan group of Members of Congress, Senators, and, very \nimportantly, our Nation's Governors.\n  The President may have tried to hide his stealth veto by doing it \nlate at night, but he can not hid the message he is sending to the \nAmerican people: a loud and clear message that he will stand in the way \nof fundamental change, and, instead, will fight for the status quo.\n  The President's veto means that American taxpayers will enter 1996 \ncontinuing to pour countless millions into a system that has failed, \naccording to everyone. The system failed, and failed, and failed. And \nthose who are served by the system will enter a new year with little or \nno hope for escaping from a future of welfare.\n  What a different 1996--and a different future--it would have been had \nthe President backed his words up with action by signing the \nlegislation.\n  Instead of the status quo where all authority resides in Washington, \nwe would have shifted power to our State capitals, and given our \nGovernors the ability to create a system that meets the unique needs of \ntheir States.\n  Instead of the status quo, where welfare often becomes a way of life, \nand where some receive Federal; cash benefits just because they choose \nnot to work, we would have a system where people are required to work \nafter 2 years, and one with a 5-year limit on the receipt of Federal \nbenefits.\n  Instead of the status quo, where children are rewarded for having \nchildren and for moving away from home, we would have one which \nrecognizes the importance of family--one that discourages illegitimacy, \nand encourages personal responsibility.\n  Instead of the status quo, which often allows deadbeat dads to escape \ntheir financial responsibilities, we would have a system that \nstreamlined paternity establishment, that established State registries, \nthat made child support laws uniform across State lines, and that \nrequired States to use the threats of denying drivers licenses to \nparents who refuse to pay child support.\n  Instead of the status quo which wastes billions of taxpayer dollars, \nwe would have a system that gives our States the authority and \nresponsibility to crack down on fraud and abuse.\n  I am not claiming that our welfare reform legislation was perfect. \nNor would it have magically solved our Nation's many social problems.\n\n  But it did put an end to a failed system.\n  It was a sharp departure. It was a fundamental change.\n  It was a big, big, step in the right direction.\n  It did return power to our States and cities, and to our people.\n  It did offer hope and opportunity to millions of Americans.\n  And we did want to stress work, and not welfare.\n  But instead of beginning in 1996 by signing this legislation, the \nPresident has chosen to begin it by keeping the status quo intact.\n  I suspect that in this year's State of the Union Address, the \nPresident will again talk about how he wants to end welfare as we know \nit.\n  But they are words that will sound very hollow to many in this \nChamber, and to all Americans who pay for, or who are served by, the \nstatus quo: And that is a failed system that remains intact thanks to \nthe President's actions of last evening.\n  It seems to me that here is a bill that passed the U.S. Senate by a \nvote of 87 to 12. If one absentee, Senator Hatfield, had voted ``aye,'' \nit would have been 88 Senators--good, bipartisan, strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The bill went to conference, and we came back with a fundamental \nSenate bill. And by then it had become politicized again, and it was \nmore of a party-line vote, with one exception on the other side.\n  We have discussed welfare reform in all of the meetings we have had \nat the White House. But I do not see how the President could veto a \nbill that we were so close to coming together on, one that he praised \nwhen it passed the Senate, one that he said he can support. I must say, \nif there are any sharp differences in those two bills--our bill and the \nbill that came from conference--they were not major.\n  So we will try again. We will try again in 1996. It seems to me, and \nit seems to most of my colleagues--at least the 87 who voted for \nwelfare reform--that system has failed. We need fundamental change.\n  We are willing to trust the Governors. We are willing to send power \nback to States. Therein lies the problem. Therein lies the problem, \nbecause I do not think the President of the United States wants that to \nhappen, unless the Federal Government determines eligibility and \ndetermines who is going to be covered and everything else. If you put \nall those regulations on Governors, they will say, ``No, thank you. If \nyou don't give us flexibility, we can't save the money.''\n  We are talking about saving somewhere in the neighborhood of $60 \nbillion over 7 years. And $60 billion is a lot of money to the American \ntaxpayers. We believe it can be done. We believe it can be done, and we \ncan still preserve the benefits for those who need the benefits.\n  There will always be some who need help, and we understand that. But \nwe will also tighten up the system so those who should be working will \nbe working, and the alternative will not be receiving benefits.\n  So we regret that the bill has been vetoed. I guess you can say it \ncame as no surprise. But in our view we had a good product that should \nhave been signed. It seems to me that we will have to take our case to \nthe American people and let them make the final decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S113-6", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

The majority leader talked about someone for whom I feel \na great deal of affection. Mike Synar and I came to the Congress \ntogether in 1978. He was the very first person I met in the House of \nRepresentatives. He was the first Member of Congress I accompanied to \nhis district. He was the first Member of Congress I brought to South \nDakota. We got to be very, very close friends. Over the years that \nfriendship grew, and our affection for one another grew with it.\n  As most people remember, Mike Synar was awarded the Profiles In \nCourage Award just last year for the remarkable display of courage he \ndemonstrated on a whole range of issues. Whether one agreed with him or \nnot, one would have to say that when it came to standing up for his \nconvictions, when it came to his belief that you either come to \nCongress to do something or be something, he chose to do something. You \ncould not deny that that is exactly what he was here to do, to make \nwhat he could out of an opportunity to be a Member of Congress from a \nconservative district in the State of Oklahoma.\n  Mike Synar stood up for what he believed. The antithesis of the \nperception of a modern-day politician, he stood up to the special \ninterests. Whether you agreed with him or not, he stood up and fought \nfor everything he could in the time he was here--campaign finance \nreform, grazing fee reform, tobacco issues that span the spectrum, a \nwhole range of issues that he felt and cared very deeply about.\n  So, Mr. President, America has lost a fine public statesman today. \nAmerica has lost somebody who came here for all the right reasons. \nAmerica has lost somebody who I was fortunate to call a very close and \nspecial friend.\n  We will miss him. Along with Senator Dole, I send my condolences to \nhis family, and to all of those who have had the good fortune to know \nhim, to love him, and to count him as their friend, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S115-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF THE WELFARE REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader talked about his disappointment at \nthe decision of the President to veto the welfare bill. Let me say, Mr. \nPresident, that I am very pleased with the action taken by the \nPresident yesterday.\n  The majority leader characterized the conference report as virtually \nsimilar to the Senate-passed bill. The majority leader did not note \nthat the President said he could support the Senate-passed bill prior \nto the time it went to conference. He did not mention that there was a \nsignificant level of bipartisan support for that bill as it left the \nSenate, controversial in many ways as it was.\n  We all recognize the need for reform. We all recognize that we have \nto build upon the reforms that we enacted over the last 10 years. We \nall recognize that we want to find ways to make work pay. But we also \nought to recognize that we should not be punishing children as we \nattempt to do that. We also ought to recognize that in the name of \nflexibility we should not simply give carte blanche to States to renege \non the responsibilities that every State must have to ensure that there \nis a welfare system that works.\n  No mention was made in the majority leader's remarks of the fact that \nthere was no requirement in the conference report on welfare for the \nStates to actually use for welfare purposes the Federal dollars that \nthey are being provided for welfare. Under the provisions in the \nconference report, if they wanted to use them for infrastructure, they \nwould be able to do that. If they wanted to use them for any other \npurpose they might have in their State budgets, there would be no \nprohibition on doing that.\n  You can talk about maintenance of effort. We actually reduced the \nlevel of maintenance of effort with no other requirement. By \nmaintenance of effort we are simply asking the States, in coming years, \nto live up to the level of benefits they now provide.\n  Not only are they not required to live up to 100 percent of the \nbenefits that they are now providing, the help that they are providing \nin whatever ways to children, the people who are attempting to break \nout of poverty, out of welfare, but the conference report would \nactually give them a license to drop from 100 percent down to 25 \npercent with no expectation in the future of how they will meet the \nrequirements that they already have noted and have accumulated in their \nwelfare budgets today.\n  There is no requirement in the conference-passed version of the bill \nto tell a welfare recipient who is waiting for some form of assistance \nthat they will be receiving assistance at a certain time. In current \nlaw that time limit is 45 days. A State or county has to respond within \n45 days. There is no such requirement in the current bill.\n  A prospective recipient of some form of assistance would have to wait \n6 months, maybe have to wait 9 months, a year, 2 years. There is no \nlimit on the extent to which recipients would have to wait for help.\n  So there are a significant number of very major differences between \nwhat we proposed in the work-first legislation, what we even passed in \nthe U.S. Senate, and what came back as a conference report.\n  We want to make work pay. We want to ensure that children are not \npunished. We want to ensure that there is adequate funding for the \nkinds of things that we know we must do. Frankly, the higher we go in \nwelfare savings, the more concerned I am that all we are really doing \nis creating the pool of resources necessary to pay for the huge tax cut \nthat Republicans continue to insist be a part of any budget.\n  I do not know how we can do more in all the areas that we have agreed \nupon in the budget negotiations, whether it is in child care, whether \nit is in providing adequate nutrition, whether it is in providing real \nskilled opportunities for those who are on welfare today, job skills \nand training skills and the things that would make them more \nemployable, how we can do all of that, and still save $60 billion, \nwhich coincidentally just happens to be an amount that would be very \nhelpful in creating the pool necessary to make the tax cut work in \ncurrent budget deliberations.\n  So, Mr. President, what the President vetoed is a far cry from what \nDemocrats had proposed. It is a significant departure from what the \nSenate had gone on record in support of. I must say, were we to bring \nthe bill back in its current form, we would have more than enough votes \nnecessary to sustain the veto the President demonstrated yesterday.\n  So we are prepared--because we are not satisfied with the status quo \neither--to go back to work to find ways to address the significant \ndeficiencies that currently exist in this bill. Let us make sure that \nwe can find a bipartisan way to address welfare reform prior to the end \nof the year. But let us do it right. Let us ensure that the guarantees \nfor children are there. Let us ensure that we find a way to make work \npay. Let us ensure that we are able to provide the child care necessary \nso that parents can leave their homes for work. Let us ensure that--as \nmuch as we want to provide flexibility to the States--that they are not \ngoing to renege on their responsibility they have to make sure we have \nthe infrastructure in place to ensure that this is more than just a \npiece of paper that we all feel good about on the day we vote again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S115-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as he had indicated he would do, the \nPresident has now vetoed H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Act of 1995. As the bill passed the Senate, December 22, \n1995, with a margin of only 5 votes, 52-47, there can \n\n[[Page S116]]\nbe no question of a veto override. Hence, the judgment of Robert Pear \nof the New York Times that ``The President's action concludes a 4-year \ndrama that began when Mr. Clinton, as a Presidential candidate in 1992, \npromised to `end welfare as we know it.' ''\n  Last September 19, essentially the same bill, indeed H.R. 4, passed \nthe Senate 87-12, with only 11 Democrats opposed. In the interval \nElizabeth Shogren of the Los Angeles Times and Judith Havemann and Ann \nDevroy of the Washington Post reported that the Department of Health \nand Human Services had submitted an analysis of the bill to the White \nHouse. Owing largely to the 5-year time limit, it would throw some 1.5 \nmillion children into poverty. No one could have wished this, and \nDemocrats were especially bound to take into account this assessment of \na Democratic administration. And so, in the end, 45 of 46 Democrats \nvoted against the measure, Republican Senators Campbell and Hatfield \njoined us.\n  On the day of the final Senate vote, the 11 Democratic Senators who \nhad been opposed from the first, wrote President Clinton to warn \nagainst including any ``broad welfare measure * * * in the end of \nsession budget agreement.'' This was not something, we judged, to be \nconcluded in a matter of days by a small group under great pressure.\n  However, we now learn that on Saturday, January 6, as part of a \nbalanced budget proposal offered by the President in those talks, a \nsection ``Welfare Reform Savings''--$46 billion over 7 years--includes \nthis:\n\n       Cash Assistance: AFDC would be terminated and replaced by a \n     new conditional entitlement of limited duration. There would \n     be a 5-year maximum time limit with a state option for \n     vouchers at the end of that period to assist children.\n\n  Thus, the administration seemingly proposes to deliver the same 1.5 \nmillion children into poverty.\n  Why is this happening? I can think of two partial explanations.\n  First, it is widely assumed that AFDC is a Federal entitlement that \nthe Federal Government can restrain without relinquishing. It is not. \nThere is no Federal entitlement to welfare for individuals. Each State \ndevises its own program. The Federal Government provides a matching \ngrant. Abolish the matching grant and you can reasonably expect a race \nto the bottom.\n  Second, even as we deplore welfare dependency, we do not seem to \ngrasp just how serious it really is. A quarter--24 percent--of American \nyouth just turned 18 have been on AFDC. Half--46 percent--of the \nchildren in Chicago will be on AFDC in the course of a single year. Of \nchildren on AFDC, three-quarters are there for more than 5 years. \nHence, a 5-year limit invites chaos and ruin.\n  In particular, liberal-minded persons must proceed with care. For \ndecades now there has been a liberal tendency to understate, even to \ndeny the welfare problem. Now, of a sudden, a liberal administration \nproposes a repeal measure that would have been unthinkable just a few \nyears back. Both positions have the common fault of underestimating how \nserious and dangerous this problem really is.\n  Even so, let us all be ready for a careful, bipartisan exploration of \nthe issue in the 105th Congress. It was, I think, a close call. But as \nChurchill remarked, there is nothing so exhilarating as to be shot at \nand missed.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Dole, and all parties to the budget negotiations and \nurge them to continue their talks after hopefully only a brief \nsuspension. It seems to me likely that an agreement can be reached \nsince the parties are reportedly $100 billion apart. While that is a \nlarge sum of money in absolute terms, it is relatively a small \npercentage of the more than $12 trillion of a 7-year budget. It is \neight-tenths of 1 percent. If an agreement cannot be reached, it is my \nstrong view that the Government should not be closed because of \ngridlock. We should not try to run Government by blackmail. If an \nagreement cannot be reached, I suggest, as strongly as I can, that we \nshould keep the Government running and crystallize the issues and \npresent them to the American people for their decision in the 1996 \nPresidential and congressional elections.\n  During the first week of the shutdown--actually, on the second day, \nback on November 14 of last year, I urged this course of action. It is \na fundamental principle of U.S. constitutional government that the \nCongress and the President are partners, really equal partners, unless \neach House of Congress has a two-thirds majority to override a \nPresidential veto. And if we can get a two-thirds majority by appealing \nto the centrists on both sides of the aisle, then we can structure a \nbudget agreement without the President and without closing the \nGovernment. But, absent that, it is my strong view that we ought to \nkeep the Government running and crystallize the issue for the 1996 \nelection.\n  I understand those in my party who seek to enact our agenda through \nthe political pressure of gridlock and shutdown. I agree with the \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, who has rejected that approach. I remain \ntotally committed to a balanced budget within 7 years with genuine \nCongressional Budget Office figures. Since my first vote for the \nbalanced budget amendment in 1983, I have stood fast for this important \nprinciple. But it is time to acknowledge that it is a failure with the \nAmerican people to try political pressure through gridlock and \nshutdown. It is like Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said about \nobscenity, that he could not define it, but he knew it when he saw it. \nThe American people, similarly, know the difference between Government \nby blackmail and legitimate political pressure.\n  Had there been any doubt about the difference, it was reduced to \nplain arithmetic by last night's NBC poll, which showed that 50 percent \nof the American people approved the President's handling of the budget \ncrisis with 46 percent against, compared with 22 percent who support \nthe Republican handling of the budget crisis with some 78 percent \nagainst.\n  One further word on blackmail versus legitimate political pressure. I \nurge my colleagues not to try to use the debt ceiling to bludgeon the \nsettlement on the budget dispute. I personally have grave legal \nreservations about the procedures currently being used by the \nadministration to avoid exceeding the debt limit, and I have said that \ndirectly to the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. If they have violated \nthe law by keeping the Government running without raising the debt \nlimit, let them be impeached or subjected to other appropriate legal \nprocedures.\n  When Treasury Secretary Jim Baker borrowed from the Social Security \ntrust fund in the mid-1980's, I spoke up on this floor and objected to \nthe conversion of trust funds for an unintended purpose. If any other \nperson violated the trust fund, they would be subjected to criminal \nprosecution for fraudulent conversion. But I suggest that is a \nfundamentally different proposition for Congress to use that kind of a \nnuclear weapon in the budget battle. It is not proportionate and I \nsuggest it is not proper.\n  The full faith and credit of the United States would be damaged \nworldwide. So I hope my colleagues will reject that approach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S116-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S116-S117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

In accordance with my practice to report on foreign \ntravel, this floor statement summarizes a trip which Senator Shelby and \nI took from December 28, 1995, through January 4, 1996, to South Africa \nand the Mideast, focusing on Intelligence Committee matters and the \nMideast peace process with a stop at the International Criminal Court \nin The Hague en route back to Washington. Our itinerary was condensed \nand our trip was cut short to be able to return to Washington on \nJanuary 4 in anticipation of possible Senate votes.\n  A key purpose was to evaluate the PLO's compliance with the \nprovisions of the Specter-Shelby amendment, enacted in 1994, \nconditioning United States aid on a change in the PLO charter striking \nlanguage calling for the destruction of Israel and requiring ending of \nterrorism by the PLO.\n  We met with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in Gaza on January 2, 1996, \nfor approximately 1 hour. He explained his lateness saying he was out \ncampaigning for other candidates. When we commented that he must have \nfelt secure in his own election to be campaigning for others, he \nresponded: ``Who Knows?''\n  We were told the PLO election procedure had been modified because the \nnumber of seats had been expanded from 83 to 88 to accommodate late \ncandidacies of members of Hamas. We then heard that the Hamas \ncandidacies had been withdrawn due to pressure from Hamas leaders \nabroad.\n  We urged Arafat not to change election procedures at the last minute \nwhich looked like rigging the election.\n  When we asked about changing the PLO charter, Arafat said that would \nbe accomplished within 2 months after the election scheduled for \nJanuary 20, 1996. We emphasized the importance of eliminating the \ncharter language calling for the destruction of Israel.\n  Later on January 2, when we met with Prime Minister Peres, we asked \nhim what he thought of the United States conditioning aid to the PLO on \nchanges in the PLO charter and curtailing terrorism. Mr. Peres \nresponded positively saying those provisions of United States law were \nsupportive of Israeli interests. After our meeting with Mr. Peres, we \ntold Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu of Arafat's promise to change the \ncharter. Mr. Netanyahu said it was good that United States law had such \na requirement, because Israeli law did not.\n  Referring back to the Arafat meeting, we asked him what had happened \nto the Arabs wanted by Israel on charges of terrorism. The Israeli-PLO \nagreement required the PLO to turn over such Arabs to Israeli \nauthorities. We had pressed Chairman Arafat on that subject last August \n31 when Senator Hank Brown and I met with him in Gaza. Arafat said some \nsuch terrorists had been prosecuted in PLO courts and some had been \nturned over to Israel. Finding that answer insufficient, we urged \nArafat to do more on that subject.\n  It was generally agreed by our Embassy that there had been marked \nimprovement on terrorism in Israel during the past several months.\n  Arafat talked at some length about his warnings to Prime Minister \nRabin on the assassination risks Mr. Rabin faced.\n  Arafat spoke about his efforts to aid in the Israeli-Syrian \nnegotiations. He referred to a letter he had written to President Assad \nwhom he described as a friend since 1963 when Assad was an Air Force \nofficer. Arafat said he urged Assad to cooperate in the peace process.\n  When asked about Iran, Arafat responded that he thought dialog was \npossible. He said he had complained to Rafsanjani about Iranian \ninterference in the Israeli-PLO peace process and had told Rafsanjani \nthat he--Arafat--would make internal trouble for Iran if Iranian \ninterference continued.\n  We also questioned Arafat about the PLO's hassling the Palestinian \npress about unfavorable new coverage. The PLO had detained an editor in \ncustody. Arafat said the press had to respect the Government. We \ncommented that Arafat couldn't get away with that in the United States. \nArafat responded that he wasn't in the United States. He added that if \nhe didn't take forceful actions, he would be undercut like the \nGovernment was in Algiers.\n  Arafat complained that some donor nations had not fulfilled their \ncommitments to aid the PLO. When asked, ``who?'', he replied that he \npreferred not to say, but ``instead to thank those who had not given as \nwell as those who had given.''\n  Arafat appeared poised, in good humor, and in good health.\n  Our meeting later the same day with Prime Minister Peres and Likud \nleader Netanyahu presented a sharp contrast in style, content, and \nperspectives. The 1996 Israeli election, the first with the Prime \nMinister elected separately from the Knesset, will present \ndiametrically opposed approaches to this nation's future. It would be \nhard to conceive of a more important election historically for any \nnation--especially a nation where survival is jeopardized by a single \nmistake.\n  Mr. Peres articulated a vision for the future: peace, while facing \nsubstantial risks, with economic development and prospective prosperity \nas the glue to hold the region together. He said he was more value in \n100 hotels than 100 weapons.\n  Mr. Netanyahu said he and his party were firmly opposed to expanded \nPLO authority which would lead to sovereignty and a Trojan Horse threat \nwithin Israeli borders. He decried any deal with Syria and President \nAssad, saying the Syria keeps only those commitments it cannot get away \nwith breaking.\n  Prime Minister Peres had a different approach saying that it was hard \nto make a deal with Syria, but once made, Syria kept its commitments. \nHe approached the peace process with ideas as opposed to a concrete \nplan. He looked to building up rapport with the discussion of ideas \nbefore either side could defeat the process by seeing a proposal it \nfelt compelled to reject.\n  It is obvious that the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin has had \nmore than a sobering effect on the region. Chairman Arafat's condolence \ncall on Mrs. Leah Rabin was a symbolic statement that Israel has \nsuffered too much from terrorism--although the ultimate blow came, not \nfrom the hand of an Arab, but a Jew. Whatever doubt President Assad had \nabout a real division in Israel, no other proof could have been more \npersuasive.\n  So, the currently visible battle lines being drawn in Israel are for \nits 1996 election. My view is the outcome will be determined more by \nevents than personalities, policies, or programs.\n  Throughout our trip, we assessed intelligence missions and \ncapabilities. Terrorism was a dominant topic of conversation. In one \nAfrican city, we were told of a plan to locate an Iraqi rocket launcher \non a hotel roof in 1991 to take out the United States Embassy and our \nAmbassador. As we looked out the conference room window in the Embassy \nwe could see the hotel roof, the proposed launching site. A vigilant \nintelligence operation produced information which prevented the attack.\n  We were told that the 1986 U.S. Terrorist Protection Act has provided \nneeded protection for U.S. personnel overseas. That legislation \nprovided extra-territorial U.S. jurisdiction to provide for indictment \nin our courts for anyone who assaults, murders, or maims a U.S. citizen \nanywhere in the world.\n  In another African capital, we discussed the recent reign of terror \nin Nigeria. We discussed the pending legislative proposals to impose \nsanctions on Nigeria with the consensus that such action would be \nsuccessful only if supported by united international action.\n  In Cape Town we met with Parliamentarians from the newly formed South \nAfrican Intelligence Committee. They had many tough questions on the \ninteraction between the Executive and Congress on legislative \noversight. They asked bluntly if the CIA had too much power because of \nthe perception that the CIA controlled the world. We responded by \ndetailing our specific oversight actions to curtail excesses without \nunduly interfering with intelligence initiatives.\n  When our turn came for questions, we asked the opinion of the South \nAfrican parliamentarians on whether the Government of South Africa \nwould cooperate by imposing sanctions against buying Nigerian oil. They \n\n\n[[Page S118]]\nsaid yes, providing everyone else did. When advised that South Africa \nbought its oil from Iran, we asked the substitute question as to \nwhether they would join in international sanctions by stopping buying \noil from Iran. This question came too close for comfort and the \nparliamentarians made no commitment on the possibility of South African \nsanctions against Iran.\n  Wherever we went, there was constant talk about the danger Iran posed \nby its terrorism and spread of fundamentalism. The discussion \nfrequently boiled down to whether Iran had to be totally ostracized \nwith maximum sanctions to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons \non whether some dialog was possible or even a combination of both.\n  The suggestion was made that if Israel could make peace with the PLO \nand Arafat, then it was worthwhile to undertake similar efforts with \nIran. That point of view argued that no one would have suspected a few \nyears ago that Yasser Arafat could be a partner for peace with Israel. \nWho would have expected that Arafat would be honored at the White House \nin 1993 after being implicated in the murder of the United States \ncharge in the Sudan in 1974 and the murder of Mr. Leon Klinghoffer in \nthe hijacking of the Achille Lauro.\n  Iran probably poses the greatest threat to world peace today. There \nwas general agreement on our travels that more attention needs to be \nfocused on the Iranian threat.\n  En route back to the United States, we stopped at The Hague in the \nNetherlands to meet with the U.N. team preparing for criminal \nprosecutions in the War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. This \ntribunal could make the greatest contribution of the decade--or perhaps \nthe century--by establishing a deterrent to wars of aggression, \ngenocide and crimes against humanity by bringing the perpetrators to \njustice.\n  Several weeks ago, I had met with Justice Goldstone, the tribunal's \nchief prosecutor, when he was in Washington, DC. At that time, Justice \nGoldstone mentioned certain evidence, which might be in the hands of \nU.S. intelligence agencies, which could be useful and perhaps \ninstrumental in the war crimes prosecution. In meeting with the staff \nin The Hague we discussed the specific evidence and its importance in \ntheir prosecutions. We advised we would pursue their requests with U.S. \nintelligence agencies. We have discussed these issues with ranking \nofficials of U.S. intelligence agencies who advised that they will \ncooperate to the maximum extent practical.\n  In addition we discussed the issue of witness protection, because of \nthe obvious dangers posed for the witnesses who remain in that war-torn \narea. We discussed U.S. procedures for protecting witnesses both before \ntrial and the possibility of creating new identities after trial to \nbest guaranty witness security and obtain their testimony. Several \nmembers of the prosecution team were on loan from the FBI. We agreed to \ntake up the issue of witness protection with appropriate officials of \nthe FBI.\n  We also had an extensive discussion about their limited budget and \nthe fact that a number of their investigative team had to delay going \ninto the field because of a limited budget. Concern was also expressed \nabout the adequacy of U.S. participation in the war prosecution team \nand the problems which might arise if replacements were not obtained \nfor personnel from the Departments of Justice, Defense, and State. We \ncommitted to take those issues up with the appropriate department \nheads.\n  We observed the new courtroom which breaks ground in an international \ncriminal trial. The trial proceedings will be conducted with three \njudges without a jury and there are booths for simultaneous translation \nin a number of languages.\n  We commended the prosecution team on their historic efforts and \npromised to follow through to be of assistance in this most important \nventure. I ask unanimous consent that the indictments of Dusan Tadic a/\nk/a ``Dule'' Goran Borovnica and also Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic \nbe printed in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of this \nstatement to demonstrate the importance of these criminal proceedings. \nDusan Tadic is in custody and is scheduled to be tried sometime in the \nspring. Radovan Karadzic is the President of the Bosnian Serb \nAdministration in Pale, and Ratko Mladic is the commander of the Army \nof the Bosnian Serbs.\n  Mr. President, the trip was very useful along a number of lines, \nespecially with conversations which Senator Shelby and I had with PLO \nChairman Yasser Arafat on the Specter-Shelby amendment which conditions \n$500 million in United States aid to the PLO curtailing terrorism and \nchanging their charter to eliminate references to the obliteration of \nIsrael.\n  The visit we had at the Hague, in the Netherlands, with the United \nStates prosecution team for the former Yugoslavia, I think, poses a \nhistoric event later this spring with the trial of Dusan Tadic.\n  I ask unanimous consent the indictment against Tadic be printed in \nthe Record at conclusion of my presentation, and the pending indictment \nalso as to Radovan Karadzic, who is the President of the Bosnian Serbs, \nand Ratko Mladic, who is the commander of the Bosnian Serb Army, which \nreally has the potential to establish a historic international \nprecedent for the rule of law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is a great deal that the United States can do to \nmake a success of that venture by pressure to bring those not in \ncustody into custody, with the obligations of Croatia and Serbia to \nturn them over, once they are observed in those countries, to the \nUnited Nations for trial, and with cooperation from our intelligence \nagencies on corroborative evidence and help from the FBI on protecting \nthe witnesses.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia--The \nProsecutor of the Tribunal Against Dusan Tadic a/k/a ``Dule'' and Goran \n                               Borovnica\n\n\n                               indictment\n\n       Richard J Goldstone, Prosecutor of the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, pursuant to his \n     authority under Article 18 of the Statute of the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     (``The Statute of the Tribunal''), charges:\n       1. From about 25 May 1992 Serb forces attacked Bosnian \n     Muslim and Croat population centers in the opstina of \n     Prijedor, Bosnia-Herzegovina, forcing most Muslims and Croats \n     from their homes and confining many thousands, including more \n     than 3,000 who were held in the Omarska camp, a former mining \n     complex. The accused Dusan Tadic a/k/a ``Dule'' a/k/a \n     ``Dusko'', participated in the collection and mistreatment, \n     including killings, of Bosnian Muslims and Croats in opstina \n     Prijedor within Omarska camp and outside Omarska camp, as set \n     forth below. The accused Goran Borovnica participated with \n     Dusan TADIC in killings outside of Omarska camp, as set forth \n     below:\n       Background:\n       2.1. In May, 1992, intensive shelling of Muslim areas in \n     the opstina Prijedor caused the Muslim residents to flee \n     their homes. The majority of them then surrendered or were \n     captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the \n     Muslims and any Croat residents, they forced the Muslims and \n     Croats to march in columns bound for one or another of the \n     prison camps that the Serbs had established in the opstina. \n     The Serb forces pulled many of the Muslims and Croats from \n     the columns and shot or beat them on the spot.\n       2.2. On about 25 May 1992, about three weeks after Serbs \n     forcibly took control of government authority in the opstina, \n     and two days after the start of large scale military attacks \n     on Muslim population centers, the Serb forces began taking \n     prisoners to the Omarska camp.\n       2.3. During the next several weeks, the Serb forces \n     continued to round up Muslims and Croats from Kozarac, \n     Prijedor town, and other places in the opstina and interned \n     them in the camps. Many of Prijedor's Muslim and Croat \n     intellectuals, professional and political leaders were sent \n     to Omarska. There were approximately 40 women in the camp, \n     and all the other prisoners in the camp were men.\n       2.4. Within the area of the Omarska mining complex that was \n     used for the camp, the camp authorities generally confined \n     the prisoners in three different buildings: the \n     administration building, where interrogations took place and \n     most of the women were confined; the garage or hangar \n     building; the ``white house,'' a small building where \n     particularly severe beatings were administered; and on a \n     cement courtyard area between the buildings known as the \n     ``pista''. There was another small building, known as the \n     ``red house'', where prisoners were sometimes taken but most \n     often did not emerge alive.\n       2.5. Living conditions at Omarska were brutal. Prisoners \n     were crowded together with little or no facilities for \n     personal hygiene. They were fed starvation rations once a day \n\n\n[[Page S119]]\n     and given only three minutes to get into the canteen area, eat, and get \n     out. The little water they received was ordinarily foul. \n     Prisoners had no changes of clothing and no bedding. They \n     received no medical care.\n       2.6. Severe beatings were commonplace. The camp guards, and \n     others who came to the camp and physically abused the \n     prisoners, used all manner of weapons during these beatings, \n     including wooden batons, metal rods and tools, lengths of \n     thick industrial cable that had metal balls affixed to the \n     end, rifle butts, and knives. But female and male prisoners \n     were beaten, tortured, raped, sexually assaulted, and \n     humiliated. Many, whose identities are known and unknown, did \n     not survive the camp. After the collection of thousands of \n     Bosnian Muslims and Croats in later May, 1992, groups of \n     Serbs including the accused later entered villages in which \n     Muslims and Croats remained, at which time they killed some \n     villagers and drove others from their homes.\n\n  The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia--the \n  Prosecutor of the Tribunal Against Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic\n\n\n                               indictment\n\n       Richard J. Goldstone, Prosecutor of the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, pursuant to his \n     authority under Article 18 of the Statute of the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     (``The Statute of the Tribunal''), charges Ratko Mladic and \n     Radovan Karadzic with genocide, crimes against humanity, and \n     violations of the laws or customs of war, as set forth below:\n\n                      ``Safe Area'' of Srebrenica\n\n       1. After war erupted in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb military forces occupied Bosnian \n     Muslim villages in the eastern part of the country, resulting \n     in an exodus of Bosnian Muslims to enclaves in Gorazde, Zepa, \n     Tuzla, and Srebrenica. All of the events referred to in this \n     indictment took place in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n       2. On 16 April 1993, the Security Council of the United \n     Nations, acting pursuant to Chapter VII of its Charter, \n     adopted resolution 819, in which it demanded that all parties \n     to the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     treat Srebrenica and its surroundings as a safe area which \n     should be free from any armed attack or any other hostile \n     act. Resolution 819 was reaffirmed by Resolution 824 on 6 May \n     1993 and by Resolution 836 on 4 June 1993.\n       3. Before the attack by Bosnian Serb forces, as described \n     in this indictment, the estimated Bosnian Muslim population \n     in the safe area of Srebrenica, was approximately 60,000.\n\n                 Attack on the Safe Area of Srebrenica\n\n       4. On or about 6 July 1995, the Bosnian Serb army shelled \n     Srebrenica and attacked United Nations observation posts that \n     were manned by Dutch soldiers and located in the safe area. \n     The attack on the Srebrenica safe area by the Bosnian Serb \n     army continued through 11 July 1995, when the first units of \n     the attacking Bosnian Serb forces entered Srebrenica.\n       5. The Bosnian Muslim men, women and children who remained \n     in Srebrenica after the beginning of the Bosnian Serb attack \n     took two courses of action. Several thousand women, children \n     and some mostly elderly men fled to the UN compound in \n     Potocari, located within the safe area of Srebrenica, where \n     they sought the protection of the Dutch battalion responsible \n     for the compound. They remained at the compound from 11 July \n     1995 until 13 July 1995, when they were all evacuated by \n     buses and trucks under the control of and operated by Bosnian \n     Serb military personnel.\n       6. A second group of approximately 15,000 Bosnian Muslim \n     men, with some women and children, gathered at Susnjari \n     during the evening hours of 11 July 1995 and fled, in a huge \n     column, through the woods towards Tuzla. Approximately one-\n     third of this group consisted of armed Bosnian military \n     personnel and armed civilians. The rest were unarmed \n     civilians.\n\n                           Events in Potocari\n\n       7. On 11 July 1995 and 12 July 1995, Ratko Mladic and \n     members of his staff met in Bratunac with Dutch military \n     officers and representatives of the Muslim refugees from \n     Potocari. At these meetings, Ratko Mladic informed them, \n     among other things, that Bosnian Muslim soldiers who \n     surrendered their weapons would be treated as prisoners of \n     war according to the Geneva Conventions and that refugees \n     evacuated from Potocari would not be hurt.\n       8. On or about 12 July 1995, Bosnian Serb military forces \n     burned and looted Bosnian Muslim houses in and around \n     Potocari.\n       9. On or about 12, July 1995, in the morning hours, Bosnian \n     Serb military forces arrived at the UN military compound in \n     Potocari and its environs.\n       10. On or about 12 July 1995, Ratko Mladic arrived in \n     Potocari, accompanied by his military aides and a television \n     crew. He falsely and repeatedly told Bosnian Muslims in and \n     around Potocari that they would not be harmed and that they \n     would be safely transported out of Srebrenica.\n       11. On or about 12 July 1995, at the direction and in the \n     presence of Ratko Mladic, approximately 50-60 buses and \n     trucks arrived near the UN military compound in Potocari. \n     Shortly after the arrival of these vehicles, the evacuation \n     process of Bosnian Muslim refugees started. As Muslim women, \n     children and men started to board the buses and trucks, \n     Bosnian Serb military personnel separated the men from the \n     women and children. This selection and separation of Muslim \n     men took place in the presence of and at the direction of \n     Ratko Mladic.\n       12. The Bosnian Muslim men who had been separated from \n     other refugees were taken to diverse locations in and around \n     Potocari. On or about 12 July 1995, Ratko Mladic and Bosnian \n     Serb military personnel under his command, informed some of \n     these Muslim men that they would be evacuated and exchanged \n     for Bosnian Serbs being held in Tuzla.\n       13. Most of the Muslim men who had been separated from the \n     other refugees in Potocari were transported to Bratunac and \n     then to the area of Karakaj, where they were massacred by \n     Bosnian Serb military personnel.\n       14. Between 12 July 1995 and 13 July 1995, Bosnian Serb \n     military personnel summarily executed Bosnian Muslim men and \n     women at diverse locations around the UN compound where they \n     had taken refuge. The bodies of those summarily executed were \n     left in fields and buildings in the immediate vicinity of the \n     compound. These arbitrary killings instilled such terror and \n     panic amongst the Muslims remaining there that some of them \n     committed suicide and all the others agreed to leave the \n     enclave.\n       15. The evacuation of all able-bodied Muslim refugees \n     concluded on 13 July 1995. As a result of the Bosnian Serb \n     attack on the safe area and other actions, the Muslim \n     population of the enclave of Srebrenica was virtually \n     eliminated by Bosnian Serb military personnel.\n\n                        Surrender and Executions\n\n       16. Between the evening of 11 July 1995 and the morning of \n     12 July 1995, the huge column of Muslims which had gathered \n     in Susnjari fled Srebrenica through the woods towards Tuzla.\n       17. Bosnian Serb military personnel, supported by armoured \n     personnel carriers, tanks, anti-aircraft guns and artillery, \n     positioned themselves along the Bratunac-Milici road in an \n     effort to interdict the column of Bosnian Muslims fleeing \n     towards Tuzla.\n       18. As soon as the column reached Bosnian Serb held \n     territory in the vicinity of Buljim, Bosnian Serb military \n     forces attacked it. As a result of this and other attacks by \n     Bosnian Serb military forces, many Muslims were killed and \n     wounded and the column divided into several smaller parts \n     which continued towards Tuzla. Approximately one-third of the \n     column, mostly composed of military personnel, crossed the \n     Bratunac-Milici road near Nova Kasaba and reached safety in \n     Tuzla. The remaining Muslims were trapped behind the Bosnian \n     Serb lines.\n       19. Thousands of Muslims were captured by or surrendered to \n     Bosnian Serb military forces under the command and control of \n     Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. Many of the Muslims who \n     surrendered did so because they were assured that they would \n     be safe if they surrendered. In many instances, assurances of \n     safety were provided to the Muslims by Bosnian Serb military \n     personnel who were with other Bosnian Serb soldiers wearing \n     stolen UN uniforms, and by Muslims who had been captured and \n     ordered to summon their fellow Muslims from the woods.\n       20. Many of the Bosnian Muslims who were captured by or \n     surrendered to Bosnian Serb military personnel were summarily \n     executed by Bosnian Serb military personnel at the locations \n     of their surrender or capture, or at other locations shortly \n     thereafter. Incidents of such summary executions include, \n     but are not limited to:\n       20.1 On or about 13 July 1995, near Nezuk in the Republic \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a group of 10 Bosnian Muslim men \n     were captured. Bosnian Serb soldiers summarily executed some \n     of these men, including Mirsad Alispahic and Hajrudin \n     Mesanovic.\n       20.2 On or about 13 July 1995, on the banks of the Jadar \n     River between Konjevic Polje and Drinjaca, Bosnian Serb \n     solders summarily executed 15 Bosnian Muslim men who had \n     surrendered or been captured. Amongst those killed were Hamed \n     Omerovic, Azem Mujic and Ismet Ahmetovic.\n       20.3 On or about 13 July 1995, in the vicinity of Konjevic \n     Polje, Bosnian Serb soldiers summarily executed hundreds of \n     Muslims, including women and children.\n       20.4 On or about 17 July 1995 or 18 July 1995, in the \n     vicinity of Konjevic Polje, Bosnian Serb soldiers captured \n     about 150-200 Bosnian Muslims and summarily executed about \n     one-half of them.\n       20.5 On or about 18 July 1995 or 19 July 1995, in the \n     vicinity of Nezuk, about 20 groups, each containing between \n     5-10 Bosnian Muslim men, surrendered to Bosnian Serb military \n     forces. After the men surrendered, Bosnian Serb soldiers \n     ordered them to line up and summarily executed them.\n       20.6 On or about 20 July 1995 or 21 July 1995, near the \n     village of Meces, Bosnian Serb military personnel, using \n     megaphones, urged Bosnian Muslim men who had fled Srebrenica \n     to surrender and assured them that they would be safe. \n     Approximately 350 Bosnian Muslim men responded to the \n     entreaties and surrendered. Bosnian Serb soldiers then took \n     approximately 150 of them, instructed them to dig their own \n     graves and then summarily executed them.\n       20.7 On or about 21 July 1995 or 22 July 1995, near the \n     village of Meces, an excavator dug a large pit and Bosnian \n     Serb soldiers ordered approximately 260 Bosnian Muslim men \n     who had been captured to stand around the hole. \n\n[[Page S120]]\n     The Muslim men were then surrounded by armed Bosnian Serb soldiers and \n     ordered not to move or they would be shot. Some of the men \n     moved and were shot. The remaining men were pushed into the \n     hole and buried alive.\n       21. Many of the Muslims who surrendered to Bosnian Serb \n     military personnel were not killed at the locations of their \n     surrender, but instead were transported to central assembly \n     points where Bosnian Serb soldiers held them under armed \n     guard. These assembly points included, among others, a hangar \n     in Bratunac; soccer fields in Kasaba, Konjevic Polje, \n     Kravica, and Vlasenica; a meadow behind the bus station in \n     Sandici and other fields and meadows along the Bratunac-\n     Milici road.\n       22. Between 12 July 1995 and 14 July 1995, at various of \n     these assembly points, including the hangar in Bratunac and \n     the soccer stadium in Kasaba, Ratko Mladic addressed the \n     Bosnian Muslim detainees. He falsely and repeatedly assured \n     them that they would be safe and that they would be exchanged \n     for Bosnian Serb prisoners held by Bosnian government forces.\n       23. Between 12 July 1995 and 14 July 1995. Bosnian Serb \n     military personnel arbitrarily selected Bosnian Muslim \n     detainees and summarily executed them.\n\n                      Mass Executions Near Karakaj\n\n       24. On or about 14 July 1995, Bosnian Serb military \n     personnel transported thousands of Muslim detainees from \n     Bratunac, Kravica and other locations to an assembly point in \n     a school complex near Karakaj. At this assembly point, \n     Bosnian Serb military personnel ordered the Muslim detainees \n     to take off their jackets, coats and other garments and place \n     them in front of the sports hall. They were then crowded into \n     the school building and adjacent sports hall and held under \n     armed guard.\n       25. On or about 14 July 1995, at this school complex near \n     Karakaj, Ratko Mladic conferred with his military \n     subordinates and addressed some of the Muslims detained \n     there.\n       26. At various times during 14 July 1995, Bosnian Serb \n     military personnel killed Bosnian Muslim detainees at this \n     school complex.\n       27. Throughout 14 July 1995, Bosnian Serb military \n     personnel removed all the Muslim detainees, in small groups, \n     from the school building and sports hall and loaded them on \n     trucks guarded and driven by Bosnian Serb soldiers. Before \n     boarding the trucks, many of the detainees had their hands \n     tied behind their backs or were blindfolded. They were \n     then driven to at least two locations in the vicinity of \n     Karakaj.\n       28. Once the trucks arrived at these locations, Bosnian \n     Serb military personnel ordered the bound or blindfolded \n     Muslim detainees off the trucks and summarily executed them. \n     The summary executions took place from approximately noon to \n     midnight on 14 July 1995.\n       29. Bosnian Serb military personnel buried the executed \n     Bosnian Muslim men in mass graves near the execution sites.\n       30. On or about 14 July 1995, Ratko Mladic was present at \n     one of the mass execution sites when Bosnian Serb military \n     personnel summarily executed Bosnian Muslim men.\n       31. The summary executions of Bosnian Muslim males, which \n     occurred on 14 July 1995 in the vicinity of Karakaj, resulted \n     in the loss of thousands of lives.\n\n\n                              the accused\n\n       32. Radovan Karadzic was born on 19 June 1945 in the \n     municipality of Savnik of the Republic of Montenegro. From on \n     or about 13 May 1992 to the present, he has been president of \n     the Bosnian Serb administration in Pale.\n       33. Ratko Mladic was born on 12 March 1943 in Kalinovik \n     municipality of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is \n     a career military officer and holds the rank of general in \n     the Bosnian Serb armed forces. From on or about 14 May 1992 \n     to the present, he has been the commander of the army of the \n     Bosnian Serb administration.\n\n\n                           superior authority\n\n                            Radovan Karadzic\n\n       34. Radovan Karadzic was a founding member and president of \n     the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) of what was then the \n     Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The SDS was the \n     main political party among the Serbs in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina. As president of the SDS, he was and is the most \n     powerful official in the party. His duties as president \n     include representing the party, co-ordinating the work of \n     party organs and ensuring the realisation of the programmatic \n     tasks and goals of the party. He continues to hold this post.\n       35. Radovan Karadzic became the first president of the \n     Bosnian Serb administration in Pale on or about 13 May 1992. \n     At the time he assumed this position, his de jure powers, as \n     described in the constitution of the Bosnian Serb \n     administration, included, but were not limited to, commanding \n     the army of the Bosnian Serb administration in times of war \n     and peace and having the authority to appoint, promote and \n     discharge officers of the army. As president, he was and is a \n     position of superior authority to Ratko Mladic and every \n     member of the Bosnian Serb army and all units and personnel \n     assigned or attached to the Bosnian Serb army.\n       36. In addition to his powers described in the \n     constitution, Radovan Karadzic's powers as president of the \n     Bosnian Serb administration are augmented by Article 6 of the \n     Bosnian Serb Act on People's Defence. This Act vested in him, \n     among other powers, the authority to supervise the \n     Territorial Defence both in peace and war and the authority \n     to issue orders for the utilisation of the police in case of \n     war, immediate threat and other emergencies. Article 39 of \n     the same Act empowered him, in cases of imminent threat of \n     war and other emergencies, to deploy Territorial Defence \n     units for the maintenance of law and order.\n       37. Radovan Karadzic's powers are further augmented by \n     Article 33 of the Bosnian Serb Act on Internal Affairs, which \n     authorised him to activate reserve police in emergency \n     situations.\n       38. Radovan Karadzic has exercised the powers described \n     above and has acted and been dealt with internationally as \n     the president of the Bosnian Serb administration in Pale. In \n     that capacity, he has, inter alia, participated in \n     international negotiations and has personally made agreements \n     on such matters as cease-fires and humanitarian relief, and \n     these agreements have been implemented.\n\n                              Ratko Mladic\n\n       39. Ratko Mladic was, in 1991, appointed commander of the \n     9th Corps of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in Knin in the \n     Republic of Croatia. In May 1992, he assumed command of the \n     forces of the Second Military District of the JNA which then \n     effectively became the Bosnian Serb army. He holds the rank \n     of general and from about 14 May 1992 to the present, has \n     been the commander of the army of the Bosnian \n     Serb administration. In that capacity, he was and is in a \n     position of superior authority to every member of the \n     Bosnian Serb army and all units and personnel assigned or \n     attached to that army.\n       40. Ratko Mladic has demonstrated his control in military \n     matters by negotiating inter alia, cease-fire and prisoner \n     exchange agreements; agreements relating to the opening of \n     Sarajevo airport; agreements relating to access for \n     humanitarian aid convoys; and anti-sniping agreements, all of \n     which have been implemented.\n\n\n                          general allegations\n\n       41. At all times relevant to this indictment, a state of \n     armed conflict and partial occupation existed in the Republic \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the territory of the former \n     Yugoslavia.\n       42. In each paragraph charging genocide, a crime recognized \n     by Article 4 of the Statute of the Tribunal, the alleged acts \n     or omissions were committed with the intent to destroy, in \n     whole or in part, a national, ethnical, or religious group, \n     as such.\n       43. In each paragraph charging crimes against humanity, \n     crimes recognized by Article 5 of the Statute of the \n     Tribunal, the alleged acts or omissions were part of a \n     widespread or systematic or large-scale attack directed \n     against a civilian population.\n       44. Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic are individually \n     responsible for the crimes alleged against them in this \n     indictment pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Tribunal Statute. \n     Individual criminal responsibility includes committing, \n     planning, instigating, ordering or otherwise aiding and \n     abetting in the planning, preparation or execution of any \n     crimes referred to in Articles 2 to 5 of the Tribunal \n     Statute.\n       45. Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic are also, or \n     alternatively, criminally responsible as commanders for the \n     acts of their subordinates pursuant to Article 7(3) of the \n     Tribunal Statute. Command criminal responsibility is the \n     responsibility of a superior officer for the acts of his \n     subordinate if he knew or had reason to know that his \n     subordinate was about to commit such acts or had done so and \n     the superior failed to take the necessary and reasonable \n     measures to prevent such acts or to punish the perpetrators \n     thereof.\n       46. The general allegations contained in paragraphs 41 \n     through 45 are realleged and incorporated into each of the \n     charges set forth below.\n\n\n                                charges\n\n             Counts 1-2 (Genocide) (Crime Against Humanity)\n\n       47. Between about 12 July 1995 and 13 July 1995, Bosnian \n     Serb military personnel, under the command and control of \n     Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, arrived in Potocari where \n     thousands of Muslim men, women and children had sought refuge \n     in and around the UN military compound. Bosnian Serb military \n     personnel, under the command and control of Ratko Mladic and \n     Radovan Karadzic, summarily executed many Bosnian Muslim \n     refugees who remained in Potocari.\n       48. Between about 13 July 1995, Bosnian Serb military \n     personnel, under the command and control of Ratko Mladic and \n     Radovan Karadzic, summarily executed many Bosnian Muslim men \n     who fled to the woods and were later captured or surrendered.\n       49. Thousands of Bosnian Muslim men, who fled Srebrenica \n     and who surrendered or had been captured, were transported \n     from various assembly locations in and around Srebrenica to a \n     main assembly point at a school complex near Karakaj.\n       50. On or about 14 July 1995, Bosnian Serb Military \n     personnel, under the command, and control of Ratko Mladic and \n     Radovan Karadzic, transported thousands of Muslim men from \n     this school complex to two locations a short distance away. \n     At these locations, Bosnian Serb soldiers, with the knowledge \n     of Ratko Mladic, summarily executed these Bosnian Muslim \n     detainees and buried them in mass graves.\n       51. Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, between about 6 July \n     1995 and 22 July 1995, \n\n[[Page S121]]\n     individually and in concert with others, planned, instigated, ordered \n     or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation \n     or execution of the following crimes:\n       (a) summary executions of Bosnian Muslim men and women in \n     and around Potocari on 12 July 1995 and 13 July 1995,\n       (b) summary executions, which occurred between 13 July 1995 \n     and 22 July 1995, of Bosnian Muslims who were hors de combat \n     because of injury, surrender or capture after fleeing into \n     the woods towards Tuzla.\n       (c) summary executions of Bosnian Muslim men, which \n     occurred on or about 14 July 1995 at mass execution sites in \n     and around Karakaj.\n       By their acts and omissions in relation to the events \n     described in paragraphs 13, 14, 20.1-20.7, 23, 26 and 28, \n     Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic committed:\n       Count 1: Genocide as recognised by Article 4(2)(a) (killing \n     members of the group) of the Statute of the Tribunal.\n       Count 2: A crime against humanity as recognised by Article \n     5(b) (extermination) of the Statute of the Tribunal.\n\n Counts 3-4 (Crime Against Humanity) (Violation of the Laws or Customs \n                                of War)\n\n       52.

Mr. President, I would like to note last week a good \nfriend of mine, and one of the best friends my home city of Burlington \nhas, Tom Racine, died after a courageous battle with cancer.\n  Tom was one of those very special people who seemed to be involved in \neverything good with our community. As a motivating force, as the chief \nvolunteer, as the hardest worker, he epitomized everything that we see \nin one who makes a community go forward, with the possibility of one \nexception. Tom Racine was the person you never saw in the headlines. \nYou hardly heard of him in the press conferences or anything else. He \njust did the work. Others, often times, got the credit but Tom did the \nwork.\n  I know so many times when I would run into him on Church Street in \nBurlington and I would talk about something that he was intimately \ninvolved in that was improving our community, I would tell him I read \nabout others who were involved, but I knew he was doing so much of the \nwork and I had not seen a word about him. He would say, ``Pat, you \nknow, that's just the way I am. I just want to get the work done.''\n  Tom and his wife, Jeanette, ran Bertha Church's store on Church \nStreet for years and years. We would see him there in the store. My \nwife shopped there, as did my mother, my mother-in-law, my daughter and \nothers. It was more than just a store you would go into. It was a place \nwhere everybody knew you by name. Everybody was concerned about you and \nyour family.\n  But more importantly, Tom and Jeanette Racine were concerned about \nall of us--Vermonters in the truest sense of the word. Our State has \nlost one of its most valuable citizens.\n  My wife, Marcelle, and I expressed our sympathy to Jeanette and the \nfamily. I had hoped to be at his funeral on Monday. As we all know, \neverything was closed down as far as air travel from here, and I was \nunable to go.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have some editorials and \narticles from the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 5, 1996]\n\n                            Called To Serve\n\n       Every community needs at least one civic leader like the \n     later Tom Racine--more interested in building up community \n     than his own reputation, so dogged in pursuit of a good idea \n     Racine once drove a Park-and-Ride van himself when nobody \n     else would.\n       Burlington is fortunate to have so many civic-minded \n     leaders like him. None, however, has been quite as self-\n     effacing, persevering or nonpolitical. And few have been as \n     determined to strengthen Burlington's retail economy where it \n     counts most, downtown, or where it's been more fun, \n     Centennial Field, home of Burlington's warmly welcomed minor \n     league baseball franchise, the Vermont Expos.\n       Racine, who helped found the Church Street Marketplace in \n     the 1980s and bring the Expos here in the 1990s, died \n     Wednesday at age 65. What he brought to Burlington as a \n     person, however, is sure to survive him--his civic work alone \n     an inspiration to those like him to press on, and a nudge to \n     others who, unlike him, might never have felt the need to \n     serve.\n       Expos' owner Ray Pecor remembers who first put the bug in \n     his ear to bring minor league baseball back to Burlington--\n     and who then bugged him . . . and bugged him . . . and bugged \n     him again until it was done: Tom Racine. Why did that \n     comeback succeed when others had not? Racine, raised during \n     baseball's heyday when players still played for fun, knew to \n     put fans and fun first.\n       The Marketplace Commission's Molly Lambert remembers how \n     that Park-and-Ride attempt to make downtown more pedestrian-\n     friendly plan failed--but not until Racine had squeezed out \n     the last drop of hope by volunteering to drive himself.\n       Mayor Peter Clavelle remembers Racine's habit of checking \n     his politics and his ego at the door--the secret of his \n     success with all manner of politicians.\n       Born in Maine, raised and educated in Brandon, he was, \n     nonetheless, a Burling- tonian through and through--first as \n     a graduate of the University of Vermont, later as a partner \n     in downtown retailing and as president of the Downtown \n     Burlington Development Association, then as chairman of the \n     Burlington Public Works Commission. In all his civic work, he \n     took the unpaid way.\n       Anyone who thinks Vermonters can afford to lose such old-\n     fashioned civic-mindedness isn't paying attention. As more \n     state and federal aid runs dry, sooner or later all of us \n     will be asked to answer similar calls.\n       How many of us who do will say a lot about what kind of \n     communities Vermonters build for generations to come.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  \n[[Page S122]]\n\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 4, 1996]\n\n                     Baseball, Downtown Leader Dies\n\n                           (By Mike Donoghue)\n\n       Tom Racine, the man who helped build a new downtown for \n     Burlington and minor league baseball clubs for Vermont, died \n     Wednesday in Fletcher Allen Health Care.\n       Racine, 65, was general manager for the Vermont Expos for \n     the past two seasons, but may be better known for helping \n     create the Church Street Marketplace.\n       Molly Lambert, director of the Church Street Marketplace, \n     noted Racine had done yeoman's work in promoting downtown. \n     She said Racine was president of the Downtown Burlington \n     Development Association when Church Street was turned into an \n     outdoor pedestrian mall in 1981. Two years later the \n     association gave him the Nate Harris award for promoting \n     downtown.\n       Racine and his wife, Jeanette, bought Bertha Church, an \n     intimate apparel shop on the Marketplace, in 1974.\n       Racine also served on the Burlington Public Works \n     Commission and was its chairman. The city named the \n     educational wing at the new public works building after him.\n       He also won sports awards. The New York-Penn League in 1994 \n     named him executive of the year for running the minor league \n     team, which is affiliated with the Montreal Expos.\n       Racine, who was diagnosed with lung cancer last year, was \n     admitted to the hospital about a week ago for unrelated \n     medical problems, according to his son, Bill Racine. After \n     further complications, he died early Wednesday, his son said. \n     Racine also leaves another son, Robert, and a daughter, Lori.\n       Lambert said Racine was quick to give a hand to anybody. \n     She said he was one of the first businessmen to befriend \n     socialist Bernie Sanders when he was elected mayor.\n       Jeanette Racine said it was her husband's friendship with \n     Sanders that helped bring minor league baseball back to the \n     state in 1983 in the form of the Vermont Reds of the Eastern \n     League. The Reds eventually left, but the city later got the \n     Mariners and then the Expos.\n       Bill Racine said the message that he got from his father is \n     that ``we all have a little something to give to our \n     community.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 4, 1996]\n\n                Baseball Community Mourns Loss of Racine\n\n                          (By Patrick Garrity)\n\n       Tom Racine was a baseball man.\n       So say those who knew and worked alongside the Vermont \n     Expos general manager, who died Wednesday morning after a \n     battle with cancer. He was 65.\n       The man who helped bring baseball back to Burlington should \n     be remembered for his business savvy and his dedication to \n     his work. But most of all, Racine should be remembered for \n     his love for the game.\n       ``He loved his work and loved to come to work,'' said Kyle \n     Bostwick, Racine's assistant with the New York-Penn League \n     team. ``More often that not, he was the first person into the \n     office or the ballpark and the last person to leave.''\n       Racine was involved as a booster for the Vermont Reds and \n     Mariners organizations in the 1980s, then worked feverishly \n     with Burlington businessman Ray Pecor to bring a NY-Penn team \n     to Vermont. Pecor was not available to comment on Racine's \n     passing, but the general manager's work was recognized in a \n     statement prepared by the team:\n       ``Tom Racine was the motivation for bringing baseball back \n     to Burlington. If not for his persistence and encouragement \n     towards the local community, baseball in Burlington may not \n     have happened.''\n       ``He always stressed to us to make sure the fans were taken \n     care of, and I think that was because he was one himself,'' \n     Bostwick said. ``Every one of his decisions, be it directly \n     or indirectly, was for the fun of the fan. . . .''\n       Racine's success with the Expos' organization clearly was \n     evident, as more than 230,000 fans streamed through \n     Centennial Field's turnstiles the past two years. He was \n     named 1994 NY-Penn Executive of the Year after the team set \n     attendance records in its inaugural season.\n       ``He was very well respected by his colleagues in the \n     league,'' said NY-Penn president Bob Julian. ``He was just a \n     real man of the community. He loved Burlington, he loved \n     baseball, and I think he had a ball doing his job. He loved \n     the game.''\n       A season-ticket holder since the days of the Vermont Reds, \n     John Douglas of Essex Junction said Racine developed a \n     rapport with fans and sought to make an Expos' game an \n     enjoyable experience.\n       ``Once, Tom mentioned to me that baseball is a game that is \n     supposed to be enjoyed,'' Douglas said. ``Consequently, he \n     had that in mind when he was setting things up for Mr. \n     Pecor.''\n       ``He was a gentleman who was very knowledgeable about the \n     business of baseball. . . . ``Mr Pecor lost a very, very \n     trusted, highly competent individual, and we're going to miss \n     him.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 5, 1996]\n\n                             Thomas Racine\n\n       Thomas Racine, 65, died Wednesday, Jan. 3, 1996, following \n     a brief illness.\n       He was born April 24, 1930, in Brunswick, Maine, the son of \n     Dr. Wilfred and Marion Racine. The family moved to Brandon, \n     Vt., in 1943, where he graduated from Brandon High School in \n     1948. Following a year in the Army, Tom received his B.A. \n     from UVM in 1953.\n       Tom worked in the pension department at Connecticut General \n     Insurance in Hartford for five years before returning to \n     Burlington. He was employed as a sales representative for \n     Proctor & Gamble and Maidenform until 1973, when he and his \n     wife, Jeanette, purchased Bertha Church, a retail shop they \n     have managed together ever since.\n       Always a baseball enthusiast, in 1994 Tom received what for \n     him was an opportunity of a lifetime: a chance to serve as \n     general manager of the newly organized Vermont Expos baseball \n     team of the NY-Penn League. In 1994 he was honored by being \n     voted ``Executive of the Year'' by his peers in the league. \n     He actively pursued his general manager's duties until the \n     time of his death.\n       Community issues were a driving force in Tom's life. As co-\n     chair of the Downtown Burlington Development Association from \n     1978 to 1982 and 1985 to 1987, he was a catalyst behind \n     creation of the Church Street Marketplace. He was a founder \n     of the Transportation and Parking Council and promoted \n     numerous public parking alternatives. In 1983, he received \n     the Nathan Harris Award in recognition of his efforts to \n     improve the economic vitality of the business district. He \n     served on the Public Works Commission from 1987 to 1993, the \n     last three years as chairman. He served as head of the \n     Downtown Middlebury Association from 1992 to 1993, a position \n     from which he helped spread the secrets of Burlington's \n     economic success.\n       While baseball was his passion and downtown Burlington his \n     consummate interest, he was also devoted to youth activities. \n     He coached Little League and umpired high school and college \n     baseball, filmed South Burlington High School football games \n     for 12 years, volunteered for early morning duty with area \n     youth hockey and served on various Boosters clubs. He also \n     loved golf and the art of joke-telling.\n       Besides his wife, Jeanette, he is survived by two sons, \n     William of Phippsburg, Maine, and Robert of Rutland; a \n     daughter, Lori MacNeill of Mansfield, Mass.; and eight \n     grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S121-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S122-S123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  SNOW\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have seen a fair amount of snow here in \nthe last few days. I have sometimes taken the floor of the Senate and \nbeen critical of things closing down for 2 or 3 inches of snow, and \nhave said we do not do it that way in Vermont. But I must admit, this \nwould be a significant snowstorm even in Vermont. It would be a welcome \none, because of our ski industry, and we would cope, but this would be \na lot of snow in any other place.\n  I do know the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, \nhad his office open during this time as did I. He is on the floor and, \nI might ask, Mr. President, my good friend and colleague from Vermont, \nwould he agree with me that this is finally a Washington snowstorm that \ncomes up to the standards of what we expect back home in Vermont?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If the Senator will yield, I would say it is getting \nclose, anyway. It was, I think, an official 17 inches.\n  I would just comment, before I came down I shoveled off the roof of \nmy house in Vermont. There was almost 4 feet of snow on the roof that I \nshoveled off. So, when I say it is getting there, it still has a ways \nto go. On the other hand, I have noted drifts in front of my house here \nthat have totally buried the car, which makes it drifting over 5 feet. \nI think the drifts are more significant than the snowfall and that has \ncertainly created a lot of problems.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would say to my friend from Vermont, Mr. President, I \nlooked out the window. One of my neighbors usually parks a car on the \nstreet. I thought it had been stolen until I saw about an inch and a \nhalf of antenna sticking out and realized the car was under that.\n  I know the area where my friend from Vermont lives, one of the most \nbeautiful ones. He at least got his roof shoveled off. We had a little \ntrouble with the roof on my house, I might say, and have had a bit of \ndamage. We have had a lot of snow back home.\n  I would note that, while the Congress might close down the \nGovernment, we would have reopened it, but we found out there was a \nmuch higher power, as I am sure the Chaplain would agree, that closed \nthe Government right down again. I hope it will be back open. I know \nthere are so many thousands of good, hard-working men and women who \nwant to get back to work.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I just ask the Senator to yield for \na second? \n\n[[Page S123]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have lived in this area all of my life, northern \nVirginia and the greater metropolitan area. I do not know that we have \never experienced anything like this, except perhaps the storm of 1979, \nwhich I remember very well.\n  Mr. President I want to say, on a serious note, how in the community \nhere--certainly I can speak to northern Virginia but I am certain it is \nthroughout the metropolitan area--citizens have really rendered help to \none another in this crisis, be it shoveling snow or driving. The \nhospitals have asked for the 4-wheelers, and it is a great credit to \nthe community and those who live in it, how they have reached out a \nhand to help their fellow citizens who are suffering as a consequence \nof this very severe storm.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the distinguished Senator from Virginia will yield on \nthat point, I absolutely agree with him. I told the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia I consider him my Senator when I am away from \nhome. Of course, I consider Senator Jeffords my Senator when I am at \nhome. But down here I have a home in northern Virginia where I live \nduring the Senate session and I have seen exactly what the Senator from \nVirginia has said. People working hard, people come by asking elderly \nneighbors do they need something from the store? They were going to ski \nto the store, whatever.\n  When he talks about the hospitals and the 4-wheel drives, I know \nabout that from firsthand experience. My wife is a nurse on a medical \nsurgical floor in this area. She was on the shift that ended Saturday \nand Sunday and Monday night around midnight. As you know, the snow was \ncoming down pretty hard at that time. Complete strangers were coming \ninto the hospital with 4-wheel drives, people who were working at other \njobs, to take nurses and doctors back and forth, pick up medical \nsupplies, to take critically people back and forth. Total strangers \nwere bringing her home. We could not get out at first, out of our \nstreet, to go ourselves. But they were doing that. There was that sense \nof cooperation that, frankly--and I mean this as a great compliment to \nthe Senator from Virginia--it is the kind of cooperation we see in our \nState where we do get hit with heavy snowfalls like this, I know, \nwhether it is in the little town of Middlesex, VT, where my farm is, or \nShrewsbury, VT, the beautiful area where Senator Jeffords is from.\n  I yield to the distinguished colleague from Vermont.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield to the Senator from \nAlabama?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I just want to comment on the snow, that \nit suits the people in Alabama and it suits the Senator from Alabama, \nthat Vermont have most of this snow with the exception, I see as he \nleaves the chair, the Senator from Alaska is leaving, relative to his \nState.\n  They can have all of this snow. We will take 2 inches in Alabama \nevery 3 years and let that suffice. Otherwise, we just want to leave it \nto Vermont and to Alaska.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Alabama for that generous \noffer, and I assure him that we will take him up on it. We will use \nevery bit that we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S122-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE IMPORTANCE OF AMTRAK\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I also want to make a couple of other \ncomments which I am sure my senior colleague will agree with. One which \nproved to me the importance of Amtrak was how I got back here on Sunday \nnight. I came all the way down from basically Vermont on through \nMassachusetts. The efforts which those crews put on, and how packed \nthat train was when it finally got to New York City, and then on to \nWashington, emphasized how important that means of travel is in times \nof crisis like this. Without Amtrak passenger service we would be in \ntrouble.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Vermont will yield, I \nmight comment on that.\n  The Senator from Vermont and I have joined together in an awful lot \nof fights for our State and for our area during the past 21 years. And \nI think it is the one that I am most proud of and join with him in. He \nand I throughout those years, with our former colleague, Senator \nStafford, joined to keep Amtrak going up in our area. He is absolutely \nright to praise them. I know he uses the train. It is not just a case \nof saying, ``I want it for others.'' He uses it as I do on occasion. \nThis is something for which Amtrak deserves that credit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S123-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE VERMONT FLAG\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, one other item which I would like to \npoint out relative to Vermont and other areas of the country is the \nimportance of dairy.\n  I did not realize it until I struggled home last Sunday night and \nwent to the convenience store. I found they had adequate food. However, \nthe dairy case had but one quart of milk left. When I arrived again the \nnext morning, it had been replenished, and there was only one gallon of \nmilk left.\n  I point that out as to how important obviously in our lives dairy is; \nthe dairy industry.\n  So keep that in mind as we go along and take up the dairy program \nlater this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S123-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me also make a couple of comments \nabout the District of Columbia, being the chairman of the subcommittee \non District of Columbia appropriations.\n  This also points out how hard strapped the District is with respect \nto meeting emergencies such as we have had recently. I know I \npersonally have not seen a single snowplow in the days that I have been \nwalking back and forth. I do know that we have a fleet of 50 snowplows, \n8 of which are out of service because of mechanical failure. Usually in \nthe past they have had funds available to be able to hire plows. In \nfact, 4 years ago over 200 private plows were hired to clear the \nstreets. However, sufficient funds were not available. Only 55 private \nplows have been able to help out. In addition to that, we have another \n30 trucks that are sitting there idle because of the failure of the \nmechanical parts.\n  So I think it is important that we keep in mind that for the District \nthat we have to get their physical matters in shape so that we can \nhandle these kind of problems.\n  I also point out with respect to the District of Columbia that I will \nbe meeting this afternoon with Congressman Gunderson in the House, and \nwe will be communicating with subcommittee Chairman Walsh on trying to \nbring a reconciliation to our difficulties over the changes that are \nbeing recommended with respect to the District of Columbia educational \nsystem.\n  I will be proposing to them a hopeful compromise which will on the \none hand allow us really to do something substantial to improve the \neducational capacity of our schools in the District of Columbia but at \nthe same time will make it unlikely that we will have a filibuster in \nthe Senate on the controversial issue of vouchers.\n  So I am hopeful that we will be able to take care of that. I \nanticipate that when we come back on the 22d of January that we will \nhave a budget agreement for the House and Senate to vote on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S123-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S123-S124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET IMPASSE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to also comment on the \nbudget negotiations.\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the state of current budget \nnegotiations. First, I would like to thank Senator Dole and Senator \nDomenici for their leadership and fortitude in pursuing a balanced \nbudget in the next 7 years. They have been working hard during this \npast year at finding common ground with the President to reach a budget \nagreement.\n  Further, I am pleased that the President has recently agreed to \nbalance the budget during the next 7 years using CBO scoring. I \nunderstand the importance that this step has in reaching a final \nagreement. With this in mind, I remain hopeful that an agreement can be \nreached quickly.\n  Mr. President, however, I look on with regret as the current \nnegotiations are under suspension. It is vitally important that both \nsides quickly resume discussions.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am committed to balancing the Federal \nbudget. I have been working with several Senate Members for the past \nfew weeks from both parties to forge a compromise budget that balances \nin 7 years and uses CBO for scoring. We have recently offered this \nbipartisan plan to our congressional leaders that is both reasonable \nand plausible. I was very pleased to see that the Republican budget \nnegotiators have incorporated many of these suggestions from this \nbipartisan plan in their latest proposal to the President. With these \nlatest proposals it now appears that Congress and the President are \nclose on many items. In many cases the two sides are off by only 1 \npercent in nominative terms on many budgetary items.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to work with my colleagues to forge a \ncompromise agreement in the near term. Finally, I believe that during \nthis process of working on a budget agreement Congress and the \nPresident must keep the Federal Government fully operating. It is \nunnecessary and wrong to penalize Federal workers for the Congress' and \nWhite House's inability to reach agreement.\n  I want to again commend, as others have, the majority leader, Senator \nDole, for ensuring that we did not have a breakdown yesterday. There \nwere rumors flying around this city that it was expected that one or \nthe other side would just decide that we ought to end the negotiations.\n  I conversed with several of my moderate companions who have been \nmoving and trying to get a moderate budget proposal there for others to \nlook at, and I found that such a breakdown of the negotiations would \nhave been a serious, serious mistake. There are issues on both sides \nfrom individuals that feel that it would be politically advantageous \nfor each side to have the negotiations break down. I think that would \nbe a horrible mistake. It is for the good of the country. And we are \nright now in the position that we can really have a breakthrough on \nwhat will make the future of this country brighter, and we should work \nall we can. The same is true on welfare as well.\n  I also would say that in the negotiations one of the areas of major \nconsideration is Medicare. I hope and urge that both Houses resume \nnegotiations on health care reform because, if we can get the \nbreakthroughs which I know are there in health care reform--to get the \ncost of Medicare under control so that we do not get all the cost \nshifting with the fee-for-services system--we can make that almost a \nnonissue in the near future. If that becomes a nonissue in the sense \nthat it is under control, then the budget reconciliation, budget \nproblems, diminish very substantially.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S123-5", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE DEATH OF MIKE SYNAR\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

He served as probate \njudge of my home county, Colbert County, and his father before him \nserved as probate judge of Colbert County.\n  After Judge Tompkins left that office, his wife served as probate \njudge of our county, and his son is now a circuit judge in Colbert \nCounty.

I want to commend the Supreme Court for its activities \nduring this storm. Monday it met and heard oral arguments. Yesterday, \nTuesday, it met and heard oral arguments. It is meeting today. It \nperhaps has a smaller group of people who would have to gather to meet, \nbut nevertheless they are to be commended for their activity in all of \nthis snowstorm.\n  I will say that on Monday I was in my office at 3 o'clock when the \nSenate met. The Presiding Officer now, Senator Warner, was here, and \nthe Senator from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, was here, and one two \nothers. Senator Dole, of course, was here. I commend them for coming \nand making the effort. It reminded me of the effort on President's Day \nin 1979 when we had 24 inches of snow, more snow than we have today.\n  As has been the custom and the tradition of the Senate, the farewell \naddress of George Washington was delivered. On that occasion the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Warner, delivered that address, read it. I \nhappened to have presided. There may have been one other Member of the \nSenate that was here. Senator Warner made a real effort, walked some \nseveral miles in order to come and finally got here. I remember that \nquite well, that particular time.\n  So the Supreme Court of the United States is meeting. They are to be \ncommended for their effort at this time.\n  I would like to----\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from Alabama \nyield for one comment?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I say yes to the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. I just want to commend the Senator for his comments. Being \nfrom a neighboring State, Mississippi, I have talked to constituents \nthere this morning. It is 65 and the sun is shining there. They feel \nlike it is a little cool. They do not quite understand what all the \nfuss is. Their needs go on.\n  I have been working on a veterans' case and a post office matter. I \njust want to commend the Senator from Alabama and note that the Senator \nfrom Mississippi and southern Senators are here, and I just do not \nquite understand what all the fuss is about with the snow.\n  Would the Senator from Alabama share that feeling?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Yes, I say to the Senator. I am not saying that I endorse \nsnow. I do not like too much of it. I see my friend from Alaska and \nVermont and others who endorse snow. I am not a snow endorser.\n  But people in various places where the weather is not too bad, they \nhave phoned in; and sometimes their phones are not being answered, and \nthat is because of the problems here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S124-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S124-S125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I would like to mention the situation concerning the \nbudget negotiations. As Senator Specter said, they are really eight-\ntenths of 1 percent from reaching agreement in dollars and cents. It \nconstitutes more than $12 trillion over a 7-year period. There is $100 \nbillion in difference now, which is eight-tenths of 1 percent.\n  There are policy differences involved in this. But many of us have \nbeen striving to have a balanced budget for a \n\n[[Page S125]]\nlong time. The first bill I introduced calling for a constitutional \namendment requiring a balanced budget, we came close to that amendment \nbeing adopted recently. I hope we return to it again. I hope it can be \nadopted.\n  I am delighted to know that harmonious relations exist. There is \nnobody fussing right now about the other pertaining to the recess, as \nit is being called. But let me say this from the perspective of long-\ntime negotiations of the settlement of lawsuits: You do not do too well \nwith recesses. So my advice, if it is to mean anything, is get back \ntogether. You might want to recess a day or 2, or maybe a week at the \nlongest, but recesses allow the reentrenchment of ideas, and therefore \nyou do not have the give-and-take, you come fortified to maintain your \nposition.\n  It is a matter of trying to be reasonable in getting together. We are \nmighty close now. So let us not have too long a recess. Let us get back \ntogether. Certainly by the time the President makes his State of the \nUnion Address, we ought to, by that time, have an agreement. That ought \nto be a goal that we should be striving toward, and making every \neffort.\n  We are close, but the differences are still major. But we can reach \nan agreement and produce a balanced budget for 7 years. I urge all \nparticipants in the negotiations to get back together and to work and \nendeavor to be reasonable and to reach an agreement.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords).

I want to comment very briefly on the matter that has \nbeen the subject of some discussion, and that is the weather in \nWashington, DC. Alaskans operate on the theory that you are hardy \nbecause you have to be. I might add, that for reasons unknown, perhaps \nbecause of the extended atmospheric conditions or warm air or some \nmight conclude hot air emanating from Washington, DC, in this general \narea, I think we have attracted something, and it has been snow. Much \nof that perhaps has moved from my State of Alaska where we have \nvirtually no snow.\n  Our ski resorts in Anchorage have not opened, and in Fairbanks there \nis not enough snow to go cross-country skiing or snow machining. So I \ndo not know whether that is a blessing in disguise or not. But Alaskans \nare somewhat concerned, and I might add somewhat confused. But I do not \nthink Alaskans necessarily are the only ones that have made that \nobservation as a consequence of the last several weeks of discussion \nhere in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S125-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HELPING A DRIVER IN THE SNOW\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I might just add for the benefit of my \ncolleagues a little story that occurred the other day when my wife and \nI were walking over here on Monday and it was pretty scarce around \nhere. The snow plows had not been active at all on the street that we \nlive on even though it is a street that offers bus service. We are only \nabout 6 or 8 blocks away.\n  We came over and went through the mail and did a few odd things, as \nwe have been doing each day since. Going back I noticed a car was \ntrying to get up a small hill. It was about a two-block hill. They were \nnot having any luck. The more the driver pressed on the throttle, the \nmore the wheels spun.\n  I said I would be happy to get his car up to the top of the hill for \nhim. So he got out of the car, and I got in the car and put it in \ndrive, and very slowly eased up the hill. I noticed that there was \nanother hill at the end of the first block. I thought, well, the best \nthing to do is take it up to the corner. And as I crept up the second \nblock, I noticed the gentleman was shaking and beginning to run after \nthe car.\n  I stopped at the stop sign when I got to the top of the hill, and he \nsaid, ``I didn't think you were going to stop. I thought you were going \nto steal my car.''\n  I said, ``No. I didn't want to stop at the first stop sign because we \nwere still on a hill and you would have trouble.''\n  He said, ``Well, I'm sure glad that you got my car up the hill.'' But \nhe said, ``I was really concerned you were going to run away with it.''\n  To end the story, he got in the car. I left. He went around the \ncorner and got stuck again. I guess it is a hazard that is associated \nwith so many experiences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S125-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S125-S126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE BUDGET TALKS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me make a reference to the state of \naffairs relative to the suspended budget talks. I think it is fair to \nsay that we have all observed, with some chagrin, finger pointing, the \nreality that after these endless meetings we are left with a situation \nwhere we have not reached an accord. It is undoubtedly a reality that \nwe will not get this thing resolved until after the State of the Union \non the 23d of January. It would be perhaps speculative to suggest we \nwill get it resolved at that time. But we certainly hope so.\n  But I think it is fair to say that the extended discussions covering \nthe major issues of Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, taxes have been \nthoroughly gone into, but they are still not resolved. The President \nhas stepped forward with a 7-year proposal to balance the budget, but \nthe difficulty with that is most of the cuts are in the 7th year.\n  In the 7th year the President is not going to be here. It is such a \ndraconian mandate that undoubtedly Congress would find it unacceptable. \nClearly it lacks the commitment that is necessary for it to be \nworkable; and that is that we have a proportional cut over each year \nthat is equitable and palatable to the American public. Further, Mr. \nPresident, we have not gone into the second-tier issues.\n  These are issues that are subject to considerable debate, but they \nare in the reconciliation, and the reconciliation process as we know it \nis hung up as a consequence of the continued discussion over Medicaid, \nMedicare, welfare, taxes, and so forth.\n  As a consequence, we have an emergency not just associated with \nweather, but in my State concerning resource development on public \nlands. As an example, we have unresolved the issue of opening up the \nArctic National Wildlife Area for oil exploration. That is covered in \nthe reconciliation package. We have a mining piece of legislation, a \nmining bill in the reconciliation package that will either determine \nthe future of domestic mining or the demise of mining in the United \nStates as we find ourselves in a situation where the industry is no \nlonger able to generate a reasonable return on domestic investments and \nmoves overseas.\n  So there is much riding on a resolve, and we also have unresolved \nmajor appropriations bills affecting my State and the timber industry \nin the Tongass and the Interior appropriations bill. So it is \nimperative that judgments be made and that those judgments be made in a \ntimely manner.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, I would just like to refer to what I \nthink is the significance of what this debate is all about. It has been \nsuggested that the debate concerns itself with a balanced budget. I \nthink it is more fundamental. I think it is a historic debate about the \nrole and the scope of Washington, DC, whether Washington will continue \nto tax Americans more, to spend more of America's savings, to regulate \nAmericans more, and to control Americans more, or whether we are going \nto see a departure that will begin to reduce the size, scope, and power \nof Washington, DC. I think that is what this debate is all about. I \nthink that is what we should focus in on. We are at a significant \ncrossroads, Mr. President, and it is appropriate that we recognize it \nfor what it is. It is either doing business as usual or a substantial \ndeparture from the status quo.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to have printed in the Record a \nletter from Kelly R. King. Kelly King is a college student from Alaska. \nHe was formerly an intern in my office. He has written this letter to \neach Member of the U.S. Senate who chose not to support opening the \nArctic National Wildlife Reserve for exploration and, if the oil is \nthere, production. I think it is appropriate that we reflect on the \nattitudes prevailing concerning whether or not we are going to continue \nto develop our natural resources in the United States, whether it be on \npublic land for \n\n[[Page S126]]\ngrazing, mining, timbering, oil and gas exploration, or whether we are \ngoing to depend on imports.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: Now that I am of voting age, I have \n     taken a deep interest in the affairs of my nation, and \n     particularly my state. The nation is facing a growing \n     national debt that we must stop. Alaska proposed a solution \n     to help this problem which you voted against, that is, the \n     opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil \n     exploration. I hope that you will reconsider your decision \n     with some information that I hope to bring to your attention. \n     If we opened the 1002 area to drilling, not only would it \n     help to solve the national debt, but it would also decrease \n     our dependence on foreign oil.\n       In 1980, Congress set aside 1.5 million acres out of a \n     total of 19 million acres in ANWR so that it could be studied \n     and considered for oil exploration and named it the 1002 \n     area. The studies have been done and it is time to open it \n     for drilling. Geologists have found that there is \n     considerable evidence that sizable quantities of oil could be \n     found in the Arctic Oil Reserve and recommend opening the AOR \n     for drilling. Don't believe those that tell you that ANWR is \n     America's last wilderness. In fact, more than 192 million \n     acres of the State of Alaska are already protected as either \n     National Parks, Preserves, Refuges, Marine parks and other \n     federal and state conservation units. The 1002 area is not \n     designated as a wilderness. Studies show that more than 99 \n     percent of ANWR would remain untouched if oil drilling were \n     to take place. A study done by the Office of Technology \n     Assessment found that fewer than 2000 acres of the 1.5 \n     million acres in the 1002, less than 5 percent, would be \n     affected. You can see by that study that drilling will only \n     affect the environment in minute ways. Modern day \n     technologies will allow us to drill for oil safely without \n     hurting the environment.\n       You may ask how opening ANWR will affect your state and \n     America? Economists are estimating that if ANWR was opened to \n     drilling, that it would create over 700,000 jobs all around \n     the country. Not only would the United States benefit, but \n     over 700,000 Americans would have job security in the oil \n     industry for centuries to come. In a recent survey done \n     around the country, very few people have even heard of ANWR. \n     And when presented with the facts, they supported the idea of \n     drilling in the 1002 Area.\n       Bi-partisan support for the opening of the Arctic Oil \n     Reserve (1002 Area) is widespread throughout Alaska. Not only \n     is it backed by the Alaska State Legislature, Governor \n     Knowles, and most of Alaskan citizens, but the Alaska \n     Federation of Natives endorses this plan as well. The \n     majority of Alaska Natives feel that development of the \n     reserve can only better their lives. If oil is found, it will \n     eventually provide jobs, water and sewer systems, electric \n     power, and security for their villages, while not sacrificing \n     the wildlife on which they are so dependent. The Porcupine \n     Caribou herd is of concern to Natives and to all Alaskans, \n     but careful regulations were implemented at Prudhoe Bay and \n     the Central Arctic caribou herd grew from 3,000 in 1972 to \n     18,000 today. This confirms that animals and development can \n     coexist in the Arctic.\n       I hope that you use some of the facts that I have provided, \n     continue to research the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and \n     reconsider your decision. Development can only better the \n     United States and Alaska. I believe there is nothing to lose \n     in opening the Arctic Oil Reserve. If you would like more \n     information, I would urge you to contact the Alaska \n     Delegation. Please carefully decide, based on sound science--\n     the obvious answer being that it is time to open the Arctic \n     Oil Reserve. Americans and Alaskans both know that it is \n     time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Kelly R. King,\n                                                  College Student.\n\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first, I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom North Dakota for allowing me to speak for a few minutes. We have \nhad a little discussion about the snowstorm, which I think is all well \nand good. I want to return to the very serious subject on the \nnegotiations relative to the Nation's budget. It has been my privilege \nto associate with the distinguished majority leader, the Senator from \nKansas [Mr. Dole], and the distinguished majority whip, the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, and others, who in the last 2 weeks have worked on \nthese issues. I must say that I was extremely disappointed yesterday \nthat a further resolution of this matter could not have been achieved \nby the President in good-faith negotiations on both sides, as \ncharacterized by the participants.\n  I had hoped that perhaps some of the can-do spirit manifested here in \nthe Northeast as we cope individually and collectively with the storm \ncould have been infused in those negotiations. But my concern, however, \nis over the hiatus between now and the proposed adjournment resolution, \nwhich I understand the Senate will soon be taking up. As it relates to \nmy particular area of responsibilities, namely the Commonwealth of \nVirginia and particularly the adjoining areas in the greater \nmetropolitan area, this geographic area has been severely hit \neconomically as a consequence of this shutdown. First and foremost, the \ncost has been what I regard as an unfair burden placed upon the \nshoulders of Government public servants who, in good faith, tried to do \ntheir work but were furloughed. They were caught in a crossfire, which \nI think was totally unjust. Nevertheless, I and many others worked \nsuccessfully to restore their work status and, indeed, their pay.\n  But, Mr. President, there is an entire infrastructure that, likewise, \nhas suffered and will receive no restitution as a consequence of this \nshutdown. Hotel, motel, transportation, restaurants, and a vast array \nof the private sector, mostly small businesses, have been affected here \nin the greater metropolitan area, and most severely in northern \nVirginia and throughout the tidewater area of Virginia, by this \nshutdown.\n  My concern is whether, during this period of uncertainty, tourists \nand travelers will continue to come to the Nation's Capitol while a \npossible shutdown again hangs in abeyance until Congress returns and \nthe negotiators again attempt to resolve this impasse. Take, for \nexample, a family planning to come to the Nation's Capitol, having \ninvested their hard-earned savings for a trip to see the wonders that \nwe have here; are they still going to come?\n  I see the distinguished majority whip. I know from working with him \nand the majority leader that none of us wants to see a further \nGovernment shutdown. I hope that in a short colloquy we might convey as \nbest we can, that it is highly unlikely that we would experience \nanother shutdown such that it would impede and adversely affect the \nplans of people who normally would be visiting this area.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator from Virginia will yield for a comment and \nresponse. First, I want to say how much I appreciate--and I want to \nmake sure that all Members recognize that the distinguished senior \nSenator from Virginia has been very, very diligent over the past weeks \nwhen the Senate has just been in very brief sessions. When most \nSenators were back in their respective States during the holidays, I \nwould turn on C-SPAN and I would see the Senator from Virginia here \nwith our distinguished majority leader. The majority leader would \nreport on the status of the budget discussions, and the Senator from \nVirginia was always here. He has made his case very well about not only \nthe need to get a balanced budget and get a control on Washington, DC, \nbut also his concern that the Government be open doing its work, and \nthat the Federal employees, and indeed those that are affected by that \nshutdown that we had, the business men and women in Northern Virginia, \nthat their positions be recognized. So he certainly has done an \nexcellent job in that area.\n  With regard to what may be happening, of course, there are a number \nof things that may be happening in the next couple of weeks. I note the \nbudget negotiators are senior Members that were there from the \nCongress, meeting with the administration. They have described this as \na recess. In any negotiation you reach a point where you really do \nsometime need to take a break, get away from each other, assess what \nthe numbers are. I assume the Budget Committee members and staff at the \nWhite House will be assessing the latest offers. So there is a \npossibility that the negotiations to reach an agreement would get back \ngoing next week.\n  I know the majority leader indicated very strongly that, whenever the \nPresident feels like there is a need for--a reason to get back and have \ndiscussions, that certainly our majority leader and the Speaker of the \nHouse and majority leader in the House would honor a request to get \nback together. So there is a possibility that will happen. \n\n[[Page S127]]\n\n  Another option, of course, is that some agreement could be reached. \nThen, during that week of January 22nd, 23rd, that agreement could \nperhaps be acted on by the Congress, and if there is an agreement \nreached I assume it would be approved relatively quickly--I hope so.\n  Another option is, then, when this continuing resolution to keep the \nGovernment operating until January 26--when we reach that point, I do \nnot think there is any intent to have a situation where we would go \nback to a Government shutdown. That time has past. I feel like the \nCongress, House, and Senate, would try to take action that would avoid \nthat and I know there would be a coordinated effort, hopefully, with \nthe administration.\n  Of course there is always the necessity for legislation not only to \nbe passed, but in order for it to be enacted, the President has to sign \nit. We have not had very good luck, lately, with the President signing \nmeasures we have sent to him.\n  But the intent, I believe, by the leadership on both sides of the \naisle, is not to have another situation on January 26 where we would go \ninto some sort of Government shutdown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S126-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. Again, \nI commend him for his leadership throughout this period. That does \nprovide, hopefully, a measure of reassurance.\n  This Senator is a very strong proponent and adherent to the concept \nof the 7-year balanced budget using the CBO figures. That is the \ncornerstone, because it is imperative that we redirect this Nation on a \ncourse of less Federal spending.\n  I shall not go into more philosophical points here. I align myself \nwith the distinguished majority leader and the majority whip. You have \nled this side of the aisle in working with the other side to reach a \nresolution of this matter. So I am philosophically attuned and in full \nagreement with our leadership here. But I am concerned, again, about \nthe economic impact here in the area that I represent.\n  I also must say, Mr. President, and I say to our distinguished \nleader, I am concerned about the national financial situation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Our financial markets--stocks, bonds, commodities and the \nlike--are following this debate closely. The continued ability of this \ncountry to borrow, both domestically and internationally, at a \nreasonable rate of interest, depends on the resolution of this matter. \nSo, while two Senators, and perhaps there are others who will join, can \ngive some measure of reassurance at this time, I think only when final \naction is taken by the Congress and signed by the President of the \nUnited States, can we regain the full confidence of the various \nfinancial institutions which are keenly aware of the actions taken here \nin the Congress.\n  So, I thank my distinguished leader, I thank the Senator from North \nDakota. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S127-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE SHUTDOWN, THE BUDGET, AND TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been some discussion today about \nthe budget negotiations. I have a couple comments to add to this \ndiscussion.\n  First, with respect to the budget negotiations, there ought not be, \nunder any condition, another Government shutdown. It is, in my \njudgment, a symbol for the entire country of failure when some people \nhere in the Congress decide that shutting down the Government should be \nused to accomplish their ends.\n  A shutdown asks the American taxpayer to pay for work that is not \nperformed. It asks some Federal employees to come to work and accept \nthe promise of pay later, but it deprives them of their paycheck. It \nsends the other Federal workers home without pay, when they have bills \nto pay and obligations to meet and want to come to work.\n  The shutdown dangles Federal workers at the end of a string, saying \nto them: ``You are the ones we will use as pawns in this budget \ndebate.''\n  Those who advocate shutdowns, and there are some, demonstrate that \nyou can have a hard head and a cold heart at the same time. But that \nadvocacy does not show any capacity to think this budget crisis through \nto a decent conclusion. We ought not have another Government shutdown \nunder any conditions, because it serves no interests except to hurt \nthis country. All of us, it seems to me, in Congress, ought to pledge \nnever to let another Government shutdown happen again on our watch.\n  Now, about balancing the budget, we should balance the budget. I have \nsaid before and I will say again, because it is worth saying, I think \nthe Republicans deserve credit for pushing for a balanced budget. You \ndeserve credit for that. Democrats deserve credit for pushing a \nbalanced budget with the right kind of priorities. We ought to get the \nbest of both rather than the worst of each.\n  People talk about ``families balance their budgets.'' Can anyone in \nhere think about a family that sits around their table at night and \nsays, ``We need to develop a plan to balance our budget, so let's see, \nwe are going to help our oldest son make payments on the Mercedes. We \nneed to send a monthly stipend to rich Uncle Louie over in Nashville. \nHow are we going to pay for all that? Let's cut back on mama's health \ncare and let's pull junior out of college.''\n  Does that sound like a logical approach for a family, in making their \ndecisions about how to deal with their budget situation? Not hardly. \nNor is it the right way for Congress to deal with its budget situation.\n  Interestingly enough, we have come to a point where there is a lot of \nagreement on the budget-balancing question. There are a number of areas \nof agreement but there are a couple of large areas of disagreement.\n  Most people, in assessing this problem, would start by saying you do \nnot balance the budget by cutting your revenue. I think everybody on \nall sides of the aisle ought to decide to abandon tax cuts at this \npoint until we have honestly balanced the budget, and then come back \nand assess the question of how you change the tax code and how you cut \ntaxes for middle-income families.\n  But I say to all parties in these negotiations, it would make sense, \nit seems to me, to abandon the proposals to cut taxes because I think \neveryone in this Chamber who thinks about it honestly will understand, \nevery dollar of tax cut during the 7 years will be borrowed and added \nto the Federal deficit. Every single dollar of tax cut will be \nborrowed. I say abandon the tax cut. Deal with the spending issues in a \nreal way, and let us balance the budget.\n  The problem we have at the moment is some are insisting on a tax cut \nwell over $200 billion. In order to make room for that, you have to \nhave deeper cuts in Medicare. That is where the scales are balanced, \nor, better said, out of balance. In order to get this tax cut on this \nside up to $12,000-some, you have to pull down the Medicare costs. You \nhave to cut Medicare to accommodate the tax cut. That is the dilemma.\n\n  Abandon the tax cut, balance the budget honestly, reach an agreement, \nand do it in a way that represents the best interests of the priorities \nof the American people. Let us make sure we have enough money for \neducation. Let us provide for health care for senior citizens. Let us \ndo the things that are necessary to protect this country's environment. \nLet us do this the right way. It can be done.\n  There are good Republicans and good Democrats who think clearly about \nthese things. We ought to be able to come together to reach an \nagreement, in my judgment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S127-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S127-S129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TWO HEROES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to just briefly, today, talk \nabout two Americans I wanted to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues, two heroes of mine.\n  I never met them. I talked to one fellow on the phone the other day. \nA fellow named Robert Naegele and his wife Ellis. He started a company \ncalled Rollerblade, which some may know about, the largest in-line \nskate company in America. It was a story I read in the Minneapolis Star \nTribune, when I traveled through Minneapolis the other day by plane. \n\n[[Page S128]]\n\n  Robert Naegele sold his company 2 months ago. He apparently made an \nenormous amount of money, ran the company, started it from scratch, \nbrought it to a $250 million company and then sold it a couple months \nago. Then, about a week before Christmas, 280 employees of this company \nbegan to get letters in the mail from Mr. Naegele and his wife. It \nturns out he decided to give the people who worked for that company, \nthe people in the factories, the people who made the skates that made \nhim a very wealthy man, a Christmas bonus equal to $160 a month for \nevery month these folks had worked for the company.\n  For some of them in the factory who had been there all the time he \nwas there it meant up to $20,000, a $20,000 check. Do you know what he \nhad done? He and his wife had prepaid the income taxes, so when these \nfolks opened up this check, totally unexpected, from someone who no \nlonger owned the company, they got a check that was tax free.\n  What this man was saying to them was ``you mattered.'' You people who \nworked in the plant and factories and helped make these products, you \nare the ones who made me successful. You made me some money and I want \nto share it with you. What a remarkable story. What a hero.\n  This guy is out of step with the CEO's in our country who now say the \nway to the future is to downsize and lay off and decide to cut the \nground out from under the feet of people who work for a company for 20 \nyears. This fellow says to a factory worker, who the article \ndescribes--as their families are weeping with joy about this unexpected \nbenevolence they received in the mail--he says, you matter to me. You \nmade a difference. You made this company successful and I want to share \nit with you.\n  What a remarkable man. It seems to me if more CEO's in this country \nwould understand what Mr. Naegele understands, this country would be a \nbetter place. Our companies could be better able to compete. You would \nhave more loyalty, more job security for people who have spent 10 and \n20 years investing their time in companies.\n  I read this one day. The next day I read another piece.\n  It was about a fellow whose company, on December 11, began to burn \ndown--it was in a small town in Massachusetts--a man named Aaron \nFeuerstein. He was about to go to his 70th birthday party, a surprise \nparty that was being thrown for him. He learned a boiler had exploded \nat his mill, textile plant, setting off a fire. It injured 27 people \nand destroyed three of the factory's century-old buildings. That \nemploys 2,400 people in an economically depressed area.\n  The people who watched that mill burn felt that they were losing \ntheir jobs, and losing their future.\n\n       When Feuerstein arrived to assess the damage to a business \n     his grandfather had started 90 years ago, he kept himself \n     from crying by thinking back to the passage from King Lear in \n     which Lear promises not to weep even though his heart would \n     ``break into a hundred thousand flaws.'' ``I was telling \n     myself I have to be creative. . . .''\n\n  And 3 days later:\n\n       On the night of Dec. 14, more than 1,000 employees gathered \n     in the gym of Central Catholic High School to learn the fate \n     of their jobs and of the cities of Methuen and Lawrence. \n     Feuerstein entered the gym from the back, and as he shook the \n     now off his coat, the murmurs turned to cheers. The factory \n     owner, who had already given out $275 Christmas bonuses and \n     pledged to rebuild, walked to the podium. ``I will get right \n     to my announcement,'' he said. ``For the next 30 days--and it \n     might be more--all our employees will be paid their full \n     salaries. But over and above the money, the most important \n     thing Malden Mills can do for our workers is to get you back \n     to work. By Jan. 2, we will restart operations, and within 90 \n     days we will be fully operational.''\n       True to his word, Feuerstein has continued to pay his \n     employees in full, at a cost of some $1.5 million a week and \n     at an average of $12.50 an hour--already one of the highest \n     textile wages in the world. And even better than his word, \n     Malden Mills was up and running last week at 80% of its \n     Polartec capacity, thanks to round-the-clock salvage work and \n     the purchase of 15 new machines. ``I haven't really done \n     anything,'' says Feuerstein. ``I don't deserve credit. \n     Corporate America has made it so that when you behave the way \n     I did, it's abnormal.''\n\n  I just want to finally mention that these two men, Robert Naegele, \nand Aaron Feuerstein, I think are heroes. I think both recognize what a \nlot of this country have forgotten. A company is its workers. Yes. It \nis its investors, it is its innovators, it is its scientists, and it is \nalso its workers. Workers matter, and these heroes have done what more \nAmerican business leaders should do. Too many American businesses now \nsay to those workers, ``You are like a wrench. We use it, and we get \nrid of you when it is over.''\n  What these people are saying is the workers are their business. They \ndetermine whether that business is successful. And both of them have \nsaid we commit ourselves to you workers. And I say to them that they \nare American heroes to me, and I wish there were more like them in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these two articles \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune]\n\n    It Was a Surprisingly Green Christmas for Rollerblade Employees\n\n                            (By Dee DePass)\n\n       Two weeks ago Rollerblade employee Ann Reader, six months \n     pregnant with her third child, called her husband, Tim, from \n     work sobbing. He immediately thought the worst, she said.\n       But it was good news for Reader and all of Rollerblade's \n     280 employees. Former Roller- blade co-owner Robert Naegele \n     and his wife, Ellis, played Santa over the holidays, giving \n     each of Rollerblade's employees thousands of dollars in tax-\n     free money, figured at about $160 for each month of service \n     with the company. Sources familiar with the giveaway \n     estimated the combined gifts to be $1.5 million.\n       Reader, team programs manager, has worked there for more \n     than six years--making her check worth more than $11,000. \n     None of the employees contacted would confirm the amount of \n     their checks.\n       ``It made me cry,'' said Reader in a shaky voice. ``I think \n     it was so generous of them. It was an amazing gesture.''\n       Rollerblade spokesperson Deborah Autrey said, ``It was a \n     complete surprise that came out of the blue. People were \n     laughing and crying and hugging. I have never seen people in \n     such a stupor.''\n       Autrey has worked at Rollerblade for four years. More than \n     half of the employees are warehouse workers with most \n     receiving hourly wages.\n       Naegele, who was chairman during the phenomenal growth of \n     the 15-year-old firm, could not be reached for comment. Two \n     months ago he sold his 50 percent share of Rollerblade to \n     Nordica Inc. of Italy for an undisclosed amount. He bought 50 \n     percent of the in-line skate company in 1985, when sales were \n     only $500,000. Sales in 1994 were $265 million.\n       In Christmas cards to employees, Naegele wrote that he had \n     reaped great rewards from his Rollerblade investment because \n     of the employees' hard work and that he wanted to show \n     his thanks, Autrey said. Enclosed in the cards were the \n     gift checks, on which the Naegeles paid federal taxes.\n       ``That way the employees did not get hit with a double \n     whammy. It is a tax-free gift,'' said Autrey.\n       The checks were mailed to employees' homes the week before \n     Christmas. The first arrived on Dec. 21 to an employee who \n     was home on maternity leave. From there word spread among the \n     workers, and later that day it was confirmed by the company's \n     chief executive, John Hetterick, who had only found out the \n     day before.\n       When the good news reached Matt Majka, 33, the director of \n     product marketing, he immediately phoned his wife, Kym, and \n     asked her to open the mail. When she did, Majka heard sobs. \n     He has been with the company for 11 years, making his check \n     worth an estimated $21,120.\n       ``It was very moving,'' he said.\n       ``It was very heartfelt for us. We were extremely shocked \n     and extremely grateful for his generosity. . . . All the \n     words he talked about for so many years--about teamwork and \n     that we are a family--he put his words into action.''\n       Majka and his wife have a 4-month-old baby and a 2-year-old \n     son, and the Naegeles' gift went to start a college fund for \n     them, he said. The couple also had a new IBM computer under \n     the Christmas tree.\n       Reader said she bought bikes for her two children (and a \n     bike baby carrier for the newest family member) and she plans \n     to put some of the money away in savings.\n       Majka marveled at what the gift meant to scores of his co-\n     workers. ``There are some people who have worked in our \n     warehouse and have been here for a long time,'' he said. \n     ``For some people, they have received a very substantial \n     check, maybe half their year's salary. It's pretty amazing.'' \n     At least two employees have been there for all of the \n     company's 15 years.\n       ``I happened to talk to Bob [Naegele] later that night,'' \n     Majka said. ``I told him, `You can't imagine the impact you \n     have had on everyone.' He bellowed and said; `That is just \n     what I wanted to hear.' He said, `This is not mine. It is a \n     gift I had to share.' ''\n     \n[[Page S129]]\n\n\n                  [[From Time Magazine, Jan. 8, 1996]\n\n                          The Glow From a Fire\n\n                            (By Steve Wulf)\n\n       Methuen, Massachusetts, is a small city not unlike the \n     Bedford Falls of It's a Wonderful Life. Over the years, the \n     working-class town on the border of New Hampshire and \n     Massachusetts has come to rely on the good heart of one man. \n     While Aaron Feuerstein may not look much like Jimmy Stewart, \n     he is the protagonist of a Christmas story every bit as \n     warming as the Frank Capra movie--or the Polartec fabric made \n     at his Malden Mills.\n       On the night of Dec. 11, just as Feuerstein was being \n     thrown a surprise 70th birthday party, a boiler at Malden \n     Mills exploded, setting off a fire that injured 27 people and \n     destroyed three of the factory's century-old buildings. \n     Because Malden Mills employs 2,400 people in an economically \n     depressed area, the news was as devastating as the fire. \n     According to Paul Coorey, the president of Local 311 of the \n     Union of Needletrades. Industrial and Textile Employees. ``I \n     was standing there seeing the mill burn with my son, who also \n     works there, and he looked at me and said, `Dad, we just lost \n     our jobs.' Years of our lives seemed gone.''\n       When Feuerstein arrived to assess the damage to a business \n     his grandfather had started 90 years ago, he kept himself \n     from crying by thinking back to the passage from King Lear in \n     which Lear promises not to weep even though his heart \n     would ``break into a hundred thousand flaws.'' I was \n     telling myself I have to be creative,'' Feuerstein later \n     told the New York Times. ``Maybe there's some way to get \n     out of it.'' Feuerstein, who reads from both his beloved \n     Shakespeare and the Talmud almost every night, has never \n     been one to run away. When many other textile \n     manufacturers in New England fled to the South and to \n     foreign countries, Malden Mills stayed put. When a \n     reliance on fake fur bankrupted the company for a brief \n     period in the early '80s, Feuerstein sought out \n     alternatives.\n       What brought Malden Mills out of bankruptcy was its \n     research-and-development team, which came up with a \n     revolutionary fabric that was extremely warm, extremely \n     light, quick to dry and easy to dye. Polartec is also \n     ecologically correct because it is made from recycled plastic \n     bottles. Clothing made with Polartec or a fraternal brand \n     name, Synchilla, is sold by such major outdoors clothiers as \n     L.L. Bean, Patagonia, Eastern Mountain Sports and Eddie \n     Bauer, and it accounts for half of Malden's $400 million-plus \n     in 1995 sales.\n       Even though the stock of a rival textile manufacturer in \n     Tennessee, the Dyersburg Corp., rose sharply the day after \n     the fire, L.L. Bean and many of Malden's other customers \n     pledged their support. Another apparel company, Dakotah, sent \n     Feuerstein a $30,000 check. The Bank of Boston sent $50,000, \n     the union $100,000, the Chamber of Commerce in the \n     surrounding Merrimack Valley $150,000. ``The money is not for \n     Malden Mills,'' says Feuerstein, ``It is for the Malden Mills \n     employees. It makes me feel wonderful. I have hundreds of \n     letters at home from ordinary people, beautiful letters with \n     dollar bills, $10 bills.''\n       The money was nothing to the workers compared to what \n     Feuerstein gave them three days later. On the night of Dec. \n     14, more than 1,000 employees gathered in the gym of Central \n     Catholic High School to learn the fate of their jobs and of \n     the cities of Methuen and Lawrence. Feuerstein entered the \n     gym from the back, and as he shook the snow off his coat, the \n     murmurs turned to cheers. The factory owner, who had already \n     given out $275 Christmas bonuses and pledged to rebuild, \n     walked to the podium. ``I will get right to my \n     announcement,'' he said. ``For the next 30 days--and it might \n     be more--all our employees will be paid their full salaries. \n     But over and above the money, the most important thing Malden \n     Mills can do for our workers is to get you back to work. By \n     Jan. 2, we will restart operations, and within 90 days we \n     will be fully operational.'' What followed, after a moment of \n     awe, was a scene of hugging and cheering that would have \n     trumped the cinematic celebration for Wonderful Life's George \n     Bailey.\n       True to his word, Feuerstein has continued to pay his \n     employees in full, at a cost of some $1.5 million a week and \n     at an average of $12.50 an hour--already one of the highest \n     textile wages in the world. And even better than his word, \n     Malden Mills was up and running last week at 80% of its \n     Polartec capacity, thanks to round-the-clock salvage work and \n     the purchase of 15 new machines. ``I haven't really done \n     anything,'' says Feuerstein. ``I don't deserve credit. \n     Corporate America has made it so that when you behave the way \n     I did, it's abnormal.''\n       Union chief Coorey begs to differ. Says he: ``Thank God we \n     got Aaron.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S127-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the January 7, 1996 New York Times Magazine \ncontains an interview with the leader of Burma's democracy movement, \nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  Many of us have followed her situation, during six years of house \narrest, and her recent release by the Burmese authorities. She is a \nwoman of remarkable courage, honesty and clarity of purpose. She wants \nto do whatever she can to improve the lives of her people, and she has \ndevoted her life to that goal. She believes unequivocally that \ndemocracy is the only way, and she has the trust and support of the \noverwhelming majority of Burmese citizens.\n  As she says in the interview, the Burmese authorities continue to \nrefuse to even discuss a process for instituting democracy, because \nthey are too fond of their power and privileges. But Suu Kyi knows that \neventually the SLORC will have to sit down and negotiate with her. As \nshe points out, that is what happened in South Africa, and even in the \nformer Yugoslavia although there only after the slaughter of a quarter \nof a million people and the destruction of much of Bosnia. Those two \nexamples represent the SLORC's options. Either a peaceful way out, or \nmass demonstrations and an explosion of violence that will make them \nwish they had listened to her.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator \nMcConnell's legislation to impose sanctions on the Burmese government. \nSenator McConnell has been a strong advocate for human rights and \ndemocracy in Burma, and I applaud him for it. It is important that the \nUnited States have a consistent policy, and I believe that until the \nSLORC demonstrates a genuine willingness to negotiate the transition to \ndemocracy with Suu Kyi, our policy should be to isolate the SLORC from \nthe world community it yearns to be part of. In that regard, I would \nnote that the SLORC has named 1996 ``Visit Myanmar Year.'' I hope that \nanyone considering accepting the SLORC's invitation will read the \ninterview with Suu Kyi, and be aware that they may find themselves \nstaying in hotels and traveling on roads that were built with forced \nlabor.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to ask that the entire interview be \nprinted in the Record, but I urge all Senators to read it. I do ask \nunanimous consent that Suu Kyi's response to the question ``What do you \nwant people in the United States to know about you?'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Excerpt From Interview With Suu Kyi\n\n       Q: What do you want people in the United States to know \n     about you?\n       A: That we are not near democracy yet and that there are, \n     so far, no signs that we are progressing toward \n     democratization. The National Convention [that Slorc was \n     holding to draft a constitution], as it stands, is not a step \n     toward democratization at all.\n       I think a lot of Americans very much take their rights for \n     granted. And I think many of them do not know what life is \n     like for those of us whose security is not guaranteed by a \n     democratic constitution. So I would like to ask them to try \n     to put themselves in our shoes, and ask how they would feel \n     if they were deprived of all rights. I would like them to see \n     us not as a country rather far away whose sufferings do not \n     matter, but as fellow human beings in need of human rights \n     and who could do so much for the world, if we were allowed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S129-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S129-S130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EXPANDED IRA'S\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the budget, I think \nit's interesting to note that the United States now has the lowest \nsavings rate of any industrialized nation in the world.\n  If the situation does not change quickly, many Americans may have no \nchoice but to live below the poverty level during their retirement \nyears.\n  Retirees can no longer depend solely on their Social Security and \npensions to support them in retirement. I believe it is our \nresponsibility to give the American people, not only an alternative, \nbut in reality, a life preserver for their retirement years.\n  We must encourage people to save for their own retirement. For that \nreason, I believe it is critical that we expand the current IRA's, \nallowing more people to use them for savings and investment. We should \ndo this as a part of any budget package which is agreed upon or as \nstand-alone legislation.\n  With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a wonderful example of how the private sector is trying to deal \nwith this growing threat to our Nation's future well-being. This is an \nopen letter from Mr. Charles R. Schwab to the President and Members of \nCongress.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S130]]\n\n\n           [From the Washington Times, Friday, Jan. 5, 1996]\n\n              An Open Letter to the President and Congress\n\n\n                                               Charles Schwab,\n\n                                                     January 1996.\n       Dear Mr. President and Members of Congress: I want to take \n     this opportunity to thank you for your hard work and vision \n     with regard to the budget process, and in particular, \n     Individual Retirement Account reform.\n       Today, the average American household, with family members \n     who are between the ages of 51 and 60, has less than $18,000 \n     in personal savings, excluding their home. With Social \n     Security teetering on the brink of disaster, this is simply \n     not enough of a resource to survive on for the next 20 or 30 \n     years of their retirement. Unless this problem is forcefully \n     addressed, the vast majority of Americans will not have the \n     money necessary to fund their own retirement expenses and may \n     become a burden on their children, grandchildren, and the \n     federal government for generations to come.\n       One of the only responsible solutions is to expand the IRA \n     now in the current budget process:\n       When the IRA deductibility was eliminated in 1986, IRA \n     contributions dropped from almost $40 billion in 1985--to a \n     low of $7 billion last year for deductible contributions.\n       Currently, over 25 million families are excluded from \n     investing in deductible IRA's, and they are relying on \n     Congress to abolish the income limit so they can save for \n     their futures. If we can't abolish the income limit, then why \n     not shorten the time frame for expansion and include indexing \n     for inflation?\n       The time has come to stop discriminating against non-\n     working spouses by letting them have an equal opportunity to \n     invest in an IRA.\n       The United States now has the lowest savings rate of any \n     industrialized nation in the world. If we increase savings we \n     will create new jobs and build new industries.\n       I urge you to act now for the sake of our country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles R.

Mr. President, it is with sadness today that I note the \npassing of an Oklahoman, former Congressman Mike Synar, who died \nyesterday, Tuesday.\n  He lost a courageous battle to cancer, which he had been fighting for \nseveral months. If anyone knew Mike Synar well, they knew that he was a \ncourageous person and they knew that he was a fighter. Mike Synar was \nan active Oklahoman. He was very active in 4-H as a young man. He was a \nstudent leader at the University of Oklahoma. He attained a masters at \nNorthwestern University, and a law degree at the University of Oklahoma \nin 1977.\n  A year later at the age of 28 he was elected to Congress. He defeated \nan incumbent Congressman, something at that time that was seldom done. \nIt showed that he was a very tenacious campaigner, a very energetic \nindividual to be elected at such a young age and to defeat an incumbent \nat the same time.\n  Mike Synar served in Congress for 16 years between 1978 and 1994. To \nsay the least, he was energetic, he was outgoing, and he was passionate \nabout many things. He had very strong convictions. And I greatly \nrespected him because he did show the courage of his conviction on a \nlot of issues--a lot of issues maybe that were not the most popular in \nour State and in his district.\n  But he was outgoing. He was willing to take on special interests at \nvarious times--sometimes at risk and jeopardy to his political career.\n  Mike Synar passed away yesterday, Tuesday, January 9, and I wish to \nextend my condolences and sympathies to his family, to his friends in \nMuskogee and his friends from throughout the country.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I would like to, if the Senator will allow \nme, participate in his expression of sympathies for the passing of \nCongressman Synar, former Congressman Synar. He was a remarkable man, \nand I worked with him on a lot of issues.\n  I recall--the Senator might recall--that prior to the last election, \nthe election before that, he had a very close race, and an enormously \ncontroversial race. And I said to him one day, ``You do not make it \neasy on yourself, do you?'' He said, ``No. I did not come here to make \nit easy. I came here to decide what I want to fight for, and I fight \nfor it and let the chips fall where they may.''\n  That is the kind of person he was. He was a remarkably strong, \nenergetic person.

Mr. President, let me just say a word, if I may, to what my \ncolleagues have already alluded to, some good things that have happened \nin the last few days.\n  I would like to say a word on behalf of the many who work for the \nFederal Government--the Federal employees not only in the Washington \narea but around the country and the many others who work for the \nFederal Government.\n  We have been through a very difficult period where for some 3 weeks, \nin effect. We told many hard-working, dedicated Federal employees to \nstay home. And they were able to work through this period. Many of them \ncame in, many without getting paid, and others who recognized essential \nservices that they were providing. But, just at the conclusion of that \nlong and very difficult period for many people who work hard on a day-\nto-day basis without a great deal of recognition, we had a snowstorm, \nthe blizzard of 1996 here on the east coast that pretty well shut down \neverything.\n  I know that there has been a great deal of concern in the last day or \ntwo about when and under what circumstances Federal employees would be \nasked to come back to work. I would simply like to say to all of those \nwho have been through a very rough period, and for those other people \nwho work with the Federal Government, whether \n\n[[Page S131]]\nthey contract with the Federal Government, or whether they are \ndependent upon the effective operation of the Federal Government, thank \nyou for your understanding.\n  It is certainly my hope that we have all learned a lesson and that we \nwill not under any circumstances close down the Federal Government \nunder similar circumstances again. It simply was counterproductive and \ncostly for everyone.\n  I applaud the majority leader for the initiative he took earlier in \nthe week to bring that particular chapter to a close. I do understand \nthat there are fundamental differences that are still at stake. I \napplaud both the President and the chief negotiators from the Congress \nfor the statements that they made yesterday so as not to exacerbate the \nproblem, to leave open the prospect that they will be able to find \ncommon ground, refer to the temporary suspension rather than the \ncollapse of those particular talks because there are very significant \nand important issues that I think benefit from the kind of discussion \nand kind of intense focus that they have had during the last few weeks.\n  I hope that process will continue. I think it makes sense for those \nwho have been locked in what might appear to be mortal combat for a \nperiod of time to take the period away from the table, away from the \ntalks, to have an opportunity to refresh themselves and their minds, \nand get a little different perspective. I hope that they will come back \nready to work on those essential issues that continue to divide us.\n  I hope that all of the Federal employees who have been in all cases \ninconvenienced--in many cases put through some very severe hardship--\nwill now assist in getting all of the functions of Government back up \nto speed as rapidly as we can.\n  Whatever decision is made tonight, I suspect that the Office of \nPersonnel Management will announce that the Federal Government will be \nformally open tomorrow. But there are still, clearly, many Federal \nemployees, and many other citizens in the area, who are unable to get \nout of their homes, out of their driveways, and find any reasonable \nprospect of getting to work in the way that they would normally get to \nwork.\n  I hope that Federal managers and Federal supervisors will be \nunderstanding, but that Federal employees themselves would make that \nlittle extra effort to catch up on a lot of work that has gone undone \nduring the last few weeks. Many people are critically dependent on them \ncatching up with the work that needs to be done.\n  For all those who are going to be doing it and for those who have \nbeen both inconvenienced, and in some cases placed at a real hardship, \nI want to say on behalf of I think all of our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, we understand what they have been through and we \nunderstand the inconvenience, we understand what has happened both with \nrespect to the budget negotiations as well as the weather. We thank you \nfor sticking with us. We hope you will continue to work as hard as you \ncan to get us back up to speed and functioning as rapidly as you can.\n  With that I thank the Chair and yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to join others in expressing my \nappreciation to those that have been negotiating in this historic \neffort to move toward a balanced budget and reduce the size and scope \nof Washington in our lives. I know that they have met, as I understand \nit, some 50 hours with the President, the Vice President, and others \nfrom the administration, the majority leader and the minority leader in \nthe Senate, and the majority leader and minority leader from the House \nof Representatives, the Speaker.\n  They certainly have made a supreme effort to close the differences in \ntrying to reach an agreement. It has been a monumental undertaking. It \nis historic. I emphasize again this is not an insignificant event. You \nare talking about a lot of the taxpayers' money being at stake. You are \ntalking about fundamental change in the way that Washington spends \nmoney and the efforts to reduce that level of increased spending in the \nfuture and an effort to allow the taxpayers to retain some of their \nhard-earned money, trying to get some fundamental reform in the so-\ncalled entitlements area.\n  It is a major effort to accomplish this. So I think they have made a \ngood-faith effort. I understand they have made some progress. There has \nbeen some movement on both sides. You can characterize which one has \nmoved the most. Obviously, I think that the majority from Congress has \nmade the greatest movement. But the fact is, they both have changed \nsome.\n  I think that probably this recess was unavoidable and perhaps even \ngood at this point. There have been shifts in positions. Listening to \nthe majority leader and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and \nthe House Budget Committee, they felt last night the last offer that \nhad been made by the majority was as far as they could go in a number \nof areas.\n  I think maybe now they can take this time to take a breath, look at \nwhat has been proposed, and the administration, the President, can look \nat what has been proposed and see if he cannot make some additional \nchanges, because I do know that the majority made changes in Medicare, \nMedicaid, welfare, in the earned income tax credit, and even a proposal \nto bring down the tax cuts from what I believe had been $203 billion \ndown to $177 billion. So a lot of changes have been made.\n  There is good reason to get this agreement. There is a lot to be \ngained for all involved. First of all, the most important thing is if \nwe get a budget agreement America will benefit. Then there will be \nbenefit for all those that have been involved, including the \nadministration and the Congress, both parties. So we should do it.\n  What is to be gained? Clearly, the experts say if we get an agreement \nyou will see a further decline in interest rates which will help us \nall--those who want to buy a home, buy an automobile, pay for college. \nLower interest rates is something we really want to achieve. That would \nbe a benefit if we could get this balanced budget in 7 years, if we get \nreal numbers agreed to. That would mean more jobs, lower interest \nrates, selling more refrigerators, automobiles. It will create jobs. I \nunderstand it would lead to lower trade deficits, and also it would \nlower the national debt in the future.\n\n  If we do not get this agreement, then this almost $5 trillion debt we \nhave will continue to go up. And to try to control the rate of growth \nof that debt is certainly a supreme accomplishment that we should work \non. I understand that it has been estimated the average benefit per \nfamily per year from this agreement would be about $1,000 per family, \nnot an insignificant amount, a minimum of $7,000 just from the benefit \nof getting the balanced budget, not to mention what we might do in the \ntax cut area.\n  What is to be lost if we do not get an agreement? First of all, I \nthink our institutions will suffer because we will have not been able \nto reach an agreement. We do not want that to happen. I have never seen \na negotiation go on this long and to this extent or to this level. In \nthe past usually there has been, you know, debate back and forth \nbetween the parties, between the bodies of the Congress, and briefly \nbetween the White House and the Congress. But never before, in an \neffort to get the size and scope of Washington under control, has it \nled to these negotiations at the Presidential and Speaker and majority \nleader level, for hours upon hours.\n  But if we do not get this done, I think all involved will pay a \nprice. We will see higher interest rates almost assuredly. I think the \nhead of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, has indicated that would probably be a \nresult. We would see more--more--ever-increasing Washington spending \nand Washington control.\n  Probably we would see a falling stock market. Just in the last 36 \nhours the stock market has tumbled more than 100 points; 67 points \nyesterday, 36 points this morning. And it was not because of the \nblizzard of 1996. It was because of their perception that maybe these \ntalks were not going to be agreed to, their concern that we were not \ngoing to control the rate of increase of Federal spending, and that we \nwere not going to have tax policies that would lead to economic growth \nand job creation. \n\n[[Page S132]]\n\n  The stock market is not something I profess to understand. But when \nit drops precipitously, I start saying, well, what could possibly be \nthe reason? I think most people would say they are worried now, that \nthis is troublesome news.\n  It is described as a recess. But is it really a recess or is it the \nbeginning of the end of the budget negotiations? And they are beginning \nto say, well, after weeks, months of believing and acting on the \nassumption that we were going to get a balanced budget agreement, and \nin fact tax cuts for individuals that deserve it--it is, after all, the \npeople's money that we are talking about allowing them to keep.\n  The idea now that these talks have taken at least a break is \ntroublesome. They are worried that we will not get these commitments \nagreed to that we worked on all year long. So I think we should be very \nconscious of that. I hope we will see a return to the negotiations, \nthat the President will move toward the majority's position in \nCongress.\n  I think we have been very responsible in the positions we have taken. \nIn fact, we have offered not one, not two, not three, but four budgets \nin effect, three since the one that passed the Congress. So there has \nbeen a significant shift to try to get the job done, but to do it in \nsuch a way that a bipartisan Congress could support it.\n  I hope that they will get back together and there will be additional \nimprovements in trying to control the Washington growth that we are \nbattling against. And failing in that, certainly we will look to the \nappropriation process to keep the Government operating, but to control \nspending as much as we can through that process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S131-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF THE WELFARE REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to say also in closing, Mr. President, that I, too, \nam very much concerned that the President vetoed the welfare reform \npackage. After talking a great deal about how we were going to end \nwelfare as we have known it, we have, in fact, not done it. He did veto \nthe bill last night. There has been suggestions that there are major \nproblems with this bill. But the Congress did add back some $10 billion \nfrom where the House position was to try to get a bill that the \nPresident could sign. It does have genuine reform.\n\n  There is complaint in effect from the minority leader that we are \ngiving States more authority. That has been one of our goals, to give \nmore flexibility to the States. As a matter of fact, States have been \ngetting waivers to have this flexibility.\n  So we need to get work back into welfare. We need genuine welfare \nreform. The President has vetoed this bill. I think it is a big \nmistake. But I think it is incumbent upon Congress that we immediately \nget back together to try to come up with a welfare reform that in fact \nsaves money, that does not spend more money, and that does retain the \nwork requirements that we have been committed to throughout the year.\n  I believe my time has expired. I yield the floor at this time, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S132-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF THE WELFARE REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I agree with my friend from Mississippi that \nthe recess probably will be important where we can, as the President \nsaid, take a deep breath, step back, and look at where we are.\n  Mr. President, we talk about the veto by the President of the United \nStates of the welfare reform bill. Well, I think the Democratic leader \nsaid very emphatically today that the 25-percent maintenance level \nwhere the Senate had voted 80 percent maintenance level by the State \nwas an important factor that was changed.\n  The President said when we passed the bill on welfare reform in the \nSenate that he would sign that bill. Well, I have been around here a \nfew years and usually when you cannot get together and you find \nsomething that can be signed and you are not too far apart, then I \nthink we can come back to the table and work it out.\n  Instead of putting all the blame on one place--the Democrats in the \nHouse, the Democrats in the Senate, the Republicans in the Senate, are \nall in favor of one item; and we wind up that there is a group in the \nHouse that will not let us move forward. So I think that becomes the \nstumbling block.\n  Even in the House an amendment was put on one of the bills where you \nwere sending the block grants back to the States that none of this \nmoney could be used by the States to build roads. That gives you some \nidea. I happened to have been a Governor when we got an avalanche of \nmoney. President Nixon pigeonholed the money after we overrode his \nveto. Then they went to court, and the court released 2 years of \nappropriations. We were the beneficiary of that.\n  I understand Federal money coming into States. I understand the \nmatching money. I understand what the States can or cannot do. I also \nunderstand the pressure on a Governor in a State by his constituents \nand what they would like to have him do.\n  We talk about big interstate highways. We call it, down in the \nStates, get-to-it roads. The interstates are fine, but if you cannot \nget to it, then you cannot ride on it. So they want us to build get-to-\nit roads. And so therefore there will be pressure to use this money to \nbuild get-to-it roads.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S132-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S132-S133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEMOCRATS WANT A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me just make two points. I think we have \nmaybe a couple minutes left. Two points. One, for the last 3 years the \ndeficit, under President Clinton, has been reduced by 50 percent. There \nwill be fewer Federal employees, 272,000 under that proposal that was \npassed and signed in 1993. And today, we have about 200,000 fewer \nemployees than there were 3 years ago.\n  There is no question to what the President and the Democrats have \nagreed to, that we want a balanced budget and, two, that it would be in \n7 years and, three, it would be certified by CBO.\n  The President has laid two budgets on the table, one, balance the \nbudget in 7 years, as certified by CBO. Last evening, the second was \nput on the table to balance the budget, approved by CBO. The only \ndifference here now is whether we give a huge tax cut or not.\n\n  My friend from Mississippi says that they have cut it to a $177 \nbillion tax cut. My figures are, when you put it together, that it is \n$203 billion they are still holding on to and clinging to, which would \nbe the tax cut they want to put in. If you look at the coalition in the \nHouse, they do not want to give any tax cut. It is zero. We hear a lot \nabout the Blue Dogs in the House. Their tax cut is zero. The bipartisan \ngroup's over here is somewhat higher. But there is $87 billion that the \nPresident has agreed to in tax cuts and $203 billion that the \nRepublicans want in tax cuts. We feel like this is not the time to give \nthe huge tax cuts, and that we ought to try to be compassionate and \ntake care of the elderly. We do not need to cut Medicare or increase \nthe premium on part B of Medicare. We do not need to increase the \ndeductible on part B in order to give the tax break.\n  Mr. President, the budget is not balanced under the Republican \nbalanced budget because if you look on page three of the reconciliation \nbill, it is $108.4 billion of money used from Social Security. I put \ninto the Record last week two things--one statutory and the other in \nthe law--relating to Social Security. You cannot use that money other \nthan what it is collected for.\n  So we have a lot to work on. But the work is only between $87 billion \nand $203 billion, and where you cut more or less and who gets the tax \nbreak. The hour of 1:50 has arrived.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have no further requests for time. All \ntime has expired under the agreement. We have some unanimous-consent \nrequests, and I believe the majority leader may want to come to the \nfloor and do that.\n  At this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. \n  \n[[Page S133]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, might I first indicate that my purpose \nin the next 10 or 15 minutes is to tell my colleagues, and to the \nextent possible the American public that might be watching, where I see \nthings in this recessed budget discussion. I want to be very frank. I \nam disappointed and somewhat let down that we have not come to an \nagreement. I do not fault anyone for dedicating time and effort. In \nmany respects, the time and effort spent in the White House is probably \nrather historic. I am not disappointed that that effort has taken place \nand that the President, Vice President, the leaders, Republican and \nDemocratic, of the Congress, have indeed spent a great deal of time, \neffort, and energy in what I presume and must state, at least as I view \nit, to be a serious effort to try to get the American people what they \nso desperately want, and that is a balanced budget in 7 years, which is \nreal, using Congressional Budget Office economics.\n  So it is an understatement to say that I am disappointed, but I also \ndo not know if we will be able to reach an agreement with the \nadministration. I choose to try very hard to state it as best I can \nfrom what I know.\n  It is quite possible, on the other hand, that working with \ncongressional Democrats from both the House and the Senate that we \ncould come to a proposal that would make fundamental reforms to Federal \nentitlement programs, make fundamental changes to Federal programs, \nredirect many of the programs out of Washington back to the States, and \nget a balanced budget in 7 years using the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates and economics. Maybe then the President and his \nadministration would take more seriously the proposals we have worked \nso hard for over 1 year to reduce to a document called the balanced \nbudget No. 1, which the President vetoed not so long ago.\n  I would like to make it very clear, yes, the President finally \nsubmitted a budget scored by the Congressional Budget Office before the \nblizzard began last Saturday night that mathematically got to balance. \nBut even some of the President's own people have admitted that that \nbudget was designed to meet the requirement of the continuing \nresolution, the targeted resolution, the continuing resolution to put \nall of Government back to work and which had as a condition of its \neffectiveness that the President submit for the very first time a \nbalanced budget using the Congressional Budget Office figures.\n  Let me repeat. That 1996 blizzard budget that the President \nsubmitted, many believe was given to the American people and to us so \nas to comply with the technical requirements, and that it was not the \nkind of budget the President could have expected we would accept. Even \nsome of the President's people have stated that it was designed to give \nus the requirements of that continuing resolution to reopen Government \non Monday.\n  The Washington Post criticized that blizzard budget as ``paper \nbalance.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Washington Post's \neditorial, a rather lengthy one, styled ``Paper Balance,'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 9, 1996]\n\n                             Paper Balance\n\n       The balanced budget plan that President Clinton submitted \n     Saturday night would achieve all kinds of things, but a \n     balanced budget is likely not among them. In submitting a \n     plan that on paper would balance the budget in seven years \n     using Congressional Budget Office economic and other \n     assumptions, the president met the condition set by \n     congressional Republicans for reopening the government. He \n     may have helped to move along the budget talks as well, and \n     the plan would largely protect the major forms of federal \n     assistance to the poor, an important goal.\n       That's the good news. The bad is that to get to balance \n     while achieving a string of other policy goals the plan \n     relies on gimmicks that almost no one believes would survive \n     and produce the deficit reduction claimed for them. It's true \n     that some of the same or similar gimmicks can also be found \n     in the Republican proposal to balance the budget. No doubt \n     the fact that they're gaming the issue in similar ways is a \n     comfort to both sides. It ought not comfort anyone else.\n       1. The president persists in giving a tax cut. His is \n     smaller and better targeted than the one the Republicans \n     propose. It nonetheless is more revenue than a government \n     looking at deficits approaching $1 trillion a presidential \n     term should forgo. To get to the promised balance by the year \n     2002 despite the tax cut, the president then pretends that \n     the cut will be allowed to lapse in the year 2000, and no \n     matter that that year, like this, happens to be an election \n     year. Once the cut lapses, even if only on paper, there isn't \n     any revenue loss to record--not for now, anyway. For now, you \n     tell the voters they can have it all--yes to a tax cut, yes \n     to a balanced budget but no to spending cuts in programs they \n     like. It will be up to someone else to tell them later--\n     always someone else and later--that the math can't be made to \n     come out that way.\n       2. Half the spending cuts in the president's plan would be \n     achieved by imposing tight caps on the part of the budget \n     subject to the annual appropriations process. It's a \n     wonderful way to cut spending, because once again the hard \n     decisions are deferred. You don't have to say which programs \n     or which constituencies you expect to bear the burden; that \n     will be up to the appropriators to decide as they apportion \n     the available funds year by year. For now, you just get a \n     free vote in favor of economy in the abstract. The vote is \n     all the easier because, in the president's plan as in the \n     Republicans', the caps are backloaded. Sixty percent of the \n     cuts would be deferred until the last two of the seven years, \n     after the turn of the century.\n       Assume that almost all the cuts would occur in domestic \n     appropriations as distinct from the military budget, which \n     the president has said he thinks should remain pretty much on \n     the current path. In real terms, this domestic total--the \n     operating budget for the entire domestic side of government--\n     would have to be cut about a third to stay beneath the cap in \n     the seventh year. Hardly anyone, least of all anyone in the \n     administration, thinks a cut of that magnitude is possible \n     without doing enormous damage to government services. The \n     president makes the math even more implausible by saying he \n     intends to protect the chunks of the budget having to do with \n     education, the environment and such that he particularly \n     supports. That means he would have to cut the balance all the \n     more. What will it be? Housing programs? Veterans programs? \n     Highway grants? The space program? You wait in vain for the \n     answer.\n       3. A lot of economists think that if the budget is \n     balanced, interest rates will ease, and that the lower rates \n     will stimulate greater economic growth. The government would \n     then reap a double dividend. Its own considerable interest \n     costs would go down and tax revenues, up. Call it a reward \n     for good behavior. The Republicans claimed the reward and \n     folded it into their budget estimates in advance. The \n     administration is doing the same thing on perhaps an even \n     weaker basis.\n       The Republican budget contains its own illusions. The tax \n     cuts the Republicans propose are heavily backloaded. They \n     were carefully designed to keep their full effect from being \n     felt until after the seven years for which, under the rules, \n     the budget estimates were made. From just the seventh year \n     through the 10th, the likely revenue loss from their \n     enactment would increase by 75 percent. You balance the \n     budget in the seventh year, then begin to unbalance it all \n     over again unless deeper spending cuts are made.\n       If the goal is to balance the budget, there ought not be a \n     tax cut. Not the modest one proposed by the president, and \n     surely not the Republican gusher, either. If the further goal \n     is to achieve a durable balance or near enough without \n     inflicting an undue burden on the poor, you have to go after \n     the major programs that benefit the middle class, in \n     particular the two great forms of aid to the elderly that \n     dominate the budget, Medicare and Social Security. The \n     Republicans proposed a restructuring of Medicare this year, a \n     mix of some good ideas and some bad, for both of which they \n     are being made to pay at the polls. The Democrats have \n     positioned themselves as protector of the program, and never \n     mind the pressure it puts on the rest of the budget and other \n     programs they also seek to protect. Neither party wants to \n     cut, or to be the first to propose cutting, Social Security, \n     even by limiting the cost-of-living increases in benefits for \n     a number of years.\n       As a partial alternative to going after these programs, the \n     president has now proposed cutting some of the tax breaks \n     that go under the label corporate welfare. But it isn't clear \n     how hard he will push for those in what is likely to be an \n     inhospitable Congress; he hasn't pushed much in the past. \n\n[[Page S134]]\n     Both parties now claim to want to neutralize the deficit. To do so \n     without also doing social harm, each has to abandon some \n     political reflexes, the Republicans above all on taxes, the \n     Democrats on Medicare. What we find out now is whether they \n     can or will.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe, as one of our Senators has indicated, since it \nwas a blizzard budget it should be categorized as ``snow job,'' \nbecause, although it gets to balance in 2002, only by raising taxes in \nthe last year and back-end loading 70 percent of the nonfreeze \ndiscretionary savings in that year could you get there. The plan made \nlittle or no fundamental changes to Medicare, which is going broke, and \nwhich many say we cannot afford in its current form; Medicaid, which is \ngrowing at 10.5 percent, and everyone says we cannot afford and must be \nreformed to save money and become more flexible at the State level.\n  It made no serious change to Federal welfare programs that had been \nsupported in the Congress in a bipartisan manner here on the Hill. \nIndeed, as we know today, the President has now even vetoed the welfare \nreform bill that we sent him before the holidays.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, so that those \nwho want at least my version of where we are, and I hope it is \nauthentic, a table that compares the President's blizzard budget of \nlast Saturday night compared to the Republican bipartisan plan which we \nsubmitted to the President. My best analysis of that is encapsuled in a \ntable which is called ``Comparison of Latest Offers.'' One is called \n``Clinton'' for the President. I am referring to that in these remarks \nas the blizzard budget. The bipartisan Republican budget is one that we \nmelded from various reforms that were supported by significant numbers \nof Democrats. Those who will take time to study this comparison will \ndiscover that the Republican bipartisan budget proposal attempts to \nfundamentally change entitlement programs by over $400 billion, over \nthe next 7 years, nearly $132 billion more than the President.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                COMPARISON OF LATEST OFFERS--JAN. 6, 1996               \n        [Seven-year total deficit impact, in billions of dollars]       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               Bipartisan/              \n                                    Clinton    Republican     Difference\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscretionary:                                                          \n  Freeze.........................      -258            -258  ...........\n  Additional.....................       -37             -91           54\n    Subtotal discretionary.......      -295            -349           54\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Medicare.......................      -102    -154 to -168     52 to 66\n  Medicaid.......................       -52             -85           33\n  Welfare programs...............       -39             -60           21\n  EITC...........................        -2             -15           13\n    Subtotal.....................      -195    -314 to -328   119 to 133\n  Other mandatory................       -69             -69  ...........\n    Subtotal mandatory...........      -264    -383 to -397   119 to 133\nRevenues.........................        24             177         -153\nCPI assumption...................       -17             -17  ...........\nDebt service.....................       -57             -60            3\n    Total deficit reduction......      -609    -651 to -665     42 to 56\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Revenue reduction shown as positive because it increases the     \n  deficit.                                                              \n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, the Republican, GOP balanced budget versus the \nbudget that we offered, that we call bipartisan--when you do that you \nget an explanation of how far we came in what we offered--and let me \njust describe those changes. They are as follows.\n  From $226 billion savings in Medicare over 7 years, we proposed \nMedicare, Mr. President, between $154 and $168 billion. These are \nnumbers endorsed by bipartisan groups in both the House and the Senate; \nfrom $226 to $154 and $168 billion as the parameters for a new program.\n  Let me say, parenthetically, if you choose to do those reforms, which \nare substantially less, $60 billion less at the minimum, you can get \nthere as far as the premiums to seniors with the premiums never going \nup beyond the $77 that the President recommended many, many months ago. \nSo, while the Republicans moved nearly $60 billion lower in Medicare, \nthe President, by his own numbers in the blizzard budget, reduced \nMedicare savings instead of increasing them, reduced the savings from \n$124 billion, which the President had heretofore said, in June, to $102 \nbillion.\n  I understand that late yesterday there may have been some adjustments \nto that number. I did not get them in their final form. But I gather, \nif anything, Medicare was returned to its $124 billion level which is a \nlevel that is 6\\1/2\\ months old. So, in neither case did much happen \nthere: While we came a low of $60 billion down, nothing happened in the \nblizzard budget, or the supplement to it, which I do not have in its \nfinal form.\n  Those who understand the budget know that we cannot achieve real \nbalance unless we address these programs that make up over 50 percent \nof total spending in the Government. And these are the programs that we \ncall mandatory, or entitlements. And, in the comparison chart that I \nhad printed in the Record, I have taken the four that we have not been \nable to agree upon--Medicare, Medicaid, welfare programs, and I choose \nto put the earned income tax credit in it--the difference between the \nClinton proposal and the bipartisan proposal is shown in this box, and \nit is a rather enormous number: $195 billion in savings versus \nsomewhere between $314 and $328 billion.\n  Therein lies the major problem in getting a budget that is not \nmathematical--as alluded to by the Washington Post--but, rather, \nsubstantively alters the course of spending in programs that are \nincreasing the most rapidly in the Federal Government, three of which \ngrow at more than 10 percent a year, not sustainable with a gross \ndomestic product growth of 2\\1/2\\ percent. That means the difference in \njust those programs is between $119 and $133 billion in savings.\n  Fortunately, there are some other entitlement programs that we seem \nto get close to agreement on. They are also shown in my comparison and \nthey are the rest of the entitlements. And we are close enough to say \nthat somewhere between $66 and $69 billion is where we are. And that is \na significant achievement.\n  Let me close by speaking for a moment about the tax reductions. \nRepublicans have also significantly and substantially reduced their \nproposal on tax cuts while protecting and insisting on protection for \nthe family tax credit and a capital gains program which has a serious \npositive effect on long-term economic growth. While protecting those, \nwe have dropped our tax reductions by $50 billion from the package that \nthe President vetoed. That, too, is shown on the comparison chart which \nI will have printed in the Record for those interested in seeing \nprecisely what is going on.\n  I believe that the bipartisan GOP proposal which I have been \ndiscussing, which has reforms encapsulated in the entitlement changes--\nthat is, returning more of the moneys to the States with flexibility in \nboth welfare and Medicaid--envisioned that the Governors of America \nwill work on those programs with us. So that in saving the money we \nplan to save, we give them the discretion they need to get the job done \nbetter and cheaper. Yet, we are willing to have those Governors work on \ntrying to make certain that some of the people have guarantees of \ncoverage and perhaps even to change the way we have funded the Medicaid \nblock grant in terms of what States are entitled to in the event of \ndisasters economically speaking, or natural, and what they might be \nentitled to in the event there is sustained caseload growth in their \nState.\n  Obviously, we have also said that, if this tax cut in the final year \nor two--that is, the Republican plan to give middle-income Americans a \nchild tax credit which essentially in its basic form means that a \nfamily raising children in America gets a $500 tax break for each \nchild--we believe that should be the cornerstone I repeat, along with \ncapital gains, which I have just described. But we also have said in \nthe event when you put all these reforms and expenditures down on paper \nand get them costed out by the Congressional Budget Office, if you do \nnot meet the targets of balance in the last year, some portion of the \ntax cut can be sunsetted in the last year or two as stated by Speaker \nNewt Gingrich heretofore, and Chairman John Kasich yesterday at a press \nconference.\n  I repeat that I am very hopeful that the President of the United \nStates with his Democratic allies will submit an offer, a new offer \nthat comes in the direction that I have been discussing today of more \nsignificant savings from entitlement reforms, the four that I have \ndescribed: Earned income tax credit, welfare reform, Medicaid reform, \nMedicare for the solvency of the fund for a very long period of time, \nand an adjustment in the premiums to meet the needs of our times. \n\n[[Page S135]]\n\n  My view is that the staff can do some work in the next few days. I am \nhopeful that we can reach some kind of accord on that. But I do believe \nit is fairest to categorize the status of the discussions as anxiously \nawaiting a new offer from the President.\n  Perhaps as my last chart, I would put a composite in the Record that \nI choose to call how far we have moved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         HOW FAR HAVE WE MOVED?                         \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Balanced                      \n                                           budget     Latest            \n                                            act:    GOP offer   Movement\n                                           vetoed                       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscretionary..........................        409        349        -60\nMedicare...............................        226    154-168        -72\nMedicaid...............................        133         85        -48\nWelfare................................         64         60         -4\nRevenues...............................        222        177        -45\n                                        --------------------------------\n    Total deficit reduction............        750        651        -99\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in the first chart I have the Balanced \nBudget Act that was vetoed. In the second column, Mr. President, I have \nthe latest Republican bipartisan offer. And in the last column I have \nthe difference. How far have we come?\n  In discretionary, we have agreed over 7 years to go from $409 billion \nto $349 billion; $60 billion additional discretionary.\n  Let me say right now that there is no longer any reason for the \nPresident of the United States to say we need a budget that meets the \nvalues of the American people. That does not. That takes care of \neducation and takes care of environmental needs. It is obvious to \neveryone that that $60 billion that we have agreed to add more than \ncovers those two and any other priority discretionary programs the \nPresident has been alluding to. Point No. 1. We went $60 billion their \nway.\n  Medicare--we went $72 billion their way from $226 billion to a range \nof $154 to $168 billion. Take the lower of the higher of them, and it \nis $72 billion their way.\n  Medicaid--from $133 billion in expected reform savings to $85 \nbillion; $48 billion their way.\n  Welfare--from $64 billion to $60 billion; $4 billion their way. And \nthe reason that is not a bigger number and need not be is because the \nU.S. Senate passed a bill with 87 votes. We are basing this principally \nupon that welfare reform measure. That one may require a couple of \nbillion dollars additional perhaps for child care, or more workfare \naid.\n  Last, on revenues from $122 billion to $177 billion, a $45 billion \nmovement in their direction.\n  Frankly, I think anyone who will look at the two charts--How far have \nwe moved?--and the comparison that I have alluded to of latest offers \ndated January 6, 1996, should have a pretty good picture of Republican \nnegotiators led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, Congressman Dick Armey, and \nmajority leader Bob Dole on our side. We have made significant movement \nyet holding to the basic principles which I believe are about fourfold.\n  First, a significant tax break for working income-producing Americans \nwho have children.\n  A capital gains tax to stimulate the economy, No. 1.\n  A reform of welfare as we know it turning it to workfare with a time \nlimit of 5 years imposed on those who use it rather than a lifetime \nwelfare program.\n  Third, a serious and dedicated effort to make Medicare work without \nit having to grow at 10\\1/2\\ percent a year. Most medical costs are \ngoing down. Our programs of Medicare and Medicaid--because we run them \nas a country, as a Government--continue upward.\n  So our third principle is returning that program with some \nflexibility to the States and saving money, yet building in some kind \nof guarantee which we think the bipartisan Governors can accomplish.\n  Our last point is that we believe Medicare ought to be made solvent \nas to the hospital portion--not for 7 or 8 years but hopefully for \nlonger than that. And in that we must have reforms which permit the \nseniors of America to stay where they are in the current program, or \nchoose other programs which will save money and provide them a \ndifferent kind of coverage, whether it is HMO's, managed care, new \nprofessional service organization delivery systems, or whether it is \nmajor medical coverage with savings accounts. We need to reform the \nsystem so that it complies with the needs and delivery systems of \ntoday.\n  Why should we shortchange seniors and keep them tied to one kind of \npolicy of coverage when all Americans have many other choices?\n  That is our fourth.\n  And in doing that we believe we will have reshaped Government \nsignificantly. But ultimately, so there is no mistake about it, we \nbelieve we will have made a significant positive decision regarding \ninterest rates in the future; jobs of the future, they will be better.\n\n  Instead of being locked in stagnation, there is a real chance that a \nbalanced budget will turn loose the energy of the marketplace so jobs \ncan increase, so that we are not the generation that says for the first \ntime that the next generation lives more poorly than we did. We want \nthem to have more opportunity. The balanced budget has a chance to do \nthat.\n  Interest is on everything imaginable, from college tuition to your \n1st home or your 2d home, your 1st car or your 10th car. The interest \nrate is a burden. If it comes down dramatically, everybody gains, \nbusinesses flourish because it does not cost them as much to do \nbusiness.\n  So the big principles I have enumerated and the big effect is a \nbetter life for our children, getting rid of the legacy that we leave \nthem now, which is, ``you pay our bills,'' to a legacy of ``we pay our \nbills. You save your money for what you need. You don't pay your hard-\nearned money for what you didn't choose to pay for by way of programs \nwe give to the American people that we cannot afford.''\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for this time. I yield the floor \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S133-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S135-S136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SPECTRUM: A NATIONAL RESOURCE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, balancing the budget is all about sacrifice. \nTo paraphrase Webster's Dictionary, that means surrendering things we \nprize for a higher purpose. Sacrifice is also about fairness. We call \nthis share, and share alike.\n  It makes no sense to me then that Congress would create a giant \ncorporate welfare program when we are reforming welfare for those \ntrapped in a failed system. But, that is exactly what would happen if \nwe pass telecommunications reform in it current form.\n  No doubt about it, balancing the budget the passing \ntelecommunications reform will ensure America's place as the world's \nundisputed economic leader. They are both bills that look to the \nfuture, not to the past.\n\n\n                           TELECOM GIVE-AWAY\n\n  With that said, however, I question whether telecommunications reform \nis worth the television broadcaster's asking price. The \ntelecommunications conference report gives spectrum, or air waves, to \ntelevision broadcasters that the Congressional Budget Office has valued \nat $12.5 billion. Many say that figure is low, including the Federal \nCommunications Commission which believes it is worth almost $40 \nbillion. That is $40 billion with a ``B.'' Other estimates run even \nhigher, up to $70 billion and beyond.\n  The bottom line is that spectrum is just as much a national resource \nas our Nation's forests. That means it belongs to every American \nequally. No more, no less.\n  If someone wants to use our resources, then we should be fairly \ncompensated.\n  The broadcasters say they need this extra spectrum to preserve so-\ncalled free, over-the-air broadcast and are just borrowing the spectrum \nand will eventually give it back. The problem is the telecom conference \nreport is vague and there is no guarantee that America \n\n[[Page S136]]\nwill ever get this valuable resource back.\n  Even if a guarantee can be secured, the report language still would \nnot fairly compensate taxpayers for lending this resource to the \nbroadcasters. From a technical standpoint, when the broadcasters \ntransition from an analog to the more efficient digital signal, they \ncan pump our several new TV stations. In short, broadcasters will trade \ntheir existing one station for an many as five stations. I am told the \nFCC believes the number can reach as high as 12 stations.\n  Interestingly enough, the broadcasters secured language in the \ntelecom bill that would exempt them from paying fees for any of these \nnew broadcast stations so long as they are supported by advertising \ndollars. Let me get this straight. America lends the broadcasters a \nnational resource so they can increase their profit margins, but they \ndo not think its fair to pay rent.\n  Mr. President, at a time when we are asking all Americans to \nsacrifice and we are all trying to balance the budget--I just heard the \nchairman of the Budget Committee speak Senator Domenici; the American \npeople want us to balance the budget--it does not make any sense to \ngive away billions of dollars to corporate interests and succumb to \ntheir intense media lobbying effort.\n\n\n                           COST TO CONSUMERS\n\n  This policy will also cost consumers billions of their own dollars. \nFederally mandating a transition to digital broadcast will ultimately \nrender all television sets in the country obsolete. Consumers will be \nforced to either buy new television sets or convertor boxes to receive \nfree, over-the-air broadcasts.\n  The impact will be dramatic. There are 222 million television sets in \nthe country. The average digital television set's estimated cost is \n$850, while the less expensive convertor box will cost about $100. \nReplacing every television set with a digital one would cost $189 \nbillion. Using the less expensive convertor box would cost $22 billion. \nNo doubt about it, consumers won't be happy that Congress made this \nchoice for them.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Mr. President, in closing, I wish to inform the Senate that while I \nwant to work with those who put together, I think, a good \ntelecommunications bill in many respects, I know there are some Members \nin the House who have some reservations about parts of it and there are \nsome Members in the Senate who have reservations about parts of it. I \ndo think we should resolve this spectrum issue before the bill is \nconsidered.\n  It is going to be very difficult, when we are looking at Medicaid, \nlooking at Medicare, looking at farm programs, looking at welfare, all \ntrying to save money here and money there, that we would at the same \ntime say, oh, that is OK because these are big media interests, we will \ngive it away, whether there is $12.5 or $40 billion, whatever it may \nbe.\n  The telecommunications conference committee is still open, so we \nstill have the opportunity to appropriately address this spectrum \nissue. I hope that we will. I would like to see it resolved before we \nbring this bill up. I know the chairman, Senator Pressler, has done an \noutstanding job. It is a very difficult task. The Presiding Officer is \na member of that committee. It is a very important bill, probably the \nmost important bill we will consider this year in 1996. But let us, for \nthe sake of the taxpayers and for the sake of the American consumers, \nfix this one corporate welfare provision before we ask Members to vote \non it.\n  Mr. President, the Democratic leader will be here in a moment or two. \nI will just go ahead and do these unanimous-consent requests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S135-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S136-S167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PUBLIC HOUSING REFORM AND EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, \n     safe, and affordable housing;\n       (2) the inventory of public housing units owned and \n     operated by public housing agencies, an asset in which the \n     Federal Government has invested approximately \n     $90,000,000,000, has traditionally provided rental housing \n     that is affordable to low-income persons;\n       (3) despite serving this critical function, the public \n     housing system is plagued by a series of problems, including \n     the concentration of very poor people in very poor \n     neighborhoods and disincentives for economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (4) the Federal method of overseeing every aspect of public \n     housing by detailed and complex statutes and regulations \n     aggravates the problem and places excessive administrative \n     burdens on public housing agencies;\n       (5) the interests of low-income persons, and the public \n     interest, will best be served by a reformed public housing \n     program that--\n       (A) consolidates many public housing programs into programs \n     for the operation and capital needs of public housing;\n       (B) streamlines program requirements;\n       (C) vests in public housing agencies that perform well the \n     maximum feasible authority, discretion, and control with \n     appropriate accountability to both public housing tenants and \n     localities; and\n       (D) rewards employment and economic self-sufficiency of \n     public housing tenants;\n       (6) voucher and certificate programs under section 8 of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937 are successful for \n     approximately 80 percent of applicants, and a consolidation \n     of the voucher and certificate programs into a single, \n     market-driven program will assist in making section 8 tenant-\n     based assistance more successful in assisting low-income \n     families in obtaining affordable housing and will increase \n     housing choice for low-income families; and\n       (7) the needs of Indian families residing on Indian \n     reservations and other Indian areas will \n\n[[Page S137]]\n     best be served by providing programs specifically designed to meet the \n     needs of Indian communities while promoting tribal self-\n     governance and self-determination.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to consolidate the various programs and activities \n     under the public housing programs administered by the \n     Secretary in a manner designed to reduce Federal \n     overregulation;\n       (2) to redirect the responsibility for a consolidated \n     program to States, Indian tribes, localities, public housing \n     agencies, and public housing tenants;\n       (3) to require Federal action to overcome problems of \n     public housing agencies with severe management deficiencies; \n     and\n       (4) to consolidate and streamline tenant-based assistance \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the following definitions shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Public housing agency.--The term ``public housing \n     agency'' has the same meaning as in section 3 of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Act or \n     the amendments made by this Act, this Act and the amendments \n     made by this Act shall become effective on the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. PROPOSED REGULATIONS; TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n       (a) Proposed Regulations.--Not later than 9 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit \n     to the Congress proposed regulations that the Secretary \n     determines are necessary to carry out the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937, as amended by this Act.\n       (b) Technical Recommendations.--Not later than 9 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking and \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives, \n     recommended technical and conforming legislative changes \n     necessary to carry out this Act and the amendments made by \n     this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6. ELIMINATION OF OBSOLETE DOCUMENTS.\n\n       Effective 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     no rule, regulation, or order (including all handbooks, \n     notices, and related requirements) pertaining to public \n     housing or section 8 tenant-based programs issued or \n     promulgated under the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n     before the date of enactment of this Act may be enforced by \n     the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 7. ANNUAL REPORTS.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a \n     report to the Congress on the impact of the amendments made \n     by this Act on--\n       (1) the demographics of public housing tenants and families \n     receiving tenant-based assistance under the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937; and\n       (2) the economic viability of public housing agencies.\n                   TITLE I--PUBLIC AND INDIAN HOUSING\n\n     SEC. 101.

ELIGIBILITY FOR PUBLIC AND ASSISTED HOUSING.\n\n       Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of \n     1980 (42 U.S.C. 1436a) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b), by inserting before the period at \n     the end the following: ``and includes any other assistance \n     provided under the United States Housing Act of 1937'';\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(h) Verification of Eligibility.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except in the case of an election under \n     paragraph (2)(A), no individual or family applying for \n     financial assistance may receive such financial assistance \n     prior to the affirmative establishment and verification of \n     eligibility of that individual or family under this section \n     by the Secretary or other appropriate entity.\n       ``(2) Rules applicable to public housing agencies.--A \n     public housing agency (as that term is defined in section 3 \n     of the United States Housing Act of 1937)--\n       ``(A) may elect not to comply with this section; and\n       ``(B) in complying with this section--\n       ``(i) may initiate procedures to affirmatively establish or \n     verify the eligibility of an individual or family under this \n     section at any time at which the public housing agency \n     determines that such eligibility is in question, regardless \n     of whether or not that individual or family is at or near the \n     top of the waiting list of the public housing agency;\n       ``(ii) may affirmatively establish or verify the \n     eligibility of an individual or family under this section in \n     accordance with the procedures set forth in section \n     274A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; and\n       ``(iii) shall have access to any relevant information \n     contained in the SAVE system (or any successor thereto) that \n     relates to any individual or family applying for financial \n     assistance.\n       ``(3) Eligibility of families.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, with respect to a family, the term `eligibility' \n     means the eligibility of each family member.''.\n       Amend the table of contents accordingly.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3117) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1260, the \nPublic Housing Reform and Empowerment Act of 1995. S. 1260 represents a \nmajor revision of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 to reform and \nconsolidate the public and assisted housing programs of the United \nStates and redirect primary responsibility for those programs away from \nFederal bureaucracy toward the States and localities. This bill \nrepresents an important first step toward a complete overhaul of \nFederal housing programs to address the needs of low-income families \nmore efficiently and effectively.\n  This legislation addresses a growing crisis in the Nation's public \nhousing system. Over the years, micro management by both Congress and \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] have saddled \nhousing authorities with rules and regulations that make it difficult \nfor even the best of them to operate efficiently and effectively. Even \nmore important has been the destructive impact these rules have had on \nthe ability of families to move up and out of public housing and become \neconomically self-sufficient. In far too many places, public housing, \nwhich was intended to provide a housing platform from which lower \nincome families could achieve their own aspirations of economic \nindependence, have become warehouses of poverty that rob poor families \nof their hope and dignity.\n  Compounding the structural problems of public housing are the dual \nconcerns of budget and HUD capacity. Public housing agencies are facing \na significant decline in Federal resources. Given these limited \nresources, housing authorities need the increased flexibility to use \ntheir funds in a manner that helps to maintain decent, safe, and \naffordable housing for their residents. In addition, HUD itself \npotentially faces a significant reduction in overall staffing over the \nnext 5 years. The prospect of diminishing staff resources means that \nHUD will lack the capacity to maintain the same degree of oversight and \ncontrol that it has exercised over the public housing system in recent \ndecades.\n  S. 1260 addresses the crisis in public housing by consolidating \npublic housing funding into two flexible block grants and transferring \ngreater responsibility over the operation and management of public \nhousing from HUD to local housing agencies. In addition, it creates a \nnew streamlined voucher program that is more market-friendly and \nprovides greater housing choices for low-income families.\n  The bill also ends Federal requirements that have prevented housing \nauthorities from demolishing their obsolete housing stock, concentrated \nand isolated the poorest of poor, and created disincentives for public \nhousing residents to work and improve their lives.\n\n  While allowing well-run housing authorities much more discretion, S. \n1260 also cracks down on those housing authorities that are troubled. \nAlthough small in number, these authorities with severe management \nproblems control almost 15 percent of the Nation's public housing \nstock. HUD would be required to take over or appoint a receiver for \nhousing authorities that are unable to make significant improvements in \ntheir operations. The legislation would also give HUD expanded powers \nto break up or reconfigure troubled authorities, dispose of their \nassets, or abrogate contracts that impede correction of the housing \nauthority's problems.\n  I would like to express my deep appreciation to Senators D'Amato and \nBond, who cosponsored this bill, for their keen interest and active \nsupport of this legislation. I also wish to express my appreciation for \nthe cooperation and support from Senators Sarbanes and Kerry. This bill \ntruly reflects bipartisan cooperation, and it specifically addresses \nmany of the concerns that have been raised by the minority. Finally, I \nalso want to thank Secretary Cisneros for HUD's participation in the \ndevelopment of this bill. We have endeavored to accommodate the \nDepartment's concerns to the greatest extent possible.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I support S. 1260. I do not object to \nthe unanimous-consent request to take up S. 1260.\n  In my opinion, the only glaring omission from this bill is that we do \nnot address the future of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  However, in consultation with Chairman D'Amato and Senator Mack, they \nhave both agreed to request in writing a study from both the GAO and \nCongressional Budget Office as to the most efficient method for \neliminating HUD.\n  I am pleased with this result. I think this advances this issue much \nfurther. I have already introduced legislation with Senator Dole, S. \n1145, to eliminate HUD. Next year, this Congress needs to take up the \nissue of HUD's very existence. Armed with these studies from both CBO \nand GAO, I think we get closer to accomplishing the elimination of HUD.\n  HUD was created in 1965. When it was created, the purpose of this \nDepartment was to revitalize our urban areas and provide safe, decent \nhousing for all Americans.\n  I think HUD has been a failure. Since 1965, HUD has spent hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. Yet despite this massive spending, I do not think \nthe American people are any better off.\n  HUD is a massive bureaucracy with over 11,000 employees, and over 240 \nhousing programs--so many that the Secretary of HUD did not even know \nHUD had that many. HUD has over $192 billion in unused budget \nauthority. HUD has even entangled the American taxpayer in 23,000 long-\nterm contracts that run until the year 2020.\n  HUD's spending is increasing so rapidly that by the year 2000, \nhousing assistance will be the largest discretionary spending function \nin our budget.\n  Knowing all of this, I do not see how the United States can afford \nnot to abolish HUD. I have often said that if one wanted to provide \nhousing assistance to 4 million families, would anyone design the \ncurrent HUD as the method to do so? Certainly the answer is no.\n  Again, let me thank Senators D'Amato and Mack. I hope that this study \nis the beginning by which we can reshape Federal housing policies and \nend HUD as a Cabinet agency.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment, as amended, be agreed to, \n\n[[Page S152]]\nthe bill be deemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, \n     safe, and affordable housing;\n       (2) the inventory of public housing units owned and \n     operated by public housing agencies, an asset in which the \n     Federal Government has invested approximately \n     $90,000,000,000, has traditionally provided rental housing \n     that is affordable to low-income persons;\n       (3) despite serving this critical function, the public \n     housing system is plagued by a series of problems, including \n     the concentration of very poor people in very poor \n     neighborhoods and disincentives for economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (4) the Federal method of overseeing every aspect of public \n     housing by detailed and complex statutes and regulations \n     aggravates the problem and places excessive administrative \n     burdens on public housing agencies;\n       (5) the interests of low-income persons, and the public \n     interest, will best be served by a reformed public housing \n     program that--\n       (A) consolidates many public housing programs into programs \n     for the operation and capital needs of public housing;\n       (B) streamlines program requirements;\n       (C) vests in public housing agencies that perform well the \n     maximum feasible authority, discretion, and control with \n     appropriate accountability to both public housing tenants and \n     localities; and\n       (D) rewards employment and economic self-sufficiency of \n     public housing tenants;\n       (6) voucher and certificate programs under section 8 of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937 are successful for \n     approximately 80 percent of applicants, and a consolidation \n     of the voucher and certificate programs into a single, \n     market-driven program will assist in making section 8 tenant-\n     based assistance more successful in assisting low-income \n     families in obtaining affordable housing and will increase \n     housing choice for low-income families; and\n       (7) the needs of Indian families residing on Indian \n     reservations and other Indian areas will best be served by \n     providing programs specifically designed to meet the needs of \n     Indian communities while promoting tribal self-governance and \n     self-determination.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to consolidate the various programs and activities \n     under the public housing programs administered by the \n     Secretary in a manner designed to reduce Federal \n     overregulation;\n       (2) to redirect the responsibility for a consolidated \n     program to States, Indian tribes, localities, public housing \n     agencies, and public housing tenants;\n       (3) to require Federal action to overcome problems of \n     public housing agencies with severe management deficiencies; \n     and\n       (4) to consolidate and streamline tenant-based assistance \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the following definitions shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Public housing agency.--The term ``public housing \n     agency'' has the same meaning as in section 3 of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a \nremarkable man who is retiring have after a career of leadership and \npublic service spanning 38 years. Milton Feldstein has been a leader in \nair pollution control since the l950's, well prior to national \nconsciousness about this issue and passage of the Clean Air Act.\n  He began work at what is now the San Francisco Bay area air quality \nmanagement district in the late 1950's and published several papers \nwhich led to the first industrial controls on smoke in the San \nFrancisco Bay area in l960. He became director of technical services in \nl961, deputy air pollution control officer in l973, and rose to the top \nposition of air pollution control officer in l979, in which he has \nserved ever since. During the course of his tenure he has authored more \nthan 80 papers on analytical methodology and air pollution control \ntechniques.\n  Milton Feldstein has repeatedly developed innovative comprehensive \nand workable air pollution control strategies that have successfully \nreduced air pollution emissions in the bay area and which have served \nas models for improving air quality throughout the State of California, \nthe Nation, and in other countries.\n  Throughout his career, he has always had as his primary focus the \nprotection of the health of the 6 million-plus people of the San \nFrancisco Bay area. In l995 the bay area became the largest \nmetropolitan area in the Nation to attain the national air quality \nstandard for ground-level ozone, complying with all Federal standards. \nThe air quality improvement resulting in attainment of such a standard \nis particularly significant considering the fact that population and \nmotor vehicles have doubled as the air has become cleaner.\n  Milton Feldstein has made a truly national contribution to the cause \nof environmental protection during his almost 40-year career as an air \npollution control pioneer. He represents the best in public service and \ndeserves to be congratulated and recognized for his achievements which \nhave provided a better environment for millions of people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S168-5", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S168-S169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JANUARY 22, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \nrollcall votes are not expected to occur during Monday's session of the \nSenate. The Senate could, however, turn to any Executive Calendar items \ncleared for action. I must also remind everybody that I think it is the \n26th when the present continuing resolution expires. So we will need to \ntake action on that before the expiration date. Hopefully, we can do \nthat by agreement and not require a rollcall vote. If that can be done, \nI do not anticipate any rollcall votes the week of the 22d.\n  If there should be some change, we will try to notify our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle and give them at least 24 hours notice, if \npossible. I will put that caveat in there, ``if possible.'' I hope it \nwill not be necessary.\n  Mr. President, let me just indicate this before we adjourn. As I \nunderstand it, next Wednesday there may be additional talks at the \nWhite House between myself, the Democratic leader, the leaders on the \nHouse side, and the President, with reference to a balanced budget. I \nthink between now and then our attitudes should be positive. We should \nbe trying to find ways to come together. Maybe we can, maybe we cannot. \nThere are fundamental differences, and it is not just about numbers. \nBut can we reach an agreement? I do not know. Is it doubtful? Probably. \nIs it possible? Yes.\n  So there are still differences. In my view, we have had a slight \nnarrowing of the differences. We are talking about a difference in \npolicy, not just in numbers on the blackboard or on charts. So we will \nsee what happens this next week. I know that some of the staff will be \nmeeting with the Chief of Staff, Mr. Panetta, or his designees, and \nperhaps by next Wednesday, there will be some coming together, or maybe \nnext Wednesday we will decide that there is no need to proceed further.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/10/senate-section/article/S169-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 22, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
