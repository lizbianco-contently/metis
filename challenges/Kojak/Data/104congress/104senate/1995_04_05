Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise today \nto pay tribute to Mr. Mack Fleming, who has recently retired as \nminority staff director of the Veterans' Affairs Committee of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, after more than 20 years of service on the \ncommittee.\n  A native of Hartwell, GA, Mr. Fleming was educated in the public \nschools of Anderson County, SC. He graduated from my alma mater, \nClemson University, Clemson, SC, after which he entered the U.S. Army. \nHe also earned a law degree from the Washington College of Law, \nAmerican University, Washington, DC.\n  In the military, he served with the 2d Armored Division in Europe and \nhe was a captain in the U.S. Army Reserve.\n  Mr. Fleming has a long and distinguished career in public service, \nboth in the Congress and the executive branch. He began that career in \n1960 as the administrative assistant to Congressman William Jennings \nBryan Dorn, of the Third Congressional District of South Carolina.\n  In 1965, Mack Fleming moved to the executive branch, first as the \ndirector and counsel of the Congressional Liaison Office at the \nVeterans Administration, then served as Special Assistant to the \nAdministrator of Veterans Affairs.\n  After a short interval, during which he was engaged in the private \npractice of law, Mr. Fleming returned to Capitol \n[[Page S5162]] Hill in 1974 as chief counsel to the House Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. In 1981, ``Mack,'' as he is known among his friends \nand colleagues, became chief counsel and staff director of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, where he served through the 103d Congress. \nFor the past 3 months he has served as the minority staff director of \nthe committee, retiring from that position last Friday, March 31, 1995.\n  During his tenure, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee worked in a \nbipartisan manner to improve the medical care, compensation, and other \nbenefits to our Nations' deserving veterans. Mack Fleming earned the \nrespect of Members of Congress and staff because of his \nprofessionalism, knowledge, and ability. He worked with all sides on \nthe issues, to ensure that all views were heard and to build consensus \nwhere possible.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I appreciated \nMack's expertise, experience, and skill as we worked together on many \nissues. The Congress benefited from his service and his leadership, and \nI know he will be missed.\n  I congratulate this fine public servant, a man of integrity, \ncapability, and character. I extend my best wishes to his wife, \nElizabeth, and their children--John, who attends Clemson University, \nand Katherine, who practices law in Texas. I wish him well in his \nretirement, as he and his wife return to Seneca, SC, where I am sure \nthey will enjoy the views, recreation, and quieter life on the shores \nof Lake Keowee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5161-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I listened to the statement made by the \nSenators from New Mexico and South Dakota and others about character. I \ndo not know all the aspects of this resolution, I just know some of the \nthings I have heard here on the floor, but I kept hearing reference \nmade to values and we have to start teaching values to our young \npeople.\n  I agree with that. I think our young people ought to learn values. \nBut, you know, perhaps we ought to look at ourselves first as teachers. \nPerhaps we ought to start looking at the Congress of the United States. \nWhat values are we sending out to the American people? What are the \nyoung people of America--what kind of values are they getting from the \nU.S. Government? That is what I want to speak about this morning, the \nContract With America. Its 100 days are up this week, and I want to \ntalk about that Contract With America.\n  Now, I think I want to talk about it in the context of values and \ncharacter, because the values that are being sent across America from \nthe Government of the United States is simply this: If you have it made \nand you have a lot of money, the Government is there to help you and \nmake you more comfortable. If you do not and you are at the bottom rung \nof the ladder, forget it. You are out in the cold.\n  Values? You want to talk about a resolution dealing with values? Let \nus talk about the Contract With America and what values it represents. \nWith any contract you have to ask, who benefits and who loses? Who wins \nand who loses on a contract? The answer now is crystal clear. The \nwinners are the billionaires, the super wealthy, the special interest \nWashington lobbyists. They get the credit card. They have the night out \non the town. They go to the fancy restaurant. The losers are the hard-\nworking middle-class, children, students, pregnant women, the elderly, \nthe disabled. They get to pick up the bill for the superwealthy. I know \nthat may sound like rhetoric, but the facts are there. Let us look at \nit. Let us not just get caught up in rhetoric, let us look at the \nfacts.\n  Here is a chart that we had drawn just to show what is happening in \nmy State of Iowa under the Contract With America, Mr. Gingrich's \ncontract, the Republicans' contract. Here we are. Two percent of the \nIowa population has an income of $100,000 or more. They get 50 percent \nof the benefits under the contract. And 86 percent of Iowans have \nincomes of $50,000 or less. They only get 20 percent of the benefits.\n  One more time. If you are in the upper income bracket, 2 percent of \nthe Iowans making over $100,000 a year, you get 50 percent of all the \nbenefits in the Contract With America. If you are a hard-working, \naverage Iowan making less than $50,000, you will only get 20 percent of \nthe benefits.\n  Values? You want to talk about values? Let us talk about values. That \nis the message that is being sent out around America today: If you are \non the top of the heap, the Government is there to help you and make \nyou even more comfortable, give you more tax breaks. You want to talk \nabout values, let us talk about values.\n  Then we just had a recent example of really giving it to the \nsuperwealthy, the so-called Benedict Arnold amendment. Senator Bradley \ntried to close a loophole in the law. The House would not hear of it \nand they knocked it out. We heard a lot of debate on the floor about \nthat last week. Imagine this, what the House Republican leadership has \nsaid is that if you make a billion dollars in America and you get all \nthese capital assets and then you renounce your citizenship, you get a \nbig tax windfall. You do not have to pay a lot of these taxes. You can \nstill live in America 4 months out of the year, you can live on the \nFrench Riviera 4 months out of the year, you can live in South America \n4 months out of the year, you can jet all around the year but you do \nnot have to pay your taxes and you can still own your property and \nstuff in America. That is why I call it the Benedict Arnold approach, \nthe Benedict Arnold amendment. You can turn your back on the country \nthat made you rich.\n  What the Contract With America says is, hey, we are going to give you \na big tax break, the Benedict Arnold approach. The middle class has to \npick it up.\n  Students. What is happening with students? Under the Contract With \nAmerica, 94,000 students will pay more for their college loans. That is \na tax on students. No one is talking about it. We are taxing students \nin America as much as $3,150 in additional cost to each student if they \nrequire payment of interest while in school and we do not have the \ngrace period before they get a job.\n  You know, old Newt Gingrich and I have a little bit in common. We \nwent to college on the National Defense Educational Loans. I went to a \nwindow in the school, got the money, borrowed the money, went to \ncollege, but I went to the military after college. Mr. Gingrich did \nnot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I spent 5 years in the military. Mr. \nGingrich did not. That is all right. So I did not have to pay it back \nthen. So then I went to law school and I did not still have to pay it \nback. It was after I finished law school that I started to pay back the \nloan, and the interest started at that point in time. I think that is \nwhat Mr. Gingrich said he did, too. He just did not go to the military, \nbut he had the same benefit. But he is saying what was good for me is \nnot good for you. He wants to close that now. He said, ``Students, as \nsoon as you start borrowing money you have to pay interest on it right \naway.'' That is a tax on students any way you cut it. I am saying it \nwas good for me and it ought to be good for \n[[Page S5163]] other students, too. I think we ought to invest in \nstudents and not shut the door. So what they are doing is they are \nwiping out opportunities for our kids to go to college.\n  Now they want to take away the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. \nThey want to zero that out. You know, you could make arguments on that. \nI happen to think public broadcasting is a benefit here in America. \nThere is good programming, good intellectual programming, good \nstimulation for our kids from ``Sesame Street'' and ``Barney'' and \neverything else. They want to pull the plug on that. But they want to \ncontinue to spend about $300 million a year for Radio Free Europe.\n  One more time. They want to cut public broadcasting in America, the \nContract With America, but they turn around and want to have public \nbroadcasting in Europe called Radio Free Europe. If you want to start a \nradio station in Europe, FM, AM, TV, go right ahead. You can go to \nBulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine --if you want to start a \nradio station, they will let you, no restrictions. We have this Radio \nFree Europe now, almost $300 million a year. Guess what, they are \nbroadcasting on shortwave. Who listens to shortwave? People there are \nlistening to FM and AM and television. They are getting satellite TV. \nThey are watching CNN and we are pumping $300 million a year into \nshortwave broadcasting on Radio Free Europe. The Contract With America \nsays we will keep that up but we will cut public broadcasting in \nAmerica.\n  If that makes sense, please someone explain it to me. Europe is free, \nthe borders are down. Whatever value Radio Free Europe had when the \nIron Curtain was up, that certainly is gone now, and we ought to bring \nthat money home and put it in public broadcasting here.\n  So, again, who wins and who loses on the contract? Big business and \ntheir special interest lobbyists have been invited into the committee \nrooms to write the laws that will benefit them. There are articles in \nthe paper about every week, every Thursday, Republicans in the House \nsit down with all the corporate lobbyists, high-powered lobbyists, not \nonly to write the legislation but to plan out how they are going to get \nit passed.\n  I saw a headline in the paper a few weeks ago where Newt Gingrich \nsaid they were going to end business as usual when they took over. They \ndid. They ended business as usual. But they did not tell us they were \ngoing to bring in big business as usual, because that is what is \nrunning us now--not business as usual; big business as usual.\n  The last thing that I want to point out is that a few years ago--this \nis where this whole thing breaks down. You talk about values. A few \nyears ago Senator Leahy and I were instrumental in putting in \ncompetitive bidding in the Women, Infants, and Children Program to \nmandate that infant formula companies had to enter into competitive \nbids to supply the States with infant formula. Before that they did not \ndo that. We got it through. As a result millions more women, infants, \nand children are getting infant formula, healthy food, to guide a good \nstart in life at no extra cost to the taxpayer because we have \ncompetitive bidding. Just last year, for example, the average monthly \nrebate to my State of Iowa was $630,000 a month because of competitive \nbidding.\n  The Contract With America wants to take that away and put it back in \nthe States, and do not require competitive bidding.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the Record \nthe article from the Wall Street Journal outlining how four giant \npharmaceutical companies can make over $1 billion a year in windfalls \nif they do away with competitive bidding.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Four Drug Firms Could Gain $1 Billion Under GOP Nutrition-Program \n                                Revision\n\n                           (By Hilary Stout)\n\n       Washington.--Four pharmaceutical companies stand to gain as \n     much as a billion dollars under a Republican bill that \n     overhauls federal nutrition programs for children and \n     pregnant women.\n       The companies sell infant formula to the Women, Infants and \n     Children (WIC) program, a federal initiative that provides \n     formula as well as milk, beans, rice and other nutritious \n     foods to poor children and to pregnant and breast-feeding \n     women. Since 1989 the companies have been required by law to \n     enter into a competitive bidding process in order to sell \n     formula to WIC, resulting in rebates to the government that \n     are expected to reach $1.1 billion this year.\n       A bill that cleared the House Economic and Educational \n     Opportunities Committee on a party-line vote last week would \n     turn the WIC program over to states in the form of a ``block \n     grant,'' and with it repeal the cost-containment competitive-\n     bidding measure. An amendment to restore it was defeated by \n     the committee. The legislation now moves to the House floor \n     for consideration.\n       The four companies, the only domestic makers of infant \n     formula--Ross Laboratories, a unit of Abbott Laboratories; \n     Mead Johnson, a unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; Wyeth-\n     Ayerst, a unit of American Home Products Corp.; and Carnation \n     Co., a U.S. subsidiary of the Swiss conglomerate Nestle SA--\n     fought the competitive-bidding measure fiercely when it came \n     before Congress in the late 1980s. Until then, they were \n     collecting retail prices for the infant formula they sold to \n     WIC.\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the \n     Senate Agriculture Committee and the lawmaker who led the \n     effort to enact the cost-containment measures, threatened to \n     filibuster the bill yesterday if it reaches the Senate. ``It \n     is really obscene,'' Sen. Leahy said. ``The most conservative \n     of people should, if being truthful, like the competitive \n     bidding. . . . It's just rank hypocrisy.''\n       If the bill reaches the Senate floor, Sen. Leahy continued, \n     ``I've spent 20 years building bipartisan coalitions and \n     working on nutrition programs. If it's necessary to discuss \n     my whole 20 years' worth of experience in real time, I'll do \n     it.''\n       In 1993, the latest year for which figures are available, \n     the WIC program spend $1.46 billion on infant formula but \n     received $935 million in rebates. That cut the overall cost \n     of providing formula to $525 million, nearly a two-thirds \n     reduction. Moreover, the states, which administer the \n     program, were allowed to use the rebates to add more people \n     to the WIC program.\n       The action on WIC comes as a liberal-leaning research \n     group, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, released a \n     study questioning the continuing effectiveness of some of the \n     infant-formula rebates. The center's analysis found that in \n     the last year, despite the cost-containment requirements, the \n     cost of infant formula purchased through WIC has almost \n     doubled in many states.\n       Since last March, the study said, 17 state WIC program have \n     signed rebate contracts with at least one of the major \n     formula manufacturers. Under those agreements, the average \n     net cost of a 13-ounce can of concentrated infant formula was \n     60 cents, compared with a 32-cent average price under rebate \n     contracts signed during the previous 15 months, the study \n     said.\n       The Federal Trade Commission has been investigating the \n     infant formula makers' rebate and pricing practices, and at \n     least one state, Florida, has filed suit against the \n     manufacturers.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, who wins and who loses? Kids lose, \nlow-income women who rely on the WIC Program lose, and our States are \ngoing to lose because they will not get rebates. Students are losing. \nWorking families are losing. But, if you are on the top of the heap \neconomically, this ``contract'' is for you.\n  So it is not a Contract With America. This is a contract with \ncorporate America. This is a contract with big business America. This \nis the contract with wealthy Americans. But it is not a contract for \nthe average man and woman in America.\n  So, again this resolution, I guess, is probably all right about \nAmerican values. But I believe that we ought to be looking at ourselves \nand the kind of value signals we send with this Contract With America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Democratic \nleader, or his designee, is now recognized to speak for up 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] is the designee and will \nbe able to speak up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is 30 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Leadership has 30 minutes but it is the \nChair's understanding that you were designated 20 minutes of the 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my colleague, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I try not to say I am shocked very often. I try to \nreserve it for when I really am. Today, I really am shocked. On Friday, \nwe actually watched Senators, led by Majority \n[[Page S5164]] Leader Bob Dole, think they need to retaliate against \nthe simple idea coming from this side of the aisle--that cutting \nGovernment spending does not mean waging an assault on education and \nour children.\n  I am speaking of the amendment from the Democratic leader.\n  With our pro-education amendment, we are asking every Senator to \nthink very hard about what's right and where our true values should \nlead us. This amendment gives every Senator a chance, before it is too \nlate, to leave politics at the door and to cast a vote for the basic \nprinciple that education and children must not be the victim of this \nSenate.\n  The citizens of this country expect us to make choices. With the \nrescissions bill before us, we are coming up with the funds to pay off \nrecent costs for natural disasters and other emergencies. The bill also \ncuts a range of Government programs to reduce the Federal deficit even \nmore. Both are essential steps.\n  But, Mr. President, reducing the deficit and taking care of natural \ndisasters do not mean that this Senate has to rob the schools, the \nchildren, and the spirit of the Nation. Any fourth or fifth grade \nteacher would give this bill a D at best for being that dumb.\n  The amendment offered by the Democratic leader is our chance to make \nthis bill a lot more worthy of passage. I urge every Senator, on both \nsides of the aisle, to resist the urge to be too stubborn or too \npartisan to vote for this amendment. It is never too late to improve \nourselves or our work. It is always a good idea to think about the \nconsequences of our actions.\n  We face one of the clearest choices imaginable between the amendment \noffered by the Republican leader and the one offered by the Democratic \nleader. The Republican choice is to cut education even more, and to \nkill off national service completely.\n  The Democratic amendment says protect our schools, protect the \nchildren, keep national service alive.\n  Vote for the Daschle amendment, and you are voting to continue \nsupporting what Americans say over and over and over again they \nsupport, and care deeply about:\n  Help for elementary and secondary schools trying to give the best \neducation possible for children from hard-pressed families; the Goals \n2000 effort to raise academic standards in over a thousand schools; the \nfunding for schools to teach children and teenagers about the dangers \nof drugs and alcohol; Head Start, and its special role in getting \nchildren off on the right foot; the training that's taking place all \nover the country to help high school graduates who aren't yet planning \nto attend college, but need that extra boost to make it in the \nworkplace; and last but not least, the country's new and exciting \nnational service program, that has inspired and excited thousands and \nthousands of young people to serve their communities with the promise \nof a college scholarship to follow.\n  Mr. President, vote against the Daschle amendment, and you are \nsnuffing out a flame of hope for children and families in every town, \ncity, and schoolhouse in this country. This is not rhetoric. These are \nnot abstract numbers. We are not talking about throwing a few \nbureaucrats out of work or closing some government offices. We are \ntalking about a bill that wants to yank $1.3 billion away from \neducation and children and national service.\n  This amendment says put the $1.3 billion back into our schools, back \ninto drug education, back into national service, back into getting \nteenagers ready for the demands of adulthood.\n  As Chairman of the National Commission on Children, I have traveled \nto many of the States of my colleagues. To San Antonio, TX, where I saw \na principal of a school use Head Start funds and title I funds to cause \nchildren to giggle and parents to smile as learning took place in every \nclassroom. Vote against this amendment, and dim the lights in that \nschool in San Antonio. We visited Kansas City, MO, where law officers \nand parents told us with fear and frustration about the drugs on the \nstreets and in the schoolyards. Vote against this amendment, and start \nsurrendering to the drug traffickers. We went to Minnesota where \ncorporate executives told us about their desperate need to get young \nworkers with better reading and math skills. Vote against this \namendment,\n and tell those employers to start thinking about locating in countries \nwere education is more valued.\n\n  Then, there's my own State of West Virginia. Where families and \ncommunities face incredible odds every day. Where children are what \ncounts, and education is the key. Where the programs covered in this \namendment make the difference. Where schools depend on these funds to \nhave a math teacher or a drug education class or a schoolwide campaign \nto get grades up. There are not a lot of wealthy families in West \nVirginia. But wealth is not supposed to determine whether a child \nbecomes a scientist or a professor or even a Senator. Education is. \nThat is the American promise. That is the American dream. Vote against \nthis amendment, and start snuffing out that promise, that dream.\n  I can hardly believe that national service is on the firing line of \nthis bill, already mowed down by the House Republican leaders. Should \nthe President really apologize or hide the fact that he is proud of \nhelping to reignite the flame for national service? For the idea that \nwe can promote rights and responsibilities? A program that is already \nthe story of thousands of AmeriCorps members, working in housing \nprojects, shelters, classrooms, health clinics, neighborhoods--for a \nminimum amount of money to live on, and a college scholarship as a \nreward for service.\n  AmeriCorps is taking hold in West Virginia. Young people and older \nparticipants are helping a mobile health van to bring primary health \ncare, like checkups and shots, to children in rural areas. they are \nworking at domestic violence shelters where women and children seek \nrefuge from this terrible danger in too many homes.\n  National service is the idea that led me to West Virginia, and \nchanged my life forever.\n  Vote for this amendment, and national service stays alive in our \ncommunities. Vote against this amendment, and let the American people \nknow that we are giving up on this idea once again. Let us wait another \n30 years to celebrate service with college scholarships and stipends.\n  When I joined the Senate, one of my very first bills was the one that \nhelped create the drug education program threatened in this bill. The \npolice officers, the teachers, and the parents of West Virginia led me \nto push for this special help. As a result, police officers are now in \nclassrooms, telling children about what it is like in prison. Peer \ngroups have developed in countless schools to make it clear that drugs \nare not cool, whatsoever.\n  If we are serious about values, where is the logic in going after \nsomething as basic as drug education? What signal does that send? It \nmakes no sense.\n  Mr. President, I heard the Republican leader bemoan the effort from \nthis side of the aisle to fight for kids. I am sorry if that's slowing \nthis bill down. I am especially sorry to see it cause a cruel \ncounterpunch in the form of a Republican-led amendment, instead of the \nadmission that we should take a breath, and remember just how much the \ncitizens of this country support and care about education and children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming wishes to speak \nin morning business for 7 minutes. I would be happy to accommodate him, \nproviding that it does not come out of our time and we retain the \nbalance of our time following his presentation.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. May I suggest that order take place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Before the Senator from Wyoming speaks, the \nChair would inform the Senator from North Dakota that the Chair was in \nerror. The Senator was allotted 30 minutes, not 20. The Senator has 22 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield 2 minutes of my time to my friend from Nebraska, \nSenator Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have, as well as the Senator from \nWyoming, come to the floor to comment on the Social Security trustees' \nreport, which is one more piece of evidence that this Congress needs to \nact sooner rather than later to change our entitlement programs, \nspecifically our retirement programs and our health care programs. The \nlonger we wait, the more likely it is that we will face very, very \ndifficult choices and it will unfairly punish people for our delay. \nWhile it is not a crisis in 1995, that should not be justification for \nour not taking action as, unfortunately, is often the case.\n  One additional point, Mr. President. I believe the trustees' report \nitself makes a very strong case for changing the law so that we have a \ndifferent kind of trustee relationship. Four of the six trustees are \nmembers of the executive branch, the administration. And while I trust \neach one of them, I do not believe they have the kind of independence \nthat the American people need in order to have a recommendation upon \nwhich we can act.\n  They say in their recommendation there is no real urgency; let us \nwait until the clock ticks a little further.\n  I believe an independent board is needed, Mr. President. Otherwise, \nthe American people are not going to acquire the sense of urgency to \nact. As a consequence, this Congress may be encouraged to delay longer \nthan is wise.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Wyoming for yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I cannot tell you how much I enjoy \nworking with the Senator from Nebraska. He and I are going to involve \nourselves in a bipartisan effort as a form of a national wake-up call. \nAfter the recess is concluded, we will introduce a series of bills \nwhich will deal with the real hard stuff in America, which is Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal retirement. I cannot tell you \nhow much I enjoy and respect and admire the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I have some remarks to make about Social Security. But in my limited \ntime, and listening to the previous debate, I cannot help but reflect, \nas I listened to the rather dramatic presentation of how, apparently, I \ngather, Republicans love to be cruel to children and to veterans and to \nold people, how absurd and bizarre that is. That is the most stupefying \ntype of debate to listen to.\n  It will really be interesting to see how everyone handles the tough \nvotes, the ones that really count, when we try to do something which \nwill assure the future for veterans and the children and the old \npeople; and that is to do something with the entitlement programs which \nare sucking it all up.\n  We here do not even vote on 68 percent of the Federal budget--no, \nthat just goes out the door to people, regardless of their net worth or \ntheir income. Absolutely absurd.\n  All we are trying to do, at least in our party, is to slow the growth \nof the programs. There is not a ``cut'' in a carload here. We are not \n``cutting'' anything. We are trying to slow the growth of programs. If \nthe American people cannot understand that, well, get the other party \nback in power and start spending it up, because that is exactly where \nwe are.\n  Let us look at that school lunch caper over there in the House. Do \nyou know what they really did? They took a program going up 5.4 percent \na year and said, ``Let's let it go up only 4.5 percent a year and let \nthe States handle it with flexibility and less administrative costs,'' \nwhich was then reported to the public as breaking catsup bottles over \nchildren's heads, and the prospect of swollen-bellied children in \nlittle school districts all over America starving to death. That is \nbosh; absolutely stupefying drivel.\n  So every one of these programs is going up, and we are trying to say, \n``slow the growth.''\n  And try this one, because you will want to be ready for it when we do \nsomething to Medicare. And, brothers and sisters, we will do something \nto Medicare because it is going up 10.5 percent per year regardless of \nwhat we do. Then you can watch what happens when we do not allow it to \ngo up 10.5 percent. We are going to let it go up probably 5 percent. \nThe headline will be: ``Congress slashes Medicare 50 percent.'' Be \nready for that one.\n  When a 5-percent increase is described as a 50-percent cut, and it is \nbelieved the American people deserve exactly what they are going to \nget.\n  I keep hearing about Head Start. Guess what? Why not use the correct \nfigures? Head Start is mentioned every single day as some kind of thing \nthe Republicans love to chop on.\n  Well, here are the correct figures and they come from Democrats and \nRepublicans alike in this body. In fiscal year 1990, $1.6 billion; in \nfiscal year 1996, $3.9 billion. So from fiscal year 1990 through fiscal \nyear 1996, Head Start has more than doubled. It has had more than a \n140-percent increase, and everybody knows it. If they do not, they are \ngoing to get exactly what they deserve.\n  It comes from a bent of being stupid about what is really happening \nin America.\n  The recent trustees' report on Social Security is another classic \nexample of stupefying logic. We are now told that, instead of going \nbroke in the year 2029, it will go broke in the year 2031. Is that not \nthrilling? Nearly the same numbers as last year; certain disaster. The \nfacts all speak for themselves.\n  The trustees say Social Security will start running deficits in 2015 \nand go broke in 2031. Disability insurance is already running deficits \nand it will go broke in the year 2016. The Medicare trust fund will \nstart running deficits in 1996, and will go broke in the year 2002. But \nhave stout heart, because last year, it was to go broke in the year \n2001. So this is cheerful news It will now go broke in the year 2002. \nThat is like a cancer patient being told, ``You lucky fellow, you are \ngoing to have 6 months to live instead of 5.''\n  The trustees go on to use phrases like ``extremely unfavorable'' and \n``severely out of financial balance'' when talking about the Medicare \ntrust fund. And the trustees urge that all these reforms be undertaken \nsooner rather than later.\n  So that is where we are. Doomsday dates, just about the same, using \nintermediate assumptions--not the best assumptions, not the worst--but \nthe best ``in between'' estimate of what the future holds. And we know \nthat they assume that the Consumer Price Index will hover between 3 and \n4 percent until the year 2002 and will never go above 4 for the year \n2070.\n  Yet one uptick in the Consumer Price Index of one-half of 1 percent \nwill cost the Government about 7 billion bucks annually for Social \nSecurity alone. And if we were to see another few years of high \ninflation, as in the late seventies and early eighties when the CPI hit \n13.4 percent, Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, only 1 year of \nthat type of increase would cost the Government more than 126 billion \nbucks--1 year.\n  In light of this report, it is well to reflect on the real, honest-\nto-God reasons for exploding Federal spending. I know the AARP, the \nAmerican Association of Retired People, hates to hear this, but it is \ntime they do. That group is the 33 million people paying 8 bucks a year \ndues to do it. They are bound together by a common love of airline \ndiscounts and auto discounts and pharmacy discounts and all the rest. \nHere is what they do not want you to hear:\n  The growth of these programs is what is creating the true hazard in \nAmerica. They have consistently argued that other than health care, \nentitlements are not growing faster than the rest of the GDP. That is \nsimply wrong--it is a misapplication of fact--it is actually a lie. \nAccording to the trustees themselves, Social Security costs would grow \nfrom 4.2 of GDP in 1995 to 5.1 by 2020, and more than 5.7 by the year \n2045. That is a 40-percent increase relative to the current share of \nGDP.\n  I hope when we listen to the debate and when the organs of the AARP \nand other senior groups begin to rap on us, that we remember that these \nnonprofit organizations have myriad and lucrative activities in which \nthey engage. We will have them before the subcommittee, of which I \nchair, to tell us \n[[Page S5166]] of their prowess in the fundraising arena.\n  So here we go. By the year 2045, the trustees' report shows that more \nthan 14 percent of the GDP will go into Social Security and Medicare \nprograms alone. And get this one: In the year 2030, there will have to \nbe a 30 percent payroll tax to pay for Social Security. Oh, yes, you \ncan get there; yes, you can; you can do it with more payroll tax; you \ncan get there that way to pay for Social Security and Medicare.\n  And we here have done all this to ourselves. The President did not do \nit. President Clinton did not do it. President Bush did not do it. We \ndid it. We have done it ourselves. We have served as pack horses to \ndrag money back to our States, and we have done a magnificent job for \n50 years. Just look at our record. The more you drag home, the more you \nget reelected. Now the people are waking up from a long slumber. Rip \nVan Winkle could not have matched it.\n  I plan to work hard with my good friend, Bob Kerrey, to introduce \nlegislation to shore up the Social Security and Medicare trust funds in \norder that it will not be in the cards to leave our children and \ngrandchildren with the burden of paying payroll tax rates of 30 percent \nand beyond in all the years to come.\n  You can run but you cannot hide on this one. The tough votes will be \ncoming, and it will be very interesting to see who casts them. My hunch \nis the people who give us the business about this and this and this \nitem, which is really peanuts in the great scheme, will not cast the \ntough votes when they know we full well have to have those votes to \nstop runaway systems that we do not even vote on, which are up now to \n68 percent of the entire national budget.\n  I earnestly hope that we will have a good bipartisan effort to \nresolve it. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 22 minutes \nremaining.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5165-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5166-S5168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  WRONGHEADED PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the discussion in Washington this week, \nand I suppose next week, and around the country during the Easter break \nwill be the first 100 days. What do we make of the first 100 days in \nthe change of majority status in the Congress, Republicans replacing \nDemocrats as the majority party in the 1992 elections?\n  I said yesterday, and let me remind people again today, the score in \n1992--in a democracy, those who win by one vote are still called \nwinners--the score in 1992 at the end of the election process was the \nRepublicans 20 percent, Democrats 19 percent and 61 percent of those \neligible to vote said, ``Count me out, I won't even participate.'' So \nwith a 20 to 19 victory, the Republicans have claimed a mandate for \ntheir ideas, and a mandate for something called the Contract With \nAmerica.\n  The Contract With America contains a number of ideas that are \ninteresting, provocative, in some cases radical, in my judgment. Some \nof the ideas in the Contract With America are ideas that I embrace, \nthat I have voted for and have supported. Some of the ideas are ideas \nthat the majority party, who now brings them to the floor, filibustered \nin the previous Congress and prevented coming for a vote because they \nfelt apparently they will not support them and now they apparently do \nand even put them in a contract.\n  By whatever device they come to the floor of the Senate, a good idea \nis a good idea no matter who proposes it. A number of them have passed.\n  Unfunded mandates has passed the Senate and gone to the President. \nThe Congressional Accountability Act has passed the Senate. The line-\nitem veto has passed the Senate. A 45-day legislative veto, which makes \ngood sense, on the subject of regulations and rules has passed the \nSenate. I voted for all of those issues, and I think they make good \nsense.\n  But the Contract With America is a mixture of good and bad. The fact \nis, some of the ideas in the Contract With America reinforce the \nstereotypical notions of what the majority party has always been about, \nand that is to keep their comfortable friends comfortable, even at the \nexpense of those who in this country are struggling to make it.\n  I would like to talk just a few minutes about some of those items in \nthe contract that we have had to fight and that we even now try to \nfight and reject because we think they are wrongheaded public policy \ndecisions for this country.\n  One hundred years from now--not 100 days--but 100 years from now, you \ncan look back and evaluate what this society decided was important by \nevaluating what it invested its money in, what did it spend money on, \nespecially in the public sector, what did it invest in. That is the way \nto look back 100 years and determine what people felt was important, \nwhat people valued and treasured. Was it education? Was it defense? Was \nit the environment? Was it public safety? Fighting crime? You can \nevaluate what people felt was important at that point in their lives by \nwhat they spent their money on.\n  And so you can look at the Federal budget and look at the initiatives \nbrought to the floor of the Senate and the House to increase here and \ncut over there and determine what do they view as valuable, what do \nthey view as the most important investments.\n  The Contract With America, in the other body, had a debate recently \nby the majority party pushing the contract provision that said to the \nDefense Department, ``We want to add $600 million to your budget.''\n  The Secretary of Defense said, ``We don't want it, we don't need it, \nwe're not asking for it.''\n  The Republicans over in the House of Representatives said, ``It \ndoesn't matter to us, we want to increase the Defense Department budget \nby $600 million. That is our priority. We don't care if you don't want \nit, don't need it or don't ask for it. We want to stick more money in \nthe pockets of the Defense Department.''\n  How are we going to get it? ``We are going to pay for it,'' they \nsaid. ``We simply will cut spending on job training for disadvantaged \nyouth and we will cut spending on money that is needed to invest in \nschools that are in disrepair in low-income neighborhoods.''\n  So they cut those accounts that would help poor kids in this country \nand said, ``Let's use the money to stick it into the pockets of the \nPentagon,'' at a time when the Pentagon and the Secretary of Defense, \nMr. Perry, 50 feet from this floor in a meeting said, ``We don't want \nit, we didn't ask for it, we don't need it.'' But the Contract With \nAmerica folks said, ``It's our priority, it's what we believe in, so \nwe're going to shove money in your direction.''\n  Then they come out on the floor of the Senate and the House and stand \nup and crow about what big deficit cutters they are, how they dislike \npublic spending, how much they want to cut the budget deficit, how \neverybody else are the big spenders but they are the frugal folks. \nRight. They are the folks who are trying to stuff money in the pockets \nof the Defense Department that the Defense Department says they do not \nwant.\n  How do they get it? It takes it from poor kids. Now, that says \nsomething about values. That says something about priorities, I think.\n  Now, do we oppose that? Of course we do. Some Members stand up and \nsay we do not think that is the right way to legislate. We do not think \nwe ought to give a Federal agency more money than it needs. If the head \nof the agency says we do not need or want this money, do Members think \nthe legislature ought to be throwing money? I do not.\n  Now, we have a number of things in the Contract With America that \nrepresent, in my judgment, wrong-headed priorities. I think we are \nduty-bound to create the debate on these subjects. That is what a \ndemocratic system is.\n  When we disagree, bring all the ideas here and have the competition \nfor ideas, and strong aggressive public debate. Respectful, but strong \npublic debate and see where the votes are.\n  We had a case in the House of Representatives under the contract \nwhere the notion is that all Federal rules and regulations are \nessentially bad and we should dump them. They did not quite say it that \nway, but this is pretty much what they meant.\n  I think there is a general understanding that rules and regulations \nin many areas have gone too far and have strangled initiative, and have \nbeen created by bureaucrats who do not understand \n[[Page S5167]] the effect of them, and that we ought to streamline \nthem.\n  So, here in the Senate we passed, with my help, out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, a risk assessment bill which I voted \nfor and helped write. We passed a 45-day legislative veto which I voted \nfor, and I am pleased to do that because we need to address that.\n  In the House, what they did is they got a bunch of corporate folks, a \nbunch of big business folks in a room and said, ``Why do you not help \nwrite this? What bothers you? See if we can write something that \nsatisfies your interest.''\n  Then they bring it to the floor, called a moratorium. It is beyond \nthe dreams of the big special interest folks to put a moratorium on \nevery conceivable rule and regulation that has yet to be issued.\n  It is like saying to the biggest businesses in the country, ``You can \ncome in and write your own ticket. It does not matter. Just come in and \nwrite it up and we will legislate it.'' We have been through this. \nThere needs to be in a free enterprise society like ours, some \noversight, some sense of responsibility, as well.\n  I told on the floor of the Senate the other day about the early days \nof this century when people did not know what kind of meat they were \neating. When a noted author wrote a book that lit the fuse that started \nthe chain reaction that led to the meat inspection programs in this \ncountry.\n  The investigations in the slaughterhouses in the meat packing plants \nwhere they had rat problems, and they take a slice of bread or loaves \nof bread and lace it with rat poison and lay it out to kill the rats in \nthe meat packing plants. They put the dead rats, bread, and rat poison \nall down the same chute with the meat and pump out the ``mystery meat'' \nthat people got a chance to eat in this country.\n  Finally, understanding that the captains of that industry at least \nwere more interested in profit than they were in public health, there \nwas a decision that we ought to do something about that. Now, when we \neat meat in this country that has been inspected, we have some notion \nthat it is safe. Safe to eat. Why is that? Because of regulations. \nRegulations in many cases are essential to public health and public \nsafety.\n  No one would want to get on an airline today that does not have a \nrequirement to subscribe to some minimum safety standards in which \nthere are not some air traffic controllers adopting public regulations \nto determine at what altitudes to fly when heading east and what \naltitudes to fly when heading west.\n  Regulations in many cases are critically important. The right kind of \nregulations. It we have the captains of industry in this country \ndeciding to write the regulations they want, it will, in my judgment, \nalways impose profit as a virtue ahead of public safety and public \nhealth.\n  We need to care a little about that. Those who say, well, we will \nopen our offices to the captains of industry to write the regulation, \nand we bring them to the floor and push them to the floor under \nsomething called the Contract With America, some are duty bound to \nstand up and say, no, no, there is a public interest involved here as \nwell.\n  We must urge the private interest and the public interest to be sure \nthat we care about public health and public safety.\n  Now, those same people in the Contract With America say that they are \nthe ones that care about public spending. They say we will take the $10 \nbillion in the crime bill and decide to move that as a block grant to \nState and local government.\n  We will send it back to the States. They are capable of better \nspending it than we are. Remember what happened when we did that before \nwith the Law Enforcement Assistance Act? You separate where you raise \nmoney from where you spend it, I guarantee you will promote the biggest \nwaste in Government.\n  Under the old LEAA Act, local governments got money and one had a \nstudy, and that was to try to determine why people in prison tried to \nget out. What would make people in prison try to escape? Well, we do \nnot have to spend $25 million to study that. I tell you why--because \nthey are locked up, for God's sake. That is why people in prison try to \nescape.\n  Why would someone want to spend public money to determine why \nprisoners want to escape? Because it was free. The money came from the \nFederal Government.\n  This notion about block grants in which we separate where money is \nraised from where money is spent and in which the Federal Government \nraises the money and sends it to the Governors to say, ``Here, you go \nahead and spend it the way you want, no strings attached. Crime, spend \nit on roads if you want.''\n  In the House of Representatives, they had an amendment on the floor \nthat says at least with respect to this crime money communities ought \nnot be able to spend it on roads. Guess what? They defeated the \namendment. They said, no, we would not restrict that. We can send money \nback in which there is a problem to deal with the epidemic of violent \ncrime, and they can spend it on roads. Those are the kind of things \nthat make no sense.\n  The previous speaker this morning spoke briefly about the hot lunch \nprogram. He said, ``Gee, it will increase.'' Yes, it is true, it will \nincrease. The cost of food goes up, we increase the amount of the hot \nlunch program by exactly the amount of increase in the cost of food.\n  Guess what? More children are coming into our school system that are \neligible for hot lunch, and there is not enough money to provide hot \nlunches for all those kids. And some kids come up and say, ``I want a \nhot lunch, or I need a hot lunch,'' and they are told, ``well, gee, one \nof the Senators said we increased funding so there certainly should be \nenough money available for you.''\n  Well, they did not increase funding enough to provide the money for \nall of the new kids coming into the hot lunch program. And besides, \nthey in the contract for America provide that they will remove the \nentitlement for a hot lunch for poor kids.\n  Now, what sense does that make? Poor kids in this country often find \nthat the only hot lunch they receive during the entire day is a hot \nlunch they received at school. I recall a statement made by the \nPresiding Officer, about that very subject.\n  I know the Presiding Officer happens to share my view, the hot lunch \nprogram is a critically important program. An entitlement for poor kids \nto get a hot lunch at school is an entitlement we ought to keep. Any \ncountry as big and generous as this country, can certainly be generous \nenough to be sure that poor kids in this country get a hot lunch in the \nmiddle of the day at school.\n  So people say, ``Well, gee, why are you against all these? What are \nyou for?'' I am for a hot lunch for poor kids. It seems to me you start \nwith those kinds of notions, and you fight for those things against \nsomeone who will decide that we ought not have an entitlement for a hot \nlunch at school for poor kids. That is what I am for and that is what I \nam against.\n  Now, words have meanings, and legislation has consequences. We can \ntalk all we want about what legislation does or does not do. Here is \nthe first 100 ways in the first 100 days that the Contract With America \ndecides it is more comfortable to help the wealthy, help the big \nspecial interests, and to do so at the expense of a lot of folks in \nthis country who are vulnerable.\n  There is a difference in how we believe we ought to discharge our \nresponsibilities. I think we ought to cut Federal spending and we ought \nto cut it in an aggressive way. But there is plenty of waste and plenty \nof Federal spending we ought to cut without hurting the vulnerable in \nour society. We can do that. It simply is a matter of priority.\n  When those who push the Contract With America decide we want to shove \n$600 million at the Defense Department that they do not want or they do \nnot need or they did not ask for, and, at the same time, they say, we \nwant you to remove the entitlement to a hot lunch, for American school \nkids who are disadvantaged. And there is something wrong, in my \njudgment, with the value system that creates those regulations.\n  I hope we can talk about all of that this week, because that is the \nstandard by which we judge the first 100 days--some good, some bad. We \naccept the \n[[Page S5168]] good, vote to pass it along and improve things in the \ncountry. The bad we fight, because this country can do better than \nthat. This country can do better than to compromise health and safety \nstandards, than to say that poor kids in school, your hot lunch does \nnot matter.\n  I just touched on a couple of areas here. There are dozens and dozens \nof them that make no sense. I hope during this coming week, we can \ndecide to explore some of those in depth and explore the reasons why we \nfeel it is important to stand up and speak out on behalf of some of \nthose as well.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, who has done an \nenormous amount of work in this area.\n  Mr. President, I yield him the remainder of my time, and he may wish \nto add to that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 6 minutes and 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we add 12 \nminutes to my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I may \nask the Senator from Vermont if I might address a question through the \nChair, I think in the order of business I was to be recognized for up \nto 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator form Georgia is correct. He has 15 \nminutes reserved.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Would morning business still allow that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was aware of the order regarding the Senator from \nGeorgia. The Chair will correct me if my addition is not right. It \nwould make sure he would still have his full 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are still several Senators who have \nreserved time. The Senator from Indiana has 10 minutes; the Senator \nfrom Georgia has also 10 minutes.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As long as I will have time, with the time remaining, \nfor my remarks, I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5166-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5168-S5170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           WINNERS AND LOSERS UNDER THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have heard from schoolteachers and I have \nhad heard from parents and doctors and day care providers and advocates \nfor children around the Nation. Many of them have called me because, \nduring the past 20 years as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have been intimately involved \nwith almost all nutrition legislation in this country.\n  Certainly, during the last dozen years, there has not been any piece \nof nutrition legislation that has passed the Congress and has been \nsigned into law by the President that has not either been authored by \nme or cosponsored by me.\n  I have heard from many Vermonters, from dietitians, dairy farmers, \nthe Governor of Vermont, and volunteers of Vermont food shelves. They \nfeel worried and betrayed. They want welfare reform; they want able-\nbodied adults to work, as do I. But they do not want to see hunger \nreturn in this country with a vengeance.\n  They do not want to see a country, blessed as no other nation on \nEarth has ever been blessed with its ability to produce food, have \nmillions of hungry Americans. And they do not want the Contract With \nAmerica. They believe the Contract With America is antichild and \nantifamily, and so do I.\n  The Contract With America is good for big corporations, for huge tax \ncuts for the rich, and for special interests. I thought we ought to see \nwho are the top 10 winners under the Contract With America. So I put \ntogether a chart that explains the top 10 winners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two lists of winners and \nlosers, under the Contract With America, be printed in the Record.\n        Top 10 Winners During the First 100 Days of the Contract\n\n       10. The Coca-Cola Company and the Pepsi Cola Company--soft \n     drinks instead of milk could be served with school lunches. \n     Children and dairy farmers, in contrast, are very big losers.\n       Pepsi is a big winner since its Taco Bell and Pizza Hut \n     subsidiaries could take over school lunch programs, and other \n     fast food companies are not far behind.\n       9. Pesticide manufacturers--the chemical giants stand to \n     make millions of dollars with planned cuts in federal \n     regulations that protect the environment. I hope families \n     that drink water in rural areas like the taste of alachlor, \n     atrazine, and cyanazine.\n       8. Criminals--Republicans plan to stop the President's \n     efforts to put 100,000 new police officers on the streets. \n     All communities who would have gotten those new officers will \n     be big losers.\n       In Houston, violent crimes have been reduced by 17 percent \n     because of cops on the beat; in New York City, community \n     policing has cut violent street crimes by 7 percent.\n       7. Four drug giants--the House bill could transfer up to \n     $1.1 billion to infant formula manufacturers by eliminating \n     the requirement that infant formula be bought at the best \n     price for the WIC program.\n       Current competitive bidding procedures keep 1.5 million \n     pregnant women, infants and children on WIC at no additional \n     cost to taxpayers. Those up to 1.5 million infants, women and \n     children are losers under the House bill.\n       6. Locksmiths--funding for child day care is slashed, which \n     means that low-income mothers who want to work may have to \n     let tens of thousands of kids stay home by themselves.\n       5. Water and air polluters, unwholesome meat and poultry \n     packers--House Republicans plan to cut regulations that \n     protect the environment, air quality, water quality and food \n     safety.\n       Families that breath air, drink water and eat food are the \n     big losers.\n       4. Large corporations--corporations will enjoy huge tax \n     loopholes (such as eliminating the alternative minimum tax \n     which will give corporations $35 billion over 10 years), \n     defense conglomerates will make large profits, and meat and \n     poultry plants will not have to worry about selling \n     contaminated meats since that will be allowed.\n       3. The wealthiest 12 percent of Americans--over half the \n     benefits of the tax breaks in the Contract With America go to \n     the wealthiest 12 percent of Americans, those earning over \n     $100,000 a year.\n       In contrast, children do not vote and have been targeted \n     for the worst cuts by the Contract With America. Included in \n     the list of Federal funding slashed or totally eliminated is \n     funding for: disabled children, food for homeless children \n     living in emergency shelters, day care for the children of \n     low-income parents who want to work, food for children in \n     over 150,000 day care homes, summer jobs and food service \n     programs, PBS children's programs, and other programs for \n     children.\n       2. Lawyers--lawyers will make a fortune exploiting all the \n     environmental, tax, and worker protection loopholes in the \n     Contract.\n       The Republicans create 101 new ways for lawyers to delay \n     environmental, health and food safety regulations.\n       1. Anyone making over $349,000 a year--the House Republican \n     proposals give the wealthy an average tax break of $20,362 \n     through huge capital gains tax cuts, estate tax breaks for \n     the wealthy, and corporate tax loopholes. In addition, U.S. \n     billionaires who renounce U.S. citizenship will be given huge \n     tax writeoffs--$3.9 billion worth over the next 10 years.\n       These tax entitlements for the rich, and for corporations, \n     are provided while cutting aid to children, to low-income \n     students who want to stay in college, and to the national \n     service program that provides college scholarships.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n        Top 10 Losers During the First 100 Days of the Contract\n\n       10. Newborn children--the Contract throws up to 1.5 million \n     pregnant women, infants and children off the WIC program, \n     threatens to make millions go hungry, and provides for major \n     funding cuts for programs that help disabled children, \n     children in child care and homeless children.\n       9. Children who drink tap water--the House delays \n     regulations that protect drinking water from being \n     contaminated with dangerous chemicals.\n       8. Children who breathe--the House bill hampers clean air \n     protections which will especially hurt more vulnerable \n     populations such as children.\n       7. Children who need child care--child care food program \n     funding is cut in half which will likely throw over 150,000 \n     day care homes off the program.\n       6. Children with mothers who work--the Contract slashes \n     funding for child care for low-income parents who are trying \n     to stay off welfare, get off welfare, or find a job.\n       5. Children with fathers who work--the Contract eliminates \n     the safety net for families when they most need help during a \n     recession. Benefits to millions of children could be \n     significantly cut during hard times.\n       4. Children who go to school--funding for educational \n     programs for grade school and secondary schools, funding for \n     the Learn and Serve Program, and funding for AmeriCorps \n     college scholarships is slashed.\n       3. Children who eat hamburgers--The House bill delays rules \n     on food safety for at least one year. These rules are \n     designed to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks like the one \n     that killed several children in Western states in 1991.\n       2. Children who are not rich--House tax cuts for wealthy \n     Americans and corporations will make it more difficult to \n     balance the budget, our children will have to pay the bill \n     [[Page S5169]] later, and low-income children will lose \n     benefits immediately.\n       1. Children who eat--The House welfare bill will take food \n     away from hundreds of thousands of infants, homeless children \n     and school children. It says to them ``have a hungry day,'' \n     especially during recessions.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, No. 10 on the list are the Coca-Cola Co. \nand the Pepsi-Cola Co.--in fact, all junk food companies are winners. \nThey are winners under the Contract With America because the House bill \neliminates nutritional requirements for school lunch.\n  I fought these fast food companies last year to make school lunches \nhealthier. They did not want to allow us to make school lunches \nhealthier for an obvious reason: their fast foods are not healthy \nfoods. Congress reduced the saturated fat content in school meals and \nclarified that schools have a right to say no to junk food \nmanufacturers.\n  Under the Contract With America, we throw out those healthy meals \nrequirements. Soft drinks can be sold to schoolchildren during lunch \ninstead of milk. Can anybody here who has been a parent, has raised \nchildren as I have, tell me that Coca-Cola is more nutritious for them \nthan milk?\n  Candy companies, fast food giants, junk food purveyors--these are the \nbig winners. Children and the producers of nutritious food in this \ncountry are the real losers.\n  Who is next in line among the top 10 winners? Why, the pesticide \nmanufacturers. The chemical giants can make millions of dollars with \nthe planned cuts in Federal regulations to protect the environment. I \nhope that families who drink water in rural areas of Vermont or \nColorado or Georgia or any other State like the taste of alachlor, \natrazine, and cyanazine.\n  Who else makes out? As a former prosecutor, I was very interested to \nsee the contract provide benefits to criminals. The Republicans intend \nto stop the President's efforts to put 100,000 new police officers on \nthe streets. They apparently do not want the President to get credit \nfor anything. As one who spent almost a decade in law enforcement, I \nwould like to see those cops on the streets. The Contract With America \ndoes not.\n  Then we have the four giant drug manufacturers that make infant \nformula for WIC. Man, did they make out like bandits. Let me tell you \nwhat is happening. We have Nestle, which is not even an American \ncompany. It is a Swiss company. Its annual sales in 1993 were $37 \nbillion. The other companies also fared well: Bristol-Myers Squibb, $11 \nbillion; American Home Products, $8 billion; Abbott Laboratories, $8 \nbillion.\n   How did they make out like bandits under the contract? I will tell \nyou how. We have the Women, Infants, and Children Program. Some years \nago I called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate price-\nfixing and bid-rigging regarding infant formula companies and the WIC \nProgram. I drafted laws that required States to use competitive bidding \nwhen they buy formula under the WIC Program. I then worked to pass a \nlaw with bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate which imposes fines of \nup to $100 million for price-fixing by these giant drug companies.\n  Now, this one simple rule saves taxpayers who pay for the WIC Program \n$1.1 billion a year. It keeps 1.5 million pregnant women, infants, and \nchildren on WIC at no additional cost to taxpayers.\n  The people who tout the Contract With America--``We are profamily; we \nare prochildren''--they are probaloney because they voted to get rid of \ncompetitive bidding.\n  That gives a windfall of up to $1 billion to four giant drug \ncompanies. I would like to know whom they contributed to among those \nwho voted for this change.\n  And what do they use to pay for this windfall in the profamily, \nprochild Contract With America? They take 1.5 million pregnant women \nand newborn children off WIC in order to give four drug companies that \nmake $37 billion, $11 billion, $8 billion, and another $8 billion an \nadditional windfall of $1 billion.\n  Can you imagine what would happen if we voted on this change in the \ndaylight? The amendment would say ``give $1 billion in tax dollars to \nthese four giant drug companies, but take 1.5 million women and \nchildren, most of whom do not vote, off of WIC.''\n  Maybe some of those who receive contributions from the drug companies \nstill would want to vote that way, but they would be embarrassed to do \nit in the daytime.\n  The Democrats offered an amendment to restore the competitive bidding \nrequirement. It lost. Taking millions of pregnant women and small \nchildren off the WIC Program is now part of the Contract With America.\n  The influence the large corporations have had on the contract was \noutlined in the Washington Post yesterday. The story tells of the \ninfluence of the Kellogg Co., Gerber's, Mead-Johnson, Abbott \nLaboratories, and Coca-Cola on the House legislative process. We in the \nSenate should not put corporate profits ahead of children.\n  Maybe we should look at another one on the top 10 list: locksmiths. \nFunding for day care is slashed under this so-called profamily, \nprochild Contract With America. It is a Contract on America because \nthey slashed child day care funding. Tens of thousands of low-income \nmothers who want to work, who want to get off welfare, may have to let \ntheir children stay home by themselves. Many of them are going to be \nlatchkey children who have to let themselves in after grade school. \nSome are going to be locked-in children, whose parents, when they go \noff to work, have to lock them in. They have to lock them in the house \nbecause the parents cannot afford to miss work.\n  Then look at the next big winners, the water and air polluters, and \nunsanitary meat and poultry packers. Thousands of consumers get ill \neach year from contaminated foods. In Washington State, several died \nfrom eating hamburgers that were tainted. We have the technology to \nprevent needless death. But the Contract With America would stall or \nstop the regulations that would bring that about.\n  We ought to think about whether we want our children or our \ngrandchildren to eat contaminated hamburger before we stand up and \ncelebrate how we passed the Contract With America. I ask Americans to \nread the small type, read the small print. And those who want to vote \nfor this, let them stand up, the next time a child dies from a \ncontaminated hamburger, let them stand up and say, ``Tough luck; but am \nI not proud I voted for that.''\n  Of course, you are not going to see that.\n  The children do not vote. They do not send money to PAC's. They do \nnot contribute.\n  Then we have large corporations next on the list. Our working \nfamilies are hurt by the contract. Large profitable corporations make \nout like bandits. They are going to get $35 billion over the next 10 \nyears because the contract eliminates the alternative minimum tax. The \naverage Vermont family is going to get very little tax relief under the \ncontract, and they will lose more than they gain. They are going to \nlose all these things I talked about--school lunches and child care.\n  The wealthiest 12 percent of Americans, do they make out. Over half \nof the benefits of the tax breaks in the Contract With America go to \nthe wealthiest 12 percent of Americans--those earning over $100,000 a \nyear. Those earning over $200,000 a year will get over $11,000 in tax \ncuts. Families earning between $10,000 and $20,000 will get $90. Big \ndeal.\n  Lawyers are next. I should be happy. I am a lawyer. But I am not \nhappy that lawyers are going to make a fortune exploiting all the \nenvironmental, tax, and worker protection loopholes in the contract. \nThe contract creates 101 new ways for lawyers to delay food safety and \nenvironmental regulations.\n  And now here's the big prize--the No. 1 winner under the Contract \nWith America--is anybody making over $349,000 a year. They ought to be \nready to send their checks to every wealthy PAC in this country because \nthey make a killing. They get an average tax break of $20,362.\n  In addition, these great patriots who are out there waving the \nAmerican flag saying, ``Look at our Contract With America,'' do you \nknow what they did? Do you know what their sense of patriotism is? They \ntell a bunch of billionaires in this country that if you make a billion \ndollars here in America under our laws and under the advantages of \n[[Page S5170]] being an American, if you just go out and renounce your \ncitizenship, we will give you 3.9 billion dollars' worth of tax \nwriteoffs.\n  Can you imagine anything more obscene or antipatriotic? They stand up \nthere and say, as they wave our flag, ``If you renounce your \ncitizenship, Mr. Billionaire, we will give you under the table a few \nbillion of American tax dollars.''\n  They are about as patriotic as they were serious about term limits. \nThe second they thought the bill might pass and they saw that term \nlimits would apply to them, immediately they backed away.\n  They were all out there calling for term limits. They said, ``We want \nterm limits. I have been here 32 years, saying that we need term \nlimits. I have been here 26 years, saying that we need term limits. I \ncannot understand why we don't get term limits. For decades I have been \narguing we should have term limits.'' Somebody said, ``Here. We have \nenough votes to apply it to your next election, immediately, to you.'' \n``Wait a minute. I do not mean term limits for me. I am pretty good. It \nis for the next guy.'' It is the same here with this patriotism.\n  We are giving these tax entitlements to the rich and to large \ncorporations by cutting aid to children and to low-income students who \nwant to stay in college, and by cutting the National Service Program, \nwhich provides scholarships. Children do not vote, and they have been \ntargeted for the worst cuts.\n  Who are the top 10 losers under the Contract With America? They are \nchildren. These are the people who lose: Newborn children, children who \ndrink tap water which will more likely be contaminated, children who \nbreathe air which will more likely be polluted, children who need child \ncare, children with mothers who work, children whose fathers are at \nwork, children who go to school, children who like hamburgers, children \nwho are not rich, children who eat, period. Children are the losers. \nThe contract is a contract not with America but against children.\n  Children who eat--the contract takes away food from hundreds of \nthousands of infants, homeless children and schoolchildren.\n  Children who are not rich--they are the ones who are going to pay for \nthe tax breaks for the rich.\n  Children who eat hamburgers are going to see the regulations on \nsalmonella- or E. coli-free food taken away.\n  Children who go to school will see their funding for educational \nprograms cut, funding for the Learn and Serve Program, funding for \nAmeriCorps scholarships all cut.\n  Children whose fathers work, if they lose their jobs, the safety net \nis gone.\n  Children with mothers who work, funding for child care is gone.\n  Children who need child care, their healthy food at child care is \ngone.\n  Clean air protection is gone.\n  Clean tap water, that is gone.\n  Newborn children--what I would say one more time is probably one of \nthe most egregious things in the Contract With America is they take \naway the requirement that the infant formula manufacturers have to be \ninvolved in competitive bidding. Some $1.1 billion is given to four \ngiant drug companies. I expect they are going to buy the tables at the \nnext big fundraiser which those who voted for that have. But as we give \nthem $1 billion, we also say to a million and a half pregnant women, \ninfants, and children, ``Sorry. We cannot afford to do anything for \nyou. But then, heck, you don't vote. You don't contribute, so it is \nOK.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, would you advise me of the amount of \ntime I am recognized for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5168-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5170-S5171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DRUG CARTEL\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, yesterday we had a hearing of the \nWestern Hemisphere Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  From time to time, in all the clutter of this city and all the issues \nthat we are addressing, something will break through and the magnitude \nof it is so significant that those who are in the presence of it come \nto a standstill. I would suggest that was the nature of the meeting \nheld yesterday in the early afternoon in the Senate Dirksen Building.\n  What was unfolding in the testimony by a very distinguished American \nwas that the United States--and, indeed, this hemisphere--is under \nattack by a grievous, evil, massively equipped enemy in the name of the \nCali cartel or Mafia, or drug lords running with abandon in this \nhemisphere.\n  There are five countries in this hemisphere that are at grave risk at \nthis very moment. One is the United States, the second is Mexico, the \nthird is Colombia, the fourth is Peru, and the fifth is Boliva; not to \nsuggest that there are not other countries in the hemisphere that fall \nprey to the circumstances, but these five countries in particular are \nembroiled in a massive confrontation with this Mafia drug organization.\n  Madam President, there is no other threat that more seriously \nchallenges the national security of the United States and of this \nhemisphere than these cartels, this Mafia, these drug lords. They are \nthreatening the lives and safety and welfare of the citizens of this \ncountry, the others I have mentioned, and this hemisphere. We are \nsuffering more casualties, Madam President, in the United States \nannually than we suffered in the entirety of the Vietnam war.\n  I would suggest, Madam President, that the fabric of democracy--this \nis a hemisphere of democracies--the fabric of democracy is threatened \nand at risk this very day in this confrontation with this evil force.\n  Let me just share with you for a moment, Madam President, the scope \nof the enemy we are confronting. This Mafia organization earns $12 to \n$15 billion in annual revenues. The cartel has the resources and the \nsophistication to penetrate every fabric of social, political, and \neconomic life in this hemisphere. They can literally buy countries. \nThese large criminal drug trafficking empires are better armed than \nmany police forces. They have more sophisticated equipment than many of \nthe armies of the hemisphere. The cartels have the money not only to \nbuy the best minds--MBA's, accountants, lawyers--they are buying police \nforces, judicial systems, and in some cases, governments.\n  They work around our past interdiction efforts, now flying large \ncargo jets, 727's, with up to 10 tons of cocaine into Mexico, where it \nis then distributed to the United States.\n  Madam President, I would like to share some of the remarks that we \nheard yesterday from, as I said, a very distinguished panel of \nAmericans.\n  First, from Ambassador Robert Gelbard, who is Assistant Secretary of \nState for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, a very \ndistinguished former Ambassador to Bolivia, very knowledgeable with \nthis entire subject. He said:\n\n       The spread of international narcotics trafficking \n     constitutes one of the most persistent and serious challenges \n     to America's foreign and domestic interests in the post-cold-\n     war era.\n\n  He went on to say that:\n\n       Cocaine consumption by casual users fell significantly \n     between 1985 and 1992.\n\n  But it is now on the rise again.\n  He says:\n\n       The potential for the problem to get worse is great.\n\n  And I would underscore that 100 times.\n  We heard from Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administer of the Drug \nEnforcement Agency. He says:\n\n       The technological capabilities of the Cali Mafia may very \n     well be impenetrable.\n\n  I repeat: It may very well be impenetrable.\n\n       The Cali Mafia has now formed a partnership with \n     transportation organizations in Mexico, with whom they work \n     hand in glove to smuggle increased amounts of drugs across \n     the U.S. border. Drug trafficking organizations in this \n     hemisphere continue to undermine legitimate governmental \n     institutions through corruption and intimidation. Here at \n     home, drug availability and purity of cocaine and heroine are \n     at an all-time high.\n\n  [[Page S5171]] Madam President, Mr. John Walters, who is president of \nthe New Citizenship Project and former Acting Director and Deputy \nDirector for Supply Reduction Office at the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy, says that:\n\n       Between 1977 and 1992, illegal drug use went from \n     fashionable and liberating to unfashionable and stupid. \n     Overall casual drug use by Americans dropped by more than \n     half between 1985 and 1992.\n\n  A period for which there was intense education about the damage of \ndrugs.\n\n       Monthly cocaine use declined by 78 percent.\n\n  That has turned around, Madam President, and now it is skyrocketing.\n\n       Last December, the University of Michigan announced that \n     drug use, particularly marijuana use, by 8th, 10th, and 12th \n     graders rose sharply in 1994, as it did in 1993 after a \n     decade of steady decline.\n\n  These are terribly alarming statistics, affecting the personal \ngeneral safety and welfare of our own citizens.\n  Madam President, let me share with you just for a moment the cost \nthat this represents to our fellow citizens in this country. Each year, \nthe drug cartels ship hundreds of tons of cocaine in the United States, \nkilling and maiming more Americans each year than died in all the years \nof engagement in Vietnam. And 2.5 percent of the live births in the \nUnited States are now cocaine crack exposed babies--100,000 per year. \nWe have had a lot of talk about children in this Chamber over the last \nfew hours and days. And yet, we seem to accept that 100,000 new babies \nare born as crack babies in the United States. Each year, the cartel \ndrains $70 to $140 billion in revenues out of the United States. That \nis $70 to $140 billion, Madam President. If this trend continues, \n820,000 children will try cocaine in their lifetime; 58,000 of them \nwill become regular users.\n  Well, Madam President, we can get caught up in the statistics, but \nthe point I am trying to make here this morning is that the United \nStates, Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru are all at grave risk and \nare being challenged openly and directly by a powerful, brutal force \nthat on a daily basis is costing the lives of our fellow citizens and \nare putting at jeopardy the very fabric of this democratic hemisphere.\n  Madam President, when we get into these discussions, there is a lot \nof fingerpointing. And there is certainly plenty of room to do that.\n  I do want to point out, as we address this issue, that in each of \nthese countries, there have been citizens who have fought valiantly--in \nthe United States, in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia--who have \nfought these problems, who have died fighting these problems. And my \nremarks in that sense are not incriminating. I applaud the efforts that \nhave been expended in our country and these others to address the \nproblem.\n  But the fact remains that we have not solved this issue and there are \ncircumstances in each of the countries that must be addressed. I would \nsuggest that a new focus needs to be brought to this crisis.\n  I would suggest the forming of a new alliance of these five \ncountries; that we must come to the table; that we must sit across the \ntable from one another and we must approach the new century by lifting \nthe bar, by lifting the standard of what we are going to achieve; that \nwe must set our sights, these countries directly affected, these \ncountries in the hemisphere must bring this era of abuse and attack on \nthe citizens of the hemisphere to an end.\n  I would suggest that we have the technology to remove the product, \nthe coca leaf, and we ought to do so as quickly as possible.\n  By the end of this century, the coca leaf should not be able to be \ngrown in the hemisphere.\n  I read from the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report \nissued in March of this year:\n\n       The United States, which has pinpointed the major growing \n     areas, has spray aircraft and a safe herbicide that can \n     destroy illegal cultivation in a matter of months. Since the \n     coca bush does not fully come on line until it is 18 months \n     or 2 years old, these simple measures could deprive the \n     cocaine trade of its basic material, crippling it, if not \n     destroying it entirely. We need the necessary cooperation of \n     the two largest coca growing countries to carry out this \n     simple but effective crop-control measure.\n\n  Madam President, we simply must set as a goal among these five \ncountries that we are going to eliminate this source of evil. We have \nthe technology to do it. We have the knowledge of where the product is. \nIt must be removed.\n  The chief kingpins behind these cartels are known and their locations \nare known and they must be arrested. Under the constitutional law of \neach of these countries, there are adequate provisions to arrest, \ndetain, and punish these individuals doing so much damage in our \ncountry and throughout the hemisphere.\n  We must seek special rights of extradition so that these criminals \ncan be brought to bay in the United States when they attack our \ncitizens, as they are doing.\n  This is a stealth issue. This is an issue that is pervasive. If any \nother country was pouring chemicals into the United States causing the \ndeath or maiming of hundreds of thousands of citizens on an annual \nbasis, it would not be tolerated. The whole Nation would rise up in \ndefense. And yet we are quietly proceeding reducing the resources to \nattack this problem.\n  I am going to close, but I will just say that it is time for a new \nfocus. I think these five major countries should come to the table. We \nneed to mutually agree on the end game that the product will be \neliminated, that the kingpins will be arrested and will understand that \nthey will be on the run for the rest of their lives, and that other \nappropriate measures of cooperation, extradition and other laws for \ninterdiction, and the like, will be put in place, and that once those \nstandards are mutually agreed upon and that this hemisphere will not \naccept degradation of democracy and an attack on the citizens, we will \nset the bar. People will either participate or we will know permanently \nthey are not cooperating.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia has 10 minutes to speak. Does the Senator from Georgia wish to \nyield?\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, I need to go ahead and make my remarks. I \nhave been waiting for some time, but I will certainly yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to make an inquiry if it is possible, that \nconcluding the remarks of the Senator from Georgia, I be permitted to \nspeak as in morning business not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIndiana [Mr. Coats] is scheduled for 10 minutes.

Madam President, in view of the recent attention to the \npolicy on homosexuality in the Armed Forces, Senator Coats and I would \nlike this morning to update the Senate on the status of the legislation \nwhich was enacted in 1993 as section 571 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1994. Both Senator Coats and I will \nbe speaking to this subject this morning. I think that our joint \nstatements certainly reflect the continuing bipartisan consensus in \nsupport of the basic legislation that was enacted in 1993.\n  This discussion is precipitated by the recent district court decision \nin Able versus the United States and the reaction to it. In my view, \nthe Able decision was not correctly decided. I believe it will be \nreversed on appeal, particularly in view of the unusual approach taken \nby the district judge in which he, in effect, drafted his own statute, \nmanufactured his own legislative purposes, and reviewed the policy \n[[Page S5172]] without regard to the standards articulated over a long \nperiod of years by the Supreme Court of the United States. And I will \nspeak further to each of those matters.\n  I believe that our legislative record is solid and the case will be \nreversed on appeal, and I do not see any need for further legislative \naction at this time.\n                               background\n\n  At the outset, I would like to summarize briefly the events which led \nto the enactment of this legislation. A more detailed discussion of \nthese events is in the committee's report on the legislation, Senate \nReport 103-112.\n  The prohibition on homosexual acts has been a longstanding element of \nmilitary law. The prohibition on service by gay men and lesbians has \nbeen covered in military regulations.\n  In September 1992, during the Senate's debate on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1993, Senator Howard Metzenbaum \noffered an amendment that would have established a ``prohibition on \ndiscrimination in the military on the basis of sexual orientation.'' I \nobserved that ``this subject deserves the greatest care and \nsensitivity'' and stated:\n\n       We will have hearings on the subject next year. We will \n     hear from all viewpoints, and we will take into consideration \n     the viewpoints of our military commanders, the viewpoints of \n     those in the homosexual community, the viewpoints of those \n     who are in uniform who may be homosexual, gay, and we will \n     also consider the men and women in uniform who are not in \n     that category and the effect it would have on military \n     morale.\n\n  Based upon the assurance that hearings would be held in 1993, Senator \nMetzenbaum withdrew his amendment.\n  During the 1992 election campaign, Presidential candidate Bill \nClinton said that, if elected, he would take action to change the \ncurrent policy restricting the service of gay men and lesbians serving \nin the Armed Forces. He also spoke of the need to consult carefully \nwith the military leadership on this issue. After the election, he \nreiterated his views on changing the policy and the need to consult \nwith the military leadership.\n  Secretary of Defense Aspin, during his confirmation proceedings in \nJanuary 1993, indicated that there would be extensive consultations \nwith Congress on this subject.\n  Shortly after the Inauguration, a series of media reports suggested \nthat a significant change in the Department's policy was imminent. A \nnumber of Senators indicated that they would offer an amendment early \nin the congressional session that would prohibit any change in policy. \nI expressed the view that neither the executive branch nor Congress \nshould institute a significant change in the current policy, by \nPresidential order or by congressional action, prior to undertaking a \ncomprehensive review, including hearings, on this subject.\n  In late January, I participated in a series of meetings with the \nPresident on the subject of homosexuality in the Armed Forces. Other \nparticipants included then-Senate majority leader George Mitchell and \nDemocratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In addition, \nI consulted extensively with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  As a result of these meetings and further discussions with the \nPresident, an interim policy was announced by the President on January \n29, 1993, to remain into effect until July 15, 1993. This interim \npolicy retained then-existing rules restricting the service of gay men \nand lesbians in the Armed Forces. The policy also set forth two \nmodifications that would apply during the interim period. First, \nreflecting a recommendation made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, new \nrecruits would not be questioned about homosexuality during the \nenlistment process. Second, gay and lesbian cases that did not involve \nhomosexual acts would be processed through separation from active duty, \nand the individual would be placed in a nonpay status in the Standby \nReserve during\n this interim period.\n\n  In additional, the President directed the Secretary of Defense to \nconduct a review of the current policy and to provide him with a draft \nExecutive order by July 15, 1993.\n  On February 4, 1993, during Senate consideration of the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, the Senate debated two amendments related to the \nservice of gay men and lesbians in the Armed Forces.\n  The first amendment would have frozen in law ``all Executive Orders, \nDepartment of Defense Directives, and regulations of the military \ndepartments concerning the appointment, enlistment, and induction, and \nthe retention, of homosexuals in the Armed Forces, as in effect on \nJanuary 1, 1993.'' The amendment was tabled by a vote of 62-37.\n  The Senate then unanimously adopted an amendment expressing the Sense \nof Congress that the Secretary of Defense should conduct ``a \ncomprehensive review of the current Department of Defense policy with \nrespect to the service of homosexuals in the Armed Forces.'' The \namendment further expressed the sense of Congress that the results of \nthe review should be reported to the President and Congress not later \nthan July 15, 1993. In addition, the amendment expressed the sense of \nCongress that the Senate Committee on Armed Services should conduct \ncomprehensive hearings on the current military policy and should \nconduct oversight hearings on the Secretary's recommendations as such \nare reported.\n  The amendment, as adopted, was enacted as section 601 of the Family \nand Medical Leave Act of 1993, Public Law 103-3. The Senate also agreed \nto an order that effectively precluded consideration of any further \namendments in the Senate relating to the service of gay men and \nlesbians in the Armed Forces until July 15, 1993. This procedure \npermitted the Department of Defense and the Committee on Armed Services \nto conduct their reviews prior to legislative action on specific \namendments.\n\n\n                            The legislation\n\n  Madam President, the legislation passed in Congress in 1993 contains \n15 findings, which address the constitutional role of Congress in \nestablishing military manpower policy, the unique nature of military \nservice, and the fact that the presence in the military of persons who \ndemonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would \ncreate an unacceptable risk to military capability.\n  The legislation codifies specific grounds for discharge--homosexual \nacts, statements, and marriages--reflecting DOD's longstanding policy \non homosexuality in the Armed Forces. The legislation also provides the \nSecretary of Defense with discretion to reinstate accession questioning \nif the Secretary determines it to be necessary to effectuate the \nrestrictions on homosexuality in the Armed Forces.\n  On February 28, 1994, the Department of Defense issued final \nregulations implementing the legislation.\n\n\n                             The Litigation\n\n  In the 13 months since the regulations were issued, there have been a \nnumber of judicial decisions addressing homosexuality in the Armed \nForces, but most have dealt with the old administrative rules rather \nthan the new legislation. The authority of the Armed Forces to \ndischarge members based upon homosexual acts has been routinely \nsustained by the courts, including those courts such as the ninth \ncircuit, that have\n questioned separation based on statements.\n\n  Two leading cases illustrate the differing approaches that the courts \nhave taken on the impact of statements. In Meinhold v. Department of \nDefense, 34 F.3d 1469 (9th Cir. 1994), a case arising under the old \npolicy, the ninth circuit held that a servicemember could not be \ndischarged solely because he or she said ``I am gay'' but could be \ndischarged for making a statement which ``manifests a concrete \nexpressed desire or intent to engage in homosexual acts.'' The court \nreached this conclusion based on its construction of the regulations, \nwhich make it unnecessary to decide any constitutional issue.\n  In Steffan v. Perry, 41 F. 3d 677 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the D.C. Circuit \nruled that the statement ``I am gay'' constituted sufficient evidence \nunder the regulations of a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual \nacts to justify a discharge. The court rejected any constitutional \nchallenge to a discharge based upon such a statement.\n  Last week, in a case arising under the new legislation, a judge in \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York took a \ndifferent approach. In Able versus United States, Judge Nickerson held \nthat the act and the implementing directives violate the first \namendment as a restriction on \n[[Page S5173]] speech and the fifth amendment as a denial of equal \nprotection. The judge's decision applies only to the six plaintiffs in \nthe case, and has no wider direct application. As a result, the \nlegislative policy remains in effect.\n  Madam President, to put this matter in perspective, there are over \n600 district court judges in the United States, and it was predictable \nsome district judge somewhere in the country would rule the statute \nunconstitutional. That does not mean though that the upper courts will \nuphold this. I made this point at the time the legislation was enacted. \nI also said that I believed the legislation would be sustained on \nappeal.\n  I am pleased that the Clinton administration has made it clear that \nit will appeal the Able decision, and I continue to believe that the \nlegislative policy will be sustained on appeal.\n  My confidence is even higher after reading the opinion. In my view, \nthe opinion does not reflect sound judicial craftsmanship or \nscholarship. The district court's opinion ignores the plain word of the \nstatute, misconstrues the legislative history, relies on speculation \nabout the purposes of the legislation rather than the clear words of \nthe statute, and fails to discuss circuit court opinions which take a \ncontrary view.\n  There are many flaws in the Able decision, which will undoubtedly be \nraised on appeal. Today, I will highlight some of the more egregious \nerrors from a congressional perspective.\n  First, the decision misstates the definition of homosexuality in the \nstatute and then proceeds to analyze the statute in terms of the \njudge's erroneous definition.\n  The opinion states:\n\n       The first question for the court is whether the Government \n     may under the first amendment prohibit a member of the \n     Services from stating that he or she is a homosexual, that \n     is, that he or she has ``an innate feeling within''--\n\n  I am emphasizing those words--\n\n     that indicates the status of a homosexual.\n\n  This completely ignores the specific conduct-based definition in the \nstatute, which provides:\n\n       The term ``homosexual'' means a person, regardless of sex, \n     who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to \n     engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts, and \n     includes the terms ``gay'' and ``lesbian''.\n\n  The statute talks about conduct, what a person does or intends to do.\n  We do not mention what the judge put so much emphasis on, that is, in \nhis words, ``an innate feeling within that indicates the status of a \nhomosexual''. That is nowhere in the statute. Judge Nickerson, in \neffect, rewrote the statute to conform to his own views of his concept \nof ``status.''\n  Second, the decision disregards the Supreme Court standard of review \nin military cases. As the Supreme Court stated in Rostker v. Goldberg, \n433 U.S. 57 (1981), ``judicial deference to * * * congressional \nexercise of authority is at its apogee when legislative action under \nthe congressional authority to raise and support armies and make rules \nand regulations for their governance is challenged.'' The Supreme Court \nemphasized that a court may not ``substitute [its] own evaluation of \nthe evidence for a reasonable evaluation by the legislative branch.''\n  The Able decision, however, is replete with the district court's \nevaluation of the testimony presented in congressional hearings, while \nignoring virtually all of the analysis presented by authoritative \nsources such as the committee's report.\n  Third, although the Able decision assumes there is no rational basis \nfor the presumption that a statement by an individual that he or she is \ngay indicates a likelihood that the service member engages in or will \nengage in homosexual acts, the court makes no attempt to address the \nopinions that are directly contrary in Steffan v. Perry, 41 F.3d 677 \n(D.C. Cir. 1994) and ben Shalom v. Marsh, 881 F.2d 454 (7th Cir. 1989), \ncert. denied 110 S.Ct. 1296 (1990), which found the presumption to be \nvalid.\n  It is a puzzle to me how a district court judge completely ignored--\nhe can disagree if he chooses--but how he completely ignored two \ncircuit court opinions on this subject.\n  Fourth, the Able decision bases its equal protection analysis on the \nunwarranted assumption that the legislation is based upon the \nirrational prejudice of service members against gays and lesbians. The \ndecision totally ignores the lengthy discussion of the issue of \nprejudice and stereotypes in the committee's report on the legislation, \nin which the committee concluded that ``our position on the service of \ngays and lesbians is not based upon stereotypes but on the impact in \nthe military setting of the conduct that is an integral element of \nhomosexuality.''\n  Fifth, instead of relying on the legislation and the committee \nreport, the Able decision manufactures its own view of the legislation. \nThe decision states:\n\n       Although the act's findings are silent as to the response \n     of heterosexuals to the presence of known homosexuals in the \n     services, the court will analyze the act as if it said that a \n     statement of homosexual status was in itself an evil because \n     heterosexuals would not like to hear it and would react so as \n     to damage unit cohesion.\n\n  Madam President, it is a very large leap from the Supreme Court's \ndecision in the Rostker case, which requires deference to Congress in \nthese matters, to the decision of the district court in Able, in which \nthe judge disregards the analysis provided by the committee and \nsubstitutes his own version of what he thinks motivated the Congress.\n  In summary, Madam President, the judge in Able has drafted his own \nstatute, manufactured his own legislative purposes, and reviewed the \npolicy without regard to the standards articulated by the Supreme \nCourt. That is not what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they \ndrafted a Constitution based upon the separation of powers.\n  Madam President, the media understandably have focused on the \ninflammatory language in the opinion, such as the suggestion that the \npolicy is ``Orwellian'' and that it ignores what ``Hitler taught the \nworld,'' in the judge's view.\n  The opinion is long on rhetoric and short on analysis. Speaker \nGingrich, in reaction, has raised the issue of whether we should reopen \nthe legislative debate and reinstate the policy that predated the \nlegislation.\n  In my view, Madam President, we should not do so. The policy on \nhomosexuality in the Armed Forces is on much stronger ground than it \nwas prior to enactment of this legislation. It is more likely to be \nsustained in the Supreme Court based on the law and the findings of \nCongress than if we went back to the old standards which were based on \nregulatory policy alone.\n  We have a strong legislative record, reflecting the common agreement \nof the civilian and military leadership of the Department of Defense, \nand of the Congress, that there is a clear military need for the policy \non homosexuality in the armed forces. We have a detailed set of \nlegislative findings, which we did not have prior to enactment, setting \nforth the basis for the policy. We have clear procedures for separation \nproceedings based upon homosexual acts, statements, and marriages.\n  The legislative policy is clearly consistent with the preexisting \nadministrative policy requiring separation on the basis of homosexual \nacts, statements, and marriages. The new policy, of course, makes a \nchange in previous practice in that the legislation does not require \nthe government to initiate questions to an individual about \nhomosexuality, and the regulations do not currently permit such \nquestions to be asked. As I noted earlier in my statement, the \nrecommendation to drop such questioning from the enlistment form was \nmade by the Joint Chiefs of Staff--our military leadership--based on \ntheir determination that the questioning was not necessary to \neffectuate the policy on homosexuality in the Armed Forces.\n  During our hearings, the military chiefs, when asked for their \npersonal opinions about this policy--General Powell, General Sullivan, \nAdmiral Kelso, General McPeak, General Mundy, and Admiral Jeremiah--\neach stated he supported the policy.\n  Each was also asked whether the policy could be implemented in a \nmanner consistent with morale, good order, with discipline, with unit \ncohesion, and without a degradation in readiness. Each responded that \nthe military could actually implement the policy without such adverse \neffects.\n  Mr. President, the policy in effect reflects the recommendations of \nthe military leadership, which were endorsed by the civilian leadership \nand \n[[Page S5174]] enacted by the Congress. Members on both sides of the \naisle worked closely to ensure that there was a solid legislative \nrecord based upon sound military requirements. The hearings were \nconducted with dignity and respect for all involved, and reflected a \nsober, careful analysis of a very difficult time.\n  In my judgment, Mr. President, there is no need at this time for any \nlegislative action. The policy is in place. The policy is working. I do \nnot believe that the opinion in the Able case will survive appellate \njudicial scrutiny, particularly in light of the clear legislative \nfindings and sound congressional action reflected in the statute. There \nis no call on the part of our military leadership for change. On the \ncontrary, they believe the policy is working well. Moreover, if they \ncome to the conclusion in the future that it is necessary to reinstate \nquestioning, the statute gives the Department of Defense the authority \nto do so without further legislative action. In the absence of evidence \nthat a legislative change is needed, it is my recommendation that the \nCongress take no further legislative action at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. According to the previous order, the Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his \nstatement, and hopefully this will complement that statement. I will \nattempt not to repeat in areas that he has already addressed.\n  Section 654(b)(2) of title 10, United States Code, governing military \nmatters states that a member of the Armed Forces shall be separated \nfrom the Armed Forces if it is appropriately determined:\n\n       (2) that the member has stated that he or she is a \n     homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there \n     is a further finding, made and approved in accordance with \n     procedures set forth in the regulations, that the member has \n     demonstrated that he or she is not a person who engages in, \n     attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or \n     intends to engage in homosexual acts.\n\n  The law defines a ``homosexual'' as:\n\n     a person, regardless of sex, who engages in, attempts to \n     engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to \n     engage in homosexual acts, and includes the terms ``gay'' and \n     ``lesbian.''\n\n  On Thursday of last week, in the case of Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able \net al. versus United States of America, Judge Eugene H. Nickerson, a \nFederal district court judge sitting in Brooklyn, ruled that the \nportion of the current homosexual policy contained in title 10, United \nStates Code, section 654(b)(2) and its implementing directives, which \naddresses statements by individuals, violates the first and fifth \namendments of the Constitution.\n  This court decision is the first one involving the current policy on \nhomosexuals in the military.\n  Judge Nickerson's ruling allows six self-proclaimed homosexuals to \nremain on active duty. These six individuals originally filed the suit \nanonymously and only stated that they were gay.\n  The issue of whether an individual has a protected right to state \nthey are a homosexual has already been decided by the courts. \nDeclaration of one's homosexuality cannot be logically separated from \nhomosexual acts under free speech. The Senate report on the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994 which accompanied the \nnew statute cited the case of Ben Shalom versus Marsh:\n\n       The admission is not a statement protected by the free \n     speech guarantees of the First Amendment because it can \n     rationally and reasonably be viewed as reliable evidence of a \n     desire and propensity to engage in homosexual conduct.\n\n  That case goes on to say:\n\n       The Army does not have to take the risk that an admitted \n     homosexual will not commit homosexual acts that will be \n     detrimental to its assigned mission.\n\n  To be very basic, the courts have ruled that if you say you are a \nsoprano, people can logically conclude that you sing. Judge Nickerson's \ndecision clearly rejects longstanding court precedent. It is early in \nthe judicial process, but I am confident that the constitutionality of \nthe current policy will prevail.\n  In 1993, the Senate began its investigation of what effect \nhomosexuals have on the military. It held hearings on March 29 and 31; \nApril 29; May 7, 10, and 11 and July 20, 21, and 22. Testimony was \ngathered from soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. The Secretary of \nthe Department of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nalso appeared before the Armed Services Committee and gave extensive \ntestimony from their knowledge of the Armed Forces. There were panels \nof witnesses from the academic community, as well as from the Senate. \nThe committee also heard from active and retired military officers and \nenlisted personnel, homosexuals who had been discharged from the \nservices and members of the military and civilian legal community. \nLiterally hundreds of hours of research were conducted. The chairman \nand ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee both \ndedicated themselves to the most comprehensive examination of this \nissue that has ever been conducted. Their efforts took them to military \ninstallations and onto ships and submarines. This issue was also \ndebated by the committee with the House Armed Services Committee and \ndiscussed with members of the administration on several occasions.\n  All of the committee's efforts made one thing abundantly clear. It \nwas best pointed out in General Powell's testimony before the \ncommittee.\n  I would like to take just a moment of the Senate's time to go over \nGeneral Powell's statements because they were extremely valuable to the \ndecision procession of the committee of the Congress and the \nadministration. Let me now quote from that testimony.\n\n       We have challenged our own assumptions. We have challenged \n     the history of this issue. We have argued with each other. We \n     have consulted with our commanders at every level, from \n     lieutenant (and) ensign all the way up to the commander in \n     chief(s) of the various theaters. We have talked to our \n     enlisted troops. We talked to the family members who are part \n     of the armed services team. We examined the arguments \n     carefully of those who are on the other side of the issue \n     from us.\n\n  After all this work by the Department of Defense, General Powell \nconcludes as follows:\n\n       The presence of open homosexuality would have an \n     unacceptable detrimental and disruptive impact on the \n     cohesion, morale, and esprit of the armed forces.\n\n  In short, trained, successful, intelligent, experienced military and \ncivilian personnel are of the opinion that admitting homosexual \nindividuals to the military will rob our forces of the most essential \nelement of a fighting force; its cohesion, morale, and esprit. Is this \nan irrational conclusion? General Powell eloquently addressed this as \nwell. He stated:\n\n       Unlike race or gender, sexuality is not a benign trait. It \n     is manifested by behavior. While it would be decidedly biased \n     to assume certain behaviors based on gender or membership in \n     a particular racial group, the same is not true for \n     sexuality.\n\n  On November 30, 1993, 10 months after this effort began, the \nPresident signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n1994 which contained the new policy at section 571.\n  The act codified the military's longstanding ban on homosexuals \nserving in the military. It was not the result of a knee jerk reaction \nbut the steady work of the U.S. Congress which took into full \nconsideration the needs of the services and the rights of individuals. \nJudge Nickerson's ruling is the ruling of a single judge in a single \ndistrict and is not the consensus of the judicial community as a whole. \nIt is not unusual for a case to be lost at the district level. The \ncircuit courts are full of cases being appealed from district courts. \nThe White House, the Department of Justice, and the Department of \nDefense all agree that an appeal is in order and will take place this \nsummer. Many appeals are met with decisions which reverse the lower \ncourts. We recently witnessed just such a reversal in the case of \nJoseph E. Steffan.\n  The law of the land is quite clear. In addressing this matter, \nCongress exercised its Constitutional prerogative, section 8, U.S. \nConstitution to--\n\n       * * * raise and support Armies, * * * provide and maintain \n     a Navy, * * * and * * * to make Rules for the Government and \n     Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\n\n  In the process, Congress made a number of findings:\n  First, there is no constitutional right to serve in the Armed Forces.\n  Second, pursuant to the powers conferred by section 8 of article I of \nthe Constitution of the United States, it lies within the discretion of \nCongress \n[[Page S5175]] to establish qualifications for and conditions of \nservice in the Armed Forces.\n  Third, the primary purpose of the Armed Forces is to prepare for and \nto prevail in combat should the need arise.\n  Fourth, the conduct of military operations requires members of the \nArmed Forces to make extraordinary sacrifices, including the ultimate \nsacrifice, in order to provide for the common defense.\n  Fifth, success in combat requires military units that are \ncharacterized by high morale, good order and discipline, and unit \ncohesion.\n  Sixth, one of the most critical elements in combat capability is unit \ncohesion; that is, the bonds of trust among individual service members \nthat make the combat effectiveness of the individual unit members.\n  Seventh, military life is fundamentally different from civilian life \nin that--\n  The extraordinary responsibilities of the Armed Forces, the unique \nconditions of military service, and the critical role of unit cohesion, \nrequire that the military community, while subject to civilian control, \nexist as a specialized society; and\n  The military society is characterized by its own laws, rules, \ncustoms, and traditions, including numerous restrictions on personal \nbehavior, that would not be acceptable in civilian society.\n  Eighth, the standards of conduct for members of the Armed Forces \nregulate a member's life for 24 hours each day beginning at the moment \nthe member enters military status and not ending until that person is \ndischarged or otherwise separated from the Armed Forces.\n  Ninth, those standards of conduct, including the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice, apply to a member has a military status, whether the \nmember is on duty or off duty.\n  Tenth, the pervasive application of the standards of conduct is \nnecessary because members of the Armed Forces must be ready at all \ntimes for worldwide deployment to a combat environment.\n  Eleventh, the worldwide deployment of U.S. military forces, the \ninternational responsibilities of the United States, and the potential \nfor involvement of the Armed Forces involuntarily to accept living \nconditions and working conditions that are often spartan, primitive, \nand characterized by forced intimacy with little or no privacy.\n  Twelfth, the prohibition against homosexual conduct is a long-\nstanding element of military law that continues to be necessary in the \nunique circumstances of military service.\n  Thirteenth, the Armed Forces must maintain personnel policies that \nexclude persons whose presence in the Armed Forces would create an \nunacceptable risk to the Armed Forces' high standards of morale, good \norder and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of \nmilitary capability.\n  Fourteenth, the presence in the Armed Forces of persons who \ndemonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would \ncreate an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order \nand discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military \ncapability.\n  If there is any remaining confusion about the policy, the Department \nof Defense should ensure that all directives, implementing regulations, \nand teaching manuals are crystal clear. Homosexuality is incompatible \nwith military service. Homosexuality has always been, and continues to \nbe defined by conduct. Speech is conduct, for it is rational to \nconclude that members of the military who say they are homosexuals have \na propensity to engage in conduct. The military should not be made to \nbear the risk.\n  I fully anticipate that the Supreme Court will carefully review the \nbody of work Congress placed into law. I believe that the strong policy \nset forth in 10 United States Code section 654 will fully meet the \nconstitutional test.\n  I agree with Senator Nunn that no additional legislation is needed at \nthis time. The law is sufficient. I am confident the court will uphold \nthat law.\n  Obviously we would tend to closely monitor these judicial \nproceedings, the implementation of department regulations, and the \nadministration's defense of the current law. But the current law is \nsufficient, in my opinion. I would just assure my colleagues that we \nintend to pay very close attention to the implementation of that law--\nas was clearly expressed with solid majority support of this Congress, \nwith the support of this administration.\n  I ask the Senator from Georgia if he has any additional comments?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I wanted to thank the Senator from Indiana \nfor his statement this morning, which shows that we have a united view \nhere. I know the Chair, the Senator from South Carolina, the chairman \nof the committee, also agrees with our view and has made that clear in \nhis statement. So I think we have very strong consensus in our \ncommittee. I thank the Senator from Indiana for the tremendous amount \nof work he has done on this issue over the last years. He has been an \nextraordinary partner in dealing with a very difficult, sensitive \nissue, but one that is important to the U.S. military and our national \nsecurity. So I thank him very much for his support.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. Without his leadership I do not \nbelieve we could have been successful. It has truly been a bipartisan \neffort and the then-chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee's \nleadership was invaluable to this process.\n  As I said it was the most extensive set of hearings and extensive \ninvestigation ever conducted on this subject or perhaps any other \nsubject. That has been placed as a matter of record and is part of the \nlaw. I thank him for his support and leadership.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Judge Eugene H. Nickerson, a district \njudge for the Eastern District of New York, has rendered a decision in \nthe Able versus United States case that declares a portion of the don't \nask-don't tell policy in violation of the first and fifth amendments to \nthe Constitution as it relates to six plaintiffs. While this is a \nnarrow ruling, it is also, in my opinion, an incorrect ruling and must \nbe appealed to the second circuit court. I have been assured by the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Justice that an appeal is \nbeing formulated and briefs will be filed in a timely manner. A \ndecision from the second circuit could come as early as this fall.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate worked hard to \ncraft a constitutional policy that protects individual rights and yet \nprovides our fighting men and women with the right kind of environment \nin which to build the highest morale, discipline, and esprit in their \nunits. I wish to remind all of you that we bear a tremendous \nresponsibility to our men and women in uniform. They rely on us to make \ncertain they are given every opportunity to survive in combat. It is \nour responsibility to provide them the best places to train and live, \nthe best equipment possible and the very finest in care for their \nfamilies. In addition, we must not do anything that could reduce the \nsoldiers' most valuable asset--unit cohesion.\n  Today, Senator Nunn, Senator Coats, and I are addressing this recent \ncourt decision. We worked long hours producing the current policy and \nboth of them agree with me that we need to let the judicial system \ncomplete its process. I am confident that the final decision will \nuphold the constitutionality of the new policy and that it will serve \nthe military well.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5171-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5175-S5176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 849\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, I am down here on the floor of the Senate \nthis morning, almost this afternoon, to talk about the celebration that \nis going to take place here at the Capitol by the Republicans on the \nHouse side, based on the 100 days after their so-called contract for \nAmerica.\n  They are bringing the circus to town for this celebration. In one \nway, I think it is appropriate that they bring the circus to town \nbecause, as I watch the proceedings, part of my heart is still in the \nHouse of Representatives. I served their proudly for 10 years. It has \nbeen pandemonium over there, in one Senator's view; a barrage of \nactivity into the wee hours of the morning. And, in my view, in many of \nthese areas they have just gone too far, too fast, too sloppily. I \nthink proof of that is the fact that the Senate has slowed down their \nmomentum and I believe we will continue to do this as reasonable people \nin this body, regardless of party, look at their activity, think about \ntheir activity, review their decisions, and come up with more \nreasonable legislation.\n  An example of that, they sent over a moratorium bill which would have \nstopped regulations--all kinds of important safety regulations, for \nexample--from going into effect. And this Senate never even took it up. \nThey put forward a very sensible approach to regulations. That is just \none example of how the Senate is slowing down the contract for America.\n  So in one way it is appropriate that the circus is coming to town. \nBut on another level it is inappropriate because who loves the circus \nthe most? Kids. And who gets hurt the most by the contract? Kids.\n  So, in some ways, to me, there is a real irony in bringing the circus \nto town and the kids to the circus to celebrate the contract which \nhurts the kids--perhaps more than any other group, although many of us \nget hurt by this contract.\n  Why do I say it is the kids had who get hurt? This is not rhetoric. \nThis is not overstatement. This is fact.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the cuts just \nin these rescission bills that are asked for, by the Republicans, that \ncut out kids, that hurt kids.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this document printed in the Record \nat this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement on S. 617, Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions--\n                          Impact on California\n\n                       (By Senator Barbara Boxer)\n\n       S. 617 as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee \n     is a classic Hobson's Choice for California. My state stands \n     in line at the livery stable, waiting for a horse to hire. \n     When she gets to the stable door, the man in charge says \n     ``take this one or none''. The problem is, the horse offered \n     is a dangerous and destructive outlaw, one that's sure to \n     throw her. So what does she do? Take the one offered so that \n     she can get where she's going? Or reject it and walk? Mr. \n     President, I conclude that California should reject this nag \n     and take a walk.\n       The amendment offered by the Senator from Maryland, Senator \n     Mikulski, is a far better alternative, and I am happy to have \n     the chance to support it.\n       Let me explain for the record a few of the most egregious \n     examples of why the bill as reported is a bad deal for my \n     state.\n\n\n          community development financial institutions (CDFI)\n\n       The bill would rescind $124 million of the Fund's $125 \n     million appropriation for FY 1995.\n       The CDFI Fund is important to California. More than 20 \n     established CDFIs serve California citizens that otherwise \n     would have no access to lending or financial services.\n       For example, the Low Income Housing Fund (LIHF), a large \n     CDFI based in San Francisco, works to increase the amount of \n     capital available for the development of affordable housing. \n     The LIHF serves a wide range of financing needs that are not \n     typically met by other lenders, including construction and \n     gap financing and interest rate subsidies.\n       There are several new California CDFI's that are currently \n     in the process of formation. For example, the Neighborhood \n     Bancorp., a San Diego CDFI, was recently granted a charter \n     from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and is \n     raising capital from private investors.\n       The Fund helps these institutions raise the capital they \n     need to provide services to distressed communities in \n     California and across the nation.\n       The Fund was established last year. It got unanimous \n     approval in the Senate and was passed by a vote of 410-12 in \n     the House.\n       The Senate bill also rescinds:\n       $47 million from the Economic Development Administration \n     (EDA). This program funds general economic development \n     planning and infrastructure. Historically, California \n     receives about 15% of EDA funds, or about $6 million. \n     Communities use EDA grants to improve economic \n     competitiveness and create jobs.\n       $27 million from the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology (NIST). Funds would be cut from the Manufacturing \n     Extension Partnership Program (MEP), which provides small and \n     medium sized companies with manufacturing assistance. The MEP \n     is based on the highly successful Agriculture Extension \n     program. There are currently MEP centers in Southern \n     California that provide assistance to defense contractors \n     seeking to diversify their businesses. Also, we hope to \n     introduce a MEP in the Bay Area soon.\n       $93.5 million from the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) \n     Account for 1993. This program funds closure related expenses \n     for bases scheduled for closure in 1993. In California, such \n     bases include the Alameda Naval Complex and the Mare Island \n     Shipyard. The BRAC account funds environmental cleanup costs, \n     moving costs, and new construction costs at bases receiving \n     workload. The exact impact of this rescission is impossible \n     to determine, but it is reasonable to worry that this \n     rescission could delay the closing of California military \n     bases.\n\n\n                        environmental protection\n\n       The Committee bill would cut $1.2 billion from water \n     cleanup infrastructure funding. $799 million of this cut \n     would come from grant money to the States to help them \n     establish revolving loan funds to finance drinking water \n     improvements. This funding would be available to the states \n     once Congress authorizes such state funds in a new Safe \n     Drinking Water Act. The remaining $433 million would come \n     from funds set aside for specific projects.\n       California's share of the drinking water fund under the \n     current allocation formula would be $57 million. Specific \n     California projects that would loose their FY95 funding \n     include City of LA ($50 million), Mojave Water Agency ($10 \n     million), Lake County ($2 million). California communities \n     whose projects would be spared include San Diego, San \n     Francisco, County of LA, Tijuana, and border cleanup near the \n     New River.\n       The Committee bill would cut $100 million from the \n     Superfund program. This cut would significantly slow cleanups \n     at many of California's 96 Superfund sites, including the 18 \n     closing and operational military bases on the Superfund list.\n\n\n                              agriculture\n\n       The Committee bill would cut $1.5 million from a new USDA \n     salinity research lab at the University of California at \n     Riverside. This lab is designed to grapple with salinity and \n     other runoff problems endemic to the kind of irrigated \n     agriculture that dominates California agriculture. Such a \n     funding cut would prevent the installation of the new labs \n     equipment.\n\n\n                           natural resources\n\n       The Committee bill would cut $3 million from the Fish & \n     Wildlife Service, effectively barring new listings of animal \n     and plant species as ``endangered'' or ``threatened'' under \n     the Endangered Species Act.\n       Timber Rider: An amendment attached to the bill would \n     require the Forest Service (under USDA) and the Bureau of \n     Land Management (under the DoI) to sharply increase ``salvage \n     logging'' in western forests. Unlike the House version of \n     this language, the Committee bill would not require a \n     particular cut level. It would, however, effectively waive \n     several important environmental safeguards.\n       Forest health is a problem in California and throughout the \n     west, but this extreme approach threatens both forest ecology \n     and cooperative efforts like the Quincy Library Group.\n\n\n                                 energy\n\n       The Committee bill would cut $48 million from the \n     Department of Energy's programs to boost energy efficiency. \n     DoE cannot give a precise breakdown of how much of this \n     funding California would loose, but the amount would be \n     significant because of California's leadership position on \n     the development and use of these technologies.\n       This includes a proposed $10 million cut from the program \n     used by federal agencies to weatherize low income homes--a \n     cut that will mean about 240 fewer weatherized homes under \n     this program in California.\n       This also includes a $5 million cut from the Clean Cities \n     Program which supports the purchase of clean vehicles by \n     federal agencies to match such purchases by cities. The \n     California cities affected by this lost funding include, \n     Fresno, Sacramento, San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, and \n     Long Beach.\n       The Committee bill would cut $35 million from solar and \n     renewable energy research \n     [[Page S5177]] and commercialization programs. DOE cannot \n     give a precise breakdown of how much of this funding \n     California would lose, but the amount would be significant \n     because of California's leadership position on the \n     development and use of these technologies.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n       $55.8 million would be rescinded from grants for state \n     reform initiatives under the Goals 2000 law. California would \n     lose over $6 million in federal funds which were to be used \n     for innovative programs emphasizing math and reading.\n       $72.5 million in Title I finds for educating disadvantaged \n     children. Title I funds are distributed by formula according \n     to the number of poor children in a school district. \n     California would lose $8.7 million in federal funds, \n     affecting services to approximately 8,500 California \n     students.\n       $100 million for the Safe and Drug Free Schools program for \n     drug prevention and safety measures. California would lose \n     $10 million. 97% of all school districts in California \n     benefit from this program.\n       $69 million for teacher training under the Eisenhower \n     Professional Development Program, which has a special \n     emphasis on training in the areas of math and science. \n     California would lose $7.6 million in funds.\n       $5 million for education technology programs to bring more \n     computers to the classroom and help schools purchase \n     software. California ranks 50th in the nation on the number \n     of schools with computers in the classroom. California loses \n     $500,000 in funds.\n\n\n                                Children\n\n       $42 million for Head Start, a comprehensive preschool \n     program for low-income children that combines learning with \n     social services and parental involvement. Approximately 9,000 \n     children nationwide would lose services.\n       $8.4 million for the Child Care and Development Block Grant \n     which provides funding to states to increase the \n     availability, affordability and quality of child care. \n     California would lose approximately $840,000 and 240 \n     California families would not get child care.\n       In San Diego County alone there are 11,633 families\n        eligible for child care assistance under the block grant, \n     but only funding for 1,646 children. The odds of getting \n     off the child care waiting list are 1 in 14.\n       $35 million for WIC which provides nutrition counseling and \n     food packages to pregnant and post partum women and young \n     children through age 4. This cut won't remove any women and \n     children from the rolls, but it will impede the expansion of \n     the program. California would lose $6.7 million in funds and \n     would be unable to expand the program to serve an additional \n     20,000 women and children.\n\n\n                            national service\n\n       $210 million for national service programs, the largest of \n     which is AmeriCorps. Federal funds go directly to the states \n     to support locally designed and operated programs addressing \n     unmet needs in the areas of education, public safety, health, \n     housing and the environment.\n       AmeriCorps members serve roughly 1,700 hours full-time over \n     a year and receive an education award worth $4,725 which may \n     be used to pay for current or future college and graduate \n     school tuition, job training, or to repay existing student \n     loans.\n       A cut of this size would severely impact the AmeriCorps \n     program by eliminating over 2,000 slots nationwide. In \n     California alone there are 2500 AmeriCorps members serving in \n     approximately 18 programs throughout the state.\n\n\n                     housing and urban development\n\n                           Rental assistance\n\n       The Senate bill would rescind $2.4 billion from incremental \n     Section 8 vouchers and certificates. California would receive \n     a rescission of approximately $300 million--denying \n     approximately 6,000 low-income families in the state housing \n     assistance. Many of these families have been on wait lists \n     for years.\n       The money rescinded was to be used for incremental \n     increases in housing vouchers and certificates--nationally, \n     62,000 new households would have been able to get housing \n     with this funding. HUD had set aside 12,000 certificates for \n     women with children who are homeless--the fastest growing \n     part of the homeless population. An additional 3,000 \n     certificates (nationally) were to be used for housing \n     assistance for homeless people suffering from the AIDS virus.\n                      Public housing modernization\n\n       The Senate would rescind $835 million for public housing \n     modernization. HUD estimates that Public Housing Authorities \n     in California would lose $37.9 million under the rescission. \n     Without the modernization money Public Housing authorities \n     would be unable to upgrade below-standard housing.\n\n\n                       health and human services\n\n          State legalization impact assistance grants (SLIAG)\n\n       $6 million would be rescinded under the Senate bill--no \n     similar rescission was made in the House bill. It is \n     estimated that California would likely receive at least 40 \n     percent of the money. The money would be used to promote \n     naturalization and citizenship for the immigrants legalized \n     under IRCA, by providing for civics and English education.\n\n                          Immigrant education\n\n       Immigrant education programs would be cut by $11 million \n     nationally. No similar rescission was made in the House bill. \n     California would receive $4.4 million of this amount. The \n     money is used to provide assistance to local educational \n     agencies that have large numbers of recently arrived \n     immigrant children--this includes legal and illegal immigrant \n     children. States like California are the large beneficiaries \n     of the program because of the large influx of immigrant \n     populations. No ``head counting'' of children is required for \n     the local educational agency to receive funding. In a sense, \n     this program is a reimbursement to states to help offset the \n     cost of providing education to illegal immigrant children \n     since no distinction is made between them and legal immigrant \n     children.\n\n\n                                  jobs\n\n       The Senate makes bigger cuts in Job Corps than the House, \n     eliminating 12 new centers, including those planned in San \n     Francisco and Long Beach.\n       The Senate bill does not rescind money for the 1995 summer \n     youth jobs, but does eliminate $871.5 million for 1996 summer \n     youth jobs. California is due to receive $147 million for \n     next summer.\n       Both House and Senate bills eliminate the Youth Fair Chance \n     program, which provides grants for education and job training \n     to poor youth in communities with high poverty. Los Angeles \n     was due to receive $2 million and Fresno $1 million under the \n     $24.8 million program nationwide.\n       Both House and Senate bills cut adult job training programs\n        by $33 million of which $5.5 million would be rescinded \n     from California programs.\n       The Senate bill rescinds $472 million from the year-round \n     program for youth job training, higher than the House \n     rescission of $310 million. Based on the impact to California \n     from the House level ($53 million), the impact to the state \n     from the higher Senate level would be about $80 million.\n\n\n                      Department of transportation\n\n       The bill cuts $1.3 billion in airport improvement funds, \n     which are used for runway construction, signals and other \n     airport improvements. The funds are fully discretionary so no \n     specific California project is targeted. However, California \n     received about 8.7 percent in FY93. Applying that proportion \n     for FY95 would mean $113 million less for California.\n       Although the Senate bill eliminates fewer California \n     transit projects than the House bill, it would still take \n     $1.9 million from San Diego commuter rail, $8 million from \n     San Jose commuter rail and $1.76 million for the Vallejo \n     Ferry.\n       The Senate bill rescinds $2 million from the Vessel Traffic \n     System, an updated traffic control system that would be \n     installed in San Francisco and Los Angeles-Long Beach. A $4 \n     million Coast Guard support center at the LA-Long Beach ports \n     complex is also rescinded.\n\n\n                           corps of engineers\n\n       The Senate bill increases the amount rescinded for Corps of \n     Engineers construction from $40 million to $50 million. No \n     state breakdown is available but this is a major account for \n     California.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let us look at some of them. Head Start? I \nthought we had a national consensus in this country that Head Start \nworks. I thought we had a bipartisan agreement that investing in our \nchildren at a young and tender age to get them on the right road to \nlearning worked.\n  Well, they cut Head Start. They cut the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram. As a matter of fact, they basically end the program. What did \nthis program do? It gave nutrition to pregnant women who could not get \nthat nutrition.\n  I said on the floor yesterday, I am so proud I am going to become a \ngrandmother for the first time.\n  I call my daughter every day. ``Did you take your vitamins? Are you \neating well? Are you gaining weight? Are you taking care of yourself?'' \nShe has the best care because she is fortunate to have insurance.\n  What about the other pregnant women? They are bringing children into \nthis world, into America. Do we not want them to be strong to avoid \nhaving to be in an incubator, to avoid having to have learning \ndisabilities because they did not have prenatal care? I thought we had \na consensus, a bipartisan lead, on that question. But no. They actually \nend the WIC Program as a national program, and they will let the States \ndecide how they are going to do this. And by the way, competitive \nbidding goes out the window. It is a giveaway to the largest infant \nformula companies--the winners in that one.\n  Drug free schools? I thought we had consensus on drug free schools. \nThe police come in and they work in the Dare Program and teach the kids \nto say no to drugs. They cut that. They are proud of that. They are \nbringing the circus to town to celebrate that they are cutting drug \nfree schools.\n   [[Page S5178]] School-to-Work Program--getting kids ready to go to \nwork, those who do not go off to college. They cut that. They cut \nAmeriCorps. They kill the AmeriCorps Program. What is it? National \nyouth service. I thought we had bipartisan consensus here in the Senate \nwhen we voted for AmeriCorps. Our young people go into the community. I \nhave met these AmeriCorps volunteers. They work with the children. They \nwork with the elderly. I even got a letter from the Red Cross saying, \n``Please don't cut the AmeriCorps program.'' I am forwarding that to \nthe majority leader because I know he likes the Red Cross. They use \nAmeriCorps volunteers. But they are going to eliminate AmeriCorps.\n  Summer youth jobs--jobs to teach our young people how important it is \nto be responsible. They cut that. They even want to do away with the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting where our little kids could get \nquality programming like ``Sesame Street'', and ``Barney'', and the \nothers, and zero out the National Endowment for the Arts that teaches \nthose kids the arts, ballet, and music instruction. They are bringing \nthe circus to town to celebrate their attack on the kids.\n  Do you know what the cruelest one of all is, throwing hundreds of \nthousands of disabled kids right off the roll, kids that would bring \ntears to your eyes. But they are bringing the circus to town.\n  Who is benefiting from all of these cuts?\n  I went to one school lunch program. A little kid came up to me. I \nwill never forget it as long as I live. She said ``Senator, when they \ncut my school lunch program, where is the money going that they are \nsaving?'' What a smart kid. What a smart kid. That is the question all \nof America should ask.\n  Where is the money going when you cut these programs? I have the \nanswer. It is being voted on, as we speak, in the House. Do you know \nwhat the answer is? It is tax breaks for the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. Hurt the kids, help the rich. That is the Republican contract. \nI will show you the chart. More than 50 percent of their tax cut goes \nto people over $100,000. A third of the tax cut goes to those earning \nover $200,000 a year. Who gets hurt? The kids, the middle class, the \npoor, Robin Hood in reverse, my friend.\n  How about the billionaire tax loophole? I have to tell you about this \none. The Senate voted to eliminate a tax loophole that went like this. \nIf you are a millionaire or a billionaire under the current Tax Code \nyou can take all the money you earned and all the assets you have that \nyou earned in America, you can renounce your citizenship, give up your \ncitizenship as a citizen of the United States of America, get out of \ntown and not pay a tax--tax dodgers who are millionaires, billionaires, \nand trillionaires. Those folks ought to go to the circus. They have a \nlot to celebrate--not the kids. But I do not think they are going to \ncome out because they do not want anyone to know about this contract. \nIt is not in their best interest. It is unbelievable to me that people \nwould celebrate such a program.\n  Let us talk about some of the other winners and losers. How about the \nso-called legal reform? You know about the doctor who cut off the wrong \nleg of a patient? You read about that. You know about corporations?\n  You know about corporations that produce dangerous products like \nsilicon breast implants, the Dalkon shield, intrauterine devices that \nmake women sterile. Devices that hurt women, maim them, kill them. \nWell, under the so-called Reform Act, we cap the punitive damages on \nthose corporations, so there will no longer be a deterrent out there to \nstop this.\n  How about the other legal reform? You all know about Charles Keating, \nhow he called the senior citizens in and sold them a bill of goods. \nThey thought their investments were secure. They thought their \ninvestments were federally insured. They were not, and they lost \neverything.\n  Well, under the so-called Legal Reform Act, by the Republicans, the \nvictims of Charles Keating could never even get into the courtroom. \nFortunately, for them, when Charles Keating stole their life savings, \nthe Democrats were in charge of the Congress and we allowed them in the \ncourtroom, and they collected. But now, under this contract, if you are \na small investor, you can forget it. Your rights, if this Republican \nbill goes forward, will have been trampled. I think we will stop it in \nthe Senate, but that is what they are celebrating over there, with the \ncircus.\n  Corporate polluters are celebrating, too, because in that contract \nthere is hidden language about a moratorium on regulations that will \nmake our water safe and our air clean. We have had people die of a \nbacteria called cryptosporidium that got into the water supply. We have \nrules to control the water supply so no one else will die from that \nbacteria. Those controls would be stopped by the Republican contract, \nand they could keep on with these practices.\n  You know about the kids who ate hamburger meat and died from E. coli \nbacteria. There are rules to stop that. And the Republican contract \nsays forget about those rules; let us have a moratorium.\n  So who wins? The polluters. Who loses? The people. And the \nRepublicans are celebrating with the circus.\n  How about the flying public? We fly a lot here in airplanes. That \nmoratorium over there in the contract would stop the FAA from issuing \nsafety regulations.\n  We know that the safety of certain commuter airlines must be \nimproved. There are several rules that have been proposed to bring them \nup to the standards of the larger planes, and in the Republican \ncontract and what passed in the House, those rules would be stopped.\n  Let me tell you what else would be stopped:\n\n       Inspection and repair of landing gear brakes for certain \n     Airbus aircraft.\n\n  Airbus is an aircraft that is made in France. This rule was prompted \nby an accident in which an aircraft was unable to stop on a wet runway. \nThe proposed regulation would ensure the safety of these aircraft, but \nthe Republicans want it stopped. Who is the winner if that regulation \nis blocked? Airbus. Who is the loser? Any of us who get on those \nplanes.\n  How about this regulation that would have been stopped:\n\n       Replacement of certain bolts, nuts, washers that hold \n     together parts of the wing flap.\n\n  They are celebrating with the circus while they want to stop these \nkinds of regulations.\n  Here is a good one. You do not have to have a degree in engineering \nto understand this one:\n\n       Requiring measures to prevent the sliding cockpit side \n     windows from rupturing in certain Airbus models. Failure to \n     prevent the sliding cockpit side windows from rupture can \n     potentially result in rapid decompression of the aircraft.\n\n  ``Rapid decompression of the aircraft.'' Do you want to be on an \naircraft when that happens? The Republicans are celebrating with a \ncircus, while they try to stop those kinds of safety regulations.\n  Who loses there? The flying public. Anyone who goes in an aircraft. \nWho wins? Irresponsible companies that do not take care of their \nproducts.\n  I could go on, Mr. President, about the winners and losers in this \ncontract. Deficit reduction surely is a loser, if they go ahead with \nthis tax break. It is going to cost $680 billion over 10 years to the \nFederal treasury. I thought we had a bipartisan consensus for deficit \nreduction. It was a most important thing, but who are they are going to \ngive that tax break to? The richest among us. Loser? The deficit \nreduction effort. Loser? The children.\n  The contract does not stop there. I thought we had a bipartisan \nconsensus last year to put cops on the street. I thought we all agreed \nto put cops on the beat in the community; it was the cornerstone of the \ncrime bill. But in the contract the Republicans want to slash all that, \nput it in a block grant, and let someone else decide. Who loses when \nthere are fewer cops on the street? You and I, members of the \ncommunity, the neighborhoods.\n  And while they are at it, they want to repeal the ban on assault \nweapons. How is that one? They want assault weapons back on the \nstreets. Who loses? Only God knows who will be the next victim. My son \nlost his best friend at 101 California Street, an attorney with \npromise, a young man, married, hoping to have a family, shot down by a \ncrazed gunman who went in and got \n[[Page S5179]] an assault weapon and shot eight people and killed my \nson's best friend John Scully. On that day, I swore to ban these \nweapons. Now we have to have the fight all over again, a fight that we \nthought was over, a divisive, difficult fight. And they are celebrating \nwith the circus. I do not understand it.\n  Who else loses with the contract? Have you ever heard of the gag \nrule? That is another fight we already had--the gag rule. A poor woman \ngoes into a family planning clinic and cannot be told her options if \nshe is pregnant, cannot be told her options, cannot be told that she \nhas a right to choose in this country. We fought that fight, and \nPresident Clinton lifted the gag rule. He said he thought women should \nhave all the facts known and they should make their own choice. It is \nup to them to decide. It is a difficult choice, but a woman should be \nable to make that decision. They are celebrating over there. In their \ncontract, they are bringing back the gag rule, treating women like \nsecond-class citizens, as if we do not know what could hurt us.\n  So it is very clear who the winners and who the losers are. The \nwinners? The very wealthy who get tax breaks, the corporate polluters, \nthe big infant formula companies, the criminals, those who oppose the \nright to choose. They win in this contract. Really, the billionaires \nwho will walk out and renounce their citizenship to get a tax break are \nthe big winners because we ended that tax break. And what happened in \nthe Republican conference committee? They took that out. Who else wins? \nThe broker-dealers who cheat, who do not take their fiduciary \nresponsibility to their clients seriously.\n  Those consumers, those investors will have a court system that \nprobably does not let them in the front door.\n  I believe in a system where David can meet Goliath in the courtroom \nand let the system work.\n  They believe in a system where David cannot get in the door. They \nhave something in that contract called ``loser pays.'' It is an English \nsystem. It is not the American system. It says if you go into court and \nyou lose, you pay the other guy's attorney's fees. How many of us as \nsmall investors would take that chance?\n  We are going to stop that here in the Senate, but it is in the \ncontract. And the Republicans are celebrating with the circus.\n  So I hope, in this brief time, I have expressed clearly who the \nwinners are and who the losers are. I can add to the losers the senior \ncitizens, who will see Medicare cuts, huge Medicare cuts. And senior \nhousing cuts.\n  We could not even get our Republican colleagues to protect Social \nSecurity when we took up the balanced budget amendment. We said, ``Take \nSocial Security out of that and protect it.'' We could not get a vote. \nWe lost it on a party-line vote.\n  So while the celebration is going on there with the circus, I just \nhope the American people will ask a question like that little girl \nasked me in school: ``Senator, what happens if you cut my school lunch? \nWho gets that money?\"\n  I ask the American people to ask the question: Who benefits from this \ncontract? And read the fine print, because they are not going to show \nit to you. You are going to have to work to find it out.\n  I hope that I have been of help in making the point that overall, \nthis contract is not helpful to the American people.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  [Disturbance in the galleries.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The galleries will restrain.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, my colleague from South \nDakota, Senator Pressler, stated on the Senate floor that the \nadministration was working through my office to block consideration of \nS. 652, the telecommunications bill. This statement was flat out wrong, \nand while Senator Pressler subsequently corrected his statement for the \nCongressional Record, the press has reported the inaccuracy. This issue \nis sufficiently important that the mistake needs to be pointed out.\n  I have spoken with the Vice President concerning telecommunications \nreform legislation. The Vice President stated, as he apparently \nindicated to Senator Pressler, that the administration would like to \nsee the bill improved in a couple of different areas. However, the Vice \nPresident did not ask, nor did I offer, to block consideration of the \nbill.\n  I am committed to passing a telecommunications reform bill, I am \neager to see the benefits of technology and communications services--\nthe so-called information superhighway--extended to all parts of this \ncountry, especially rural areas like my own State of South Dakota.\n  The telecommunications bill is sweeping legislation addressing \ncomplex problems, and highly technical subjects. While I have taken no \nsteps to block the bill from coming to the floor, I sympathize with \nthose of my colleagues who desire the opportunity and time to study it. \nWith the Senate schedule set for the balance of the week, and with the \ntime provided by the upcoming Easter recess, Senators will have the \nchance to evaluate the proposal in detail prior to its coming to the \nfloor.\n  Again, let me reiterate, I have not sought to block consideration of \nS. 652. Our ranking member on the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, \nstands ready to proceed. Indeed, as Senator Pressler noted, every \nDemocrat on the Commerce Committee voted for the bill at markup.\n  I believe my intentions in regards to this matter are clear. I simply \ntake this opportunity to reinforce my position that a \ntelecommunications reform bill is among the most important legislation \nthe Senate will consider this year.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5179-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5179-S5180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE 14TH ANNIVERSARY OF SHOOTING OF JIM BRADY\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I would like to tell you a story about \ncriminals and guns. It is about someone--let us call him John Doe \nbecause the B-A-T-F says it cannot disclose his identity--who in 1978 \nwas convicted of criminal reckless homicide. He killed another driver \nwhile driving drunk. Although, as a convicted felon, John Doe was \nprohibited by law from buying guns, he purchased a handgun from a gun \ndealer in December 1993. Then, only 1 month later in January 1994, he \npurchased another. On both occasions he walked out of the gun store \nfully armed.\n  How could he do this? He lied on his forms and no one conducted a \nbackground check. A few weeks later John Doe tried to increase his \narsenal yet again by purchasing a third handgun. But this last time he \nwas caught--thanks to the background check that is now required under \nthe Brady law.\n  [[Page S5180]] Mr. President, last week marked the 14th anniversary \nof the vicious shooting of President Reagan and Jim Brady by John \nHinckley. And last month marked the first anniversary of the effective \nday of the Brady bill.\n  Critics claimed that Brady would mark an end to personal freedom, and \nthat felons and drug traffickers would never buy guns over the counter. \nBut 1 year after enactment, the sky has not fallen. And the Brady law--\nfor the most part--is accomplishing its goal: Keeping guns out of the \nhands of criminals and drug traffickers, while not unduly \ninconveniencing law abiding gun owners.\n  According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, over the \npast year in the 29 States covered by Brady, the law prevented \napproximately 40,000 firearms purchases. Indeed, when States with their \nown background checks are added in, B-A-T-F estimates that law \nenforcement denied up to 70,000 gun purchases in the past year. That \nmeans fugitives, rapists and murderers have been stopped while trying \nto purchase guns.\n  Statistics from my State support these conclusions. Wisconsin, which \nhas its own 2 day waiting period and background check, has blocked more \nthan 800 convicted felons from buying handguns in the past 3 years. And \nkeeping guns out of the hands of criminals, Mr. President, is the most \neffective form of prevention--as well as the best way to ensure the \nsafety of the community.\n  But while the background check and waiting period have stopped gun \nsales to criminals, authorities need to do more to prosecute the \ncriminals who try to buy guns. CBS news found that only 551 people had \nbeen prosecuted in 19 States. And according to the Washington Post, \nfewer than 10 have been prosecuted federally. These figures just do not \nadd up. We need to do a better job of putting these people behind bars.\n  In my opinion, if you lie on the Brady Act form you should go to \njail. Period. That is the law.\n  Mr. President, the police chiefs, sheriffs and other law enforcement \nofficers know the real truth: The Brady law has proven to be an \neffective tool in helping to keep handguns out of the wrong hands. And \nthe American people agree: The latest CBS News/New York Times poll \nfound that 87 percent support the Brady law.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, on this anniversary all of us should \nexpress our gratitude and appreciation to Sarah and Jim Brady. We would \nnot be where we are today without their hard work.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5179-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        RECESS UNTIL 12:45 P.M.\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, a year ago we were in the midst of a \nmomentous debate in this institution over the reform of our Nation's \nhealth care system. At that time, one of my concerns was that dramatic \nchanges were taking place in the prescription drug marketplace. A \nnumber of prescription drug manufacturers had begun to experience \ncompetitive pressures arising from the growth of generic drugs and \nmanaged care. But disturbingly, one of their strategies was to coopt \nor, if possible, eliminate the sources of that competitive pressure.\n  In the days that have followed, we have seen some extraordinary \nchanges in the drug marketplace. There has been a wave of multibillion \ndollar mergers and acquisitions which, according to a recent issue in \nthe Wall Street Journal, ``promises to create industry giants.'' This \nremarkable consolidation has profound consequences for American \nconsumers.\n  A few days ago, in fact it was April fool's day to be exact, the \nAssociated Press reported that corporate merger activity broke all \nrecords last year and extended its frenetic pace into the first quarter \nof 1995--with the drug industry leading the way.\n  Mr. President, in the past 3 months alone, the drug industry by \nitself has carried out some $23 billion in mergers and buying out their \ncompetition worldwide.\n  We read just the other day, for example, about Glaxo's $14 billion \nhostile takeover of Burroughs Wellcome, both major drug giants. This \ndeal will create the world's largest pharmaceutical company, in the \nwake of other giant deals like Hoechst's anticipated $7.1 billion \npurchase of Marion Merrill Dow, American Home Products' $9.7 billion \nbuyout of American Cyanamid and Hoffmann-La Roche's $5.3 billion \nacquisition of Syntex.\n  Brand name companies have also been investing heavily in \nbiotechnology, generic and over-the-counter drug companies. Ciba \npurchased a $2 billion stake in Chiron, and SmithKline Beecham recently \njust bought Sterling for $3 billion. Hoechst spent a paltry half a \nbillion dollars on a generic company called Copley.\n  These are remarkable figures, Mr. President. And if we simply add up \nthe cost of just a sampling of some of these recent mergers and \nacquisitions, we will find that they total $54 billion.\n  In the last 15 months, $54 billion has been spent by giant \npharmaceutical companies buying up and acquiring their competition. \nThat is an interesting figure when we compare it to the research and \ndevelopment that is planned by the entire prescription drug industry \nfor the year 1995: $14.9 billion \n[[Page S5181]]  spent on research compared to $54 billion spent by the \nmajor pharmaceutical companies in acquiring their competition since the \nbeginning of last year.\n  That is three and a half times what the entire industry is going to \nspend in research in 1995. This is an extraordinary difference. One \nwould think that such large deals would leave these companies either in \ndebt or strapped for cash. Mr. President, that is not so. These \ncompanies are so profitable and their pockets are so deep, Wall \nStreet's Standard & Poor's concluded just a few days ago that the \nindustry's ability to ``generate cash in excess of ongoing needs is \nlikely to continue.'' And their generating that cash is going to \ncontinue because the consumer in the United States is going to continue \npaying the highest drug prices of any major country in the world today.\n  This is a far cry from the recent past. We may recall that just a \nyear ago the industry was sounding the alarm about declining profits \nand research cutbacks. These companies claimed that they were under \nsiege and out of favor with investors. A year and a half ago, these \nsame companies warned that research would be choked off by health \nreform.\n  This is a statement by Merck in 1993: ``R will fall at least $2 to \n$3 billion over the next 5 years.''\n  Well, today, Mr. President, we are hearing a different story. This \nyear, Bear Stearns says earnings growth will be ``the best we have seen \nin years'' for the drug industry. They are out spending $54 billion on \nmergers and we have to wonder how serious the threat to research ever \nwas.\n  Well, Mr. President, why are they spending all of this money to buy \ntheir competition? Why are these mergers taking place? Let us look a \nlittle deeper.\n  Last month, the CEO of Glaxo put it quite simply. His company is \ntrying to do ``nothing more than to wrench market power back from the \nadministrators and the distributors who now hold the health care purse-\nstrings.'' His company is responding to competitive pressures by \nfocusing on its research portfolio.\n  But what if the brand name companies owned those administrators? What \nif the brand name companies owned those distributors? What if they not \nonly wrench that market power back--they buy it outright? Who will hold \nthe health care purse-strings at that time?\n  This is exactly what we are facing today in the United States. The \ndrug industry's acquisitions have not been restricted to brand name or \nbiotechnology companies. They have also included the country's largest \npharmacy benefits management companies. We call these companies, PBM's. \nWe are going to hear a lot in the future about PBM's.\n  What is a PBM? A PBM is hired by HMO's, by health plans, by major \ncorporations, and by self-insured companies to administer their \nprescription drug programs. PBM's act as a buying agent in negotiating \nwith the drug manufacturers, seeking deep discounts for their clients \nand in developing cost-saving formulas for their covered patients. They \nmay also deliver medicine to patients through selected pharmacies or \nthrough mail-order.\n  In rapid succession, these PBM's have been snapped up by some of the \nbiggest drug companies in the world. Only 2 years ago, April 1993, the \nPBM market was completely independent of the pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers. Only 24 months later, in April 1995, SmithKline Beecham-\nDiversified, Merck-Medco, and now Eli Lilly-PCS would dominate 80 \npercent of the PBM market.\n  This is vertical integration, as clear a case as I have ever seen. \nMerck paid $6 billion for Medco Containment Services, one of the \nlargest PBM's and distributors of drugs. SmithKline Beecham bought \nDiversified Pharmaceutical Services for $2.3 billion. Today, Eli Lilly \nis, as we speak, ready to close on acquiring a company called PCS, the \nNation's largest PBM company, for $4.1 billion.\n  The prescription drug marketplace is being revolutionized. Before too \nlong, there may only be a handful of major drug companies left. The \nmajor manufacturers of prescription drugs in this country are soon, Mr. \nPresident, going to have a lot less competition.\n  This kind of vertical integration between large manufacturers and \ndistributors, however, is unprecedented. We can see what has happened \nin the last 24 months. It has had very different implications for \nconsumers than the horizontal mergers and acquisitions so prevalent in \ntoday's headlines.\n  If Lilly is permitted to purchase PCS, the three largest PBM \ncompanies will belong to brand name drug companies that research, \nmanufacture, and distribute drugs. These three PBM companies serve 94 \nmillion covered lives--80 percent of the total PBM market. A handful of \ndrug companies will wield tremendous influence over which drugs are \nused by millions of American citizens. They will have the raw power--\nand they will use that power--to restrict access to needed medicines. \nThey will possess a large share of the mail order drug business. They \nwill exercise decisive leverage over their competitors' access to the \nmarketplace.\n  This is why, Mr. President, these PBM's are being bought by the major \nmanufacturing firms. They provide market power to a select few \ncompanies, precisely when the market has shifted beneath their feet.\n  Owning a PBM can switch sales to your own drugs. Owning a PBM can \ncounteract the bargaining power of managed care. Owning a PBM can \ndetermine which generics you sell: your own or your competitors'. Mr. \nPresident, in short, ownership of PBMs by brandname manufacturers \ndestroys all competition.\n  The brand name companies now admit it. In 1993, Merck said it \nexpected to sell more drugs to Medco after it bought out the PBM.\n Merck's CEO at that particular time felt the company had to be in a \nposition where ``We can be sure that we control the flow of our own \ndrugs.'' In fact, at one point last year, Lilly and PCS had agreed to \nmake PCS's previous owner, McKesson, the sole distributor of Lilly \ndrugs.\n\n  This is growing evidence that these manufacturer-owned PBM's are \ndoing what one would expect. They may no longer act as honest brokers. \nThey may now be acting in the interests of their parent companies, not \ntheir clients. They may be favoring their parent companies by switching \npatients from one drug to another without explicit regard to their \nhealth.\n  Mr. President, these charges have been filed with the Federal Trade \nCommission. The FTC has heard from a wide spectrum of citizens, \nconsumer groups, trade associations, manufacturers, distributors, \nFederal agencies, and Congress on this issue. The FTC has even heard \nthese concerns from the brand-name companies who do not own PBM's or \nwho are not about to own PBM's. As a result, the Federal Trade \nCommission is still reviewing the Lilly-PCS proposed acquisition and \nhas reopened its investigation of the Merck-Medco and SmithKline-\nDiversified deals.\n  I have written on two occasions to the Federal Trade Commission about \nthese concerns. On the first occasion, I was joined by my former \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator Howard \nMetzenbaum, who then chaired the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Our feeling at that time was that the Lilly-PCS \nmerger would lay the capstone of an uncompetitive marketplace. There \nwere already indications that the other two deals had eroded \ncompetition.\n  In November, the FTC confirmed our suspicions and proposed a consent \norder which established strict conditions over the Lilly-PCS deal. In \nthe next several weeks, the FTC will either approve the consent order, \nrevise the consent order, or seek an injunction blocking the \nacquisition.\n  The FTC is not alone in its scrutiny of these manufacturer-PBM deals. \nIt is the Food and Drug Administration's responsibility to ensure that \nprescription drug marketing is fair and accurate.\n  When the Lilly-PCS deal was the subject of public comment, the Food \nand Drug Administration at that time expressed grave concerns over the \npotential for new forms of violative marketing and promotion. In fact, \nI recently read in the New York Times that the Food and Drug \nAdministration has now had to warn Merck, SmithKline Beecham, and Eli \nLilly ``not to put pressure on doctors to prescribe their drugs \n[[Page S5182]] for unauthorized treatment or to withhold sufficient \ndisclosures regarding the risks of adverse side effects.''\n  What does this mean? It means that if you are one of the millions of \nAmericans covered by these PBM's, your doctor may no longer be \nreceiving impartial advice about which drugs to prescribe to you.\n  Let me raise another example of how improper marketing can degenerate \ninto inappropriate care.\n  Two months ago, Eli Lilly & Co. participated in a depression \nawareness program at a local high school. This story was published in \nFebruary by the Washington Post. While sponsoring educational programs \nmight be a laudable endeavor, the students in this particular school \nand the teachers were furious with the company for ``turning an \neducational program into an extended commercial.''\n  What was the particular drug that the drug company was pushing on the \nstudents? Mr. President, 1,300 students listened to company \nrepresentatives pitch their drug, and then they received pens, pads, \nand brochures embossed with the product name. The product that we speak \nof is, of course, Prozac.\n  Afterward, the principal felt that Eli Lilly ``shouldn't be pushing \ntheir drug program, especially not to children.''\n  One of the students explained, ``I was upset that I had to sit in an \nassembly for 45 minutes and listen to a plug for Prozac.''\n  Her mother added, ``The message my daughter came away with was pop a \npill and everything is going to be all right.''\n  Let me say that Eli Lilly & Co. did apologize. They admitted their \nconduct was inappropriate. But imagine, if you can, the potential for \nsuch abuses when a manufacturer not only makes a drug, but they also \nmarket that drug, they advertise that drug, they influence HMO's to buy \nthat drug, they collude with their PBM subsidiary to win contracts, \nand--if they have not gotten your business yet--they encourage the \ndoctors with incomplete information to switch you, the patient, to \ntheir product.\n  To add insult to injury, the consumer may also have to pay more for \ntheir prescription drugs. In our market economy, we all know that if \nthere is no competition, we pay higher prices. Competition brings down \nprices. Competition is good for the consumer. Today, the major drug \ncompanies of America are buying up their competition and the consumer \nis going to foot the bill.\n  If the PBM's have a vested interest in their owner's products, they \nwill not necessarily be negotiating the best deal for their patients--\nand this is taking place in the midst of the industry's best pricing \nenvironment in years. Look at what Wall Street is thinking. Analysts \nexpect drug price increases to be ``faster in 1995 than in the \npreceding 4 years.''\n  I am deeply concerned about the impact of these acquisitions. There \nis growing evidence that the PBM companies no longer act as independent \nor honest brokers for their clients. They are going to be acting as \nbrokers for their parent companies who pay the bills. This can only \nlead to inappropriate health care and to higher prices for consumers, \nwho are already paying some of the highest prescription drug prices in \nthe world.\n  The FTC has now demonstrated due diligence in investigating the \nLilly-PCS deal. The FDA has also signaled its concern over these \nmarketing abuses. Consumers will undoubtedly benefit from this \nvigilance.\n  In a textbook-perfect market, competition prevails and the consumer \nbenefits without such scrutiny. But in the real world's imperfect \nmarkets, we must sometimes intervene. That intervention is necessary \nnow to guarantee that true competition takes place. It is my hope that \nwe can prevent the anticompetitive practices which I have just \ndescribed this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we realize what is happening in the drug \nmarketplace in the spring of 1995, and I only hope that we are not \ngoing to act too late.\n  Mr. President, I see another colleague seeking the floor. I thank the \nChair for recognizing me. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his \npatience. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President. I rise to discuss the issue \nof a bill I introduced recently that I understand is going to be \nhighlighted tonight on a Dateline/NBC telecast having to deal with the \nissue of fugitives--felons--who are not only running from the law, but \nunder the law receiving welfare benefits, and under the law the police \nare not able to assert information from the welfare office to be able \nto help track this person down.\n  Believe it or not, that is exactly the issue that we are going to \ndiscuss and hopefully be able to remedy. I got into this in the House. \nI was Chairman of the Task Force on Welfare in the House of \nRepresentatives and was presented with a whole lot of information about \nsome of the problems in the welfare system, and worked extensively \nputting together the House welfare reform package in 1993 and 1994.\n  This issue is while there have been a lot of partisanship with \nrespect to the welfare issue and gnashing of teeth as to the mean-\nspiritedness of the welfare proposals that have been put forward, this \nparticular area of the welfare bill has attracted broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  When explained, most Americans--all Americans--support this kind of \nchange. I have not heard of any organized opposition to the bill I \nintroduced along with Representative Peter Blute from Massachusetts in \nthe House or the one that was introduced here in the Senate.\n  The House of Representatives, in the welfare reform debate, debated \nthis issue on the floor and it passed, I believe, unanimously on the \nfloor of the House.\n  The bill now comes to the Senate as an amendment to the House welfare \nreform bill. Whether we bring it up, I hope this issue can be \naddressed, because I think it is important in not only reducing welfare \nfraud--and this is clearly welfare fraud--but also facilitating police \noperations in tracking down wanted criminals.\n  We know from the National Crime Information Center there are roughly \n400,000 outstanding fugitive warrants in this country. As I say, \nbelieve it or not, a sizable portion of those fugitives are on welfare \nreceiving food stamps or AFDC or some other welfare assistance, Federal \nwelfare assistance. SSI is a big one, where they receive assistance \nfrom the Federal Government to help support their lifestyle while \nhiding from law enforcement authorities.\n  That is bad enough, but under current, law Federal and State law, law \nenforcement authorities are not able to contact the welfare offices to \nassert any information about this fugitive. Why? Because of welfare \nprivacy laws. If a person gets on welfare they can collect their check, \ncollect their benefits, and be completely immune from anybody ever \nfinding out that they are on the welfare rolls. This is almost \nunbelievable. But that is, in fact, the case.\n  Now people may say, how many people are on this? Is this really a \nproblem or is this an isolated case?\n  Let me first give Members the case. The case that really brought this \nto my attention was an article in the July 29, 1994, Pittsburgh Tribune \nReview.\n  I will read:\n\n       Fugitive Used Real Name for Welfare\n\n  James Brabham knew who he was. During a decade on the lam for a 1984 \nslaying in Pittsburg, he used at least five aliases and five Social \nSecurity numbers.\n\n       But when he went on welfare he used his real name--and his \n     State-issued welfare card bore his current address and photo.\n       The cops who arrested him on Wednesday in Philadelphia saw \n     the card when they asked Brabham for identification. They \n     hadn't known he was on welfare.\n       ``I'm sure it would have made things a lot easier,'' said \n     Detective Joe Hasara of the Federal Fugitive Task Force in \n     Philadelphia, one of the squads that for years pursued lead \n     after dead-end lead searching for Brabham.\n\n  I went and met with the Federal Fugitive Task Force in Philadelphia. \nWhat they told me was absolutely amazing. They believe from the 90-some \nfugitives they have caught since \n[[Page S5183]] the task force has been put together the last couple of \nyears that 75 percent of the people they have tracked down had welfare \ncards. Seventy-five percent. They have no way to go and find out the \ninformation about what their current address is, what their Social \nSecurity number is, or even a photograph.\n  In Cleveland, the Fugitive Task Force ran a sting operation--one of \nthese things where a person gets free things and they invite only \ncertain people and they catch the folks who show up--33 percent of the \npeople who showed up at this sting operation had welfare cards.\n  Again, because of court decisions and the Welfare Privacy Act, they \nhad no way of contacting or getting this information from the welfare \noffice.\n  People may say, ``OK, these folks have welfare cards. But how many of \nthem use their real name?'' I asked that of the Philadelphia Fugitive \nTask Force. I said, ``How many use their real name?'' They laughed, and \nthey said almost all of them use their real name and real Social \nSecurity number.\n  I said, ``Well, why in the world would they do that?'' The answer is, \nbecause they do not want to lose their benefits. They do not want to be \naccused of a welfare problem, and they can get in trouble for a whole \nbunch of other things, so they use their real name and real Social \nSecurity number so they can get the benefits. It is a very good source \nof the true name and the true Social Security number of people who are \non the lam.\n  Now, what we have suggested in this legislation is to permit law \nenforcement agencies that have a fugitive warrant to be able to go to a \nwelfare office and say ``Look, we would like to know if John Doe is in \nyour file and, if so, we would like the address of John Doe, we would \nlike the Social Security number of John Doe, and we would like a \nphotograph of John Doe.''\n  People wonder why we need a photograph. In the original legislation I \nproposed in the House, I did not have ``photograph.'' But the Fugitive \nTask Force in Philadelphia said this is very helpful information \nbecause a lot of times they have fugitives who are first-time felons, \nand they have absolutely no idea what they look like. So this gives a \ncurrent picture to be able to track this person down. It is very \nhelpful information.\n  Now, again, this is a bipartisan bill. There is bipartisan \nsponsorship on the bill here. We hope that this is a measure that can \nsail through the House, whether we do a welfare reform package or not, \nand it passes again, this is something we can do to eliminate a welfare \nproblem that we know is occurring.\n  People who are fugitives are not permitted to be on welfare. Again, \nthere is no way of checking that. And, number two, to give police \nofficers the opportunity to track these people down and get better \ninformation.\n  There is another part of the bill I will briefly discuss, and that is \nanother situation we found out about from our hearings on welfare in \nthe last couple of years, which is the definition of what ``temporarily \nabsent'' is from a home.\n  We have situations where we have parents who have children who are on \nAFDC, whose children end in jail for long periods of time, or run away \nfrom home for long periods of time, or are in detention, or a whole lot \nof other things, but they are out of the house.\n  If they are out of the house for any period of time the welfare \nbenefit that goes with the child--that is where most of the welfare \ncash goes and other benefits go--should cease to the mother or the \nparents--not necessarily the mother.\n  There is no definition in most States as to what ``temporarily \nabsent'' means, so we provide a definition of how long a child should \nbe away from home to determine whether that person is temporarily \nabsent, or in fact, permanently absent. It they are permanently absent, \nthey lose their welfare benefits.\n  We have seen situations where parents have collected welfare benefits \nliterally for years when kids are in jail, and they keep collecting the \nmoney, because the State has never determined what ``temporarily \nabsent'' means. That, we believe, is an abuse that can be stopped.\n  Again, this provision had bipartisan support and we hope will be so \nsupported here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I hope that we will soon be able to vote \nin the Senate on the unjustified tax loophole that exists for \nbillionaires who renounce their American citizenship in order to avoid \ntaxes on the wealth they have accumulated as Americans.\n  This reform was first proposed in President Clinton's budget on \nFebruary 6. The Senate Finance Committee closed this loophole as part \nof its action on the bill to restore the health care deduction for \nsmall businesses.\n  The committee took this action to close the billionaires' loophole, \ndespite the fact that the revenue gained was not needed to pay for the \nhealth care deduction in the bill. In fact, the committee recommended \nthat these revenues be used for deficit reduction. This is exactly the \ntype of action necessary if we are serious about achieving a balanced \nbudget.\n  According to the revenue estimates in the committee report, closing \nthis loophole would raise $1.4 billion over the next 5 years, and $3.6 \nbillion over the next 10 years. Clearly, substantial revenues are at \nstake.\n  Too often, we close tax loopholes only when we need to raise revenues \nto offset tax cuts. In this case, the committee closed this flagrant \nloophole as soon as it was brought to the committee's attention--and \nrightly so, because this loophole should be closed as soon as possible. \nThe Senate bill did so, and all of us thought the issue was settled.\n  Yet the legislation came back to us from the Senate-House conference, \nand the loophole had reappeared. This outrageous tax break for two \ndozen or so of the wealthiest individuals in the country will remain \nopen.\n  We have been told that the loophole was preserved because of \nunanswered questions about whether closing it would violate U.S. and \ninternational laws on human rights. But it certainly does not. All \ncitizens of the United States have a basic right to leave the country, \nlive elsewhere, and relinquish their citizenship.\n  Any and every citizen surely has the right to repatriate. Closing the \nloophole would not prevent any individuals from shifting their assets \nand their citizenship to a foreign country. Rather, it would just make \nsure that those who have amassed great wealth through the U.S. economic \nsystem pay their fair share of taxes, as the rest of us do. It is a \nprovision which a dozen other countries have enacted for the same \nreasons.\n  Prof. Detlev Vagts of the Harvard Law School has said,\n\n       The proposed tax does not amount to such a burden upon the \n     right of repatriation as to constitute a violation of either \n     international law or American constitutional law. It merely \n     equalizes over the long run certain tax burdens as between \n     those who remain subject to U.S. tax when they realize upon \n     certain gains and those who abandon their citizenship while \n     the property remains unsold.\n\n  Andreas Lowenfeld, a professor of international law at NYU said,\n\n       I am confident that neither adoption nor enforcement of the \n     provision in question would violate any obligation of the \n     United States or any applicable principles of international \n     law.\n\n  Michael Matheson, a legal advisor at the State Department said;\n\n       This provision does not conflict with international human \n     rights law concerning an individual's right to freely \n     emigrate from his or her country of citizenship . . . a \n     state, in order to protect its interests, may impose economic \n     controls on departure as long as such controls do not result \n     in a de facto denial of an individual's right to emigrate . . \n     . These are comparable taxes to those which U.S. citizens or \n     permanent residents would have to pay were they in the United \n     States \n     [[Page S5184]] at the time they disposed of the assets or at \n     their death.\n\n  Clearly, there is ample support in U.S. law and international law for \nclosing this loophole. Yet, the provision was dropped in conference.\n  This is all happening, of course, at the same time that we are \ncutting Federal funds for basic investments in the future of children, \nstudents, and working families. Funds for school lunches, education, \nhousing, and other vital social services are all being drastically cut, \nat the very time our Republican colleagues have decided that this tax \nbreak is not flagrant enough to be terminated immediately.\n  In fact, the conference report on this tax legislation was called up \nfor debate last Friday, just as the Senate was beginning debate on our \nDemocratic amendment to restore some of the harshest cuts in the \npending appropriations bill.\n  Our Democratic amendment contained several key provisions:\n  We wanted to restore nearly $800 million in cuts in housing programs \nand in job training programs for young Americans.\n  We wanted to restore $210 million in cuts in the program to encourage \nyoung Americans to participate in national and community services.\n  We wanted to restore $100 million in cuts from the drug-free schools \nprogram.\n  We wanted to restore $72 million in cuts from education programs for \ndisadvantaged students.\n  We wanted to restore $67 million in cuts from the Goals 2000 program \nfor local school reforms.\n  We wanted to restore $42 million in cuts from Head Start, and $35 \nmillion in cuts from nutrition programs for expectant mothers and \ninfants.\n  The contrast in priorities is impossible to ignore. Give every \nbenefit of the doubt to tax loopholes for a few billionaires. Rush to \nenact spending cuts that jeopardize education, nutrition, and job \ntraining for large numbers of children, students and working families.\n  Yet when it comes to closing a totally unjustified tax loophole used \nby wealthy citizens who renounce their citizenship to avoid taxes, \nHouse Republicans say, ``Go slow; this needs more study; we shouldn't \nact in haste; perhaps this loophole has some merit we don't know \nabout.''\n  Nonsense. I wish that our colleagues would show as much solicitude \nfor millions of deserving Americans struggling to make ends meet, as \nthey are now showing for a handful of undeserving billionaires willing \nto insult America to evade their fair share of taxes.\n  This amendment will put the Senate squarely on record in favor of \nclosing this gaping loophole in our tax laws. The amendment has two \nclear provisions:\n  The first subsection states the Sense of the Senate that Congress \nshould act as quickly as possible to amend the Internal Revenue Code to \nclose this loophole.\n  The second subsection makes clear that the effective date of any such \naction should be February 6, 1995.\n  The February 6 date is the effective date in the original Senate \nFinance Committee amendment, and it is also the date of the original \nproposal by President Clinton to close this loophole.\n  Clearly, everyone has been on notice since February 6 that this \nloophole is likely to be closed. It would be unconscionable for anyone \nin Congress to attempt to delay the effective date to enable a few more \nwealthy Americans to squirm through this notorious loophole before it \nfinally snaps shut.\n  Finally, all of us must be vigilant as well to see that this \nimportant reform is not watered down behind closed doors before it \nreappears in its next incarnation.\n  We know what happened last time. We know that the smartest tax \nlawyers money can buy will be quietly undermining this reform in any \nway they can, in order to salvage as much of this billionaires' \nloophole as possible.\n  Two good measures of the seriousness with which Congress resists that \nspecial interest pressure will be maintaining the effective date of \nFebruary 6, and maintaining the revenue gain anticipated from the \nprovision in the Finance Committee bill.\n  Obviously, the revenue estimates may be refined as the Joint Tax \nCommittee and the Treasury Department obtain more information on this \ninsidious tax avoidance practice. But refining the estimates is not the \nsame as reducing them because the reform has been weakened.\n  A useful measure of the strength of this reform is contained in a \ncomparison of the revenue estimates prepared by the Treasury for the \nPresident's February 6 budget, and by the Joint Tax Committee for the \nSenate Finance Committee's report on March 20 on H.R. 831, the small \nbusiness tax bill. I ask unanimous consent that a table containing \nthose revenue estimates may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  TABLE.--REVENUE ESTIMATES FROM CLOSING THE BILLIONAIRES' TAX LOOPHOLE \n                          [Dollars in millions]                         \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Revenue gain           \n                                     -----------------------------------\n                Year                                     Senate Finance \n                                          President     Committee report\n                                      Clinton's budget   on H.R. 831\\1\\ \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1995................................                $0               $47\n1996................................                60               144\n1997................................               200               197\n1998................................               300               257\n1999................................               410               322\n2000................................               530               392\n1995-2000...........................             1,500             1,359\n2001-2005...........................

The Senate Finance Committee is $1.359 billion, and then \nthe Senate Finance Committee goes on from 1995 to the year 2005 to be \n$3.6 billion.\n  Although the committee's revenue estimates are based on a modified \nversion of the administration's proposed reform, the estimates are \ngenerally similar, and the total revenue gains in the two estimates for \nthe period 1995-2000 are within about 10 percent of each other. \nClearly, it is reasonable to expect that at least this much revenue \nwill be gained by closing this loophole.\n  The most significant difference between President Clinton's proposal \nand the Finance Committee bill is that President Clinton's proposal \nwould close the loophole not only for U.S. citizens, but also for \nwealthy resident aliens who renounce their residency status and leave \nthe country to avoid taxes.\n  The Senate Finance Committee proposal closes the loophole only for \nU.S. citizens. There is no obvious reason why the loophole should be \nclosed for one type of billionaire and not the other. They have amassed \ngreat wealth in America, and they should not be permitted to escape \ntheir fair share of taxes by renouncing America. It is time to close \nthis loophole tight--no ifs, ands, or buts, and no escape hatches for \nanyone.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this amendment, and to send a clear, \nsimple message once and for all to any wealthy tax-dodgers who are \nscheming to renounce America--``Good riddance, but you can't take it \nwith you!''\n  Just a final two thoughts. As I mentioned during my brief remarks, \nthis debate is coming at a time when the minority leader is attempting \nto restore the cuts under the rescissions. That means that these moneys \nhave already been appropriated. The Appropriations Committee has made a \nrecommendation. It has perceived that we are going to cut the Voluntary \nCommunity Service Program, and the Drug Free Schools Program, which is \nso important to our young people. It also includes funding for safety \nin our schools.\n  As I mentioned on previous occasions, we have had long and good \ndebates with good bipartisan support. We are trying to do something \nabout the increasing incidence of violence that is taking place in our \nschools. We are attempting to restore some $100 million to the program \nthat will help and assist schools at the local level to deal with the \nproblems of violence and substance abuse in their schools.\n  Title I of the education bill, which was debated here, and has strong \nbipartisan support--try to bring some focus and attention to \ndisadvantaged children by providing extra help and assistance to them--\nwe have changed that program, is a good program with \n[[Page S5185]] strong bipartisan support. We want to make sure that the \nfunding for that program that was included in last year and which local \nschool districts have been depending on will not be pulled out from \nunderneath those young children.\n  The Goals 2000--again with bipartisan support--each 5 percent of this \nmoney, or $67 million, will actually go to the local school districts \nwhich are interested in reform; strengthening the academic achievements \nand accomplishments of young Americans. It has the broad support of the \neducation community and of the parents, teachers, the business \ncommunity that are in support of the Goals 2000 program.\n  The Head Start Program, which we revamped and rechartered just over \nin the last Congress, and had strong bipartisan support, virtually \nunanimously reported out of our committee and the strong support in \nappropriating the funds, this represents about a quarter of a reduction \nin the increases for the Head Start Program. Only about 38 percent of \nall of our young people get any Head Start Program. We extended the \nHead Start Program from zero to four to recognize that the \nrecommendations of the Carnegie Commission report that talked about the \nimportance for the nurturing and nutrition, particularly in the early \nyears, and the relationship between that kind of a tension and the \nacademic achievement of children. Now, as is increasingly apparent, we \nneed the kind of support that Head Start provides for that early \nintervention. We have responded to it. There are school districts all \nover the country that are depending upon that funding. We should not \npull the rug out from the Head Start Program.\n  The Women, Infants, and Children's program, the $35 million for \nexpectant mothers that do not have the financial resources to get the \nadequate nutrition to make sure that we are going to have healthy \nbabies, this program has been tried, tested and reviewed. It should not \nbe cut back.\n  The School-to-Work program, where we have seen a new basis of trying \nto do something for the 70 percent of our young people that do not go \non to higher education. They are the ones who have been too often left \nout and left behind. We have a good program that again has bipartisan \nsupport. This program will be reshaped and adjusted under the \nleadership of Senator Kassebaum and others to be a basis for the whole \nyouth training program. We should not abandon that program.\n  The child care program, a modest program that only addresses about 4 \nor 5 percent of the total needs of child care for working families, \nworking mothers primarily, we should not deny that kind of very \nimportant support system for working mothers, particularly those that \nare in the entry-level jobs and the modest income. We know that child \ncare takes up anywhere from a quarter to a third of the income for \nworking mothers. This provided some help and assistance on the basis of \nneed for mothers primarily, but also for single fathers, primarily for \nsingle mothers so that they can go out and work and be a part of our \nwhole economic system.\n  The other programs we have referred to in terms of housing and the \nyouth training are mentioned here.\n  These are all worthwhile programs that have been tried, tested and \nevaluated, and in which the local communities--primarily the teachers, \nthe parents, the students--have been depending upon for support. We \nwant to restore education and children's programs.\n  Against that, Mr. President, we have $1.4 billion that otherwise \nwould be regained for the Federal Treasury, $3.6 billion over a period \nof 10 years. It is extraordinary to me that, if we are attempting to \ntry to represent the best of what is in the interest of the working \nfamilies in our society, it is such a compelling case for the support \nfor these programs and such a compelling case to capture the legitimate \nresponsible resources that should be paid in by these billionaires, it \nis amazing that we have to spend the amount of time that we have had to \nto get a favorable vote on the Daschle amendment or to get the vote on \nthe billionaire tax break. We have been trying since last Friday to get \na vote on that billionaire tax break. We have worked out a procedure by \nwhich we will be able to, after we conclude to vote on matters which \nhave been described as at the majority leader's request. This issue is \nnot going to go away. We are going to get a vote on this measure. They \nmay be able to frustrate us by 1 day or a few hours. But we will yet \nget a vote on that. I hope it will be overwhelming. I hope it will be \nunanimous. The majority leader has indicated his support for that \nprogram, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Moynihan \nhas indicated his strong support, Senator Bradley, and others.\n  There is no reason in the world why we cannot send the message to the \nHouse, which evidently is the reluctant partner in this proposal, that \nthe Senate of the United States is virtually unanimous in support of \nthis proposal. We need to do that. I hope we have the earliest \nopportunity to do so.\n  Mr. President, I am sure the American people are wondering why we \ncannot take action on that particular proposal. I am sure they are \nwondering why the proposal was dropped in the conference in any event. \nBut they understand what is the issue before us, and hopefully we can \nhave clear, resounding, overwhelming support, hopefully universal \nsupport, for that particular proposal.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5183-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5185-S5187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NO ACTION IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we are waiting around. Probably lots of \npeople are wondering what we are doing while the House of \nRepresentatives is storming along at a rapid pace, accomplishing an \nenormous amount of work here in the first 100 days. They are over there \nright now trying to pass a tax bill--a tax-cut bill, not a tax \nincrease. You get a tax bill around here and you think to reach for \nyour pocket. No, this is a tax-cut bill.\n  I actually wonder why the people are here. The action is over there. \nThe action is not here. We are waiting here. We are waiting and waiting \nand waiting and waiting. What are we waiting for? We are waiting to \nhear from the leaders on the Democratic side as to how much more money \nthey want to spend this year--not how we can get to a balanced budget \nbut how much more money they want to pack into this appropriations \nbill, not how we are going to get the budget down to zero but how much \nmore we are going to spend this year.\n  And I can say that I speak for a large body of people on this side of \nthe aisle who question the sincerity of folks who during the balanced \nbudget debate got up and said, ``I'm for a balanced budget. I am just \nnot for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. But I am for \na balanced budget. We have the power to make these tough decisions. We \nhave it right now. The power is within us. We can do it. We do not need \nsome phony baloney constitutional amendment to get us to face the tough \ndecisions of getting this country back on track. We can do it.''\n  And so they used that argument and the phony baloney about Social \nSecurity to oppose the balanced budget amendment. Well, as a sports \nannouncer in Pittsburgh likes to say, ``The turkey is on the table.'' \nRight here is a spending cut proposal, a proposal that funds California \ndisaster relief assistance that they need but makes further \nrescissions, cuts in spending, for this fiscal year and next fiscal \nyear.\n  So what do we see? We have seen for the past 2 weeks a filibuster. \nOh, no, you will not see it called that in the national media. They \nwould not dare call anything that the other side of the aisle is doing \na dilatory tactic. They are delaying and delaying and delaying so we do \nnot get this bill passed. This \n[[Page S5186]] is the game. The end game is do nothing. Let us not pass \na rescission bill. Let us not cut spending. Let us not put a \ndownpayment on deficit reduction. Let us, as the leaders of the other \nside want to do, trot out an amendment to spend more money.\n  And so what are we doing? We are waiting. We are waiting--the \nunwritten story of the first 100 days. I have not seen it anywhere. It \nis absolutely unbelievable to me. The unwritten story of the first 100 \ndays is not that the House accomplished so much and what happened to \nthe Senate? The unwritten story is the filibustering, delaying tactics \nof the minority in the Senate to stop what the November election was \nall about. That is what is going on here.\n  You want to point to the folks who are trying to derail the train \nfrom happening in this country? Look across the aisle. Look at the \nempty desks. Look at the folks who want to delay, delay, delay. They \nknow if they delay this bill over the recess, a lot of these spending \ncut proposals go away. Why? Because they are spending cut proposals for \nthis fiscal year. And by the time we get back in May a lot more money \nwill be spent because we are another month and a half into the fiscal \nyear. And so the longer they wait the less we can cut. They know this. \nAnd so that is what is going on. Delay, delay, delay. Do not give \nanybody success. God forbid that we have any bipartisan effort to try \nto achieve anything around here. Let us play the partisan game of \ndelay, and then stand up and say, ``Geez, these folks can't get \nanything done around here,'' when the fact is they do not want to \nchange Washington. They do not want to change Washington. They built \nWashington, and they like it just the way it is. And any time you touch \nany of their sacred cows, oh, you are mean-spirited. You do not care \nabout people. I care about kids born today who will be saddled, if we \ndo nothing to reduce this deficit--and that is what this bill is all \nabout, reducing the deficit--if we do nothing to reduce the deficit, \nwho will be saddled with 82 percent tax rates--82 percent tax rates \nover their lifetime, 82 percent of everything you earn goes to the \nGovernment to take care of people.\n  That is the message here in Washington today: You just give it to us \nand we will take care of everything you need. Folks, that has been \nrejected all around the world.\n  It is just incredible to me, it is incredible to me that the very \npeople who blocked the balanced budget amendment will now come to the \nfloor and stop any further deficit reduction.\n  How can you justify that in your own mind, unless, of course, you are \nnot really for deficit reduction, not really for a balanced budget in \nthe first place.\n  I do not have any problem--and there are several Senators who come up \nto the floor, and I give them a lot of credit, who come up to the floor \nand looked into these cameras and looked around at their colleagues and \nsaid, ``I'm not for a balanced budget. I think the Federal Government \ncan be just fine running a deficit and we will be fine.''\n  That is being intellectually honest. I do not agree with it, but \nthere is a body of economists out there who believe we can run a \ndeficit and disaster is not impending. Again, I do not agree with it. I \nthink the weight of the evidence is contrary to that. But at least they \nhave the courage to come to the floor and say they do not want to do \nit.\n  But quit double-crossing the American public by putting out these \npassionate speeches about how much you want to get this budget into \nbalance and how the children of this country need it, and when the \nchance comes where the pedal is supposed to be put to the metal and the \nrubber hits the road, we call off the race. We decide, no, no, no, we \ncannot do that. Oh, we cannot cut that program; oh, no, we cannot cut \nthat program. ``You know, oh, no, well, this is only .003 percent of \nthe budget. You cannot cut that; I mean, it is so small. Why would you \nwant to cut that?'' Or, ``We have got a brand-new program of \nAmeriCorps, which is a great program.'' Of course, we have increased \nfunding on that. You can go down the list.\n  I mean, how is the American public going to take this institution \nseriously? I mean, they are going to look at what happens here and they \nare going to say, ``Wait a minute.''\n  Are we really serious about solving problems? What were we elected to \ndo here? I do not think we were elected in the last election just to \ncome down here and keep doing the same old thing. We were not elected \nto do the same old thing. We were elected to make changes. We were \nelected to get our house in order.\n  And now we have this debate going on between the leaders of the \nDemocratic side and us, the Republican side, about how much more they \nwant to spend. And, do you know something? We made a proposal. We said, \n``OK. You want to spend $1.3 billion more''--that is what they came up \nwith, $1.3 billion more--``fine.'' We made an offer. We said, ``How \nabout if we give you half of what you want. You give us half of what we \nwant, we will give you half of what you want. We will split the \ndifference, and let us do the bill.''\n  That is the art of compromise. I mean, not just here in Washington, \nbut in everyday life. I mean, we do not always get everything we want. \nSometimes you have to sit down and you have to have minds meet.\n  And so we said, ``Let's hear the reasonable offer.'' Now, that is \nwhat we are debating right now--whether a reasonable offer will be \naccepted. Let us just each meet each other half way. In the end we will \nhave a $15 billion deficit reduction. You can restore the programs that \nyou say will jeopardize the health and safety of so many millions of \npeople. We do not agree with that, but you are passionate about it. Let \nus put the money back in. We will provide some offsets--in other words, \nsome spending cuts--to pay for these programs and we will be able to \nput it back together and move the bill.\n  The leader just walked on the floor. I mean, the leader is spending \nday after day after day trying to get things done around here. All we \nhave is people obstructing, obstructing, obstructing, obstructing, \nobstructing.\n  Let us not let these folks succeed in what they want to do. My \ngoodness, if they accomplish the Contract With America, the American \npublic may actually like them; may actually support what they want to \ndo. They may actually vote for them in the next election. We cannot \nhave that. We cannot have them vote for them, because that means they \nwill vote against us. And if they vote against us, then we will not be \nhere. And if we stall, if we delay, maybe--maybe, maybe--we will be \nable to cloud the issue up enough, muddy the waters enough, that they \nwill blame all of us. Since there are more of them now than there are \nof us, we will be OK. We may lose a little bit, they may lose a little \nbit, but we will not really get hurt.\n  That is the strategy. That is what is going on here in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  You know, I ran for U.S. Senate and I was told this was the upper \nChamber, a more deliberative body, where, you know, you had statesmen \nactually come here and do what was right for the country--do what was \nright for the country--not worry about partisan advantages or playing \npolitics, but do what was in its best interests of this country.\n  And so what we have seen is the House of Representatives follow \nthrough with a promise they made to America. They promised the American \npublic that they were going to do these 10 things. Imagine that. \nImagine. Politicians making promises. Oh, we have heard a lot of \npromises from politicians around here. All over the campaign trail, we \nmake promises.\n  But think of this: Politicians who made promises who lived up to \ntheir promises. Is not that amazing?\n  That is exactly what they are doing over in the House of \nRepresentatives. These 10 things they said we were going to bring to \nthe floor of the House of Representatives and, darn it, did they not? \nEvery single one of them came to the floor for open debate, for \namendments.\n  And, do you know what? After today, when they vote the tax bill--\nwhich I understand is supposed to pass--they will have passed 90 \npercent of the Contract With America. Not only did they live up to the \npromise of bringing all the stuff to the floor--and that is what the \ncontract said, we will bring it to the floor. They brought it to the \nfloor not saying, well, we are going to promise a tax cut and then \nbring a tax bill that was a tax increase. No, no. No bait and switch \nhere. No ``read my lips'' \n[[Page S5187]] here. No middle-class tax cut that turned into a middle-\nclass tax increase.\n  But elected officials, people in Washington, Congressmen, who \nactually lived up to what they said they would do. Amazing. Amazing.\n  And so here we are in the U.S. Senate, looking at the model over \nthere, and saying, ``Boy, wouldn't it be nice if we could come to the \nU.S. Senate floor, and we could stand up''-- and we do not have to vote \nin lockstep with the House. I would not suggest it. It is a different \nbody; different rules; different procedures; and different ideas.\n  But to stand here and play politics and delay on an issue that is--of \nall the issues that we are dealing with here in Washington, the one \nthat is highest above all is getting our financial house in order. That \nis what the American public want us to do. They want us to get our \nhouse in order.\n  And so, we have our first chance, right here--the first spending cut \nbill since the balanced budget amendment. The first chance for the U.S. \nSenate where the vote of the balance budget amendment occurs, right \nhere--all of us, all 100 of us were sitting in our chairs. We stood up \none at a time.\n  It was a very impressive moment for a young--I know the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Michigan, was just as impressed in casting \nthat vote. It was a very awe-inspiring moment.\n  But we lost. And we lost because of the argument that we did not need \nthe amendment to force us to make tough decisions. OK. Fine. You say we \ndo not need the amendment. We do not have the amendment.\n  Now we have the tough decisions. And where are we? We are nowhere. We \nare waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting. And they \nare delaying and delaying and delaying, just like they did--you know, \nthe amazing thing is they just are not delaying on this bill. The \nDemocrats have delayed on every bill--every single bill. Even bills \nthey liked.\n  I have heard the leader stand up here many times and say, you know, \nwe passed a bill here earlier in the year, the congressional \naccountability bill, that makes us live by the laws here in Congress \nthat we impose on other people's lives around America. It was over a \nweek of debate, of delay, of dilatory tactics. It passed 98 to 1--98 to \n1. It took us better than a week. It took the House an hour--98 to 1.\n  The next bill was the unfunded mandates bill, another bill that \npassed 86 to 10, 2 weeks or more. Two weeks of endless debate, delay. \nWhy? Did they disagree? Of course not, 86 to 10. Was the bill changed a \nlot? No.\n  So what was the point? What was the point there? Why did we do that? \nWhy did we go through that? Why have we gone 2 weeks on this rescission \nbill?\n  Are there a lot of amendments substantive to the bill? Oh, a couple.\n  Have we had lots of interesting debate? Some.\n  Have there been agreements to move the bill along, to actually come \nto votes on some of these things? No, no; we cannot do that. Well, \ntomorrow we have a vote on cloture on this bill. Cloture means to end \nthe debate. Let us get this thing done. Let us end the debate tomorrow \nand let us stay here and finish the bill. We will see how many of these \ndeficit hawks, these people who really are concerned about getting the \ndeficit under control--and I will guarantee you, every one of the \npeople delaying this bill will go back home to their States over the \nrecess and talk about how they are for deficit reduction; how they are \nfor changing Washington; how they want to make things different here; \nhow this just happened to be a bad bill; how this just went a little \ntoo far.\n  Folks, this is $15 billion in deficit reduction--excuse me, $15 \nbillion in spending cuts and deficit reduction. That is out of $1.6 \ntrillion, and this goes too far? Get serious. Nobody believes it goes \ntoo far. These are the decisions we have to make that we are no longer \nforced to make, that we are not going to be forced to make because the \nbalanced budget amendment did not pass.\n  So the unwritten story, the story that may be written here--I hope \nnot--but the story that may be written here in the next couple of days \nis going to be how 46 Senators conspired to stop the train, did \neverything they could, everything they could to make sure that \nelections do not matter. That is right, that elections do not matter; \nthat what people on November 8 said is irrelevant, that it did not \nhappen. Denial and hope that if they just keep muddying the waters, if \nthey just keep deflecting away the real issues before us, that maybe \nthey will just blame the whole lot of us and not them.\n  I had to come out here today and just say the buck stops there. You \nwant to change Washington? You know where the change has to happen. It \nis very simple. Do not let all these cries about, oh, how this is going \nto be so terrible--offer your amendments. You want to put back money \nfor WIC? I will offer an offset. I will pay for the increase, and I \nwill vote with you. I will increase money for WIC--Women, Infants, and \nChildren. I have no problem with that. That is a good program. We will \nput more money back in. You will get a lot of Republicans to vote for \nthat. Just come up with the money to offset it. Just pay for it. Keep \nthe deficit reduction at the same level so if you want to add in $50 \nmillion for it, fine, we will take $50 million out of, oh, let us pick \nthe AmeriCorps Program and offset it.\n  Set your priorities. Is that not what you want us to do? Do you not \nwant us to set priorities? Do you not want us to say this program is \nmore important than this program? We, obviously, would love to give all \nthe money to every program and everything we want to do. But as \neverybody in America, maybe outside of 46 people in this room, believes \nand knows, we do not have all the money to give for everything. So we \nhave to set priorities.\n  Let us set them. Come on down to the floor. Offer those amendments. \nPut that money back in for WIC. I will be right there with you. Take \nthe other programs you say are just outrageous cuts; come on, let us \ntalk about them and let us set priorities. Let us offset that money. \nLet us do it. Let us show the American public we really do care, that \nthe deficit is really important.\n  You have the chairman of the Budget Committee here, the Senator from \nNew Mexico. I know he cares about the budget. I know his family has not \nseen much of him because that is all he is doing probably is working on \nhow to get to that balanced budget, and he is making a lot of tough \ndecisions. Folks, we are ready to make the decisions. You told us in \nthe balanced budget debate you were ready to make the decisions. Why \nare you not here? What is the problem? Is it just politics? Is it just \npartisanship? Do you not want to come here and solve problems? We \ndeserve better. This institution deserves better.\n  Eleven freshmen Republicans did not come here to let the status quo \ncontinue. You want to fight; you do not want to come here and make \nthings happen. We are ready. We are ready. We will stand here as long \nas it takes. We are ready to do battle.\n  We are ready to let the American public decide what direction they \nwant this country to take: More spending, more Government, more power, \nmore control in the hands of the people in Washington; or more money, \nmore power, more control, more freedom in your hands on Main Street, \nAmerica? That is the issue. We are ready. We are waiting. And we will \nwait, and we will wait, and we will wait.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk today to everyone in this \nbody and every American who will listen and, in particular, senior \ncitizens across this land, because something is happening that we are \nnot paying attention to and we ought to be doing \n[[Page S5188]] something about. I want to share it with you.\n  Again, I repeat, I hope the senior citizens, who themselves are \nconcerned about the future, will pay heed to what occurred the day \nbefore yesterday when the trustees of the Medicare program issued their \nrelease with reference to the status of this fund. The trustees of \nMedicare released their 1995 annual report, Mr. President, on the \nhospital insurance trust fund. This looks like yet another boring \nGovernment report. But the information contained within it is \nsingularly alarming. The information contained in this report affects \nthe lives of all Americans, and has an immediate effect on the lives of \nsenior citizens.\n  I want to read from the cover letter that was sent with this report:\n\n       The Medicare hospital insurance trust fund is expected to \n     be exhausted in the year 2002. While the status of the HI \n     trust fund has thus improved slightly since last year, it \n     still does not meet the board's test of short-range financial \n     adequacy.\n\n  Translated, this means Medicare is going bankrupt 7 years from now. \nIt will not have the money in the fund to pay the hospital bills of \nseniors then in the hospitals of America expecting their bills to be \npaid under the current Medicare program. If we do nothing, Medicare \npart A, that portion that pays for hospital benefits, will run out of \nmoney in the next 7 years.\n  I rise today to tell my colleagues and the American people that we \nmust work together to save Medicare from bankruptcy.\n  This is not one part of America's problem. It is not a Republican \nproblem, a Democrat problem, an independent problem. It is everyone's \nproblem.\n  We will look at why Medicare is going bankrupt. As we can see on this \nchart, the bottom line is flat. This line represents the money coming \ninto the trust fund from payroll taxes on current workers in the United \nStates.\n  The amount of money we are projected to pay out for Medicare is going \nto continue growing. The top line represents money we are going to \nspend on Medicare benefits. The Congressional Budget Office, our \nofficial scorekeeper, tells Members that Medicare outlays are projected \nto grow more than 10 percent each year. That means if we leave programs \nlike they are, if we leave the delivery system like it is, that program \nwill go up 10 percent a year in cost.\n  This is unsustainable. The trend is obvious. The black line is the \ntrend of 10 percent a year. I do not think we can afford to let \nMedicare spending continue to grow more than 10 percent every year. If \nwe do, the consequence is absolutely and unequivocally and simply that \nMedicare will go under.\n  I, for one, will strive diligently not to let that happen. I hope \nmany Senators from both sides of the aisle and many House Members from \nboth sides of the aisle will help Members keep that from happening.\n  My hope that the President would help do that is dwindling rapidly. I \nwill share with the U.S. Senators why I believe that is a fair \nconclusion.\n  I cannot sit by and let it happen because I have promised the people \nof my State I would protect Medicare. To do nothing and leave the \nprogram alone is not to protect it. If I do nothing as a Senator, and \nif we do nothing, it will go bankrupt. Therefore, my commitment and \npromise requires that we act to save this system. I am not about to let \nit go bankrupt in 7 years.\n  There are some other interesting facts in the trustees' report that I \nbelieve should be spread out here in the Senate, and for those who are \ninterested, through the networks that tell the people what we are \nsaying, this report says, if we do not change our projected Medicare \nspending and if we want Medicare in long-term balance, if we want to \nput it in that position, we would have to raise payroll taxes by 3\\1/2\\ \npercentage points. The report says that.\n  I note my distinguished friend from New York is present and I hope I \ndo not misinterpret anything in the report.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. No, sir, you do not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In other words, if we do not change the slope of this \ntop line, which represents 10 percent per year growth, we are going to \nhave to raise the bottom line. That means raising the current HI \npayroll tax from 2.9 percent to 6.4 percent. That is 120 percent \nincrease. Those are not my numbers, their numbers. Those charts were \ntelling the status of this.\n  Our other option, obviously, is to slow the growth of Medicare \nspending by changing the system or changing something within the \nsystem.\n  What else do these trustees say? They say:\n\n       The HI program is severely out of financial balance and the \n     trustees believe that Congress must take timely action to \n     establish long-term fiscal stability for this program. The \n     trustees believe that prompt, effective, decisive action is \n     necessary.\n\n  They did not say wait until after the next election. They did not say \nwait 3 years. They did not say it is too tough, so do not do it. We \nasked them to tell Members what to do, and they are saying, ``Congress, \nchange it, fix it, and fix it now.''\n  These trustees are urging Congress to act. They are telling Members \nto save Medicare. They are telling Members that Medicare part A is \ngoing to go bankrupt in 7 years.\n  I have said that five times. Before I am finished, I hope to say it \nthree more times. Perhaps we should say it 10 times a day until some \npeople in this Congress, besides a few, decide that we must fix this \nnow.\n  I want to read from another report. Last year I served on the \nBipartisan Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform, cochaired by \ncurrent Senator Bob Kerrey and retired Senator Jack Danforth. Thirty of \nthe 32 members of the bipartisan commission signed the interim report \nto the President. He asked for it. We sent it to him. I want to read \nfinding No. 6 from that report.\n\n       To respond to the Medicare trustees' call to action and \n     ensure Medicare's long-term viability, spending and revenues \n     available for the program must be brought into long-term \n     balance.\n\n  Not the black line and the green line and the monstrous wedge, or \ndifferential, but so that the lines on the chart are one.\n  Let Members make no mistake about it. If we pass the President's \nbudget, the highly touted budget of the President, Medicare will go \nbankrupt in 7 years. The President's budget did nothing on Medicare. \nThe President's budget proposed three tiny changes to the program. \nThese changes have no effect on those lines.\n  Secretary Shalala testified before the Budget Committee--I believe \nthe distinguished occupant of the chair was present--2 months ago. I \nasked her what the administration intended to do about Medicare. She \nsaid they would wait until the new trustees' report came out before \nthey made a recommendation. So the Secretary, representing the \nPresident, 2 months ago said, ``Let's wait until the report.''\n  Now, of course, there is something slightly funny about all of this. \nI have not told Members who the trustees are. The trustees are \nShalala--Secretary Shalala. She is one of these trustees. Treasury \nSecretary Rubin is another of these trustees. Labor Secretary Reich is \na third member. Out of the six Medicare trustees, three are Cabinet \nSecretaries to this administration. The fourth also works for the \nadministration.\n  So, would we not think that the administration Cabinet Secretaries \nwould recommend some specific action, Mr. President? Ultimately, they \ndo not. Instead, they recommend that we create an advisory counsel that \nwill provide information to help lead to the effective solutions to the \nproblems of the program.\n  The Cabinet Secretaries are apparently recommending that we continue \nto study the problem, that we engage in a study program instead of \nchanging the program.\n  Now, however, I want to tell Members the difference between citizens \nwho do not represent this administration or any Members of Congress who \nare on this board who are trustees, I want to tell Members what they \nhave to say, Mr. President. Citizens understand reality.\n  I want to turn to trustees Nos. 5 and 6. These are public trustees, \ntwo citizens who do not work for the Government but have given their \ntime over the past 5 years to this Nation. I understand by party \naffiliation one is a Democrat, one is a Republican. In any event, I \nthank them profusely. Their names are Stanford Ross and David Walker. \nMr. Ross and Mr. Walker have been trustees for Medicare and the Social \nSecurity for the past 5 years.\n They \n[[Page S5189]] have been trustees during both the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations. They are nonpolitical, private citizens charged with \nworking in the best interests of senior citizens and our country. Most \nimportant, they do not answer to the White House.\n  In the past, Mr. Ross and Mr. Walker have issued their own \nstatements. Believe it or not, the trustees issued a report and the \ncitizen members issue their own report in the back of the book because \nthey do not agree with the public members.\n  So, what do they have to say? I want to read some of these two public \ntrustees' statements into the Record.\n\n       The Medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its \n     present form.\n\n  Further quote:\n\n       With the results of last Congress, it is now clear that \n     Medicare reform needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct \n     legislative initiative.\n\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       The idea that reductions in Medicare expenditures should be \n     available for other purposes, including even other health \n     care purposes, is mistaken.\n\n  Why do I quote that? I will tell you a little more about that in a \nmoment. Continuing on:\n\n       The focus should be on making Medicare itself sustainable, \n     making it compatible with Social Security, and making both \n     [of them] financially sound in the long term.\n\n  That is the end the quotes. Now, my own conclusions from that.\n  That is what public, nonpolitical trustees say we should do about \nMedicare and that is exactly what I hope we are going to do. I would be \nquick to add, as Senator Chafee has pointed out, when Congress \nincreased taxes on Social Security benefits in 1993, it devoted the \nincreased revenues to this HI trust fund. Therefore there should be no \ndoubt, if we now repeal that increase we would be lowering the amount \nof money going into this HI fund, causing the system to go bankrupt \neven sooner.\n  We must enact comprehensive Medicare reform to make Medicare \nfinancially sound now. And we must do that so it will be manageable and \nsound over the long term. We must make it sustainable and do that now. \nWe must act to preserve the system, to ensure that our senior citizens \nreceive Medicare today and will continue to receive it in 7 years from \nnow. There is nothing magical about it. We have to do something. If we \ndo not do anything it will be bankrupt. Current seniors for the next 5 \nor 6 years will get their hospital bill paid as per the law, but \nthereafter they will not.\n  What kind of public servants and leaders are we, if we do nothing \nagain? So I am committing today that the U.S. Senate Budget Committee \nis going to mark up a budget resolution. After we return from this \nrecess that will get done. At least from my standpoint, as chairman, I \ncommit to a blueprint that not only achieves balance in terms of our \nfiscal house, but also addresses this critical problem. In order to \nmake Medicare financially sound and a financially sound program once \nagain, Congress will have to follow.\n  I made a comment that I did not follow up on, where I said the \nnonpolitical trustees, the two who are not Members of the President's \nCabinet, said that Medicare savings should be used--Senator Gorton--to \nmake the program solvent. Not to pay for something else.\n  One might say, ``Who intends to spend them for something else? What \nare you talking about?'' I suggest the President ought to let us know \nwhat he has in mind. He proposed a $130 billion in Medicare savings 2 \nyears ago. He did not help with this, not one bit. Because he spent the \nmoney. He spent it to cover other people with health care coverage \nproblems. I submit that one of the reasons the President of the United \nStates did not put Medicare reform in his budget is because he intends \nto use Medicare reform savings to pay for health care reform, not to \nput it on the deficit. I submit we ought to have that debate.\n  We ought to ask the American people: Do you want to make this program \nsolvent as it should be, or do you want to take savings that you can \nget from reform and decide we are so rich we can just spend it on \nanother program? That is simple and that is oversimplification, but it \nis the real question. Some will say, Senator Domenici, it is not that \nsimple. We need to cover all the other people who are not covered and \nit will ultimately help this program. But to tell you the truth, that \nis very, very difficult to understand. It is very difficult to figure \nwe are really going to do that someday.\n  So I submit in the next 6 months this body, the U.S. Senate, has a \nreal chance to vote on whether they are going to make this program for \nfuture senior citizens and those who have been paying into this fund \nfor a long time, this 2.9 percent--for those, are we going to make it \nsolvent or not? I believe there is a way to do it without a huge amount \nof pain. I might just suggest it is amazing that the two programs, big \nprograms in health care that are still on a hell-bent-for-bankruptcy \ngrowth line are the two programs the U.S. Federal Government still \nruns.\n  There are no other programs that are growing at 10 percent a year. Go \nask businesses, are they paying 10 percent more, year after year, for \ninsurance coverage for their employees? They will tell you no. It was \n14 percent or 15 percent 3 years ago, but it is down to 4 and 5 in some \ncases. In fact, we got a report the other day, some of them that were \ngrowing at 12 or 13 percent are now down at no growth, getting the same \ncoverage. Why? Because they are trying new delivery systems. They are \ntrying managed care. They are trying health maintenance organizations. \nThey are trying those kinds of delivery systems which everybody knows \nare inevitable.\n  But we hang onto Medicare and we lead our senior citizens to believe \nthat they are only going to get good health care if we keep the system \nthat the rest of the public is beginning to say does not work, it is \ntoo expensive. So that is why we can fix this and we can fix it without \ndenying our senior citizens good, solid health care. And the programs \nmust continue to grow because we know health care for seniors cannot be \na zero sum game.\n  So I thought we ought to tie in, today, sort of the first \npresentation of the issue with reference to fiscal policy. If you do \nnot want to fix this you probably do not want a balanced budget and, \nmore important than anything else, you probably do not want to do \nanything very difficult to get to a balanced budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on March 23, together with Senators Kerry, \nFeingold, and Snowe, I submitted Senate Resolution 91 condemning the \nTurkish invasion of Northern Iraq. Since then, Senators Biden, D'Amato, \nSarbanes, and Simon have become cosponsors. With such strong bipartisan \nsupport, I hoped to move this resolution to Senate passage. Until \ntoday, I had intended to offer it as an amendment to the pending \nlegislation. Given the fluidity of the floor situation--particularly \nthe difficulties involving the Jordan debt amendment, and the need to \nsend that matter to the President as soon as possible--I think it best \nnot to offer a foreign policy amendment to this bill.\n  I remain deeply concerned, however, about Turkey's continued military \noperations in northern Iraq, and I wish to address that subject now. In \nthe past several days, I have had occasion to pursue this issue at the \nhighest levels of both the United States and Turkish Governments. I \nhave had an exchange of letters with both the President and the \nSecretary of State, and just this morning, I and other members of the \nForeign Relations Committee met with the Turkish Foreign Minister.\n  Specifically, I am disturbed by Turkey's continued military presence \nin Iraqi Kurdistan, and by the Government's unwillingness to set a date \ncertain for withdrawal. Turkey should withdraw now.\n  While I appreciate Turkey's legitimate desire to combat the terrorist \nthreat posed by the PKK, I believe the military action in Northern Iraq \ngoes beyond mere self-defense, and furthermore offers virtually no \nprospect of eradicating PKK terror. The vast majority of terrorist \nattacks in Turkey \n[[Page S5190]] are carried out not from Northern Iraq, but from inside \nTurkey itself. Turkey's repressive treatment of its own Kurds has \nforced thousands of civilian Kurds to flee to Northern Iraq. This has \nmade it easier, in fact, for a small number of PKK terrorists to use \ncivilian settlements in Northern Iraq as cover.\n  The Turkish incursion puts at risk thousands of Kurdish civilians \nliving in Northern Iraq. To my mind, the Turkish incursion is a \nviolation of international law, that must be brought to an end.\n  Furthermore, reports indicate that Turkey has made difficult access \nto areas of the conflict to representatives of international relief \norganizations, such as the International Red Cross. At a minimum, \nTurkey should take immediate steps to ensure the protection of innocent \ncivilians and refugees. It also appears that Turkey has restricted \njournalists' access to critical areas of the conflict.\n  I must say that I took small comfort in the thought that Turkey is \narranging tours for journalists and\n that it must place limits on access to the ICRC to ensure that the PKK \ndoes not receive assistance. I believe that the ICRC has vast \nexperience in these matters, and certainly is as capable as the Turkish \nGovernment in determining how best to assist civilians caught in the \nfighting.\n\n  I will say that in my consultations with the U.S. Government on these \nmatters, I have been pleased to see an acknowledgment of--and a \nconcerted effort to--address my concerns. The President has assured me \nthat United States officials in Washington and Ankara are pressing \nTurkey daily to protect innocent civilians and to withdraw at the \nearliest possible date.\n  The Secretary of State acknowledges that Turkey has been denying \naccess to journalists and nongovernmental organizations, and informs me \nthat the United States is working at the highest levels to rectify this \nsituation. I am pleased to learn that United States embassy officials \nare visiting Iraqi Kurdistan this very week, and that Secretary Talbott \nand Secretary Holbrooke will travel to Ankara where they will pursue \nour concerns. I await their reports anxiously.\n  I welcome the apparent shift in the administration's approach to the \ntroubling aspects of the invasion. The administration seems much more \nwilling to question Turkey's motives and behavior, and to confront \nTurkey on these troubling issues. Although I still intend to pursue \nadoption of my resolution at the earliest practical time, I do believe \nU.S. policy is moving in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am glad that my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from New Mexico is still on the floor.\n  If I got the message of the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, it is that President Clinton is not doing anything while \nMedicare is going broke.\n  Mr. President, that is about as topsy-turvy as you can get it. the \ntruth of the matter is that Presidents Reagan and Bush were the ones \nwho did nothing while we spent ourselves blind. It was the Congress--\nRepublicans and Democrats--who overwhelmingly voted for the Reagan tax \ncut in 1981. This particular Senator, Senator Mathias, and Senator \nBradley were the only ones to vote against those tax cuts and also vote \nfor the spending cuts. We were trying to hold the line and pay the \nbill.\n  At that particular time, we did not have hundred billion dollar \ndeficits. We had suffered during the 1970's when the impact of the OPEC \ncartel sent our country into a recession. In response, we had an \neconomic summit with President Ford, and eventually worked our way down \nto a $57 billion deficit when President Reagan took office.\n  But after the Reagan tax cuts, we saw the first $100 billion and the \nfirst $200 billion deficit. Then, under President Bush, we saw the \nfirst $300 billion deficit. Before he left town, if you didn't use the \nsurpluses in the trust funds to mask the size of the deficit, the red \nink rose to over $400 billion.\n  So President Clinton did not cause this problem. What did he do about \nit? Very admirably, he came to town and put all his political cards on \nthe table, saying that you cannot get on top of this deficit unless you \ncontrol health care costs.\n  In his first budget as President recommended cuts in Medicare and \nMedicaid which the Senate adopted to the tune of $63 billion. Every \nRepublican voted against these cuts. The distinguished occupant of the \nchair was not here. He may have been over on the House side where we \ndid not get a Republican vote either. In the Senate, the Vice President \nhad to break the tie. The President then followed up with his health \ncare package containing additional Medicare and Medicaid reductions \nthat the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nMoynihan, labeled as ``fantasy.'' At the time Republicans took great \npride in attacking the President, but to his credit he stuck to his \nguns.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of my rising this afternoon is to remind \nmy colleagues of that piece of history. If the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee wants to stand on the floor of the Senate with a big chart \nshowing the deficit going up, let us remember that President Clinton \ndid not start that line up. We did, long before the gentleman from \nLittle Rock, AR, even came to town. Indeed, before President Clinton \narrived the line would be even steeper.\n  Against all of this criticism of the President for ``taking a walk'' \nor ``waving the white flag,'' I want to get right to the heart of my \nrub with the chairman of the Budget Committee. I read: ``accepts the \nPresident's proposed reductions in the Medicare program and indexes the \ncurrent $100 annual part B deductions for inflation. Total Medicare \nsavings would reach $80 billion over the next 5 years.''\n  That is the chairman of the Budget Committee, outlining the ``GOP \nAlternative Deficit Reduction and Tax Relief Plan,'' just last April.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    GOP Alternative: Deficit Reduction and Tax Relief--Slashing the \n                  Deficit, Cutting Middle Class Taxes\n\n       The Republican Alternative Budget will reduce the deficit \n     $318 billion over the next five years--$287 billion in policy \n     savings and $31 billion from interest savings. This is $322 \n     billion more in deficit reduction than the President proposes \n     and $303 billion more in deficit reduction than the House-\n     passed resolution contains.\n       Moreover, the GOP alternative budget helps President \n     Clinton achieve two of his most important campaign promises--\n     to cut the deficit in half in four years and provide a \n     middle-class tax cut. The GOP plan:\n       Reduces the deficit to $99 billion in 1999. This is $106 \n     billion less than the 1999 deficit projected under the \n     Clinton budget.\n       Even under this budget federal spending will continue to \n     grow.\n       Total spending would increase from $1.48 trillion in FY \n     1995 to more than $1.7 trillion in FY 1999.\n       Medicare would grow by 7.8-percent a year rather than the \n     projected 10.6-percent. Medicaid's growth would slow to 8.1-\n     percent annually rather than the projected 12-percent a year \n     growth.\n       It increases funding for President Clinton's defense \n     request by the $20 billion short-fall acknowledged by the \n     Pentagon.\n       Provides promised tax relief to American families and small \n     business:\n       Provides tax relief to middle-class families by providing a \n     $500 tax credit for each child in the household. The \n     provision grants needed tax relief to the families of 52 \n     million American children. The tax credit provides a typical \n     family of four $80 every month for family expenses and \n     savings.\n       Restores deductibility for interest on student loans.\n       Indexes capital gains for inflation and allows for capital \n     loss on principal residence.\n       Creates new incentives for family savings and investments \n     through new IRA proposals that would allow penalty free \n     withdrawals for first time homebuyers, educational and \n     medical expenses.\n       Establishes new Individual Retirement Account for \n     homemakers.\n       Extends R tax credit for one-year and provides for a one-\n     year exclusion of employer provided educational assistance.\n       Adjusts depreciation schedules for inflation (neutral cost \n     recovery).\n       Tax provisions result in total tax cut of $88 billion over \n     five years.\n       Fully funds the Senate Crime Bill Trust Fund, providing $22 \n     billion for anti-crime measures over the next five years. The \n     Clinton budget does not. The House-passed budget does not. \n     The Chairman's mark does not.\n       Accepts the President's proposed $113 billion level in \n     nondefense discretionary spending reductions and then secures \n     additional \n     [[Page S5191]] savings by freezing aggregate nondefense \n     spending for five years.\n       Accepts the President's proposed reductions in the medicare \n     program and indexes the current $100 annual Part ``B'' \n     deductible for inflation. Total medicare savings would reach \n     $80 billion over the next five years.\n       Achieves $64 billion in medicaid savings over the next five \n     years, by capping medicaid payments, reducing and freezing \n     Disproportionate Share Hospital payments at their 1994 level.\n       Achieves additional savings through reform of our welfare \n     system totaling $33 billion over the next five years.\n       Repeals Davis-Bacon, reduces the number of political \n     appointees, reduces overhead expenditures for university \n     research, and achieves savings from a cap on civilian FTE's.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, Mr. President, what galls my friends on the other \nside of the aisle is that the President of the United States did not \ngive them a ball to run with this year. They thought the President \nmight want to be harassed again and would propose another multibillion-\ndollar plan. Why go through that act again? Instead, he understandably \nsaid, ``If you have a better way to do it, you do it.'' But rather than \ndoing it, they come here with the false representation that the \nPresident of the United States has done nothing about Medicare. In so \ndoing, the Republicans are making a feeble attempt to justify the \nenormous Medicare cuts that will be part of the Republican plan.\n  But we have seen their record on preserving the Medicare Trust Fund. \nOne of the major proposals in the Contract With America would repeal \nrecent changes in Social Security and would result in bankrupting the \nMedicare trust fund. If there is any movement around town to really \nmake sure that Medicare goes broke quicker than 2002, it is to be found \nin the Contract With America.\n  The pundits on the weekend programs need to tell the American people \nthe truth, namely that the entire contract is eyewash. Like a \nhurricane, as we learned down home, you just have to let it blow on \nthrough.\n  When all fanfare and fireworks are over, it does not create one \nsingle job, and it does not pay one single bill. It is all symbols and \nno substance. Unfortunately, the media treats the entire Government \nlike spectator sport up here, finding out who is on top, and who won \nthis particular vote, without focusing on the long term to find out \nwhere we are headed.\n  Mr. President the inference I took from the comments I heard earlier \nwas that the President was not being responsible. In fact, it is we \nmembers of the Budget Committee who have not been responsible. The law \nthat says by April 1 the budget should be reported out of the Senate \nBudget Committee and by April 15 it is supposed to become law.\n  Here it is April 5. The Budget Committee has not even started its \nwork on the budget resolution and, yet we are running around with \ntables, charts, contracts, and hoopla. All symbols, no substance; all \nprocess, no product.\n  In December, Mr. Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, told \nus on ``Meet the Press'' that we were going to have three budgets. In \naddition, we were going to have spending cuts and put them in the bank \nbefore we got any tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, we do not have the spending cuts, but in the House \ntoday, they are voting on tax cuts. And where are the spending cuts \nthat they promised? In January I put in the Record a list of spending \ncuts and an illustrative glide path to balance the budget by the year \n2002.\n  (Ms. SNOWE) assumed the chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We computed that you had to have at least $37 billion \nin cuts to put us on that glidepath of Government in the black by the \nyear 2002.\n  That does not take into measure any tax cuts. You are going to lose \nanother $189 billion over 5 years, if the House succeeds with their tax \ncut. I was asked earlier this morning about the tax cut. I said, ``A \ntax cut really means a tax increase.''\n  They said, ``That is doubletalk. What do you mean?''\n  I said, ``You have to think it through. The first thing your \nGovernment did this morning at 8 o'clock was go down to the bank and \nborrow 1 billion bucks and add it to the debt.'' That is interest \ncosts. They should more appropriately be called interest taxes in that \nthey cannot be avoided. We are adding it to the debt which is now \nrapidly approaching $5 trillion bucks. Gross interest costs now total \n$339 billion and, with rising interest rates, it will soon surpass $1 \nbillion a day.\n  Thus, if you care to have a tax cut for the middle class, you have in \nreality burdened the middle class by increasing interest taxes and \ndriving ever skyward, the Federal debt.\n  The contract is a political exercise designed to make it look like we \nare thinking about the middle class when in reality we are depriving \nthe middle class. You are doing it to them, not for them, when you pass \nthat tax cut.\n  I cosponsored a bill earlier this year, along with the Senator from \nWisconsin, saying that we oppose the tax cuts would rather any savings \nbe used to reduce the deficit. I am glad the Senate now has gone on \nrecord to that effect.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to have printed in the \nRecord at this point, dated January 23, the truth in budgeting \nproposal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements. \n     Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable. Health reform can and should save some, but \n     slowing growth from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough \n     savings. Social Security won't be cut and will be off-budget \n     again.\n       Reality No. 3: We should hold the line on the budget on \n     Defense; that would be no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes and cuts in \n     domestic discretionary spending but that's not enough to stop \n     hemorrhaging interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes are necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1996            1997            1998            1999            2000            2001            2002     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 1995 (using trust                                                                                                                      \n funds).................................             207             224             225            253             284             297             322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998.               0               0               0            -19             -38             -58             -78 \nSpending cuts...........................             -37             -74            -111           -128            -146            -163            -180 \nInterest savings........................              -1              -5             -11            -20             -32             -46             -64 \n                                         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total savings ($1.2 trillion).......             -38             -79            -122           -167            -216            -267            -322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nRemaining deficit using trust funds.....             169             145             103             86              68              30               0 \nRemaining deficit excluding trust funds.             287             264             222            202             185             149             121 \n5 percent VAT...........................              96             155             172            184             190             196             200 \nNet deficit excluding trust funds.......             187              97              27            (17)            (54)           (111)           (159)\nGross debt..............................           5,142           5,257           5,300          5,305           5,272           5,200           5,091 \nAverage interest rate on debt (percent).             7.0             7.1             6.9            6.8             6.7             6.7             6.7 \nInterest cost on the debt...............             367             370             368            368             366             360             354 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Figures are in billions.

I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Finally, I could not get to the floor yesterday, but I heard my \ndistinguished colleague from Kansas, the majority leader, constantly \ntalking about,\n\n       Well, if you want to talk about children, why didn't you \n     think about it when we were voting for the balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution? That is when you should have \n     been thinking about children. The Democrats flip-flopped.\n\n  Well, let me correct that record. The flip-flopper is the majority \nleader. He voted for my law, section 13301, of the Budget Enforcement \nAct, signed by President Bush on November 5, 1990. In a word, it says \n``Thou shalt not use Social Security funds for the deficit.''\n  Unfortunately, I cannot find it in the newspapers. If they ever print \nit, I am going to give them some kind of Pulitzer Prize. I have seen \nmagazine articles. I just saw Susan Dentzer in the U.S. News and World \nReport; I saw Time magazine; I have seen Newsweek. But have not seen \nanywhere in print that we have a law saying you cannot use Social \nSecurity funds for the deficit.\n  In direct conflict with that law, section 7 of the balanced budget \namendment says, ``On, no, all receipts and all revenues shall be \nused.''\n  I cannot go in two different directions. No, I was not thinking of \nthe children. I was thinking of the trust we made with the senior \ncitizens.\n  But I am thinking of children, though, and what will happen when they \nbegin to use those funds. When their time comes in the next century, \nthey are going to have to be taxed a second time to get their money. \nAnd that is why I do not want that $600 billion in Social Security \nfunds to be used for this charade of balancing the budget.\n  The balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is supposed to put \na gun to the head of Congress to give us discipline. Instead, it makes \nCongress creative.\n  I remember what happened during the budget summit of 1990. The \nleadership went out to Andrews Air Base and said, ``We're going to put \nin caps,'' and the caps--well, they were way higher than this ceiling. \nI do not believe they ever brought them in for us to look at. All these \nwords, charades, plays and games have to be understood for what they \nare.\n  The majority leader says that they do not intend to use Social \nSecurity funds. He said so in the debate on the floor, and others have \nsaid so.\n  But we know differently. If they can use $600 billion of Social \nSecurity funds to make it look balanced, they will, in effect, only be \nmoving the deficit from the general Government over to the Social \nSecurity fund.\n  I am ready to get serious. The budget was supposed to be reported out \non April 1, pass both Houses and be sent to the President by April 15.\n  So let us not come on the floor of the Senate and chastise the \nPresident of the United States for being guilty of a crime that he did \nnot commit. We cannot in good conscience continue this game against the \nWhite House.\n  I can tell you, nothing is going to happen around here because I am \ngoing to start joining in this game. I was not going to come to the \nfloor today. I did not feel so kindly toward the executive branch \nbecause we had worked, the Republicans and Democrats from both sides of \nthe aisle, on a very complicated telecommunications bill. We reported \nit out with 8 of the 10 Republicans approving it. We got it out with \nall nine of the Democrats approving it. We had a bipartisan bill \nreported out of the Commerce Committee last week. We were ready to go \nthis week. But then along comes the Vice President and says he does not \nlike the provisions in the bill about cable TV. There are a lot of \nthings I don't feel totally comfortable with, but this bill is a \nbipartisan compromise bill. A compromise between the Republican bill \nand the Democratic bill that reflects a lot of give-and-take. Overall \nthis bill is good for the public. The Republicans wanted to totally \nderegulate the upper tiers, the Democrats did not let them. We still \nhave the basic tier regulated. We did the best we could do with the \nvotes we had in committee. Another example where we had to compromise \nwas on the question of RBOC entry into long distance. We still have the \nDepartment of Justice in a consultative role. I can go down point by \npoint where the Democrats would have supported a stronger position. \nJust look at the Democratic draft of February 15. But my reaction this \nmorning when I read the paper about the administration's position \nreminds me of the story when Churchill was talking to Stalin about the \nSoviet troops going into East Poland and how the Pope was worried about \nit. And Stalin is reported to have asked: ``How many divisions does the \nPope have?''\n  This morning my question was, how many votes does the Vice President \nhave? We know the votes pretty well, and I can tell you the votes \nweren't there in committee. We have a bill we could have passed in a \nbipartisan fashion here in 2, maybe 3 days, like we had planned. The \ncommittee reported out a similar bill, S. 1822, by a vote of 18 to 2 \nlast year. We reported it out 18 to 2. I support Senator Pressler's \nbill.\n  When we get to the floor, there will be some amendments. But when the \nexecutive branch says ``veto''--I hear now the Vice President said he \ndid not say ``veto''--it sends a very conflicting signal. I asked the \ndistinguished chairman of our Commerce Committee this morning, ``Larry, \ndid he say veto?'' He said he used the word five times. So I asked my \nstaff and they said that the administration would veto the \ncommunications bill in its current form.\n  So if they are going to veto it, then I feel sort of relieved of my \nfurther responsibility of trying to maintain the core provisions of the \nbill. I was very fearful we might get rolled on the amendments, such as \na date-certain entry on long distance. If that passed, then there would \nbe no so-called level playing field. There would be no competition \ntest, and you would have the RBOC's moving in and extending their \nmonopoly rather than real competition in the local exchange. And bet \nyour boots the RBOC's have the clout to do it.\n  In the middle of all this criticism of the committee, we can at least \nbe \n[[Page S5193]] thankful to the heads of AmeriTech, AT, the Justice \nDepartment, and particularly Anne Bingaman, the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Antitrust.\n  That is not the case at all. That lady is an astute trial lawyer. She \nknows her subject and works around the clock and has been working for \nmonths on getting this so-called consent presentation to Judge Greene.\n  I say kudos to Anne Bingaman; the president of AmeriTech; to Bob \nLaland, the president of AT and I think it was the fellow from the \nConsumer Federation of America.\n  The four appeared on television the day before yesterday. What they \nhad was a proposal. They proposed that they move forward, and they had \nthe steps and we looked at our bill. We looked at the steps and they \nare one and the same.\n  Why should we delay and palaver on the floor of the Congress when the \nparties in the particular discipline have all agreed?\n  Long distance, ARBOCK, Justice Department, Consumer Federation, have \nall gotten together. We had a real good kickoff. I am particularly \nindebted to those parties, and particularly the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, and to the Department of Justice, in charge of the antitrust.\n  I see other Senators wishing to be recognized. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5189-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5193-S5207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AMERICA'S SENSITIVE NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President and colleagues, I rise to speak briefly \ntoday about a rather curious development in the history of U.S. efforts \nto halt the global spread of nuclear weapons.\n  The hallmark of a good law is its ability to balance elements of \npermanence and change. A good law offers both fixed compass points and \nsufficient latitude for tactical navigation.\n  Our nonproliferation legislation offers no exception to this rule. \nWhen our laws and policies apply too much sail or too much anchor, the \nconsequences can be devastating for vital national security interests \nof the United States.\n  For example, the notion of timely warning--that is, a legal \nprecondition for certain forms of nuclear cooperation that was placed \ninto the Atomic Energy Act to ensure stringent controls over exported \nU.S. nuclear materials and technology--has been rendered virtually \nmeaningless by the way various administrations have used this term over \nthe last decade to expedite commercial uses of U.S.-controlled \nplutonium in other countries.\n   United States nuclear cooperation with Japan and with members of \nEURATOM, the European Atomic Energy Community, a region plagued by \ndaily headlines of new black market nuclear deals, are two specific \ncases where large-scale nuclear cooperation is proceeding without \ntimely warning having been satisfied within the original meaning of the \nterm.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the end \nof my remarks an authoritative interpretation of this concept by Dr. \nLeonard Weiss, who is now the minority staff director of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Another example, Madam President, in 1985, following \nrepeated and flagrant violations of its peaceful nuclear assurances to \nthe United States, Pakistan was required by the Pressler amendment to \nsatisfy a certification requirement before receiving new aid. \nSpecifically, the President had to certify that Pakistan did not \npossess a nuclear explosive device and that new aid would, as numerous \nofficials from the Reagan administration had asserted, reduce \nsignificantly the risk that Pakistan would acquire such a device.\n  America funneled hundreds of millions of United States taxpayer \ndollars into Pakistan after 1985, until President Bush finally stopped \nmaking the required certifications in 1990.\n  Throughout that period, both Presidents Reagan and Bush solemnly \ncertified--using an interpretation of the word ``possess'' that would \nmake even the most cynical of our Government's legal advisors blush--\nthat Pakistan did not possess the bomb.\n  The interpretations of the words ``reduce'' and ``significantly'' \nwere similarly handled, as though they had been inscribed on something \nlike silly putty. They did not mean anything.\n  Since the aid cutoff in 1990, by the way, we have finally started to \nsee the first signs of some potential nuclear restraint in Pakistan in \nthe form of a freeze on the production of highly enriched uranium.\n  Oh yes, I almost forgot to mention the $1 billion or so in taxpayer \ndollars not doled out to Pakistan since 1990 in the name of restraining \nPakistan's bomb program. Those funds remain here at home, thanks to the \nPressler amendment.\n  As a footnote to the sad saga of Washington's failure to implement \nthe Pressler sanctions until 1990, however, our Government has since \ninterpreted the ban on assistance as not covering commercial sales of \nmilitary equipment, including spare parts for Pakistan's nuclear weapon \ndelivery vehicle, the F-16. Even joint military exercises are not \nregarded as assistance. Once again, a key nonproliferation term has \nbeen molded and distorted beyond recognition.\n  Yet, my remarks today will focus on another term that has found its \nway into the ``Twilight Zone'' of nonproliferation. I am referring to \nthe term ``sensitive nuclear technology,'' SNT, as it is known, which \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act very clearly defines as any \ninformation, other than restricted data, ``* * * which is not available \nto the public and which is important to the design, construction, \nfabrication, operation or maintenance of a uranium enrichment or \nnuclear fuel reprocessing facility or a facility for the production of \nheavy water * * *''.\n  If we look carefully into the United States-Japan agreement for \nnuclear cooperation, signed in 1987, we will find a clause in there \nthat says the following: ``* * * sensitive nuclear technology shall not \nbe transferred under this Agreement.'' That is article 2-1-b.\n  Underscoring this provision, the principal negotiator of this \nagreement, Ambassador Richard Kennedy, testified on December 16, 1987, \nbefore the House Foreign Affairs Committee: ``The transfer of \nrestricted data and sensitive nuclear technology under the agreement is \nspecifically excluded.''\n  Last September, the international environmental group, Greenpeace, \nprepared a lengthy analysis of the transfers of United States nuclear \nreprocessing technology to Japan. This study, titled ``The Unlawful \nPlutonium Alliance: Japan's Supergrade Plutonium and the Role of the \nUnited States,'' makes for interesting reading. It presents \nconsiderable evidence of United States cooperation with Japan in the \nareas of plutonium breeder reactors and nuclear fuel reprocessing.\n  On September 8, 1994, the United States Department of Energy promised \na comprehensive review of the report and further stated that it was \n``phasing out collaborative research efforts with Japan on plutonium \nreprocessing and development of breeder reactor technology.''\n  The same day, the New York Times quoted a Department of Energy \nspokesman as saying that this cooperation was ``* * * a remnant of the \nlast administration.''\n  Later, on September 23, Greenpeace was joined by the Natural \nResources Defense Council and the Nuclear Control Institute in \ndemanding several steps to restore United States-Japan nuclear \ncooperation to the constraints of United States law.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter by these organizations to Energy Secretary Hazel \nO'Leary.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Greenpeace International; Nuclear Control Institute; \n           Natural Resources Defense Council,\n                                [[Page S5194]] September 23, 1994.\n     Hon. Hazel O'Leary,\n     Secretary of Energy, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Secretary O'Leary: We are writing to you concerning \n     the Department of Energy's current review of its policies and \n     practices with respect to the export of ``sensitive nuclear \n     technology.''\n       We urge that the Department immediately suspend its July \n     1986 guidelines for determining whether technology proposed \n     to be transferred to other countries constitutes SNT within \n     the meaning of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act. We further \n     request suspension of all cooperation in reprocessing, \n     uranium enrichment, and heavy water technology pursuant to \n     the guidelines, pending the outcome of the SNT review.\n       On September 8, 1994, in response to a report issued by \n     Greenpeace, ``The Unlawful Plutonium Alliance'', outlining \n     the history of recent transfers of reprocessing technology to \n     Japan, the Department announced that it was undertaking a \n     ``comprehensive review'' of its SNT guidelines. It promised \n     to publish the results of this review within 60 days, or by \n     November 7, 1994. It further stated that it was ``phasing out \n     collaborative research efforts with Japan on plutonium \n     reprocessing and development of breeder reactor technology.''\n       As outlined in the Greenpeace report, there is no question \n     that any SNT transfers to Japan are unlawful. Indeed, the \n     1988 agreement for nuclear cooperation between Japan and the \n     United States flatly prohibits such transfers. While the \n     Department, in reliance on its internal guidelines, has \n     sought to justify the transfer of reprocessing technology to \n     Japan on the grounds that it is not SNT, the justification \n     cannot withstand scrutiny. In fact, the Department's July \n     1986 guidelines--which permit reprocessing technology to be \n     treated as something other than SNT when supplied to a \n     recipient country with a sophisticated nuclear program or \n     where it would duplicate an existing capability (the\n      rationale invoked in the case of Japan)--cannot be squared \n     with the language and intent of the NNPA.\n       Indeed, taken to its logical extreme, the Department's \n     interpretation would allow reprocessing technology transfers \n     to countries with questionable proliferation credentials. \n     However, contrary to the Department's guidelines, the NNPA \n     mandates strict, statutory controls over this highly \n     sensitive technology wherever it is to be transferred and \n     without regard to the relative nuclear sophistication of the \n     recipient.\n       Our conclusion mirrors that of the General Accounting \n     Office, which stated in a 1987 report that the Department's \n     interpretation was ``not fully consistent with the intent of \n     the NNPA.'' (GAO, ``Department of Energy Needs Tighter \n     Controls Over Reprocessing Information'', 41 GAO/RCED-87-150, \n     August 1987.)\n       Likewise, in House hearings held more than eight years ago, \n     Senator Glenn, a principal co-author of the NNPA, \n     characterized the Department's approach to SNT determinations \n     as reflecting a ``willful determination over a period of \n     years to ignore the intent of Congress.'' (Hearing on Nuclear \n     Exports before the Subcommittee on Energy Conservation and \n     Power of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 99th \n     Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5, May 15, 1986.) At the same hearing, \n     Congressman Markey called the Department's views ``bizarre'' \n     and underscored. ``In the NNPA, Congress took the view that \n     enrichment, reprocessing and heavy water manufacture are \n     inherently sensitive activities wherever they are located. No \n     latitude is specified in the act because none was intended.'' \n     Id. at 3.\n       We think the legal positions asserted in the Greenpeace \n     report, echoing those of GAO and key members of Congress, are \n     unassailable. We think far too much time has passed during \n     which the Department has ignored the requirements of law and \n     cavalierly condoned unauthorized SNT transfers. While we \n     applaud the Department for undertaking its review, we do not \n     believe that business as usual is appropriate while the \n     review is underway. Indeed, ``business as usual'', when it \n     involves continued violation of the law, is scarcely \n     something that can or should be tolerated by the Department.\n       We therefore believe it is incumbent upon the Department to \n     take three firm steps during the period of the review. First, \n     it must immediately suspend the 1986 guidelines. Second, \n     independent of the general phase-out of collaborative \n     reprocessing efforts with Japan, it must perforce suspend \n     approvals of any further technology transfers which might \n     involve SNT to any country. Third, Japan and other countries \n     with whom SNT is shared must immediately be advised of the \n     suspension of the 1986 guidelines and cooperation involving \n     SNT. Only by taking these steps can both the NNPA and the \n     review process be the 1986 guidelines and cooperation \n     involving SNT. Only by taking these steps can both the NNPA \n     and the review process be preserved and can the public have \n     adequate assurance that fundamental U.S. non-proliferation \n     law will not continue to be undermined.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views. We would \n     appreciate it if you would promptly advise us of how you \n     intend to proceed concerning our request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Clements,\n       Greenpeace International.\n     Paul Leventhal,\n       Nuclear Control Institute.\n     Christopher Paine,\n       Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Months later, on December 28, 1994, these groups received \na brief reply from the Department of Energy simply asserting that the \ntransfers to Japan were ``permissible exercises of its statutory \nauthorities.''\n  Madam President, I further ask to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the Director of the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear \nEnergy communicating DOD's view that it is permissible for the \nDepartment ``to consider the quality of technology already indigenous \nto the country that would receive the export in making the \ndetermination that sensitive nuclear technology was in fact proposed to \nbe exported in a given transaction.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 28, 1994.\n     Mr. Tom Clements,\n     Greenpeace, Inc., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Clements: As you will recall, after receiving \n     Greenpeace's report. ``The Unlawful Plutonium Alliance,'' the \n     Department agreed to review the guidelines it has used since \n     1986 in determining whether particular proposed exports \n     involve ``sensitive nuclear technology,'' as that term is \n     used in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act. In particular, the \n     Department directed its critical scrutiny to the question \n     whether it is legally permissible for the Department to \n     consider the quality of technology already indigenous to the \n     country that would receive the export in making the \n     determination that sensitive nuclear technology was in fact \n     proposed to be exported in a given transaction.\n       The Department's Office of General Counsel has concluded \n     that consideration of the quality of indigenous technology is \n     permissible in identifying whether sensitive nuclear \n     technology is proposed to be exported in a particular \n     transaction. As a result, the Department has concluded that \n     its determinations with respect to technology exports to \n     Japan were permissible exercises of its statutory \n     authorities.\n       The Department will codify the overall guidelines it uses \n     to determine which exports should be considered sensitive \n     nuclear technology by December 1995. This decision is \n     consistent with our current practice of codifying statements \n     of general applicability and future effect that implement, \n     interpret, or prescribe law or policy. To begin this process \n     the Department will publish an Advanced Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking in the Federal Register by February 1995. The \n     Department will actively seek the public's views about \n     sensitive nuclear technology during the rulemaking process. \n     We encourage your participation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Terry R. Lash,\n                               Director, Office of Nuclear Energy.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. In short, because Japan already had demonstrated a \ncapability to separate plutonium, DOE is arguing that our reprocessing \ntechnology did not qualify as SNT--even though the technology was not \nin the public domain, even though the technology was important to a \nJapanese facility engaged in reprocessing activities, and even though \nthe technology was not classified Restricted Data. In short, the \nDepartment is asserting that even though the technology satisfied each \nand every one of the requisite components of the definition of SNT, the \ntechnology transferred to Japan was not SNT.\n  The Department did, however, indicate that it will soon invite the \npublic's views on this interpretation in a rule making process. By all \nindications, that should be a lively process indeed.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record: \nFirst, three articles from the trade newsletter, Nuclear Fuel: ``Four-\nMonth Look at SNT Guidelines Yields Three-Paragraph Response,'' January \n2, 1995; ``DOE Pressured to Explain Position on Secret SNT Export \nGuidelines'', October 24, 1994; and ``PNC Argues Against Public Release \nof RETF-Related Design Information'', October 24, 1994; and second, a \nJanuary 6, 1995, letter from the three environmental organizations--\nGreenpeace, NRDC, and NCI--to the Secretaries of Energy and State \nurging the exclusion of reprocessing technology transfers from any new \nagreement for cooperation with the European Atomic Community.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n     [[Page S5195]] Four-Month Look at SNT Guidelines Yields Three-\n                           Paragraph Response\n\n       In a pithy three-paragraph letter, a senior DOE official \n     said December 28 that the department is within its legal \n     authority to transfer so-called sensitive nuclear technology \n     (SNT) to other countries if those countries have advanced \n     nuclear programs.\n       Questions about DOE's export of SNT arose in September when \n     Greenpeace International released a report charging that DOE \n     has for years illegally provided Japan's Power Reactor & Fuel \n     Development Corp. (PNC) with SNT, which PNC has used to \n     research and develop a\n      planned breeder reactor spent fuel reprocessing plant. \n     Greenpeace said such exports violate the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Act, which limits such transfers, and the \n     1987 U.S.-Japan Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, \n     which specifically bars them (NF, 12 Sept '94, 12).\n       DOE promised to review the Greenpeace report, ``prepare a \n     comprehensive response'' and ``analyze the guidelines used in \n     determining whether nuclear technology transferred to other \n     countries is (SNT) which would be subject to export controls \n     under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act.''\n       DOE said it would ``make public the results of the \n     comprehensive review within 60 days'' (by November 7), but a \n     lengthy legal analysis added 51 days to the review, \n     culminating in the one-page, three paragraph response faxed \n     to Tom Clements, U.S. coordinator of Greenpeace's plutonium \n     campaign, at 5:30 p.m., December 28.\n       The letter from Terry Lash, director of DOE's Office of \n     Nuclear Energy, provides no details on how DOE concluded that \n     the exports to Japan are permissible, but rather merely \n     restates DOE's position that SNT export guidelines, prepared \n     by DOE in 1986, permit such exports if a country has an \n     advanced nuclear capability.\n       Greenpeace and other environmental groups have argued that \n     the guidelines themselves are unlawful because SNT is SNT, \n     regardless of the capabilities of the country that receives \n     it.\n       In September, a Greenpeace-sponsored legal analysis of the \n     guidelines concluded that DOE ``is not free to designate the \n     same technology as SNT for some recipients and not for \n     others.''\n       DOE clearly disagrees with that analysis, but has provided \n     nothing to back up its rationale and apparently doesn't \n     intend to. Asked specifically if DOE plans to provide \n     additional information on how it concluded that it had not \n     violated the NNPA or the U.S.-Japan agreement. DOE's Ray \n     Hunter said: ``There is nothing more intended to come out.'' \n     The ``comprehensive review'' DOE promised in early September \n     ``is reflected in that letter'' to Clements, he said.\n       Clements told NuclearFuel December 29 that DOE claims to \n     have no written record of its legal analysis, even though \n     Lash noted in his letter that the department ``directed its \n     critical scrutiny'' to the question of whether ``it is \n     legally permissible'' to consider a recipient country's level \n     of nuclear expertise when determining whether SNT is involved \n     in a proposed transaction.\n       Having concluded--without further explanation--that the SNT \n     guidelines are legal. DOE has further concluded that ``its \n     determinations with respect to technology exports to Japan \n     were permissible exercises of its statutory authorities.'' \n     The letter offers no insight as to which ``statutory \n     authorities'' the department's lawyers considered in their \n     lengthy deliberations over the SNT designation issue.\n       Lash said the department will codify the overall guidelines \n     it uses to determine which exports should be considered SNT \n     by December 1995. He invited Clements\n      to participate in the rulemaking process, which will begin \n     in February when DOE publishes an advanced notice of \n     proposed rulemaking.\n\n\n                           totally inadequate\n\n       ``We obviously view this as totally inadequate,'' Clements \n     told NuclearFuel, ``and we will continue to legally challenge \n     DOE on this.''\n       In a press release, Clements said DOE ``has failed in the \n     extreme to conduct the thorough review promised of its \n     `sensitive nuclear technology' export policy. The DOE \n     determination to leave its SNT export policy in place has no \n     basis in law and stands in contradiction to stated U.S. \n     policies aimed at halting the proliferation of plutonium.''\n       Greenpeace and the Nuclear Control Institute (NCI), which \n     have long fought breeder reactor technologies and the \n     separation and use of plutonium, also maintained that DOE's \n     response was contrary to opinions by the U.S. General \n     Accounting Office, Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Rep. Edward \n     Markey (D-Mass.).\n       ``DOE's conclusion creates a massive loophole in the U.S. \n     nuclear nonproliferation regime, which is particularly \n     disturbing in light of the current renegotiation of the U.S. \n     nuclear agreement with the European Atomic Energy Community \n     (Euratom),'' added NCI Deputy Director Daniel Horner.\n       NCI and Greenpeace are concerned that DOE may be laying the \n     foundation for a new deal with Euratom which would allow \n     virtually unfettered cooperation in plutonium reprocessing \n     technology.\n       Clements was also disturbed by the way DOE released the \n     letter to him. According to Clements, DOE provided PNC and at \n     least one nuclear industry official with a copy of the \n     December 28 letter before sending it to him.\n       ``The timing of the release of the letter was contrary to \n     openness policies of DOE and we are perturbed that DOE \n     continues to conduct the public's business in this slipshod \n     way,'' he said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n   DOE Pressured to Explain Position on Secret SNT Export Guidelines\n\n       DOE critics are pressing the department to explain how and \n     why it adopted export guidelines that allowed the transfer of \n     nuclear technology that would otherwise be barred under U.S. \n     law.\n       The export guidelines adopted by DOE in July 1986 without \n     any public notice, allow the transfer of so-called Sensitive \n     Nuclear Technology (SNT) if a recipient country has an \n     advanced nuclear program.\n       The guidelines became an issue last month after Greenpeace \n     International released a report charging that DOE--relying on \n     the guidelines--has for years provided Japan with SNT, in \n     violation of the 1978 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act and the \n     1987 U.S.-Japan Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation Agreement (NF, \n     12 Sept., 12).\n       Critics charge that the guidelines, and the exports made \n     under them, violate the nonproliferation law and the U.S.-\n     Japan agreement because the law and the pact define SNT \n     strictly by the information and technology involved, making \n     no distinction on the recipient.\n       The day Greenpeace issued its report, DOE conceded that \n     information and technology provided to Japan under a 1987 \n     collaborative arrangement with Japan's Power Reactor & Fuel \n     Development Corp. (PNC) ``may be considered'' SNT if provided \n     to a country with a less-developed nuclear program than \n     Japan's.\n       The department is analyzing the 1986 guidelines and is \n     supposed to make public the results of its review around \n     November 8. However, sources say that date may slip because \n     the DOE review is disorganized and might be folded in broader \n     review of how the department handles surplus material.\n       Late last month, Greenpeace, the Nuclear Control Institute \n     and the Natural Resources Defense Council jointly urged \n     suspension of the 1986 guidelines and of ``all cooperation in \n     reprocessing, uranium enrichment, and heavy water technology \n     pursuant to the guidelines,'' pending the outcome of the \n     review.\n       In a separate six-page letter, dated October 11, Rep. \n     Edward Markey (D-Mass.) urged a similar suspension of the \n     guidelines and ongoing cooperative agreements. He also asked \n     detailed questions about who devised the 1986 guidelines and \n     whether agencies other than DOE signed off on them.\n       Markey wants to know who were the principal authors of the \n     SNT guidelines and why they were not promulgated in a formal, \n     open process as agency rulemaking. He also wants to know who \n     was the highest ranking DOE official to approve the \n     guidelines and whether DOE did a legal analysis to determine \n     whether the guidelines were consistent with the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Act and other applicable law. As of October \n     20, DOE had not responded to the queries and had not \n     suspended the guidelines.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  PNC Argues Against Public Release of RETF-Related Design Information\n\n       DOE's use of controversial, secret guidelines to sanction \n     export to Japan of information and hardware that would \n     otherwise be considered sensitive nuclear technology (SNT) \n     has put the department in a bind over how to respond to a \n     year-old Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.\n       The FOIA, filed in October 1993 by Greenpeace's Tom \n     Clements, requests information concerning technology and \n     information transferred to the Japanese Power Reactor & \n     Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (PNC) from DOE's Oak Ridge \n     National Laboratory under contract with PNC.\n       Specifically, Clements has asked for copies of the design \n     of a fuel disassembly system which Oak Ridge delivered to PNC \n     for use at its Recycle Equipment Test Facility Fuel (RETF), a \n     breeder reactor spent fuel reprocessing plant.\n       For more than a year, DOE has balked at releasing the \n     design information and, for at least six months, the \n     department has been consulting with PNC on the issue.\n       Clements has argued that if the information provided to PNC \n     was not SNT--and DOE insists it wasn't--then it should be \n     publicly available.\n       The 1987 U.S.-Japan Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, which \n     bars the transfer of SNT, defines SNT as ``data which are not \n     available to the public and which are important to the \n     design, construction, fabrication, operation or maintenance \n     of enrichment, reprocessing or heavy water facilities. . . \n     .''\n       DOE determined that this and other information and \n     equipment transferred to PNC for use in its breeder reactor\n      program is not SNT because export guidelines, adopted by the \n     department in July 1986 without any public exposure, allow \n     the transfer of what would otherwise be deemed SNT if a \n     recipient country has an advanced nuclear program.\n       The guidelines became an issue last month after Greenpeace \n     International released a report charging that DOE has for \n     years provided Japan with SNT, in violation of the 1978 \n     Nuclear Nonproliferation Act and the 1987 U.S.-Japan \n     agreement (NF, 12 Sept., 12).\n       In April and again July, DOE told Clements that the \n     department had asked the Japanese for comments on the FOIA \n     request. \n     [[Page S5196]] A July 25 letter from Terry Lash, director of \n     DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy, informed Clements that PNC \n     had ``recently'' assured DOE that the Japanese company's \n     comments would be sent ``in the near future.''\n       On September 20, following another Clements' inquiry on the \n     status of his FOIA request, Lash advised that the Washington, \n     D.C. law firm of Lepon, McCarthy, White & Holzworth, ``acting \n     for PNC, has provided DOE with a lengthy, detailed legal \n     argument opposing the release of this information to \n     Greenpeace.''\n       DOE's Office of General Counsel is reviewing the letter, \n     Lash said. Contacted by NuclearFuel, neither the law firm nor \n     PNC would provide a copy of the legal argument or discuss the \n     arguments made.\n       Clements has argued that, while he is interested in \n     whatever the Japanese might have to say about his request \n     ``their opinion should be of no concern regarding the release \n     of the information to me.'' DOE has taken the position that \n     no SNT was transferred, Clements has noted. Any other \n     information transferred ``should be publicly available.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Nuclear Control Institute; Greenpeace International; \n           Natural Resources Defense Council,\n                                                  January 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Hazel R. O'Leary,\n     Secretary of Energy, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, \n         DC.\n\n     Hon. Warren Christopher,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretaries O'Leary and Christopher: In view of \n     certain recent determinations by the Department of Energy \n     with respect to the identification of ``sensitive nuclear \n     technology'' (``SNT'') in export transactions, we are writing \n     to urge that it be made crystal clear in any new agreement \n     for cooperation with the European Atomic Energy Community \n     (``EURATOM'') that transactions involving reprocessing \n     technology are prohibited. As explained below, failure \n     plainly to bar such transactions would run directly counter \n     to the Administration's expressed non-proliferation policy.\n       As you know, Section 123a.(9) of the Atomic Energy Act, 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2153(a)(9) (the ``Act''), requires that, as a \n     precondition to SNT transfers, agreements for cooperation \n     contain ``a guaranty by the cooperating party that any \n     special nuclear material, production facility, or utilization \n     facility produced or constructed under the jurisdiction of \n     the cooperating party by or through the use of any sensitive \n     nuclear technology transferred pursuant to such agreement for \n     cooperation will be subject to all the requirements specified \n     in this subsection. . .'' including, among other things, \n     full-scope safeguards, adequate physical security and U.S. \n     approval of retransfers. Absent such a guaranty, under the \n     terms of Sections 127 and 128 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2156, 2157, no SNT may be exported from the United \n     States to the nation or group of nations in question. \n     Further, under the Department of Energy's regulations, 10 CFR \n     Part 810, technology transfers involving SNT are prohibited \n     unless the Section 127 and 128 requirements are met.\n       In 1987, the United States determined that no SNT transfers \n     would be permitted under the U.S.-Japan agreement for nuclear \n     cooperation. The U.S.-Japan agreement therefore does not \n     contain the provision required by Section 123a.(9) of the \n     Act. Instead,\n      Article 2(1)(b) provides, ``[S]ensitive nuclear technology \n     shall not be transferred under this Agreement.'' Because \n     SNT is defined in Section 4(a)(6) of the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Act of 1978 (Pub. L. No. 95-242) generally \n     to cover non-public information ``important to the design, \n     construction, fabrication, operation or maintenance of a \n     uranium enrichment or nuclear fuel reprocessing facility \n     or a facility for the production of heavy water,'' it was \n     understood at the time by observers outside the Executive \n     Branch, including ourselves and, to our knowledge, the \n     responsible Congressional oversight committees, that \n     reprocessing technology transfers to Japan would be \n     prohibited.\n       As it has turned out, this understanding was not shared by \n     the Executive Branch. Under an internal Department of Energy \n     guideline, adopted in 1986, the Department permitted itself \n     to determine whether certain information constituted SNT in \n     part based upon the ``level of expertise of the information \n     recipient.'' In fact, at the time the U.S.-Japan agreement \n     was under consideration in Congress, Oak Ridge National \n     Laboratory (``ORNL'') was transferring reprocessing \n     technology to Japan, based upon a determination that it was \n     not ``SNT' when delivered to a such a sophisticated nuclear \n     nation.\n       In our view, the Executive Branch misled Congress in 1987 \n     and 1988 into believing that reprocessing transfers were not \n     possible under the ``no-SNT'' provision of the U.S.-Japan \n     agreement at the very time such transfers were already \n     underway. We have since established by means of a Freedom of \n     Information Act request that the Department of State has been \n     briefed by the Department of Energy on the ORNL transaction \n     well in advance of the State Department's testimony in \n     Congressional hearings that no SNT could be transferred to \n     Japan under the terms of the new agreement.\n       Given the high level of expertise in Japan with respect to \n     reprocessing technology, the Department has proceeded over \n     the past half-dozen years to authorize numerous transfers of \n     such technology to Japan. These transfers have been carried \n     out pursuant to a Department of energy guideline which was, \n     in our view, improperly adopted in secret in the first \n     instance, without public notice or opportunity for comment. \n     The SNT prohibition in the U.S.-Japan agreement has thus \n     effectively been rendered a nullity.\n       The DOE guideline clearly violated the expressed language \n     of the statute and led to absurd results. Moreover, DOE's \n     interpretation has been rejected as having no basis in law by \n     the chairmen of two Congressional oversight committees with \n     jurisdiction over nuclear exports and by the General \n     Accounting Office, which reviewed DOE's nuclear-export \n     performance and concluded that ``DOE made [SNT] \n     determinations . . . on the basis of factors that are not \n     included in the 1978 act,'' and that ``DOE needs standards \n     for identifying sensitive nuclear technology that are \n     consistent with the 1978 act.''\n       This fall we raised what we believe are serious concerns \n     about the legality of the Department of Energy's \n     interpretation. In response, the Department promised a\n      ``comprehensive review'' of the entire issue of the \n     lawfulness of its guidelines. However, in a three \n     paragraph letter dated December 28, 1994, not supported by \n     any public, background analysis, the Department rejected \n     our contentions. Instead, it concluded that \n     ``consideration of indigenous technology is permissible in \n     identifying whether sensitive nuclear technology is \n     proposed to be exported in a particular transaction.'' On \n     that basis, the Department then further concluded that its \n     ``determinations with respect to technology exports to \n     Japan were permissible exercises of its statutory \n     authorities.''\n       We continue to believe that the Department of Energy's \n     conduct was wrong as a matter of law. However, without \n     awaiting resolution of the legal issue, we believe that the \n     policy issues presented by the Department of Energy's \n     conclusions need to be addressed immediately and \n     unequivocally in the context of the U.S.-EURATOM \n     negotiations. Indeed, it is essential that the \n     misapprehensions which attended the U.S.-Japan agreement be \n     avoided in the case of EURATOM.\n       In his September 27, 1993 Policy Statement on \n     Nonproliferation and Export Control Policy, President Clinton \n     categorically states that the United States ``does not \n     encourage the civil use of plutonium. * * *'' While he also \n     referred to his decision to ``maintain its existing \n     commitments regarding the use of plutonium in civil nuclear \n     programs in Western Europe * * *,'' whatever those \n     commitments are they cannot survive the term of our existing \n     agreement with EURATOM, which expires at the end of December, \n     1995.\n       In our judgment, any transfer of reprocessing technology, \n     whether determined to be SNT or not, would involve the \n     encouragement of civil use of plutonium, contrary to the \n     Administration's policy. It is in fact presumably for such \n     reasons that the Department of Energy stated in September, \n     1994, that it was ``phasing out collaborative research \n     efforts with Japan on plutonium reprocessing. * * *''\n       The need to curtail any future reprocessing transfers to \n     EURATOM is of particular importance. EURATOM is a \n     conglomerate consisting of numerous countries which have \n     quite different degrees of nuclear sophistication. Twenty \n     years hence it could be even more variegated, perhaps \n     stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals, presenting \n     proliferation and terrorism risks that may vary dramatically \n     from member state to member state. Yet, because the United \n     States treats EURATOM as a single entity under the Act, U.S. \n     nuclear materials, technology and facilities will be able to \n     move freely from state to state within the Community. We \n     think it critical in such circumstances that any \n     new nuclear cooperation agreement with EURATOM \n     leave no doubt that cooperation on the civil use of plutonium \n     will not be permitted.\n       The United States must act consistently with the \n     President's non-proliferation policy in the context of any \n     new EURATOM agreement. This consistency of action means that \n     whatever approach the Department of Energy may ultimately \n     take in its promised\n      rulemaking on SNT transfers, there should be an explicit \n     prohibition on the transfer of any non-public and/or \n     proprietary technology, whether or not designated as SNT, \n     relating in any way to reprocessing. In this way, the type \n     of controversy which has attached to reprocessing \n     technology transfers to Japan would not arise, \n     administrative interpretation would not be allowed to \n     undercut non-proliferation law and policy, and the \n     Congress and the public would have full and complete \n     assurance that the policy of not encouraging plutonium use \n     would be implemented in a consistent and comprehensive \n     manner.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul Leventhal,\n       Nuclear Control Institute.\n     Tom Clements,\n       Greenpeace International.\n     Christopher Paine\n       Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, my own views on this whole issue are well \nknown. On May 15, 1986, Congressman \n[[Page S5197]] Markey chaired a hearing of the House Subcommittee on \nEnergy Conservation and Power to assess the effectiveness of DOE \ncontrols over nuclear technology exports. The hearing focused in \nparticular on findings of a report by the General Accounting Office \ndocumenting several problems in DOE's controls. I testified that \n``GAO's documentation of examples where obvious exports of sensitive \nnuclear technology were covered up by DOE through twisted reasoning \nallowing determinations that no sensitive nuclear technology was \ninvolved, suggests a dangerous attitude of contempt for law on the part \nof some DOE officials.'' That was clear back in 1986.\n  The GAO report that was the focus of that hearing was entitled, ``DOE \nHas Insufficient Control over Nuclear Technology Exports'' (RCED-86-\n144) and was dated May 1, 1986--about 9 years ago. That same report \nreached the following specific conclusions--\n\n       DoE has not established objective standards for \n     specifically authorizing exports [of nuclear technology] \n     (page 2).\n       The 1978 act [the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act (NNPA)] . . \n     . limits the determination of sensitive nuclear technology to \n     its importance to sensitive facilities, not to recipient \n     countries. (page 4)\n       In defining SNT, neither the act nor its legislative \n     history distinguished among countries, their nuclear weapons \n     capabilities, or their nonproliferation credentials. The act \n     requires DoE to determine if information to be provided to a \n     foreign country is important to the design, construction, \n     fabrication, operation, or maintenance of an enrichment, \n     reprocessing, or heavy water production facility. (page 57)\n       In our opinion, therefore, the better view is that the NNPA \n     requires DoE to make SNT determinations strictly on the basis \n     of the technical importance of proposed assistance to \n     sensitive nuclear facilities. (page 58)\n\n  On August 17, 1987, GAO issued another report, entitled, ``Department \nof Energy Needs Tighter Controls Over Reprocessing Information' (RCED-\n87-150). This report found that ``DOE has little control over the \ndissemination of information related to the design, operation, and \nmaintenance of commercial or defense reprocessing technology that it \nproduces * * * [adding that] most of DOE's reprocessing-related \ninformation is readily available to anyone who wants it.'' That was on \npage 17. Here are some additional findings from that report--\n\n       DoE has not enforced the SNT export conditions on \n     activities in conducts with foreign countries under technical \n     exchange agreements. (page 33)\n       DoE's interpretation [of SNT] * * * does not appear \n     consistent with the NNPA definition of SNT. (page 33)\n       DoE has not fully met NNPA conditions for transferring SNT \n     on any of the cooperative reprocessing activities with other \n     countries. (page 39)\n       * * * prior approval rights required by the act were not \n     obtained on any of the cooperative reprocessing activities \n     [specifically the UK and Japan].'' (page 39)\n       [DoE officials] believe that although the information \n     [transferred to the UK and Japan] is `valuable,' it is not \n     `important' in the sense intended by the NNPA and is, \n     therefore, not SNT. (page 40)\n       Neither the definition [of SNT in the NNPA] nor the export \n     requirements [under existing regulations] indicate that SNT \n     decisions were to be based on the nuclear proficiency of the \n     recipient country. (page 41)\n       Neither the act [NNPA] nor its legislative history \n     distinguishes among countries, their nuclear capabilities, or \n     their nonproliferation status to determine what information \n     constitutes SNT * * * this definition should be consistently \n     applied to all countries on the basis of objective criteria. \n     (page 42)\n       The assistance DoE provides directly to the reprocessing \n     programs of other countries * * * qualifies in our opinion as \n     SNT as defined in the NNPA. (page 43)\n\n  In March 1988, DOE's own Office of International Security Affairs \nissued a lengthy report on Technology Security (DOE/DP-8008612) which \nfound that ``Success in acquiring unclassified sensitive technology, as \nidentified in the Militarily Critical Technologies List, has enabled \npotential proliferant countries to construct, outside of the \ninternational safeguards regime, sensitive fuel cycle facilities at \nlower costs and in shorter period of time'' (page 9-2).\n  Then on September 19, 1989, the GAO issued another report entitled \n``Better Controls Needed Over Weapons-Related Information and \nTechnology'' (RCED-89-116), which found that ``DOE makes readily \navailable a great deal of unclassified information and computer codes \nthat could assist sensitive countries in developing or advancing their \nnuclear weapons programs'' (page 16). GAO also found that ``In addition \nto obtaining DOE information, sensitive countries routinely obtain \nhardware\n from the United States that has both nuclear weapons and commercial \napplications * * * about 290 of the approved requests [for export \nlicenses in 1987] were destined for facilities suspected of conducting \nnuclear weapons development activities'' (page 5).\n\n  With respect to exports of these so-called dual-use goods, GAO's 1987 \ndata amount to peanuts compared with what GAO found in 1994. In a \nreport bearing a now-familiar title, ``Export Licensing Procedures for \nDual-Use Items Need to be Strengthened,'' (NSIAD-94-119), GAO found \nthat the United States approved over 330,000 licenses for exports of \nnuclear dual-use goods worldwide between fiscal years 1985 and 1992. \nEven more alarming, some $350 million of such goods went specifically \nto facilities believed to be involved in nuclear weapons-related \nactivities in eight controlled countries. For further discussion of \nthis GAO report, readers should consult my floor statement on January \n4, 1995, where I inserted into the Record detailed summaries of this \nreport and another report prepared by four inspectors general \ndescribing serious problems in the implementation of U.S. export \ncontrols relating both to munitions and to goods relating to weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Fortunatly, DOE is now under new leadership and appears to be trying \nto grapple with bringing DOE practices back into line with the spirit \nand letter of our fundamental nonproliferation legislation.\n  I compliment Hazel O'Leary for the job she is doing there as the \nSecretary of Energy.\n  In light of President Clinton's September 27, 1993, policy statement \nthat the United States ``does not encourage the civil use of \nplutonium,'' I hope that the Department's three-paragraph letter does \nnot represent the administration's final position on this matter. I \nwould urge DOE in the strongest of terms to undertake a truly \ncomprehensive reexamination of its policies and practices for handling \nsuch data and to bring these policies and practices back into line with \nU.S. law.\n  The United States is not in the business of promoting commercial uses \nof plutonium or highly enriched uranium around the world, either as a \nmatter of policy or of law. The bizarre notion that just because a \ncountry has demonstrated a national capability to separate plutonium or \nperform some other sensitive nuclear activity does not, should not, and \nmust not exempt it from provisions of our law addressing sensitive \nnuclear technology. Indeed, if this notion continues to poison our \nnonproliferation laws, what would keep our weapons labs or their \nsubcontractors from transferring SNT to virtually any proliferant \nnation, given the capabilities that many of them have already \ndemonstrated in the fields of reprocessing, enrichment, and heavy water \nproduction? If today such technology can go to Japan in direct \nviolation of a bilateral agreement, where will such technology go \ntomorrow?\n  I will closely monitor developments in this area in the months ahead \nand am optimistic that the Department will eventually bring its \npractices into line with statutory controls over SNT. This will be a \nsplendid opportunity for the Department to distance itself from the \ntime-dishonored practice of previous administrations of redefining key \nnonproliferation terms to pursue short-term political or diplomatic \ngoals.\n  I will close this statement by attaching a chronology of some \nrelevant documents pertaining to this whole SNT controversy,\n and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record, and I \nurge all my colleagues to look into this matter and to support \nretaining some consistency, predictability, and clarity in the \nimplementation of one of our most important nonproliferation controls.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Chronology of Relevant Documents\n\n       1/6/95: Letter from Greenpeace/National Resource Defense \n     Council/Nuclear Control Institute to the secretaries of \n     Energy and State.\n       12/28/94: Letter from Terry Lash (DoE/Nuclear Energy) to \n     Greenpeace.\n       11/9/94: Letter from Sec.

Approval of the shipment had been given by \n     the Secretary of Energy, with the concurrence of the \n     Secretary of State, who was required by the NNPA to determine \n     whether the retransfer of this plutonium from France (where \n     the reprocessing of spent fuel took place) to Japan would \n     result in a ``significant increase of the risk of \n     proliferation . . .'' in which the ``foremost'' factor was \n     whether the United States would receive ``timely warning'' of \n     a diversion of the material.\n     Footnotes at end.\n       In accordance with procedures adopted pursuant to the NNPA, \n     the interagency discussions of the Japanese request for \n     approval of the shipment involved the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission (NRC). Although the NRC concurred with the finding \n     that the shipment would not result in a ``significant \n     increase of the risk of proliferation,'' the Commission \n     questioned whether the Departments of Energy (DOE) and State \n     had followed Congressional intent in arriving at their \n     conclusion that the ``timely warning'' test had been met. The \n     NRC's position was summarized by NRC Chairman Nunzio J. \n     Palladino as follows: (2)\n       ``(T)he Commission's disagreement with DOE's position is \n     focused on whether or not non-technical factors are permitted \n     to be considered in connection with reaching any conclusions \n     on the existence of timely warning. In the Commission's view, \n     the legislative history of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Act \n     of 1978 (NNPA) indicates that Congress intended timely \n     warning to be essentially a technical matter involving such \n     factors as safeguards measures applied to the material and \n     the technical ease of incorporating the material into a \n     nuclear explosive device. Other, non-technical factors were \n     to be considered relevant only in connection with making the \n     overall statutory finding of no significant increase in the \n     risk of proliferation. A close reading of the statutory \n     language in Section 131 b. of the Atomic Energy Act would \n     seem to support the Commission's interpretation regarding \n     timely warning, particularly since otherwise it would be \n     necessary to consider the same non-technical factors both in \n     connection with the timely warning analysis and in connection \n     with the overall ``increase in the risk of proliferation'' \n     finding. The attachment to this letter lists the more \n     significant technical factors that the Commission believes \n     affect timely warning, and that should be addressed in a \n     classified supplement to future DOE analyses of subsequent \n     arrangements.''\n       The resolution of this issue will set a precedent with \n     possibly profound future implications for U.S. national \n     security and foreign relations.\n       The DOE/State conclusion on ``timely warning'' was not \n     accompanied by a detailed supporting analysis. Rather, as \n     indicated in the NRC letter, the conclusion was claimed to \n     result from the presence of certain favorable political \n     factors surrounding the U.S./Japan relationship. Subsequent \n     inquiry (3) has revealed that DOE and State interpret the \n     NNPA as saying that political factors, such as the nature and \n     condition of the governmental system and nonproliferation \n     policies in a recipient country, independently of the \n     technical capabilities of that country, could be determining \n     factors in judging whether the U.S. would receive ``timely \n     warning'' of a diversion. Therefore, according to this view, \n     some political factors, which determine the ``inherent risk \n     of proliferation'' (4) in a country, could determine that \n     ``timely warning'' was available, and these and other \n     political factors could be used to determine that there was \n     ``no significant increase in the risk of proliferation'' \n     stemming from a proposed retransfer for reprocessing or \n     return of plutonium. Further, it is claimed that there was no \n     stated or implied legislative requirement for a supporting \n     analysis of the DOE/State ``timely warning'' conclusion or \n     the weight given to the latter in relation to other factors \n     in determining proliferation risk.\n       It is the purpose of this paper to show that the DOE/State \n     position is not in keeping with the legislative history of \n     the NNPA or any other indication of Congressional intent. \n     Rather, we shall show that; (a) the Congressional intent was \n     to separate and independently weigh the ``timely warning'' \n     test from the set of possibly counterbalancing political \n     factors listed in the NNPA as being pertinent to an overall \n     judgment as to whether a proposed retransfer would result in \n     a significant increase of the risk of proliferation; and, (b) \n     that Congress meant the ``timely warning'' test to compare \n     the time needed by the U.S. to effectively react to a \n     diversion of nuclear material to the time needed by the \n     diverting country to produce an explosive device, the latter \n     time being estimated by technical assessments only. By this \n     view, a political assessment based on specific political \n     factors could result in approval of a retransfer request even \n     if the ``timely warning'' test fails, but then the burden is \n     on the political assessment to show that such political \n     factors override ``foremost'' consideration of the technical \n     capabilities of the recipient country to make a nuclear \n     explosive device quickly from diverted materials.\n                       I. The Language of the Act\n\n       The key paragraph, Section 131b (2) of the Atomic Energy \n     Act of 1954 (Section 303a of the NNPA of 1978) states that,\n       ``. . . the Secretary of Energy may not enter into any \n     subsequent arrangement for the reprocessing of any such \n     material in a facility which has not processed power reactor \n     fuel assemblies or been the subject of a subsequent \n     arrangement therefor prior to the date of enactment of the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 or for subsequent \n     retransfer to a non-nuclear-weapon state of any plutonium in \n     quantities greater than 500 grams resulting from such \n     reprocessing, unless in his judgment, and that of the \n     Secretary of State, such reprocessing or retransfer will not \n     result in a significant increase of the risk of proliferation \n     beyond that which exists at the time that approval is \n     requested. Among all the factors in making this judgment, \n     foremost consideration will be given to whether or not the \n     reprocessing or retransfer will take place under conditions \n     that will ensure retransfer will take place under conditions \n     that will ensure timely warning to the United States of any \n     diversion well in advance of the time at which the non-\n     nuclear-weapon state could transform the diverted material \n     into a nuclear explosive device. . . .''\n       This language was originally offered by Senator Glenn to \n     the Administration during negotiations prior to the beginning \n     of markup of the NNPA by the Subcommittee on Arms Control, \n     Oceans, and International Environment of the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee on September 14, 1977. It was a \n     substitute for proposed language by the Administration that \n     would have replaced the ``timely warning'' criterion with \n     consideration of ``the probability of timely warning'' as one \n     (not ``foremost'') factor among many in determining whether \n     to approve a retransfer request. We shall examine this markup \n     in more detail later on. For now it suffices to note that the \n     Subcommittee approved the Glenn language and ignored the \n     Administration's proposal.\n       Following the markup by the full Committee (there were two \n     earlier markups by the Committees on Governmental Affairs and \n     Energy and Natural Resources), the legislation was reported \n     out and a report filed which contained the following \n     statement on the meaning of ``timely warning'' (5):\n       ``* * * the standard of `timely warning' * * * is strictly \n     a measure of whether warning of a diversion (emphasis added) \n     will be received far enough in advance of the time when the \n     recipient could transform the diverted material into an \n     explosive device to permit an adequate diplomatic response.''\n       The Senate bill language was accepted by the House on the \n     grounds that there were no substantive differences between \n     the Senate bill and one passed by the House some months \n     earlier. Representative Zablocki (D-Wisconsin), the floor \n     manager for the House bill, while offering a resolution on \n     February 23, 1978, directing the Clerk of the House to make \n     certain technical corrections in the NNPA, made the following \n     observation about \n     [[Page S5199]] the Senate amendments (6): ``The House \n     reviewed these and found the amended Senate version to be, in \n     all essential respects, consistent with (the House Bill). \n     Upon reaching this judgment, the House, by unanimous consent \n     then moved to recede and accept (the House Bill) as \n     amended.'' Indeed, on February 9, 1978, when Representative \n     Zablocki received unanimous consent to bring up the Senate \n     bill and successfully proposed its passage by voice vote, he \n     stated (7):\n       ``All of the central elements of the House bill--including \n     the important ``timely warning'' criterion--were faithfully \n     preserved. * * * On the critical issue of timely warning, I \n     am pleased to say that the Senate's legislative history was \n     indeed consistent with our own.''\n       The concept of ``timely warning'' was explained in the \n     House report as follows (8):\n       ```Timely warning' has to do with that interval of time \n     that exists between the detection of a diversion and the \n     subsequent transformation of diverted material into an \n     explosive device.''\n       Despite Representative Zablocki's clear statement, the \n     Senate Report's phrase ``warning of a diversion'' as opposed \n     to the House Report's ``detection of a diversion'', along \n     with some additional Senate report language has been used by \n     some in State/DOE to bolster a claim that the intent of the \n     Senate on the meaning of ``timely warning'' was substantially \n     different from that of the House.\n       We shall show that such a claim is logically unsupportable.\n\n        II. A Precise Reformulation of the Timely Warning Issue\n\n       Thee are four time intervals associated with the notion of \n     ``timely warning'' to the U.S. of a diversion by country \n     ``X''. For purposes of explanation, we define them as \n     follows.\n       Reaction Time: The amount of time needed to fashion an \n     appropriate and effective diplomatic response to prevent \n     diverted material from being converted by country ``X'' into \n     an explosive device. Reaction time is a function of bilateral \n     and multilateral relationships and, therefore, involves a \n     political assessment.\n       Conversion Time: The time needed by country ``X'' to \n     convert diverted material into an explosive device. (Note: \n     Conversion time is a function of the industrial and bomb-\n     making infrastructure in country ``X'', the nature of the \n     diverted material, and the availability of any technology \n     needed to process the diverted material into weapons-usable \n     form. A technical assessment of country ``X'''s capabilities \n     would yield an estimate of conversion time, and no political \n     factors are involved.)\n       Detection Time: The time between diversion of material and \n     either the last detection of the diversion by the safeguards \n     system or the earlier prediction of diversion through \n     intelligence information. (In the latter case, detection time \n     is a negative quantity, and may depend upon observations of \n     political changes in country ``X''. Note that if we tacitly \n     assume that the safeguards system works as designed, no \n     political factors enter into an estimate of positive \n     detection time. Quality of safeguards is then measured by the \n     value of positive detection time, with smaller values \n     indicating better safeguards.)\n       Warning Time: The interval between the time when the U.S. \n     learns a diversion has occurred or may occur and the time at \n     which country ``X'' is capable of producing a nuclear \n     explosive device following the aforementioned diversion of \n     material. (Thus, warning time = conversion time - detection \n     time. It is important to note that warning time involves \n     political as opposed to technical assessments only when \n     detection time is negative.)\n       In terms of the above definitions, the concept of ``timely \n     warning'' in the NNPA becomes as follows:\n       Definition: The U.S. has received ``timely warning'' of a \n     diversion by country ``X'' when warning time is greater than \n     reaction time.\n       The only thing remaining in order to show equivalence with \n     the statutory concept is to make the connection between some \n     auxiliary concepts in the Senate report with the terminology \n     in this paper.\n       The phrase ``warning time required'' in the Senate report \n     as in, ``The amount of warning time required will vary (and \n     cannot be defined in terms of a certain number of weeks or \n     months) . . .'', (9) refers to what is here called ``reaction \n     time''. Thus, if a multinational response is needed for \n     effective diplomacy, a quicker reaction time can be expected \n     in the event that the diverted material was multinationally \n     owned or came from a multinational plant, since all the \n     parties in that venture would have reason to feel aggrieved \n     by the diversion.\n       The phrase ``time . . . available'' as in ``. . . it will \n     be necessary to determine how much time be actually (sic) \n     available under any specific circumstances,'' (10) refers to \n     what we are calling here ``warning time''.\n       The State/DOE position boils down to the claim that \n     Congress did not intend the ``timely warning'' criterion to \n     involve, on either side of the inequality in the above \n     definition, a quantity estimated only on the basis of a \n     technical assessment.\n       Since ``reaction time'' clearly involves political factors, \n     and ``warning time'' can involve political factors, there \n     appears, superficially at least, to be some merit to the \n     State/DOE argument. On closer examination, however, the \n     apparent merit vanishes.\n       We reiterate that ``warning time'' may involve political \n     factors only when ``detection time'' is negative. The key \n     observation to make is to note that detection time can be \n     negative only in two situations: 1) Either the U.S. has \n     learned of plans for (or suspects) diversion at a time prior \n     to the time of actual retransfer (in which case the approval \n     of retransfer is denied or revoked and there is no problem), \n     or 2) There is a significant interval of time after the \n     retransfer occurs before a diversion is achieved. In this \n     case it can be argued that the clock marking off warning time \n     could be triggered by observed changes in the political\n      character of the government of country ``X''. But there is \n     nothing in the Senate or House floor debate or report \n     language or in the statute language that suggests making \n     an assumption of existence of a significant time interval \n     between retransfer and diversion, or equivalently, to \n     assume that a significant change had occurred on the \n     meaning of timely warning by the time the final version of \n     the NNPA was passed by the Senate on February 7, 1978, and \n     by the House two days later without further amendment.\n       To show this, we provide a detailed history of the \n     Congress' consideration of the timely warning issue during \n     its deliberations on the NNPA.\n\n      III. The Senate Legislative Markup Record on Timely Warning\n\n       Committee markup records, which are uncorrected and not \n     publicly filed, and therefore not readily available to the \n     rest of the Congress, are usually given little or no weight \n     in legal determinations of congressional intent on \n     legislation. Nonetheless, they may, in conjunction with the \n     committee report on the legislation and the floor debate, \n     give some clue as to the meaning of certain legislative \n     provisions when such meaning is otherwise obscure.\n       The DOE/State defense of its position on ``timely warning'' \n     in the NNPA apparently includes a claim that the \n     Congressional interpretation of the statutory language at the \n     time of passage reflected the Carter Administration's view as \n     expressed in a formal communication from the State Department \n     to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (see (4)). Since \n     the only place in the legislative history of the NNPA where \n     the Administration's position on ``timely warning'' is \n     substantively discussed by Senators occurs in the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee markups (11), (12), (13) of the \n     legislation, we consider these (uncorrected) markup records \n     in examining the DOE/State claim.\n       On September 14, 1977, at the Foreign Relations \n     Subcommittee markup (see (11)) Senator Glenn introduced the \n     language on approvals of retransfers for reprocessing or \n     return of plutonium, including the ``timely warning'' test, \n     that subsequently was adopted as the statute language. This \n     language was a substitute for a previous formulation \n     identical to that contained in the House bill, H.R. 8638, \n     which passed with a dissenting vote on September 28, 1977,\n      the same day the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported \n     out the NNPA. As indicated earlier, Senator Glenn offered \n     this new language following discussions with and in \n     response to objections by the Executive Branch that the \n     previous formulation on approvals of retransfers was too \n     ``restrictive in scope'' (14).\n       It is important to note the motivation as well as substance \n     of the Administration's position at this point. The \n     Administration was facing a serious problem in that the House \n     and Senate bills had virtually identical provisions that \n     subjected decisions on retransfers for reprocessing or return \n     of plutonium to consideration of a single factor, the timely \n     warning criterion. The Administration was concerned that this \n     single test could be used to block U.S. approvals of any such \n     retransfers and disrupt trade relations with our allies. \n     Accordingly, the Administration had to either try to get the \n     Congress to alter the definition of ``timely warning'' or \n     broaden the test for approvals of retransfers to include \n     other factors besides timely warning. Thus, in its comments \n     on the marked up version of the NNPA reported by the \n     Government Affairs Committee, the Administration said this \n     about the proposed test for retransfer (15):\n       ``First, it would jeopardize negotiation of new, strict \n     nuclear cooperation agreements since an overly strict \n     interpretation of the ``timely warning'' standard could rule \n     out all forms of fuel processing necessary for future fuel \n     cycle activities. Second, timely warning should not be the \n     sole basis for making determinations concerning the \n     acceptability of subsequent arrangements, taking into account \n     the existence of other factors which must be evaluated. \n     Additional factors of importance include the nonproliferation \n     policies of the countries concerned, and the size and scope \n     of the activities involved.''\n       Now, it is interesting that the language actually proposed \n     by the Administration by way of compromise, language that was \n     arrived at following negotiations with Senator Glenn, clearly \n     takes the path of broadening the test for approvals for \n     retransfers, and does not change the definition of ``timely \n     warning'' but merely attempts to make the determination fuzzy \n     by referring only to the probability of timely warning being \n     available. The proposed language was as follows (16).\n       ``The Administrator may not enter into any subsequent \n     arrangement for the reprocessing of any such material in a \n     facility \n     [[Page S5200]] which has not processed power fuel assemblies \n     or been the subject of a subsequent arrangement therefore \n     prior to the date of enactment of the Act or for subsequent \n     retransfer to a non-nuclear-weapon state of any plutonium in \n     quantities greater than 500 grams resulting from such \n     reprocessing unless in his view such reprocessing to \n     retransfer shall take place under conditions that will safely \n     secure the materials and that are designed to ensure reliable \n     and timely detection of diversion. In making his judgment, \n     the Administrator will take into account such factors as the \n     size and scope of the activities involved, the non-\n     proliferation policies of the countries concerned and the \n     probabilities that the arrangements will provide timely \n     warning to the United States of diversions well in advance of \n     the time at which the non-nuclear-weapon state could \n     transform the diverted material into a nuclear explosive \n     device; and''.\n       Senator Glenn's explanation of the amendment he offered at \n     the Foreign Relations Subcommittee markup left no doubt that \n     it was not his intention to change the meaning of timely \n     warning, but rather to broaden the test for approvals of \n     certain retransfers. To see this, we note that in his \n     statement, Senator Glenn referred approvingly to recent \n     congressional testimony by then NRC Commissioner, Victor \n     Gilinsky, defending the timely warning standard against \n     Administration criticism that it was ``unnecessary, \n     unworkable, rigid, and unrealistic'' (17). Senator Glenn went \n     on to say, (18).\n       ``The idea of timely warning is the explicitly stated \n     objective of the so-called blue book safeguards of the IAEA, \n     which polices the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Under this \n     system, as under the U.S. bilateral safeguards which preceded \n     it, records are kept of all nuclear material going into and \n     coming out of civilian power reactors throughout most of the \n     world, and verified by an international inspectorate. The \n     idea is simply that the disappearance of any of this material \n     will be reported to the international community in plenty of \n     time to allow for appropriate counteraction. Thus timely \n     warning is essential to effective safeguards.''\n       Senator Glenn's references to safeguards and timely warning \n     strongly imply that the timely warning criterion in his \n     amendment could be met only if the reaction time afforded by \n     the safeguards system's detection of a diversion was \n     sufficient ``to allow for appropriate counter action'' (19).\n       This thought was echoed in substance by Representative \n     Bingham (D-NY) in introducing this language on the House \n     floor 14 days later. He said (20):\n       ``(W)e consider (timely warning) to be an essential to the \n     safeguarding of nuclear facilities. If there is no timely \n     warning, there are no effective safeguards.''\n       At this point in the Senate markup and without challenging \n     Glenn's view, the Chief Administrative spokesman, Ambassador \n     Gerard C. Smith, expressed two Administration concerns \n     explicitly. First, he said (21):\n       ``May I observe on that Gilinsky quotation that we don't \n     disagree with the concept of timely warning. It is a very \n     appropriate consideration here but we feel it will lead to \n     distortions if it is made the exclusive (emphasis added) \n     consideration.''\n       This statement shows that the Administration understood \n     that ``timely warning'' was a concept that could stand \n     separately and apart from other considerations in determining \n     how to exercise U.S. consent rights for certain retransfers. \n     Indeed, prior to Senator Glenn's statement, Senator Pell had \n     stated that (22):\n       ``The Executive Branch believes that the timely warning \n     standard should not be the sole basis (emphasis added) for \n     measuring an arrangement's acceptability. . . .''\n       There is no hint in this markup record that the Committee \n     viewed the position of the Administration as seeking to alter \n     the meaning of ``timely warning'' or how to determine it. On \n     the contrary, the position statement by Senator Pell \n     indicates that the Committee saw the Administration's goal as \n     replacing the timely warning test with a broader one in which \n     the test of ``timely warning'' was an important factor.\n       The second concern expressed by the Administration at the \n     markup stemmed from its own confusion between ``timely \n     warning'' and ``reaction time''. The House report had stated \n     in essence that the amount of reaction time needed to \n     effectively counter a diversion from a reprocessing plant \n     based on the Purex process was unlikely to be larger than the \n     conversion time to make the bomb (23). The drafters of that \n     report also tried to provide some guidance for a minimum \n     acceptable amount of reaction time, corresponding to a \n     situation where the diverting country only possessed stored \n     spent fuel and had no reprocessing facility. The effect of \n     this would have been to force the denial of nearly all \n     reprocessing requests since ``reaction time'' would have been \n     mandated to a level greater than ``conversion time'' in \n     almost all cases, thereby leading to a failure of the \n     ``timely warning'' test.\n       In sum, the administration's second complaint was directed \n     to the fixing a priori of a high ``reaction time'' guideline \n     that effectively did not allow approval of any reprocessing \n     requests. This lack of flexibility in judging reprocessing \n     requests was viewed by Senator Glenn as having been taken \n     care of in his amendment, which did not mandate a ``reaction \n     time'' beyond that needed for ``effective safeguards'', and \n     which allowed other factors (besides ``timely warning'') to \n     be taken into account in judging whether to approve a \n     request. Indeed, although Ambassador Smith's initial reaction \n     to the Glenn language was that ``. . . it doesn't move enough \n     in the direction of flexibility that I think is necessary . . \n     .'' (24), the Administration's own proposed language at that \n     point, as we have already seen, gave no hint of altering the \n     meaning of ``timely warning'' or the factors that would have \n     involved its determination. Therefore, when the subcommittee \n     adopted Glenn's language, it had no alternative meaning of \n     ``timely warning'' before it.\n       This conclusion was reinforced at the opening of the \n     discussion of the Glenn amendment during the full Committee \n     markup on September 20, 1977. In response to the Chairman's \n     (Senator Frank Church, (D-Idaho)) request for an explanation \n     of the amendment, Senator Glenn replied (25):\n       ``The main issue on the timely warning amendment is this. \n     Timely warning really means technical safeguards and making a \n     judgment as to whether approving reprocessing for some \n     country will result in a significant elevation of risk. The \n     question arises as the weight that should be given to \n     technical safeguards as opposed to, say, political or foreign \n     policy considerations.\n       My position, as relected in the language adopted by the \n     subcommittee was that technical safeguards, that is, timely \n     warning, should be given primary consideration in these \n     cases. We should not be able to override that because it \n     seems to me that the technical methods of giving timely \n     warning are so critical to the system of safeguards and \n     protections that we have in this area that they should not be \n     ignored.''\n       Now this quote is from an uncorrected record. In the first \n     paragraph, when Glenn says, ```Timely warning' really means \n     technical safeguards'', it should be understood (indeed, \n     cannot be understood any other way) from the context of all \n     that has gone before, that the statement implies ```timely \n     warning' really means effective technical safeguards,'' \n     where, in the Subcommittee markup, Glenn made it clear that \n     effective technical safeguards meant detection of a diversion \n     by technical means ``in time for use to do something about \n     it'' (26).\n       The second paragraph, in the absence of further \n     elucidation, could have been interpreted as meaning that the \n     absence of ``timely warning'' can never be overridden by \n     political or foreign policy considerations. A later statement \n     by Glenn (27) indicates that he meant for ``timely warning'' \n     to be the largest single factor (``it would be given the bulk \n     of the consideration'') in judging whether a retransfer would \n     result in a significant increase in the risk of \n     proliferation. This view was not challenged by the Committee \n     during its discussion of ``timely warning''. Rather, the \n     committee concentrated on those other factors which, in \n     strong combination, could produce a decision in favor of a \n     retransfer even if ``timely warning'' is not clearly \n     determinable. Senator Glenn turned the general discussion to \n     specifics by suggesting that (28):\n       ``. . . in the report language we put in that there are \n     situations in which other factors, besides timely warning, \n     may induce the Secretary of State to give his approval. I \n     will give a few examples.''\n       Senator Glenn then listed the factors that ended up being \n     mentioned in the Senate report and in his floor statement \n     during debate on the bill. Senator Church summarized the \n     discussion by saying (29).\n       ``Clearly what is sought is to give timely warning a very \n     high priority; but at the same time to recognize that there \n     may be circumstances . . . that will suffice and lead us to \n     grant such a request even though timely warning is not \n     present.''\n       Note that there is no suggestion of any change in the \n     definition or interpretation of timely warning as given \n     earlier by Senator Glenn.\n       Moreover, Senator Glenn indicated that discussions had been \n     held on his proposed language with members of the House \n     Committee on International Relations (indeed, there was much \n     staff contact on this issue at the time) and that ``they are \n     in agreement with this language (30).'' What is implied here \n     is that the House members agreed not only with Glenn's \n     language, but also with his interpretation of that language.\n       At this point, Senator Richard Stone (D-Florida) asked for \n     the Administration's views on this matter. Mr. Philip Farley, \n     the chief Administration spokesman at the full Committee \n     Markup, stated that the Administration's position was set \n     forth in letters to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \n     dated September 12 and September 19, 1977, and asked that \n     these letters be placed in the record (31). The letter of \n     September 19th, from Assistant Secretary of State Douglas \n     Bennett to Senator John Sparkman (D-Alabama), contained the \n     substantive details of the Administration's position. The \n     most important paragraph is reproduced below (32):\n       ``Agreement has been reached on suitable language relating \n     to the timely warning standard to govern U.S. approval of \n     reprocessing with the leadership of the House Committee on \n     International Relations. This language is acceptable to the \n     Administration. While setting forth strict standards, it \n     recognizes that other foreign policy and non-proliferation \n     factors must be considered. It should also be recognized that \n     warning time associated with alternative reprocessing \n     technology is difficult to quantify but does represent a \n     continuum, progressing from a minimum time associated with \n     processes \n     [[Page S5201]] that involve separated plutonium to longer \n     times for processes that involve uranium and most of the \n     fission products present in irradiated spent fuel. Timely \n     warning is a function of a number of factors, including the \n     inherent risk of proliferation in the country concerned, the \n     amount of warning time provided, and the degree of \n     improvement in warning time that alternative reprocessing \n     technology provides relative to other technologies.''\n       We note that the phrase ``inherent risk of proliferation'', \n     which appears almost gratuitously and with no explanation of \n     its meaning, was never used in any previous Executive Branch \n     communication to the Congress on ``timely warning''. We also \n     reiterate our comment in note (4) that this phrase or concept \n     was given no substantive acknowledgment in the legislative \n     history of the NNPA beyond its appearance in the September \n     19th letter.\n       In discussing the content of this letter, Mr. Farley went \n     into a long and cogent explanation concerning the amount of \n     warning time available to the U.S. under various \n     circumstances involving the retransfer of nuclear materials. \n     But his explanation does not reflect, in words or \n     implication, any notion that timely warning is a function of \n     ``the inherent risk of proliferation'' in a country, whatever \n     the meaning of that phrase. Indeed, Mr. Farley's explanation \n     of warning time conforms with the notion that one must \n     consider the worse case possibility of a completely \n     unexpected diversion in determining whether one's warning \n     time is ``timely'' or not. He said (33):\n       ``For many States, clearly achieving the capability to \n     proceed fairly quickly to a nuclear explosives capability is \n     increasingly going to be something which they have. In that \n     case, there will be very strict limits on the amount of \n     warning we can expect'' (emphasis added).\n       Mr. Farley did not say that the ``strict limits'' he \n     referred to depended on a fuzzy concept like the ``inherent \n     risk of proliferation'' in a country. He tied those limits \n     only to technological capability. There was no further \n     substantive discussion on this point in the markup because \n     the Executive Branch's explanation of the timely warning \n     language was not viewed as differing from the explanation \n     offered earlier by Senator Glenn.\n       Thus, the State Department letter of September 19th played \n     no role in changing the congressional view of ``timely \n     warning'' that had existed from the beginning. The Glenn \n     compromise allowed for ``timely warning'' not to be the \n     controlling factor in every circumstance where one had to \n     judge whether a given subsequent arrangement would result in \n     a significant increase of risk of proliferation, but the \n     meaning of ``timely warning'' was unaffected.\n       The above claim is nailed down for good by considering the \n     House floor statements on timely warning, following the \n     Senate markup.\n\n     IV. The House Discussion of the New Language on Timely Warning\n\n       The House floor debates clearly show that House members \n     viewed the new language as not altering the relationship of \n     timely warning to effective safeguards, i.e., that timely \n     warning was still to be viewed as having to do with ``that \n     interval of time that exists between the detection of a \n     diversion and the subsequent transformation into an explosive \n     device'' (see (8)).\n       In support of this proposition we have already offered a \n     statement by Representative Bingham in introducing the Glenn \n     language on September 28, 1977. Statements by other key \n     participants also are supportive of our claim. For example, \n     Representative Paul Findley (R-Ohio), Ranking Member of the \n     House Committee on International Relations, in two speeches \n     given before and after the final markup of the NNPA in the \n     Senate, showed that his view of the meaning of ``timely \n     warning'' was unaffected by the Senate action. He stated \n     (34):\n       ``Moreover, the definition of an effective safeguard \n     standard--timely warning--will insure that recipient nations \n     cannot manufacture, undetected and overnight, bombs from \n     materials we provide for peaceful purposes.''\n       Representative Findley solidified his view of timely \n     warning in the floor debate on September 28, 1977, with the \n     following discussion of the related concept of ``warning \n     time'' (35) (recall that timely warning is present when \n     warning time exceeds reaction time):\n       ``One needs to have warning times that are ample enough to \n     give supplier states or the international community an \n     opportunity to orchestrate an effective response to an act of \n     diversion and to be able to do this, moreover, before the \n     violator is able to transform his stolen material into \n     bombs.'' (Emphasis added.)\n       Representative Lagomarsino (R-California) in support of the \n     compromise amendment described it as follows (36):\n       ``Specifically, it requires that the reprocessing of U.S.-\n     supplied fuel must occur under conditions that provide timely \n     warning of illicit diversion of bomb-usable material. Without \n     such timely warning, the nuclear safeguards system becomes \n     meaningless. We would discover that the plutonium has been \n     diverted after the bombs have been built. Delayed warning or \n     no warning at all would render deterrence impossible.''\n       Representative Lagomarsino went on to paraphrase the \n     amendment, and describe it further. He said (37):\n       ``. . .  the timely warning amendment . . . will further \n     require the Administrator to give foremost consideration to \n     the question of whether the reprocessing facility and the \n     reprocessed product can be safeguarded so as to provide \n     timely warning (emphasis added) to the United States of any \n     diversion well before the time at which a violating (emphasis \n     added) country could transform weapons-useable material into \n     a nuclear explosive device. Such warning time is essential if \n     the international community or the community of supplier \n     states is to have the opportunity for action. And it is only \n     when such an opportunity for action exists, that safeguards \n     can reliably be considered to deter''.\n       Finally, Representative Legget (D-California), while \n     expressing general support for the House bill on the day it \n     passed (September 28, 1977), expressed a number of \n     reservations about the changes in the measure, including \n     ``timely warning'' (38). His complaints, however, do not \n     address any perceived change in definition, but address the \n     fact that certain facilities were exempted from immediate \n     application of the timely warning standard. The tenor of his \n     remarks suggest that if he had perceived a change in the \n     definition of timely warning to make it ``more flexible'', he \n     would have cited this as a problem.\n       The congressional statements discussed above make clear \n     that the change in wording of the amendment did not alter the \n     intent of Congress to view ``timely warning'' as a measure of \n     whether effective action was possible after discovery of a \n     diversion (i.e., the worst-case scenario) to deter or prevent \n     the diverting country from fashioning a nuclear explosive \n     device. There is no reference in the House debate to any \n     concept such as the ``inherent risk of proliferation'' as \n     being part of the ``timely warning'' test. Indeed, there is \n     no indication that any member of the House saw a copy of the \n     Bennett-to-Sparkman letter that contained this phrase, let \n     alone paid any attention to it. The only Administration \n     communications that appear in the record of the House debate \n     are identical letters (39) dated September 17, 1977 from \n     Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to Representatives Zablocki \n     and Findley approving proposed amendments to be offered by \n     Congressman Bingham and expressing support for the amended \n     bill. There is not only no reference to ``inherent risk of \n     proliferation'' as an ingredient of ``timely warning'' in \n     these letters, but one of the letter's recipients, \n     Congressman Findley, in the statement that preceded his \n     placement of the letter in the Congressional Record \n     reiterated his view that ``timely warning'' was connected to \n     the notion of effective international safeguards. In his \n     words (40):\n       ``Moreover, the definition of an effective safeguard \n     standard--timely warning--will insure that recipient nations \n     cannot manufacture, undetected and overnight, bombs from \n     materials we provide for peaceful purposes.\n       ``By requiring safeguards to provide reliable, timely \n     warning of diversion we are not committing to a new standard \n     but are returning to an old truth.''\n       Later, in the same statement, Representative Findly said:\n       ``Existing safeguards when applied to reactors do provide \n     reliable, timely warning'', but that ``present safeguards, \n     when applied to reprocessing, do not . . . permit timely \n     warning.''\n       He went on to say that:\n       ``[W]e must devise safeguards that, when applied to \n     reprocessing, will provide reliable, timely warning. \n     Promising technologies exist which, if pursued, may satisfy \n     this standard. This bill, by defining the standard that \n     safeguards must meet intends to stimulate these new \n     technologies.''\n       Congressman Findley then referred to collaboration between \n     the Committee and the Administration ``to fashion this \n     safeguard standard'', and remarked that ``. . . the president \n     and Secretary of State have urged that this legislation pass \n     Congress during this session--in its present form--without \n     amendment'' (41).\n       Obviously, it was not Congressman Findley's understanding \n     that the Administration was proposing any substantial \n     alteration of interpretation of ``timely warning'' from the \n     one he had just laid down.\n       The conclusion is therefore inescapable that the House did \n     not see the Senate action as changing the meaning of timely \n     warning, but only as broadening the test for determining \n     whether a subsequent arrangement for reprocessing or return \n     of plutonium would result in a significant increase of the \n     risk of proliferation.\n\n             V. Conclusion on the Meaning of Timely Warning\n\n       There is no logical alternative to the conclusion that the \n     Congress meant for the ``timely warning'' criterion to apply \n     to the most difficult or ``worst-case'' situation, where the \n     U.S. would not suspect in advance that a diversion might \n     occur, but would learn about it after the fact, when the \n     safeguards system had detected it. That is, when detection \n     time is a positive quantity. In this case it follows from the \n     definition that ``timely warning'' is met only when reaction \n     time is less than conversion time (which depends only on a \n     technical and not a political assessment). This explains why \n     the legislative history of the NNPA is replete with \n     references to ``timely warning'' as being associated with \n     what we are here calling ``conversion time'', and squares the \n     statutory (Senate) language on ``timely warning'' with the \n     discussion of the concept in the House report.\n[[Page S5202]] VI. The Relationship of Timely Warning to Other Factors \n                   in Determining Proliferation Risk\n\n       The Senate report, after a discussion of factors that are \n     involved in judging whether ``timely warning'' would be \n     present (i.e., factors entering into an assessment of \n     ``conversion time'' and ``detection time''), launches into a \n     listing of ``other factors which may be taken into account in \n     determining whether there will be a significant increase in \n     the risk of proliferation.'' These are (42):\n       (1) ``whether the nation is firmly committed to effective \n     non-proliferation policies and is genuinely willing to accept \n     conditions which would minimize the risk of proliferation'';\n       (2) ``whether the nation has a security agreement or other \n     important foreign policy relationship with the U.S.'';\n       (3) ``the nature and stability of the recipient's \n     government, its military, and security position''; and,\n       (4) ``the energy resources available to that nation''.\n       There would have been no reason for the Senate to label \n     these as ``other factors'' if they already were included in \n     judging whether the ``timely warning'' test was met. To do \n     otherwise would have meant that the Senate was counting such \n     factors twice in giving guidance to DOE on retransfer \n     requests, in which case these component factors would become \n     the ``foremost'' factors in practice, a result not in keeping \n     with the clear congressional intent to identify ``timely \n     warning'' as a separate, ``foremost'' factor.\n       We have thus established through examination of the NNPA, \n     the Senate and House Reports on the legislation, the Senate \n     Markups, and the floor debate, that Congress intended \n     ``timely warning to be an important factor (the ``foremost'' \n     one), separable and apart from specific political \n     considerations in determining whether a proposed subsequent \n     arrangement for reprocessing or retransfer of plutonium will \n     result in a ``significant increase of the risk of \n     proliferation.''\n\nVII. The Need for Adequate Analysis of the Timely Warning Criterion by \n                          the Executive Branch\n\n       The chief sponsor and Senate floor management of the bill, \n     Senator John Glenn, stated during the floor debate on \n     February 7, 1978, that (42):\n       ``It is important to note, however, that the bill requires \n     that foremost consideration be given to the question of \n     timely warning. This implies that the latter will receive the \n     greatest weight among all factors. Although this does not \n     require denial of a request when timely warning is not \n     clearly determinable, the language suggests that in the \n     absence of a clear determination that timely warning will \n     indeed be provided, a strong combination of other factors \n     would be necessary to compensate for this weakness in \n     safeguards.''\n       This statement emphasizes the importance of clearly \n     determining that the ``timely warning'' test has been met. \n     Since Executive Branch decisions on retransfers were made \n     optionally reviewable by the Congress under the NNPA, it \n     would have made no sense for the Congress, which went through \n     tortuous hours of debate and negotiation with the Executive \n     Branch on this issue, to intend the Executive Branch to make \n     an important, possibly critical, determination on ``timely \n     warning'' without adequate supporting analysis showing that \n     the test, as laid out by the Congress, had been met. \n     Therefore, an Executive Branch determination, such as in the \n     Japanese plutonium case, in which there is inadequate \n     analysis revealing how the presence of ``timely warning'' was \n     arrived at, which does not show how ``foremost \n     consideration'' was given to it, and which suggests that \n     extraneous political factors were the main component in the \n     determination, is directly counter to Congressional intent.\n                               Footnotes\n\n       (1) P.L. 95-242, enacted on March 10, 1978.\n       (2) Letter from NRC Chairman Nunzio J.

Madam President, we started working on this effort of \nnonproliferation back many years ago in my very early days in the \nSenate. We have been on it ever since. Sometimes you feel like the \nlittle story of the Dutch Boy with his finger in the dike. You feel \nlike you are not getting very far, and then you find some nations which \nare willing to sign up under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] \nand place their confidence in some of the restrictions we have had \ngoing on around the world. They express admiration that we and Russia \nfinally are at long last getting our nuclear stockpiles downhill \nsomewhat. So maybe over the long term we are making considerable \nprogress in that area.\n                       irs compliance initiative\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I rise today to take issue with my \ndistinguished colleague, the majority leader, whose amendment would \nseverely impact the wide variety of Federal programs on which all \nAmericans rely.\n  The amendment being offered by the majority leader seeks a recession \nin the funding of the Internal Revenue Service of $100 million. The \nfunding in question is part of the IRS' new compliance initiative, a \nbroad-based effort to collect all the outstanding tax revenue \nrightfully due the Federal Government. This excellent program, which \nwas passed with bipartisan support by the Congress last year, will \nbring in more than $9.2 billion in additional revenue over the next 5 \nyears at a cost of just $2.2 billion during the same period. This is a \ngreat deal by anybody's calculations.\n  In fact, as we stand here and debate, this initiative is already \nworking. For the first quarter of 1995, the IRS has generated an \nadditional $101 million of enforcement revenue, 31 percent of the \nfiscal year 1995 commitment. These are outstanding results for which we \nshould commend the IRS, given that the program has only just begun and \nthat some lag is always necessary to hire new compliance staff. Do we \nreally want to stop a program that brings in revenue to the Government?\n  Madam President, I am as aware as any of my colleagues of the need to \nsave scarce tax dollars and effectively spend resources provided by the \npublic. I have long believed that there is a lot of fat, fraud, waste \nand abuse in Government programs. It has been the focus of our activity \non the Governmental Affairs Committee for the last several years.\n   [[Page S5203]] But I must respectfully take issue with cuts that \nwould come in a program expected to bring in $9.2 billion. If the \nSenate approved this amendment to the recession bill, then the IRS \nwould be seriously affected by the resulting funding cut. IRS estimates \nthat at this point in the fiscal year, the agency would have to\n furlough all 70,000 compliance personnel for up to 10 days. At the \nsame time, a cut of this magnitude would cost the Government \napproximately $500 million in lost collections in addition to the loss \nof revenue from this initiative.\n\n  I am aware that some of my colleagues think that because this \nappropriation last year was made outside of the domestic discretionary \ncaps, that it undermines our budget strictures and unfairly provides \none agency with additional resources. While I sympathize with this \nreasoning in general--and would not be eager to make exceptions for \nother agencies--I think that in the case of the IRS, the only \nresponsible choice is to make an exception. To cut compliance funds \nfrom the IRS, when each new revenue officer brings in five times their \nkeep, is truly penny wise and pound stupid.\n  Cutting compliance funds for the IRS is not good logic and it is not \ngood business.\n I cannot support this amendment that the majority leader has offered. \nI hope it goes down to defeat.\n\n  Madam President, the IRS has had problems. We followed those problems \nthrough a number of GAO reports. They have had some financial \nmanagement problems. After we passed the CFO Act, the IRS management \nwas one of the areas that was targeted to have a first look made of it \nunder the CFO Act to see how they are doing. They are making a number \nof improvements now as a result of those studies.\n  Another area that I have followed for several years in which we are \nbeginning, I think, to maybe get our hands on is in the area of IRS \nreceivables. I do not think most Members of this body, or most \nAmericans, people out across America, realize the IRS has owed to it \nsomewhere around $156 billion. Why do we not go out and collect that? \nPart of that is not collectible in that it is debt that is not validly \ncollectible; where people have gone into bankruptcy, either \nindividually or as corporations. So a big chunk of it fits in that \ncategory.\n  How much can we go out and collect? Peeling that $156 billion down, \nthey have active accounts, they estimate, of $79.5 billion. But they \nexpect, when they look into those, that some are going to be abated or \nsuspended because it will cost more to get them than the money they \nwould get back anyway. But when you come down to the hard core figures \nthat we were given just day before yesterday in a hearing by the \nCommissioner of the IRS, Margaret Richardson, they feel over there \nright now that actually collectible money, if we had the people to go \nout and collect it, is $27.5 billion out there. That is collectible \nmoney on IRS accounts if we had the people to go out and get it.\n  We provided them with additional people last year. We have several \nthousand people, 4,000 I believe it was, a little over 4,000, that we \ngot as new, full-time employees to go out and collect those accounts \nbecause each employee actually brings back in about five times his or \nher keep as an agent in the IRS.\n  Now, I think that is a good investment. I think when we talk about \ncutting back in some of these areas and cutting back on their \nenforcement money, I cannot understand that, when they bring back far \nmore than what it costs us for those particular people.\n  The impact of the $100 million rescission would have some far-\nreaching effects also. We had a hearing just this morning on earned \nincome tax credit. Now, that is a program that has had a lot of fraud \nand problems because people file either some false income data or they \nfile the wrong number of dependents or whatever and a fairly high \npercentage of those returns are fraudulent returns.\n  Now, what do we do? Just as the IRS at the beginning of this year \nsaid they were going to do, hold up and look at those returns before \nthey automatically send the money out. They are doing that right now. \nAnd we are about to cut the people who do that. We are going to lose \nfar more than the $100 million rescission that has been proposed.\n  What the amendment would do, it would actually cut the IRS tax law \nenforcement appropriation by $100 million, 25 percent of the amounts \napproved in fiscal 1995 for a compliance initiative which is intended \nto collect an additional $9.2 billion over the fiscal 1995 to fiscal \n1999 time period.\n  The amendment would further require that any revenue officers hired \nsince the beginning of fiscal 1995, which are those addressing the \naccounts I just mentioned, would have to be redeployed as collection \ncall site assisters.\n  And third, the amendment would limit the cuts that could be made to \nthe examination and inspection activities of IRS to accommodate the \nrescission. Reductions cannot take these activities below fiscal 1994 \napproved levels.\n  The IRS compliance initiative is designed--and is carrying on right \nnow--to try to already reduce the deficit. Last year, Congress approved \na $405 million annual investment to collect an additional $9.2 billion \nto reduce the deficit over a 5-year period. And the initiative is \nworking. That is the good news. Early results show that IRS will meet \nor exceed the goal of generating the additional $9.2 billion. In fact, \nthrough the first quarter alone, the initiative has generated an \nadditional $101 million of enforcement revenue--in the first quarter of \nthis year. That is 31 percent of the fiscal 1995 commitment. It is \nahead of schedule. In other words, they have collected more this year \nalready than it would cost to keep the program in place.\n  These initiative results are being tracked. They have a new system \nfor tracking enforcement initiatives, and revenue has been developed \nand approved by GAO. The first-quarter report was delivered to Congress \non schedule on March 31.\n  Further, cutting the initiative increases the deficit. For every \nappropriated dollar saved, tax revenues are reduced by nearly $5. The \ncost of this cut in lost revenue is $500 million, if it is limited just \nto 1 year--a 5 to 1 ratio. If the cut is permanent, the revenue loss is \nin the range of $2.5 billion. The rescission will negatively impact \nexamination coverage, collection of delinquent accounts, information \nreturns matching, and efforts to curb fraud and abuse with refundable \ncredits.\n  Just think of that. If we make this cut of $100 million, we are going \nto reduce impact; we are going to reduce examination coverage; we are \ngoing to reduce collection of delinquent accounts, and we are going to \nnot reduce one of the big problems, matching information returns in \norder to curb fraud and abuse on those refundable credits that we send \nout.\n  These are only direct revenues. The Service's enforcement activities \nalso encourage voluntary compliance. When other people see what is \ngoing on and they are not able to get away with fraud and abuse, they \nthink twice before they do it and they check that return an extra time \nbefore they send it in to make sure there are not mistakes in that \naccount. An estimate has been made of this. Every 1-percent increase in \nvoluntary compliance increases tax revenues by about $10 billion \nannually. I think that is a very, very impressive figure.\n  There are some other aspects of what this $100 million rescission cut \nwould do to IRS. Stop-and-go financing disrupts IRS operations. IRS put \nin place a long-range hiring and training plan. They did it with our \nsupport, with our encouragement. Over 4,000 people have been hired or \nredeployed to compliance jobs so far as part of this initiative. It is \na good initiative. In balanced tax administration, ACS addresses \npredominantly the high volume of low- to middle-dollar cases while \nrevenue officers address the more complex higher dollar individual and \nbusiness cases. Uneven enforcement could lead to a perception of unfair \ntax administration. So we want a balanced tax administration.\n  There are limits to telephone intervention. Certain issues, such as \ntrust fund recovery penalty, cannot be resolved with the telephone. \nAdditionally, certain enforcement tools require face-to-face contact, \nincluding seizure and sale, lien priority investigations, and offers in \ncompromise.\n  The IRS fiscal 1995 savings options are few. With only 6 months \nremaining in the fiscal year, IRS would need to \n[[Page S5204]] make reductions through a combination of an across-the-\nboard hiring freeze in the tax law enforcement appropriation and the \nstaff furloughed.\n  Now, the worst case I mentioned a moment ago is a furlough of all \n70,000 tax law-enforcement appropriation personnel for a 10-day period. \nA 10-day furlough could result in $500 million in lost revenue \ncollections. So that sounds like a poor bargain to have to do that.\n  Another factor, too, is using revenue officers as call-site assisters \nis not practical. In allocating resources for the fiscal 1995 \ninitiative, IRS listened to GAO and congressional concerns regarding \nstaffing for automated collection call sites. The fiscal 1995 \ninitiative contained 2,200, FTE's, full-time employees, for collection; \n1,450 of these FTE's were allocated to positions other than revenue \nofficers such as ACS, service center examiners, bankruptcy, account \nnotice work in toll-free operations, and early intervention. Counting \nthe early intervention initiative, 900 additional full-time employees \nwere allocated to ACS.\n  I wish to also mention the capacity issues. IRS has 3,276 full-time \nemployees assigned to ACS. There are space, equipment, and system \nlimitations that would need to be addressed to accommodate the \nredeployed revenue officers if this legislation went through. The usual \nprocurement cycle for space and equipment is 18 months.\n  Since the start of fiscal 1995, only 216 revenue officers have been \nhired, 89 from outside the IRS and another 127 from other occupations \nwithin the IRS.\n  And redeployment is costly. Even if there were available ACS \npositions to be filled, redeploying recently hired revenue officers \nwould be costly and it would be inefficient. Revenue officers were not \nhired in the same location as ACS sites. Revenue officers from around \nthe country would have to either travel to distant cities, incurring \ntravel and hotel costs, or be permanently moved. It has its own costs \nassociated with it. This would mean as much as $7 million in \nunnecessary travel costs. Further, IRS would be using higher skilled \nrevenue officers to do call-site work that could be done at lower \nsalary costs.\n  Madam President, this is simply not good business,\n   to cut $800 million out in the interest of balancing the budget, \nmuch as we may want to do that, and at the same time cut back on the \nmodernization systems that the IRS has undertaken.\n\n  These are good programs that they have and cutting $100 million from \nlaw enforcement is exactly the wrong way to move.\n  I will quote from another document that came to my attention in the \noffice. The headline is:\n\n       Cutting $100 Million From Law Enforcement Bad Move, \n     Richardson Says.\n       Congress should reconsider before it rescinds $100 million \n     of a $405 million compliance initiative enacted last year, \n     IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson testified April 3.\n       Richardson told the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \n     Treasury, Postal Service and General Government that the \n     rescission proposal ``is simply not good business.''\n       The proposal is part of S. 617, which would cancel $13 \n     billion in fiscal 1995 spending.

J. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., criticized Richardson and \n     her entourage of deputy commissioners for delays this year in \n     the issuance of the earned income credit. Accusing the IRS of \n     harassing ``hard-working Americans,'' Kerrey said measures \n     such as getting a notary and a clergy member to attest to a \n     child for suspect returns amounted to abuse of taxpayers.\n       Richardson, taken aback by Kerrey's criticism, said the \n     Service had uncovered several schemes, many involving \n     multiple returns. Fraudulent EITC refunds cost Treasury $1 \n     billion to $5 billion last year, according to official \n     estimates.\n       Kerrey criticized Richardson for characterizing ``some'' of \n     those caught as ``common street criminals'' and wondered \n     aloud how much of the fraud is committed by organized efforts \n     and how much by individuals trying to snag an extra hundred \n     dollars. Richardson could not say.\n       ``There are bigger fish in the ocean,'' said Kerrey, who \n     suggested the IRS should pay more attention to corporate \n     fraud and individuals who try to avoid all tax.\n       Richardson tried to escape the examination by saying she \n     would testify on the EITC before the Senate Governmental \n     Affairs Committee the next day.\n       Subcommittee Chairman Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., quizzed \n     her about problems with electronic filing and whether the \n     Service could cut its staff positions by 30,000 in seven \n     years if it got all of its budget request.\n       Shelby also asked Richardson about a March 29 Tax Analysts \n     article that said IRS computers were responsible for some of \n     the millions of returns rejected this year. Richardson said \n     the IRS has found that all of the rejects were caused by \n     taxpayer errors.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 4, 1995]\n\n      IRS Fights Recision, Tells Hill Panel It Would Boost Deficit\n\n                            (By Ruth Larson)\n\n       A Senate proposal to trim the current budget of the \n     Internal Revenue Service ultimately will increase, not \n     decrease, the federal deficit, IRS Commissioner Margaret \n     Milner Richardson told a Senate panel yesterday.\n       The cuts are part of a $1.2 billion recision package now \n     being considered on the Senate floor. Senate Republicans want \n     to pay for federal disaster relief by trimming funds already \n     appropriated for federal agencies like the IRS.\n       IRS' share of the cuts--$100 million--would come from the \n     $405 million appropriated by Congress last year to help the \n     agency increase tax compliance by hiring 4,000 more agents. \n     The plan was touted as a relatively painless way to raise \n     $9.2 billion in revenues in the next five years, to be \n     earmarked for deficit reduction.\n       That compliance initiative may be jeopardized just as it \n     gets under way if some Senate Republicans have their way. An \n     amendment expected to be introduced today by Senate Majority \n     Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri \n     would rescind a quarter of the IRS compliance funding.\n       Mrs. Richardson said that while she understands Congress is \n     being forced to make difficult funding choices, ``some cuts \n     that might appear to produce a short-term benefit may not \n     actually do so. The recision proposal is simply not good \n     business.''\n       The IRS estimates that for each dollar spent on compliance, \n     such as hiring more enforcement officials, it receives $5 in \n     extra tax revenues. Thus, cutting $100 million could \n     translate to a $500 million loss in revenues next year, and a \n     five-year loss of $2.5 billion, Mrs. Richardson said.\n       Budget cuts could force the IRS to furlough all 70,000 of \n     its compliance agents for up to 10 days, or even lay off the \n     4,000 newly hired agents, Mrs. Richardson told the Senate \n     Appropriations subcommittee on the Treasury.\n       Sen. Richard C. Shelby, Alabama Republican and subcommittee \n     chairman, has been skeptical of the IRS initiatives. Last \n     year he supported an amendment, eventually rejected, that \n     would have eliminated funding for the additional enforcement \n     agents.\n       For its fiscal 1996 budget, the IRS has requested $8.2 \n     billion--an increase of $700 million over this year's budget. \n     ``Many of us are asking, What are we getting for this large \n     expenditure?'' Mr. Shelby said.\n       More than half the increase is tied to the agency's on-\n     going tax systems modernization.\n       Next year the IRS plans to upgrade its computer scanning \n     equipment so it can enter all tax forms and supporting \n     documents into its database. Basic tax data is now entered \n     [[Page S5205]] manually, a time-consuming task prone to \n     error; many supporting records are not even entered in the \n     system.\n       The General Accounting Office has long criticized the IRS \n     modernization efforts, saying it doubted the project would \n     result in more revenue, even if it were completed. The GAO \n     also has questioned the need for hiring more compliance \n     staff. It found that the IRS has used the extra compliance \n     funds to pay for budget shortfalls, such as locality pay.\n       Mrs. Richardson said, ``While the IRS agrees with many of \n     the issues raised by GAO, we believe a number of their \n     criticisms are not valid.'' An independent evaluation team \n     from GAO has been looking at the program and is expected to \n     report its findings to Congress next month.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, when introducing this legislation, \nSenator Dole, when he was listing the cuts, said ``IRS, 100 million--\nthat ought to be a favorite of everybody.''\n  Well, I disagree with that. I disagree that cutting the IRS is going \nto prove to be popular with very many people.\n  On the following page of the Congressional Record, Senator Kyl is \nquoted as saying, ``For example, as the majority leader says, it cuts \n$100 million from the IRS bureaucracy, and makes other changes,'' as \nthough there was a bureaucracy over there that is not working properly \nto get in the amount of revenue that is owed to the Government.\n  Let me tell you why I think Senator Dole is wrong in that regard. \nWhen I go back home, what makes people more unhappy than anything \nelse--while they are unhappy at paying taxes, of course; no one likes \nto pay taxes--but what really burns people up is to feel that they are \npaying their taxes, they fill out that form, they are honest about \neverything they do, they do the most honest job they can in submitting \ntheir data in for the IRS to consider, but then, when they hear about \nother people getting away with falsifying accounts and with not \nsubmitting all the data and with getting away with something and not \npaying their fair share, that is what really concerns people very much. \nIt makes them very, very angry. And it makes me angry, too, and, I am \nsure, every Member of this body.\n  Yet when we know there are compliance difficulties like this, and we \nknow the earned income tax credit has some difficulties, and where we \nhave programs that are set up now to address those difficulties and get \nevery person to pay their fair share, and now we are saying that \ninstead of expanding that program and making sure that that program is \nbig enough to really make sure everybody does pay their fair share, we \nare going to cut it.\n  We are going to cut those funds by one-quarter? That just does not \nmake any sense at all, just from a plain business, flat business \nstandpoint, when we know that each IRS agent gets approximately five \ntimes his or her keep in return of revenues that they have found that \nshould have been submitted or should have been paid for and was not. \nNow that just does not make any sense.\n  I appreciate the necessity to try to cut the budget here and so on, \nbut this is absolutely the wrong, wrong place to do it.\n  Madam President, I would like to go to a different subject for a \nmoment.\n  Another one of the cuts that has been proposed by the Republican \nConference this year, which I think is very shortsighted and I hope it \ndoes not go through, is an attempt to cut the funding for the General \nAccounting Office by one-fourth in this 1 year.\n  Let me give just a little bit of background. We, in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, have been the committee of jurisdiction and of \nsupervision over the General Accounting Office ever since I have been \non that committee and long before that. We work very closely with them.\n  They started over 2 years ago, before the last election, to downsize. \nThey wanted to be more efficient. They started their own program of \nmodernization and downsizing at GAO and it has been on schedule. What \nhas happened? They are already down some 12 or 13 percent now and they \nplan by the end of 1997 to be down one-fourth smaller than they were \nwhen they started this program. They are doing that at their own \ninitiative.\n  Now what happened? The Republican Conference came out with a policy \nthat they want to see GAO cut one-fourth this year, an additional one-\nfourth of what the GAO is already doing, an additional one-fourth cut \nin this year alone. This would decimate the GAO.\n  We depend on the GAO as our investigative arm of Congress.\n  When they were before us a short time ago over in committee, I could \ndetail just what my own personal efforts where, as committee chairman \non the Governmental Affairs Committee, I had asked them to do certain \nreports. They would come back and then, as a result of that, with \naction here on the floor or working with other committees, we would \npoint to several billion dollars just that I had saved, just with my \nown initiative working with GAO.\n  They have pointed out all sorts of problems. And yet we are trying to \ncut them back.\n  Where did this start? Where did people get down on the GAO to the \npoint where they are proposing to be cut back by one-fourth when they \ndo good work and where they their own downsizing already going. And, as \nComptroller General Bowsher has said, if you just let them alone and \nlet them proceed until the end of 1997, they will have reduced by one-\nfourth over that period of time and accomplished on their own an \norderly reduction that still enables them to do their job without \ngetting slashed as the proposal would do out of the Republican \nConference this year.\n  There is an editorial in the Hill newspaper, Wednesday, April 5, \ntoday. That editorial is entitled ``Don't gut the GAO.'' By and large \nthey state the situation pretty well, I think. I just read this a few \nmoments ago, before I came on the floor. I quote from this editorial:\n       Ever since the General Accounting Office uncovered the \n     House bank scandal, which cost many lawmakers their jobs and \n     sent some to jail, Congress has been gunning for the watch-\n     dog agency. Republicans were particularly incensed by GAO \n     reports critical of President Bush's tax policies.\n       It now appears that the GAO, the research arm of Congress, \n     may have to pay a heavy price for its independence. Senate \n     Republicans want to slash the agency's budget by 25 percent.\n       The ostensible reason for this cut is a deeply flawed \n     report by a panel of the prestigious National Academy of \n     Public Administration, which concluded that the GAO had \n     strayed from its role as a numbers cruncher and wandered into \n     the more esoteric realm of evaluating government programs and \n     policies. But how does an agency evaluate whether taxpayer \n     funds are being well spent except by evaluating the programs \n     and policies for which they are used?\n       Since its inception in 1921, the agency has saved taxpayers \n     billions of dollars--more than $200 billion by some accounts.\n\n  In fact, I correct the editorial here. The $200 billion I think was \nsince 1985, not going clear back to 1921.\n  I continue with the editorial:\n\n       It was the GAO that found the money trail in the Iran-\n     Contra scandal. After uncovering the HUD scandal, the agency \n     went to work on the Department of Defense, and found $36 \n     billion in supplies not needed to satisfy current operations \n     of war reserves.

About 77 percent of the agency's work was at the \n     request of Congress. Only last week, the Senate approved \n     giving GAO responsibility for \n     [[Page S5206]] reviewing every significant regulation \n     promulgated by a Federal agency, a task currently performed \n     by the Office of Management and Budget.\n       Clearly, the agency that uncovered the House bank scandal \n     doesn't always give Congress what it wants. That makes the \n     GAO all the more needed, especially when budget cutters are \n     honing their axes.\n       This is definitely not the time to shackle Congress' most \n     effective fiscal watchdog.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Hill, April 5, 1995]\n\n                           Don't Gut The GAO\n\n       Ever since the General Accounting Office uncovered the \n     House bank scandal, which cost many lawmakers their jobs and \n     sent some to jail, Congress has been gunning for the watchdog \n     agency. Republicans were particularly incensed by GAO reports \n     critical of President Bush's tax policies.\n       It now appears that the GAO, the research arm of Congress, \n     may have to pay a heavy price for its independence. Senate \n     Republicans want to slash the agency's budget by 25 percent.\n       The ostensible reason for this cut is a deeply flawed \n     report by a panel of the prestigious National Academy of \n     Public Administration, which concluded that the GAO had \n     strayed from its role as a numbers cruncher and wandered into \n     the more esoteric realm of evaluating government programs and \n     policies. But how does an agency evaluate whether taxpayer \n     funds are being well spent except by evaluating the programs \n     and policies for which they are used?\n       Since its inception in 1921, the agency has saved taxpayers \n     billions of dollars--more than $200 billion by some accounts. \n     It was the GAO that found the money trail in the Iran-Contra \n     scandal.

Madam President, it just does not make any sense that we \nare going to cut GAO at a time when we need their investigations more \nthan ever.\n  It came as a big surprise to me back several years ago, as chairman \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee, to learn that the departments \nand agencies of Government are not required to do a bottom-line audit \nevery year, as any business would have to do. The biggest spending \norganization in the world, the U.S. Government, and we are not required \nto do any audits at the end of the year.\n  We worked over several years putting together legislation. It was put \ntogether with the assistance of Dick Darman in the White House, during \nthe years when he was head of OMB, and with Charles Bowsher, who is the \nComptroller General, and we put together what we called the Chief \nFinancial Officer Act, which has been in effect since 1990.\n  What does that do? It requires a bottom-line audit every year of \nevery Department, every agency. We started GAO out auditing just three \npilot projects trying to see whether we could get audits or not and \nwhat kind of shape they would be in. Nobody is passing, at this point, \nwhat in business would be called a certified audit. It will be a number \nof years before we get to that point. But who is required to analyze \nthose new activities that we have put on every Department, every agency \nof Government to make sure that they are truly doing an audit--in other \nwords, checking the audits, making sure the bottom-line audit is valid? \nThe GAO, the General Accounting Office. That is one of their assigned \njobs.\n  We are assigning them new roles all the time, and yet, at the same \ntime, we are saying in addition to what they are already cutting down, \n12 to 15 percent, we whack them out one-fourth this year when we need \nmore accounting capability, not less.\n  I wish we could go not just to three agencies of the Government or \nDepartments of Government and say, ``Yes, the GAO is coming over to \naudit you and you better get your books in order.'' I wish we could go \nthe whole length and breadth of Government. We are going to do that \nnext year, and they are phasing it in slowly and doing a good job of \nphasing it in slowly, because they do not have the resources to go \nfurther into this and do it more rapidly.\n  It is unbelievable some of the things we found in our hearings going \non over at the Pentagon, as far as accounting. GAO found across the \nwhole length and breadth we have 200 different accounting systems, most \nof which cannot talk to each other on computers. The Pentagon alone has \n160 different accounting systems; the Army has 43 different accounting \nsystems. GAO is working closely with the Pentagon, with John Hamre, the \ncomptroller over there, trying to make some sense out of this and \ntrying to get reports and combine some of these systems so that we can \nknow what happens to the money that we appropriate for the Pentagon. I \nuse that as just one example.\n  I think it was $32 billion in unmatched disbursements, for instance, \nwhere they are just sort of written off. We hope they were all valid \npayments, but we could not really document what those payments were, \nwhether they were as valid as they should be or not.\n  We did not have the paperwork trail there to do it. They are helping \nthe Pentagon upgrade their system so we can get that kind of an audit \ntrail every single year, not just once in a great while. Yet, at the \nsame time, we are talking about cutting their funding back by a fourth \nwhen they are on the downswing now.\n  It was rare we used to hear any comment about problems with the GAO, \nand I know, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, where I \nheard the first major complaints. I think maybe this is where some of \nthe problems started with the reputation of GAO in the Senate at least.\n  I know that the editorial I read a moment ago puts some of the \nproblem over in the House on what they did in uncovering the House bank \nscandal. But in the Senate, everybody went along thinking GAO was doing \na good job, which they were, up until President Bush was elected. And \nduring that transition period is when the GAO took it upon themselves \nto issue the transition reports, giving advice, which was not solicited \nby the new administration at that time.\n  These were transition reports that called on GAO's background and \ntheir experience in these different areas as to where they saw some of \nthe major problems in Government. This was unsolicited by the new \nadministration. We had very few Senators here, but some--I still have \none of the letters in my file that was just caustically critical of the \nGeneral Accounting Office for going outside what this particular \nSenator saw as their proper role of doing only reports that we had \nrequested specifically from here, committee chairmen or individuals, of \ncourse. But they voluntarily made these transition reports.\n   [[Page S5207]] If that affronted some people, I am sorry it did, but \nit certainly did not affront me and it would not have affronted me had \nit been a Democratic administration coming in.\n  I do not think there is any agency of Government--no one certainly at \nthe congressional level--to give us advice whose views go clear across \nthe length and breadth of Government, all the way across, and is more \nqualified to give advice than the General Accounting Office.\n  I know if it had been a Democratic administration coming in, I would \nhave welcomed those transition reports to give a new administration \nsome guidance. Instead of that, their initiative, which they took on \ntheir own, seemed to have affronted some people here. And we heard \ncontinual criticism of the General Accounting Office ever since that \ntime. Even up to and including one of the reported suggestions after \nthe Republican conference made their suggestions on cutbacks at 25 \npercent, one of the Senators was quoted as saying he thought they \nshould be cut back 50 percent. That would virtually do away with the \nfine job the General Accounting Office does for the Congress.\n  So I hope that we can think about this very carefully as to what we \nare doing when we cut funds back for the General Accounting Office. I \nhope they can be permitted not to take a one-quarter cut in this year, \nall in this year. That would decimate them. It would interrupt all \ntheir programs. They are on a reduction of about one-fourth of their \nwork force right now. It started back 2 years ago and will be completed \nby the end of 1997. That is their target for this, and they are on \nschedule for it right now.\n  They can go that kind of reduction in an orderly fashion and \naccomplish the same thing if just given the time to do it.\n  I realize the efforts that we try to put forth around here to cut the \nbudget, but if we are cutting the budget with regard to the General \nAccounting Office to that level, I think we are making a very, very, \nmajor mistake and one that we will regret.\n  If we do not have them, who are we to use for investigations that \nthey have done in the past? I have used them. As chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I used them for quite a number of \ndifferent projects.\n  One I will mention. We are all concerned about the nuclear waste \nacross the country, nuclear waste out of the nuclear weapons production \nprogram across the country that went for so many years without anybody \neven looking at it.\n  Back in 1985, I was at Fernald in Ohio. People wanted me to come out \nthere, and it was one of the first steps in the nuclear weapons \nprocess, a processing plant at Fernald, and they felt there were \nproblems there with waste.\n  I went out not knowing quite what I would find. The situation was \nworse than I thought it was. I went to work on that.\n  Then we asked the General Accounting Office to do a study of the \nsite, which they did. I thought it could not possibly be this bad all \nover the whole country at the 17 major sites in 11 different States \nthat were part of that nuclear weapons process. It turned out we asked \nGAO to do studies in some of the other areas, which they did, and what \ndid they find? They found what I had run into at Fernald was only the \nstarting point. What was out there across the whole nuclear weapons \ncomplex was a hideous ignoring of what had been going on all during the \ncold war as we fought to get fissile material and nuclear weapons \nproduced as fast as we possibly could.\n  We had been just ignoring the waste. Everybody was so concerned, \nincluding me, including Members of this body, including most Americans, \nwe were concerned, ``The Russians are coming, the Russians are \ncoming.'' We have to get those nuclear weapons out there fast.\n  What are we going to do with the waste? Put it out behind the plant \nand we will deal with that later. That is what we did. This ``out \nbehind the plant and deal with it later'' was all the nuclear waste \nthat we are now going to have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars \nto clean up.\n  The organization that has given the best definition of that whole \nproblem all across the country is the General Accounting Office. I add \nthis. Back then, when we first ran into this and had the first GAO \nreports, we asked for estimates from the Department of Energy as to how \nmuch they thought it was going to cost to clean up this whole thing out \nacross the country. This was in about early 1986. They estimated it was \ngoing to cost $8 to $12 billion to clean these places up.\n  Better defining as GAO went through this showed in about 2 years it \nwould cost closer to $100 billion. That was our estimate for several \nyears. Then the cost went up, through better refining of the data, to \nabout $200 billion and 20 to 30 years to do the cleanup.\n  Now this past week the Department of Energy has finally estimated \nthat depending on how clean we want to make the sites, the cost will be \n$200 to $375 billion. Some can be done in 20 to 30 years, and some of \nit may take as long as 75 years as we try to learn how to do it.\n  GAO is the one who has defined most of this problem and pointed it \nout. They deserve a lot of credit for having done that.\n  We could go on. I could talk all night here, all afternoon and all \nevening about what has happened in GAO on the different projects and \nwhat we have been able to save. They have gotten back so many times \ntheir cost, the cost of having GAO so many times.\n  I indicated just my own personal case of requests for information \nthat has resulted in several billion being saved on different accounts \nthat we can document. This $200 billion I said they saved since about \n1985, I believe it was, they can document. They have follow-up \nactivities that show. These are not some wild pie-in-the-sky estimates \nto make them look good. They document this with follow-up review \nprocedures to see how much has actually been saved, and $200 billion \nover the last 10 years is an enormous savings. Yet at the same time we \nare talking about whacking them by one-quarter in addition to the \nreduction they are already making. That would be the most false economy \nI can think of if we went through with that.\n  Madam President, I have spoken longer than I usually speak on the \nfloor today, but I think these are very important matters. We talk \nabout pulling back money for the IRS at a time when they are getting \ntheir TSM, their tax system modernization in place. That is a mistake. \nThey are getting back far more than what it costs.\n  If we cut them down on their compliance activities, their follow-up \non tax returns, their follow-up to make sure that everybody is paying \ntheir fair share, their follow-up to make sure the IETC--the earned \nincome tax credit--is not given incorrectly to the wrong people, when \nwe start cutting back on activities like that, that is a mistake.\n  I personally would like to see funding increased for GAO and \nincreased for IRS because their track record is that they are getting \nback more than those additional dollars would cost.\n  I hope we are not going to, in the interests of balancing the budget \nhere, make some false economies here that will cost more in the long \nrun than it would to fully fund these agencies as requested right now.\n  I appreciate the consideration of my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5193-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5207-S5212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGET PROCESS STATUS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to address the underlying \nlegislation and also generally about how we stand in this budget \nprocess, because obviously this piece of legislation has an impact on \nthe budgets generally.\n  We are about to break here for a couple of weeks, and when we return \nfrom this break, we will have a chance to debate the basic budget \nresolution before the Congress. This rescission package which we are \npresently taking up is sort of a precursor to that whole debate, the \nbudget resolution of the Congress.\n  What it all comes down to is an issue of how we preserve the American \ndream for our children. What this debate is about is whether or not we \nare going to start putting fiscal discipline into the Congress and into \nthe Federal Government in a manner which will allow Members to avoid an \neconomic catastrophe which is looming over the horizon and which, \nunfortunately, our children will be the recipient of.\n  [[Page S5208]] If we do not soon get control over the extraordinary \namount of debt which the Federal Government is running up, we will \nessentially pass on to the next generation a nation which is bankrupt.\n  In fact, the national debt today stands at about $5 trillion. It will \nstand at about $8 trillion by the year 2010. Today, about every \nAmerican owes about $19,000 if we take the national debt and divide it \nby the number of Americans. As a result, we are essentially creating a \nsituation where the next generation will not have the capacity for \npaying the costs of Government which has been passed on to them by our \ngeneration. We will be the first generation--talking about the postwar \nbaby boom generations that dominates the membership of this Congress--\nwe will be the first generation in the history of this great country \nwhich passes less on to our children than was given by our parents. The \nopportunity to survive and have a lucrative and a prosperous lifestyle \nwill essentially have been snuffed out for our children by our actions.\n  Federal taxes today consume about 25 percent of the median income of \nan American. In the year 1970 it was only 16 percent. Combined Federal \nand State taxes consume about 50 percent of the incomes of an average \nAmerican. That is today. That is a huge amount of money. By the time \nthat our children begin to earn and produce, unless we get control over \nthe growth of the Government, taxes will consume 84 percent--84 percent \nof their income.\n  Now, that is not my number. I did not come up with that number. That \nwas a number that was actually in the President's prior budget, not in \nthe one he presented this year but the one he presented a year ago. He \ntook it out of this year's budget, I suspect, because it was such a \nstartling number he did not want to disclose it again.\n  Madam President, 84 percent of all the earnings of all Americans will \nbe absorbed simply to pay for the Government as we move into the \nbeginning of the next century unless we do something, unless we begin \nto bring under control the rate of growth of our Federal Government.\n  The current spending policies of this Government also directly \naffects the cost of doing business and the cost of living in this \ncountry.\n  For example, the national debt adds nearly 2 percent to interest \nrates, and that, of course, directly affects everyone's lifestyle. For \nexample, those 2 percent in additional interest points represents $900 \non the cost of financing a $15,000 car and represents $37,000 on the \ncost of financing a $75,000 house.\n  CBO has projected that interest rates would fall, however, if we were \nable to bring under control Federal spending. In fact, if we were able \nto balance the budget and put in place a balanced budget, interest \nrates would fall by fully 1 percent.\n  In addition, we know if we look into the outyears, what is driving \nthis deficit, what is driving this rate of growth of the Federal \nGovernment is entitlement spending. It is not that this country is \nessentially an undertaxed country, it is not that the people of this \nNation do not pay enough in taxes, it is that the people of this \ncountry are being asked to spend too much by the Federal Government.\n  This chart reflects that, and the problem. The green line, which is \nhard to see, which runs across the middle of the chart, shows what the \nrevenues of the Federal Government are, as we project out into the \nfuture years what they have been since 1970 and what they are as we \nproject in future years.\n  The blue spaces represent discretionary spending. The yellow space \nrepresents interest on the Federal debt. And the red space represents \nentitlement spending.\n  What this chart essentially says is by the year 2010, we as a \nGovernment are going to be spending so much on entitlement programs and \ninterest on the Federal debt that it will absorb all the revenues of \nthe Federal Government. We will not be able to pay for things like \nnational defense, education, roads, libraries, all the services which \nare discretionary spending. Unless, of course, we wish to tax people at \n84 percent of their earnings. Then, around about the year 2015, what \nthis chart essentially says is that because of the force of the cost \nand the rate of growth of the cost of entitlement spending, this \ncountry essentially goes bankrupt.\n  Ironically, the Medicare system, which is one of the major \nentitlement programs and which is the primary health care system for \nsenior citizens, that goes bankrupt in about the year 2002, around \nhere. But as a result of demographics and the fact that a large number \nof citizens in the postwar baby boom generation become senior citizens \nbeginning in about the year 2007, and that group starts to peak around \nthe year 2020, as a result of the huge number of people then receiving \nbenefits under things like Social Security and Medicare, the whole \ncountry essentially goes bankrupt in about the year 2015. We end up \nlike Mexico, essentially, a country unable to pay for the operation of \nits Government and unable to secure or provide a prosperous lifestyle \nfor its people.\n  All of this occurs not as a result of the fact that people in this \ncountry are not paying enough taxes. You would believe they are not \npaying enough taxes if you listen to many of the Members on the other \nside of the aisle, that simply raising taxes will address this issue. \nBut that is not the case. As the next chart shows, all of this occurs \nbecause we are simply spending too much money. Taxes have remained \nfairly constant over the last 20 years and will remain constant over \nthe next 20 years as a percent of our national income. But spending has \ngone up dramatically and stays up and then goes up even more \ndramatically as we head into the outyears. So it is spending that we \nmust address and addressing the issue of spending we must also address \nthe entitlement spending.\n  How has the other side decided to do this? How has the President and \nhis party approached this issue? The President sent us a budget about a \nmonth ago which projected $200 billion deficits for as far as the eye \ncould see--$200 billion deficits. It added $1 trillion of new debt, \njust in the next 5 years, to our children's shoulders. It made no major \nproposals to control any costs in any of the entitlement programs. \nImagine that. Entitlement spending makes up 60 percent of the Federal \naccounts--60 percent. And not one proposal was made in the President's \nbudget to address any of the entitlement accounts.\n  It was, to say the least, a political document--not designed to \naddress the substance of the major issue confronting this country, \nwhich is the fiscal viability of our children's future; not designed to \naddress the fact that we are facing an impending bankruptcy in the \nMedicare system and a bankruptcy of this Nation for our next \ngeneration--but a budget designed to get reelected in 2 years from now.\n  I call it the Pontius Pilate school of budgeting. Essentially, the \nPresident and his party washed their hands of the issue of addressing \nthe deficit and the issue of controlling spending and the issue of how \nwe protect our children's future, and walked off into the distance and \nsaid they would give us $200 billion deficits for as far as the eye can \nsee.\n  This, in my opinion, was an outrage, an inexcusable act, and one \nwhich clearly did not reflect the need to manage this Government \ncorrectly and to face up to what is the most significant issue we as a \nGovernment confront.\n  On the other side, we, as Republicans, have proposed substantive \nproposals to address this deficit problem. Today we are taking up this \nrescission bill. It represents specific reductions in spending for the \nnext 6 months, the balance of this fiscal year, reductions in spending \nwhich actually exceed in 6 months what the President has allegedly sent \nup to us over 6 years. He suggested another $13 billion in spending \ncuts. We are proposing $13 billion more--more than $13 billion in \nspending cuts in the next 6 months. He is talking about it over the \nnext 5 years and actually does it through budget gimmicks on top of \nthat.\n  So that is the first step in this exercise, in this critical exercise \nof protecting our children's future. But the more important step is how \nwe address the major budget for the next 5 years and how we address \nspecifically the entitlement spending that is driving the issue of the \ndeficit.\n  If you look at the entitlement accounts there are obviously a large \nnumber of them. Many people do not understand what they are. Basically, \nthose are accounts where you have the legal right to receive a payment \nfrom the Federal Government, unlike discretionary accounts, where the \nFederal \n[[Page S5209]] Government has the option to spend the money. In defense \nwe have the option to spend the money. In education we have the option \nto spend the money. In building roads we have the option to spend the \nmoney. But in entitlement accounts, if you meet certain criteria, you \nhave the right to be supported by the Government or have the Government \npay you.\n  In the entitlement accounts are such areas as Social Security--it is \nconsidered an entitlement account although it is really an insurance \naccount--health care, especially Medicare and Medicaid, farm programs, \nSSI, EITC, pensions for Civil Service and military retirees. Those are \nsome of the biggest ones--welfare. Those are all entitlement accounts.\n  To begin with, Social Security is something that in the short run is \nnot a problem and we have not proposed doing anything that would impact \nthat in a negative way. Why is that? For the next 7 years, actually, \nSocial Security runs a surplus. Every year more money is paid into the \nSocial Security system than is paid out: $60 billion this year, by the \nyear 2000 it will be $100 billion annually. That is a factor of \ndemographics and a tax increase that occurred back in 1983.\n  After the year 2005 the postwar baby boom generation hits the system. \nThen Social Security becomes a major problem. But for people who are \nover the age 50 there is no proposal and there should be no proposal \nthat would impact their Social Security benefit. So we have not \naddressed that in the short run of the next 5-year budget.\n  So we take Social Security off the table but we leave--that leaves on \nthe table the other major entitlement issues. Of those health care is \n55 percent of the spending, health care accounts.\n  In the health care accounts we are talking about two major areas, \nMedicare and Medicaid. Medicaid is essentially a welfare proposal, \nwhere moneys come out of the general fund to support people who cannot \nafford their own health care and their own long-term care; Medicare is \nan insurance proposal for the most part, where people pay into it \nthrough their earnings. What we propose, as Republicans, is not to cut \nMedicare, not to cut Medicaid. There has not been any proposal to do \nany of that. What we propose is to change those programs to make them \ndeliver a better service to the people who are receiving them and, in \nthe process, slow their rate of growth.\n  Today the Medicare and the Medicaid accounts are growing at about \n10.5 percent annually--10.5 percent. That is three times the rate of \ninflation. It is actually about 10 times the rate of inflation in the \nhealth care community in the private sector. Last year the health care \ncommunity in the private sector actually had a negative rate of growth. \nSo it is actually 10 times that. But it is three times the rate of \ngrowth of the general economy. That is simply too fast and it cannot be \nafforded. What we are suggesting is we should slow that rate of growth \nfrom 10.5 percent down to about 7 percent. That is still twice, in the \nMedicare area, twice the rate of growth of inflation.\n  How do we do that? How do we slow that rate of growth? We are going \nto do it by suggesting to senior citizens that they should have more \nchoices. In fact, we are going to say to them essentially we are going \nto try to give you the same type of choices a Member of Congress has. \nThat seems pretty reasonable to me. They do not have that today. Today \nmost seniors function out of what is known as a fee-for-service service \nin health care. Why? Fee for service is where you go out, hire your \nlocal doctor, you know him personally, and you pay him personally, and \nyou pay whoever he refers to personally. It is a one-on-one type of \nrelationship to health care. Most seniors in the fifties, sixties, \nseventies when they were growing up, that was the health care provided \nin this country, about the only health care, and they were comfortable \nwith it. So the culture of senior citizens today use the fee for \nservice. It happens to be fairly expensive. In fact, it is the most \nexpensive form of health care. It is why health care is growing so fast \nas a function of cost.\n  So we are going to say to seniors, I hope, as a way to control the \nrate of growth of cost, if you want to stay with fee-for-service, fine, \ndo that. We are not going to limit your ability to do that. You can \nkeep that program. But if you as a senior decide to choose a program \nwhich is captivated, where the fee for that program is fixed, you go \nand buy the program at the beginning of the year, they supply you all \nyour health care needs, and the needs they supply are the same as you \nget as under your fee for service, if you go into that type of program, \nand that type of program costs less even though it supplies the same \ntype of care--it has to supply the same type of care as you get today--\nif that program costs less, and it probably will, these are HMO's, \nPPO's, we are going to let you, the senior, say keep part of your \nsavings. In other words, if it costs $5,000 to get fee for service and \nyou can go out and buy into an HMO for $500, you get to keep 75 percent \nof the $500 you saved. That is a pretty good deal for seniors. They are \ngoing to get the same, probably better, health care in many areas and \nit is a good deal for the Federal Government. Why? Because it gives us \na predictable amount of cost for health care and its rate of growth.\n  We know that if we can move people out of the fee-for-service system \ninto a captivated system, we can in the outyears save a dramatic amount \nof money and be assured of the rate of growth. We can afford, instead \nof the 10-percent rate of growth, closer to the 7-percent rate of \ngrowth which we need to reach.\n  It also creates a huge attitude in the marketplace where you will see \ncompetition rise, and you will see seniors given all types of choices. \nWho knows what will come forward. The market has imagination. They will \nbe able to get programs today that we cannot conceive of, probably \noffers to give them drugs, long-term care, and probably offers to give \nthem all sorts of different opportunities that they continue to have \ntoday under their present plan.\n  That is a result of marketplace forces competing for those dollars, \nas a thoughtful senior out there purchasing and make the senior a \nsmarter purchaser. As a result the Federal Government and the seniors \nare the winners. We will see a reduction in the rate of growth. That is \none approach which we will take. We call that creating a better \nprogram.\n  Medicare was created in the 1960's. It is a sixties health care \nprogram. It no longer functions in the present climate effectively as a \nway to deliver health care. We need to change it. Unfortunately, the \nforces of the status quo which have dominated this place for the last \n30 years resist any type of change. But this type of change is needed \nin order to bring these costs under control, and in order to assure \nthat our children have an opportunity to have health care and that the \nMedicare system does not go broke so that our seniors get health care \nafter the year 2002. Medicaid accounts, and the welfare accounts, two \nmajor entitlements where we have essentially said--and I think most \npeople would agree with this, especially in welfare--the Federal \nGovernment has failed. If there is an example of the failure of the \nliberal welfare state, it is welfare. We have created generations of \ndependency and despondency. People are locked into their system and \ntold they cannot be productive citizens, and if they try to be they are \nbeaten down by a bureaucracy which says you are not capable of being \nproductive. We are going to keep you in this atmosphere, this endless \ncycle of dependency on the Federal Government and on the Federal dole. \nIt has not worked. Welfare is a failure. The vast majority of Americans \nknow that. The only folks who do not seem to know that are some of our \nmore liberal colleagues who appear to be tied inexorably to this \nholdover from the concepts of the past.\n  What we are going to suggest is that the States should have the \nresponsibility of managing the welfare systems, and they are willing to \ndo it. Given the imagination, the creativity and the flexibility the \nStates have shown in all sorts of areas, release that sort of \nenthusiasm and energy on the issue of welfare reform and Medicaid, and \nyou will see programs which are better. You will see the recipients and \nthe people who need the care and the assistance get better care, better \nassistance programs, and the States feel they can do it at less cost. \nWe will design these programs in relationship in conjunction with the \nGovernors so that they will be Governor-driven, so to say. They will be \nimaginative. They will be \n[[Page S5210]] creative, and bring to the process a much better view \nand a much better approach to welfare and to Medicaid. We will get a \nbetter program, and we will get it for less money again because the \nStates freed of this huge overhead of Federal bureaucracy can deliver \nmore for the dollar, deliver it for less because they do not have to \ncomply with all of this endless paperwork and bureaucracy.\n  As Governor of New Hampshire, I knew that if I did not have to comply \nwith an overwhelming morass of Federal red tape and the number of \npeople that we had to keep on the payroll just to comply with the \nabsurd regulations, the massive regulations that were coming out of \nWashington, that I could have taken that dollar and gotten more dollars \nout of my welfare for recipients who needed it, make sure the folks who \ndid not need it did not get it, make sure the people who you had to \nhelp transition out of welfare were helped transitioned out of welfare, \nand in the process do it for considerably less and be more efficient. \nThe Governors feel that way too. That is why they have supported this \ninitiative.\n  So we will undertake that process in reforming that type of program. \nIn other entitlement accounts we can take the same type of approach--\nimaginative, creative approaches which will slow the rate of growth. \nThat is what we are talking about; slowing the rate of growth of these \nentitlement accounts. Why? For two simple goals. First, to make sure \nthat these programs work a lot better because they are not working \ntoday very well. But, second, to make sure that we do not bankrupt our \nchildren's future. That must be one of our primary thoughts.\n  So as we go forward in this budget debate, we need to be sure that we \nunderstand what is at risk here. We can follow the course which has \nbeen laid out by some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwhich is to resist every proposal that comes forward to impact any of \nthese programs, and to say that it is wrong--wrong to change one ``i'' \nor change one ``t'' as it has been dotted and crossed for the last 20 \nyears. But we can attempt to go in and fundamentally change and reform \nthe manner in which Government is delivered in this country, to slow \nthe rate of growth of Government, to downsize the size of the Federal \nGovernment, to return power to the States, the power to the people, to \nhave a Government which understands the delivery of these programs to \nbe significantly improved through delivering them at the State level, \nand with the programs that we retain here make sure we take a number of \nimaginative, more creative approaches such as giving choice to our \nseniors in the area of health care. Those are the types of changes we \nneed to undertake in order to assure that our children have some \nopportunity for a prosperous lifestyle.\n  If we make those choices here on this rescissions bill, and when we \ncome back on a budget bill which would substantially reduce the rate of \ngrowth over the next 5 years, then we will see a budget that will come \ninto balance. That is what this black line means. The red line happens \nto be the President's budget as it is projected out over the next 5 \nyears, with the $200 billion deficits, continuous $5 trillion new debt. \nBut the type of budget we are going to propose will be a budget that \nwill lead us to a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  Yes. The decisions will be challenging, and I suppose the votes will \nbe defined as tough, hard-to-make votes. But they really are not. They \nreally should be fairly easy votes because what we are talking about \nhere is how to reform this Government so that it delivers the services \nit is supposed to deliver, but delivers them in a manner which can be \nafforded not only by our generation but by the next generation which is \ngoing to have to pay for the costs which we are passing down to them.\n  I believe we can accomplish that. I believe we must reject the debate \ntactics which we have heard on this floor for the last few days which \nhas essentially demagoged every cut as an act that shows no compassion \nto whatever constituency has been identified for the moment and \nacknowledge the truth of the matter, that if we are truly concerned \nabout our children--and there has been so much rhetoric from the other \nside about this program or that program being an issue of caring for \nchildren and compassion for children--if we really care about our \nchildren, then we have to be willing to address the deficit and the \nfiscal crisis which we are facing today and the fact that we are going \nto pass into a bankrupt Nation if we do not act and act quickly and act \nnow.\n  We should also reject the view that all compassion is retained here \nin Washington, that the only people who can run a program that really \nis caring and thoughtful is some small cadre of bureaucrats aided by \ntheir assistants here in the Congress of the United States out of \nWashington. How arrogant that is. How elitist that is. It assumes that \nGovernors are not compassionate, State legislators are not \ncompassionate, that the people on the main frontline of the issue, the \nfolks in the towns and cities across this Nation who deliver these \nprograms do not have the compassion to manage them themselves; they \nmust be told how to do it by this cadre of self-appointed experts here \nin Washington.\n  That theory of compassion holds no substance. It is not defensible. \nThis debate, when you hear those terms, is not about compassion. This \ndebate is about power. That is all it is about, the fact that there are \nfolks in this city who have built their careers around the capacity to \ncontrol the dollars which flow back to run these programs. And they \nunderstand that when we move these programs back to the States and the \ndollars back to the States, they will lose that power and they do not \nlike it. And so they mask their fear of losing that power or they cover \nup their desire to retain that power with this inflammatory language \nabout compassion which on the face of it is not defensible because it \npresumes that they are the only ones who possess such traits and that \nelected officials at the local level and at the State level cannot \nequal their level of compassion, which is absurd.\n  So as we move out back to our States over the next couple of weeks \nand we discuss the issue of the deficit and of the budget, and as we \ntake on issues such as this rescission package and later this budget \nitself, I think it is absolutely critical that we be honest with the \nAmerican people, that we explain to them that if action is not taken \nvery soon on bringing this deficit under control, on bringing the rate \nof growth of this Federal Government under control, our senior citizens \nwill find a Medicare system that goes bankrupt in the year 2002 and \nthat our children will find a nation that goes bankrupt in the year \n2015, 2020, somewhere in that range; that we will have passed on to the \nnext generation a nation that is unable to supply them the \nopportunities for prosperity and hope that we were given by our \nparents. And as I said at the beginning of this talk, it is not right \nand not fair for any generation to do that to another generation.\n  So I hope that as we go forth over these next few weeks we will \nhonestly discuss what is truly at risk here, and what is at risk is the \nfuture of our children.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the time.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we have a solemn responsibility the \npeople have given us. It is a responsibility to control the spending of \nthis Government, to bring it in line with the concept of balance, to \nsomehow manage the resources of this Government in a way which would \nnot continue to jeopardize future generations.\n  You and I are keenly aware of the fact that every man, woman, and \nchild in the United States of America has a debt of about $18,000, \nevery family of four a debt of about $72,000.\n  We have before us a rescission bill, this measure to try and rescind \ncertain spending items which we think we can afford not to spend--as a \nmatter of fact, we cannot afford to spend. These are items which ought \nto be cut.\n  The freshman class of the Senate in this body in the last several \ndays has forwarded additional cuts that would \n[[Page S5211]] allow us to save additional resources. The original \nproposal for rescissions in the Senate was about $13.3 billion, and \nthis Senate just a few evenings ago in an act of rather courageous \njudgment decided that we would defer an additional $1.8 billion in \nspending by deferring the construction of a number of courthouses \naround the country.\n  I think it is important for us to look carefully at the proposal of \nthe freshmen Senators that would provide for another $1.3 billion in \nspending reductions. That money would be available for future \ngenerations because it would not be an encumbrance of debt placed upon \nthem. And the kinds of places in which there are projected cuts are \nplaces where we can afford to trim back spending, not the least of them \nis the AmeriCorps of President Clinton, the so-called volunteer arena \nwhere people are paid significant sums of money in order to go and \nvolunteer.\n  What is interesting about AmeriCorps is that it has been costing the \nAmerican citizens an average of $30,400 per volunteer.\n  Now, most people do not think of $30,400 price tags on volunteers. We \nthink of volunteers as a part of a great American tradition of giving. \nThis is part of the great American governmental tradition of spending. \nNot only is it $30,400, a lot of that just goes into the bureaucracy to \nsupport those so-called volunteers. As a matter of fact, the data we \nhave indicates that $15,000 of each one of those $30,400 items goes \ninto the bureaucracy and overhead and administrative costs to support \nthe volunteers. That only leaves $15,400 remaining. So that money then \nsupports the so-called volunteer.\n  But it is interesting to know where the volunteers work. The \nvolunteers, 20 percent of them, one out of every five of them, works \nfor the Government. And frequently these individuals are not really \nvolunteering in the traditional area of volunteer service in America at \nall. It is just a back-door way of bringing more people into the \nbureaucracy.\n  So the AmeriCorps Program is a program that ought to be carefully \nlooked at. And when the freshman class proposed, in response to the \nmandate of the American people, that we cut an additional $206 million \nfrom the AmeriCorps Program, it was a worthy thing to consider.\n  Now there are those who have come to say to us, ``Well, volunteering \nis noble; volunteering is wonderful.'' It is noble and it is wonderful, \nbut it is very expensive if you accept the administration's definition \nof a volunteer. Here you have volunteers in the State of Alaska \naveraging over $40,000 apiece in terms of cost. I know there are a lot \nof folks in my home State that would consider that kind of volunteering \na great opportunity.\n  So, I would just say that when we have come forward with the \npotential of cutting $206 million from the AmeriCorps Program, I think \nwe have come forward with a reasonable way to say that we ought to \nrestrain spending, to rescind this appropriation so that we do not \nunduly jeopardize future generations with debt.\n  Another important area they are recommending and we are recommending \nfor rescission is the area of foreign operations, in the area of our \ngenerosity to countries overseas. The original recommendation of the \nSenate was that we would have a foreign operations cut of $100 million. \nThat represents about an eight-tenths of 1 percent cut. The House had \nrecommended $191 million. If we were to move from the eight-tenths of 1 \npercent, or $100 million, figure to the $191 million figure, we would \nonly be moving to about a total of 1.4 percent cut in the so-called \nforeign operations budget.\n  Now, this foreign aid that we give to other countries can be \nimportant, can be in the national interest. But let us not suggest to \nthe entire world that the American people are the only people that are \ngoing to have to act responsibly in the area of restraining spending. \nOther countries around the globe are going to have to participate with \nus, as we tighten our belt in order to reach a balanced budget, in \norder to have the kind of fiscal restraint and financial responsibility \nthat our children are demanding of us. As a matter of fact, not just \nour children and their yet unearned wages, but the people across \nAmerica are demanding of us.\n  Incidentally, I think countries around the world are demanding that \nwe act responsibly. If you will look at what has been happening to the \nAmerican dollar on world monetary markets recently, we have been in a \nfree fall. We ought not to have the picture of George Washington on the \nAmerican dollar. We ought to have a parachute, if we are going to \ncontinue to see its value plummet.\n  Why does the American dollar plummet on world markets? I think it is \na lack of confidence in the discipline of this Government to restrain \nits spending. And we ought to be restraining spending. So if we do \nrestrain spending and if we are in a position to restrain spending in \nsuch a way as to protect the future of America and stabilize the world \neconomy, our restraint of spending the additional $91.6 million in \nforeign operations will be a great benefit not only to us in balancing \nthe budget, but of great benefit to the world because we will have \nhelped create an environment of financial stability.\n  Well, there are a whole range of things that are a part of this \nproposed rescission bill. It includes everything from public \nbroadcasting, to the foreign operations, to the AmeriCorps, to the \nLegal Services Corporation, a variety of items, all of which at one \ntime or another, or some of which even today are laudable things, but \nthings we simply cannot afford.\n  Mr. President, I believe the American people expect us to live within \nour resources. The question is not, Is it something you want? The \nquestion is, Is it something that we should be spending for, especially \nin light of the fact that we do not currently have the resources?\n  When you and I sit down at our kitchen table to develop the budgets \nthat we must have with our family, we ask more than the question: Is \nthis a good thing or is it a bad thing? We have a list of good things \nthat we might like that would be a mile long. We look at the catalog, \nwhether it be from Sears or Lands End, or wherever it was that we are \nlooking at. There are all kinds of good things there.\n  The question is not whether they are good things. It is whether or \nnot they are a priority for us, whether or not we really have the \nwherewithal to engage in this kind of activity.\n  Now those who have come to attack the committee's proposed reductions \nhave suggested that we are cutting children; that we are somehow \ninjuring young people. They have elevated horror stories. They have \nelevated very sad scenarios, suggesting that we are heartless and \ncompassionless.\n  This has been done irresponsibly, in my judgment, because, as a \nmatter of fact, we are responsibly addressing these problems.\n  One of the things that was projected for reduction and rescission was \nthe WIC Program, Women, Infants, and Children. It is a nutrition \nprogram. There was a modest reduction there, I think, of $35 million.\n  There is a great outcry as a result of that modest reduction, saying \nthat this was heartless, it was compassionless, it was going to be \ntaking food from the mouths of women, infants, and children, and it was \ngoing to be destructive of the future because people would have lower \nlevels of nutrition.\n  The truth of the matter is this money was to be rescinded from an \nunallocated, undistributed surplus in the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram. The surplus was about $150 million. And to reduce the surplus \nby $35 million, from $150 million to $115 million, would not impair the \nnutrition, not impair the health, not impair the safety, not impair the \nstanding of any of these individuals.\n  But it is important for us to impair the deficit. And we need to look \ncarefully at the way we are managing resources, even resources that are \ndevoted to things of relatively high priorities, even resources that \nare devoted to things like health and the like. If they are not being \nutilized, if they are in unallocated and undistributed surplus \naccounts, let us make sure that we do not leave that resource there or \notherwise fail to rescind it so that we occasion additional spending \nsomewhere else.\n  We have come in response to the voice of the people last November. As \none of the newly elected Senators, I know my colleagues and I, when we \ncame to add our voices to the voices \n[[Page S5212]] that were asking for rescission of unnecessary spending, \nwe knew we were doing that representing the American people. We were \ndoing that because the people are demanding responsibility in \nGovernment. They were demanding reasonable, but tough decisions. They \nwere demanding we restrain the growth of Government. They were \ndemanding that we limit the kind of jeopardy into which our children \nwill go because the debt is higher and higher and higher.\n  We are not talking about an environment where the debt is going down \nand down and down. The President has proposed debts of $200 billion a \nyear as far as he is forecasting.\n  As a matter of fact, the data from which he is creating the forecasts \nis data that is now coming out of OMB. A year ago, it was represented \nthat we would be using data from the Congressional Budget Office, but \nthat data is not nearly as favorable to the President as the OMB data \nis.\n  The OMB data suggests the deficit would only be about $200 billion--\nonly about $200 billion--next year and the year after and the year \nafter and the year after and the year after. But the Congressional \nBudget Office data indicates that the deficit is substantially greater, \nhundreds of millions of dollars greater in the outyears than the \nPresident's forecasts have indicated.\n  So we are not talking about a circumstance or situation where it does \nnot matter whether we are cutting, it does not matter whether we are \nrescinding. It does matter. It matters not only to taxpayers today, but \nit matters to the young people of tomorrow.\n  An ordinary family, the father, the mother, no matter how deeply they \ngo into debt, they simply cannot provide or mandate that the youngsters \nwill some day have to grow up and pay that debt. There is a rule \nagainst that in America, you cannot be held responsible for the debt of \nanother. No matter how reckless I might be, I cannot create debts my \nchildren would have to pay off.\n  However, there is an exception to the rule. The Congress can incur \ndebt that the next generation will have to pay off, and we have been \nincurring that debt at an incredible rate. Now each family of four \nfaces a debt of $72,000, and it is growing and growing and growing.\n  We have the opportunity in this body to say we will stop some of the \nspending, we will stop the hemorrhaging where we can, we are going to \nrestrain this outflow, and it is time for us to restrain the outflow.\n  We will restrain it in terms of the AmeriCorps Program, yes, the so-\ncalled volunteer program that costs $30,000 per volunteer. We will \nrestrain it in the area of foreign operations and foreign aid. Yes, if \nwe are going to have some belt tightening in this country, other \ncountries around the world should share in that belt tightening as \nwell. We will restrain it even for the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting, which is an institution of great wealth, but is an \ninstitution which ignores that great wealth and continues to draw upon \ntaxpayers' resources and which ought to be able to use that wealth to \navoid having to draw on taxpayers' resources.\n  We need to make sure that we even implement the rescission cuts which \nthe President of the United States has asked us to implement. When we \nfirst started this debate on rescissions, we were going to ignore over \n$300 million of cuts that the President asked us to make. It is time \nfor us to knock those earmarked special projects out. Those are the \nprojects which the President next year, under a line-item veto, will \nhave the authority to knock out.\n  He said this year that he would like for us to knock those out, and I \nthink we ought to accommodate the President in that respect and knock \nout that kind of spending. If we do, we will be responding \nconstructively to the mandate of the people. If we do, we will be \nresponding constructively to what they have asked us to do in the \nelection last year. I believe that is very important. They have asked \nus to be responsible in restraining spending.\n  The Senate has an opportunity, as a result of the report of the \ncommittee and the amendment offered by the freshmen Members of the U.S. \nSenate, to rescind the expenditure of resources, the expenditure of \nwhich will drive us deeper and deeper into debt.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to accept the challenge of the \nAmerican people to respond constructively to rescind unnecessary \nspending and to devote the proceeds of the rescissions to the reduction \nof the Federal deficit. That is the mandate of the people. It is the \nopportunity which we have. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 100\n\n       Whereas the Senate is proud to honor the National 4-H Youth \n     Development Program of the Cooperative State Research, \n     Education, and Extension Service for 85 years of experience-\n     based education to young people throughout the United States;\n       Whereas this admirable Program seeks to provide a learning \n     experience for the whole child (including head, heart, hands, \n     and health) and help children of the United States to acquire \n     knowledge, develop life skills, and form attitudes to enable \n     the children to become self-directed, productive, and \n     contributing members of society;\n       Whereas the 5,500,000 urban, suburban, and rural \n     participants in the Program, ranging from 5 to 19 years of \n     age, hail from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds \n     and truly represent a cross-section of the United States;\n       Whereas the Program could not have achieved success without \n     the service of the more than 65,000 volunteers who have given \n     generously of their time, talents, energies, and resources; \n     and\n       Whereas throughout proud history of the Programs, the \n     Program has developed positive roles models for the youth of \n     the United States and (through its innovative and inspiring \n     programs) continues to build character and to instill the \n     values that have made the United States strong and great: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims April 5, 1995, as National 4-H Day;\n       (2) commends the 4-H Youth Development Program and the many \n     children and volunteers who have made the Program as success; \n     and\n       (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was pleased to submit Senate \nResolution 100 proclaiming today, April 5, 1995, as National 4-H Day. \nAs part of the Cooperative Extension System, 4-H is a program of \ninformal education for youth. It is open to all interested young \npeople, age 5 through 19, regardless of race, sex, creed, or national \norigin.\n  The mission of 4-H is to help youth acquire knowledge, develop life \nskills, and form attitudes that will enable them to become self-\ndirected, productive, and contributing members of society. This mission \nis carried out through the involvement of parents, volunteer leaders, \nand other adults who organize and conduct educational experience in \ncommunity and family settings.\n  4-H gives young people the opportunity to contribute to food \nproduction, community service, energy conservation, and environmental \nprotection. In addition, they learn about science and technology and \nparticipate in programs that help them with employment and career \ndecisions, health, nutrition, home improvement, and family \nrelationships. In the process, 4-H youth apply leadership skills, \nacquire a positive self-image, and learn to respect and get along with \nothers. As a result of international cooperation with 82 countries, 4-H \nis also contributing to world understanding.\n   [[Page S5213]] Approximately 5.5 million young people participate in \n4-H. The program has almost 50 million alumni.\n  The 4-H's are:\n  Head--clearer thinking and decisionmaking; knowledge useful \nthroughout life.\n  Heart--greater loyalty, strong personal values, positive self-\nconcept, concern for others.\n  Hands--larger service, work-force preparedness, useful skills, \nscience and technology, literacy.\n  Health--better living, healthy lifestyles.\n  The 4-H pledge is:\n\n       I pledge my head to clearer thinking, my heart to greater \n     loyalty, my hands to larger service and my health to better \n     living, for my club, my community, my country, and my world.\n\n  The 4-H motto is: ``To make the best better.''\n  Mr. President, this organization provides positive and nurturing \nexperiences for our country's youth. Many of our Members have served in \n4-H. I am pleased to inform you that 4-H'ers from all over the Nation \nare visiting Washington today.\n  Senator Heflin, a cosponsor of this resolution, and I would \nappreciate passage of this resolution in acknowledgment of the fine \ncontribution members of this organization make to our society.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5212-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5213-S5214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I actually will be brief, Mr. \nPresident. I, between other work, had a chance to hear some of my \ncolleagues speak on the floor. Since they are not here now, I do not \nchoose to get into a major debate. Others Senators are not here. \nHopefully, we can do that at the right time.\n  Just a couple quick points for the record, Mr. President. We have for \nnow, several days or at least the last day and a half, been at an \nimpasse. I just want to set the record straight.\n  One or two of my colleagues were talking about the delay and the, if \nyou will, filibuster of this rescission bill. Actually, I think it was \nyesterday morning, I came out with a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I \nmade it very clear that I was willing to vote on it, was more than \nwilling to have a time agreement. But the majority leader then came out \nand second degreed that amendment.\n  For those watching, second degree means that his amendment took \nprecedence over my amendment.\n  From that point in time, we really have been pretty much at an \nimpasse. The amendment I brought to the floor of the Senate yesterday \ndealt with the Women, Infants, and Children Program, nutrition \nstandards, all of which, by the way, is quite relevant to this \nrescissions bill, since there are proposed cuts in the WIC Program.\n  The majority leader's second-degree amendment dealt with Jordan.\n  At that point in time, Mr. President, we have been pretty much at an \nimpasse, but it is certainly not because Senators like myself and \nothers do not want to move forward. We do.\n  There has been another amendment which has taken up a good deal of \nthe time this week by my colleague from New York. That amendment deals \nwith Mexico--financial assistance to Mexico.\n  Mr. President, the rescissions bill of proposed cuts, we have had \nsome debate about that. There has been some discussion of the minority \nleader's amendment which I think is a very important corrective step in \nrestoring some funding for programs that are really not programs--\nbureaucracy--but perhaps that really make a difference. Childrens' \nlives, senior citizens' lives--just name it.\n  Mr. President, by and large the last 2 days have been pretty much an \nimpasse, but it is not because on the part of Democratic Senators that \nthere is not a willingness to move forward. We are more than willing to \nmove forward.\n  I did not second-degree my amendment. I wanted to have an up-or-down \nvote. I did not have an amendment that dealt with aid to Jordan on the \nrescissions package. That was not my decision.\n  I just want the record to be clear when Senators come out here and \nsay, well, where are they? Why are we not moving forward? I would be \npleased to. I had an amendment that was in a sense only a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment, but it did not deal with Women, Infants, and \nChildren, did not deal with nutritional standards, did not deal with \nchildren, and those are some of the programs we are talking about and \ndebating.\n  Second point, Mr. President, some of the discussion about Medicare, \ntonight is not the night to really go into this in great detail or \ndepth, but I feel like some of the comments of colleagues deserve a \nresponse--a brief response. I fear that it is just too easy for \nSenators to come to the floor about the statistics and data about \nMedicare, and then make the argument that this is the area that we \nreally have to kind of make the cuts.\n  Mr. President, a couple of points. In the State of Minnesota, with \nsome of the projected cuts that we will be discussing if not today, \ncertainly during this session, those cuts can amount to as much as $10 \nbillion for Medicare and Medicaid. By the way, about 40 percent of \nMedicaid is for the elderly in nursing homes.\n  I can just say, and I speak to my colleague from Minnesota, that if \nwe talk to people in rural Minnesota and we ask them what that will \nmean either in terms of less reimbursement for some of the hospitals \nand clinics that already struggle because of the inadequate \nreimbursement, or if we add to copays or deductibles or make seniors \npay more out of their pockets, we will across-the-board from senior \ncitizens and the care givers, get the same response: Its impact will be \ndevastating.\n  Mr. President, I would just raise two points. Point one, I wonder why \nsome of my colleagues who talked about the dangers of rationing when we \nwere talking about universal health care coverage last Congress, now \nwhen we talk about just the focus on Medicare and Medicaid and the need \nfor deep cuts in those programs, are not talking about rationing.\n  Quite clearly, in the absence of overall health care reform, in the \nabsence of some courage about how to contain costs--and by the way, I \nthink we have to contain costs to have universal coverage--if we just \ntarget Medicare and Medicaid, then we are guaranteeing that there will \nbe rationing: by age, by disability, and by income.\n  I can assure Members that those citizens that would be most affected \nby these proposed cuts are going to be the citizens who are going to \nhave a very bold and I think clear voice. Not because there are some \nawful special interests but because they have every reason to raise \nquestions.\n  The Medicare program, imperfections and all, passed in 1965, has made \na huge difference for me. I can say that as a son of two parents with \nParkinson's disease. For my mother and father, who were not exactly \nwealthy, Medicare was the difference between being able to survive and \nfinancial disaster.\n  The Medicare program is not perfect. There are imperfections. There \nare imperfections to all public and private sector programs, but I \nthink that most view Medicare and Medicaid, both passed in 1965, as \nsteps forward, made our country a better country.\n  Now, I am not opposed to reform at all. But I do want to make it \ncrystal clear that in the projections that have been laid out here, and \nwhat is to be done, I have noticed a certain silence, and that silence \nis deafening on two counts.\n  Number one, based upon the criteria of ``Well, aren't you going to \nthen be rationing?'' And, number two, ``What about containing costs \nwithin the overall health care system?\"\n  When the Congressional Budget Office scored these different health \ncare plans last Congress, the one proposal to contain costs that really \ngot a very strong score, that really made sense, I say to my colleague \nfrom Utah whom I respect and who I know is immersed in this debate, the \none proposal that did extremely well was to put some kind of limit on \ninsurance company premiums.\n  No question about it, in terms of the effectiveness of such a \nproposal as a \n[[Page S5214]] part of overall cost containment strategy. It was taken \noff the table immediately. Taken off the table immediately. I wonder \nwhy? Sure, the insurance industry has a tremendous amount of power.\n  I would just say to my colleagues before we start talking about all \nsenior citizens herded into managed care plans, forgetting fee-for-\nservice period, I thought choice was an important issue. And before we \nstart talking about the way we contain health care costs is target \nMedicare and Medicaid, we should be sure that we are intellectually \nrigorous and that we are very honest in our policy choices. We also \nlook at other ways of containing costs.\n  I will just say to my colleagues, we can take a look at the CBO \nstudies last Congress when they looked at a lot of different proposals, \nand I see no reason in the world why, in fact, insurance company \npremiums are not on the table as well in terms of where we try to put \nsome kind of limit as a Senate strategy of cost containment.\n  Last point, a discussion about welfare. I am just responding to some \nof what I heard on the floor today. I apologize to colleagues that are \nnot here. When there will be time for debate there will be debate. \nNothing that I will say will be personal. Nothing that I will say on \nthe floor right now will be at all hard hitting because I think people \nshould be on the floor to have a right to respond to whatever we say.\n  I do think that the concern that I have, at least about some of what \nis in this rescissions package which is cuts in this year's budgets, \nmuch less some of the proposals in the future, vis-a-vis some of the \nblock grant, is not flexibility.\n  That is not the concern I have. The concern I have is that in real \ndollar terms, when we look at some of the proposed cuts, I really think \nthat the effect of those cuts on too many citizens, and I will start \nwith children, is too much in the negative.\n  Again, whether it is the insurance companies and their premiums, that \nsomehow that is not on the table when we talk about how to contain \nhealth care costs, but we want to target Medicare or Medicaid, same \nthing here.\n  Whether it is school lunch or school breakfast or whether it is WIC, \nor whether it is just the child care block grants programs right now, \nall that is on the table, clear proposed cuts; but on the other hand, \nsubsidies for oil companies or coal companies or tobacco companies or \ninsurance companies are not on the table.\n  I think there has to be some standard of fairness, Mr. President. I \nthink that is what people in Minnesota and the country are interested \nin. I think everyone is aware we have to get our fiscal house in order, \nalthough I think there are different views about how to do that. I \nthink we have to have balance.\n  There has not been an effort on the floor of the Senate on my part, \nand I do not think on the part of Democrats, to slow anything up. I \nwanted a vote on the amendment I introduced yesterday.\n  I will go back to that and end on this. I wanted a vote on the \namendment I introduced yesterday morning, which was a long time ago. I \ndid not choose to second-degree that amendment. That was not my \namendment on Jordan and financial aid to Jordan. That was the majority \nleader, the Republican Party. That is his choice--skillful legislator--\nhe did so. Ever since, we have essentially been tied into a knot.\n  That is really the story of the last 24 hours in the Senate. I look \nforward to when we get back to this debate. I hope that we can have \nsome good debate on this rescissions package. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5213-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5214-S5216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATE VOCABULARY\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have had to learn a new vocabulary \nsince I have come to Washington. I would like to explain to people of \nAmerica and particularly the people of Utah about this vocabulary, \nbecause they may have been watching this debate and have not learned \nthe things that I have had to learn since I have been a Senator.\n  When I came to the Senate, I came naively from the private sector \nthinking that the word ``cut'' meant that we would spend less on a \nprogram than we were previously spending.\n  Indeed, when I talked to my children and I say, ``We are going to cut \nyour allowance,'' that means we will give them less money per month \nthan we were giving them before. When my wife and I sit down and we say \nwe have to cut our household budget, that means we will spend less this \nmonth than we were able to spend last month. That is what the word \n``cut'' means to me in the outside world.\n  When I come to Washington, however, I had to learn, as I say, a new \nvocabulary. I learned that the word ``cut'' does not mean that we spend \nless this year than we spent last year. In many instances, in \nWashington vocabulary, the word ``cut'' means that we spend more this \nyear than we spent last year.\n But you do spend less than someone promised that you might spend at \nsome future time.\n\n  So, I have had my staff look through this rescission bill to help me \nunderstand this vocabulary, and they have come up with the list of \ncuts, Washington style, and then compared those to cuts as the term is \nused outside of Washington. I would like to share a few of those.\n  One that caught my attention--I got letters from Utah saying, \n``Senator, this rescission bill will cut $42 million from Head Start. I \ndo not want to do that. I am a very strong supporter of the Head Start \nProgram.''\n  Mr. President, $42 million, under my definition of the word ``cut'' \nmeans that we would spend $42 million less this year on Head Start than \nwe would have spent last year. However, in Washington terms that $42 \nmillion cut means that we will only spend $168 million more this year \nthan we spent last year.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Two questions to the Senator, and I appreciate the \ngraciousness of my colleague.\n  First of all, and I do not remember the exact statistics, maybe he \ncan help me out on this, is it not true that right now, those children \nwho are eligible to benefit from Head Start, we only right now, in \ncurrent appropriations, cover maybe half or a little more than half of \nthose young children?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Like the Senator from Minnesota I do not have those \nfigures at my fingertips. I do know that the Head Start Program from \nfiscal 1990 to fiscal 1995 has had a 128 percent increase during that \nperiod, and as I said in my statement, in this rescission bill it will \nhave a $168 million increase over fiscal 1994, for a total of $3.492 \nbillion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me try--if my colleague will take another \nquestion. This gets to the semantics about cuts, because I do not think \neither one of us are trying to be clever. I think it is an honest \ndifference of opinion.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, the background of the context \nseems to be the following. I do not have it precisely.\n  First, we say, with Head Start, we intend to do exactly what the \ntitle of it is, give a head start to children who come from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds.\n  Second, even though we say that, we have never funded the program \nanywhere close to the level where those children who really could \nbenefit from such support get such support.\n  Third, my colleague says the fact that this is an increase over what \nis now, over the funding right now, means you cannot call it a cut. But \nif every 30 seconds a child is born into poverty in this country and \nthe demographics are such and the trend line is such that by definition \nyou have more and more children who are in need of Head Start and you \nare not funding it anywhere near up to the level to keep up with that \nincreased need, then, in fact, that is a cut. That is a cut by any way \nin which I think you would imagine it.\n  In other words, I say to my colleague, my family, we were living on a \nsalary--take my salary when I was teaching, $40,000 a year. And by the \nsame token, then the next year there was an increase in my salary, but \nit went up just a few percentage points, but the cost of living went \nup, in terms of food, in terms of utilities, in terms of housing, so in \nreal dollar terms we \n[[Page S5215]] had less of a standard of living than I had before, that \nwould be a cut.\n  If the trend line is many more children are eligible so we are now \nlosing ground, is that not a cut from what the program is about?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has given us \nthe theoretical, with respect to his own employment which may or may \nnot constitute a cut. He has not produced any figures in it. But \nultimately the basic disagreement here has two points.\n  No. 1, with respect to his issue regarding Head Start, is it not a \ncut because we have not fully funded it? That is based on the \nassumption that money alone will solve the issue of poverty that he \nraises when he talks about the number of children being born into \npoverty every year. That is a managerial decision involving an analysis \nof Head Start and its contribution, how well it works, how often it \ndoes not work, what the various problems are, what problems are \naddressed by Head Start, what problems are not. That is not the issue I \nam talking about here.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Let me finish my point here, if I may. I am not talking \nabout that because that is not what is going out over the television to \nthe American people. I am responding to letters, not addressing the \nquestion of whether Head Start is adequately funded or inadequately \nfunded; whether it is being properly managed or improperly managed; \nwhether it is achieving its goal or not achieving its goal. I am \ngetting letters saying, ``You are cutting back Head Start by the rate \nof $42 billion. Senator, we do not want to cut Head Start from its \npresent level. We do not want to cut Head Start from the job it is \ncurrently doing.''\n  The point I am making is that we are not cutting Head Start back from \nits present level. The semantics of Washington are deceiving the \nAmerican people by leading them to believe things are happening that, \nin fact, are not happening. And Head Start in this rescission bill \ndoes, in fact, receive an increase of $168 million, more than it had in \nfiscal 1994; and over the total period of time from fiscal 1990 to \nfiscal 1995, it has had a 128-percent increase.\n  I want to say to the people of Utah and the people throughout the \ncountry who are saying, ``Do not cut us back $42 million from last \nyear's level,'' we are not cutting back $42 million from last year's \nlevel. Begin to understand the Washington mentality and the Washington \nvocabulary. When we use the word ``cut'' on this floor, we do not mean \nwhat 99 percent of the American people think we mean, and we do not \nmean what 99 percent of the American people themselves mean when they \nuse the word ``cut.'' That is the point I am trying to make. If the \nSenator wants to debate with me the issue of the efficacy of Head Start \nor the wisdom of Head Start on the adequacy of funding for Head Start \nin terms of what it does, that is a separate issue for a separate time.\n  If the Senator has a further question on the issue, I will be glad to \nyield to him.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I appreciate that. Actually, this will be the last \nquestion because I want to enable my colleague to go forward with his \nremarks.\n  First of all, I would say to the people of Utah who have written the \nletter to you that I honestly and truthfully believe that they have a \nfine Senator. The Senator's reputation here for fairness is unsurpassed \nby anyone else.\n  Second, I want to say to my colleague, I think that, however, he is \ndeceiving himself in making the case, the semantic case about cuts. \nBecause it does not seem to me to be that strong kind of high ground \nyou are standing on here--though you are considerably taller than I \nam--when we understand first, that right now, though we say we want \nchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds to have a head start, we do not \nanywhere near come close to fully funding it and second, in addition, \nunfortunately, it is the reality that we continue to see a dramatic \nrise in the poverty of children. Every 30 seconds a child is born into \npoverty in our country, and then third, we have a budget which was \ngoing to increase the funding for Head Start and that now has been cut \nback. That is exactly what this rescission is, a cutback.\n  So based upon a program that is inadequately funded, that deals with \nthe most important goal we could have, a head start for disadvantaged \nchildren, with more and more children, unfortunately, being \ndisadvantaged, I do not see how my colleague can take any comfort in \nthe very remarks he has made.\n  Why would you want to trim this back at all? Why would you not want \nto expand the funding? What is the case for any kind of rescission in \nthe Head Start area?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for his kind remarks. I appreciate \nhis comments and I reciprocate the personal friendship that we have \nbecause we do have a genuine personal friendship even though on the \npolitical spectrum we are probably about as far apart as we can get. \nBut one of the delightful things that comes out of the service of this \nbody is you become friends with people with different pasts, different \nattitudes, different backgrounds, different parties as well as \ndifferent parts of the country, and you form the warm personal \nfriendships that the common experience of serving in this body gives \nus. I thank the Senator for his comments. I do say that perhaps we \nshould have the debate as to whether or not Head Start is the logical \nway to spend money in an attempt to eradicate poverty or, if there are \nother places to spend it more effectively I think that is the debate \nfor another day and another time.\n  I will return now, Mr. President, to some of other items that are on \nthis list that I think appropriately belong in this debate.\n  Here is one, Goals 2000. That was in the debate last year with \nrespect to education. We are told that there is going to be a $55.8 \nmillion cut in Goals 2000. Well, after that cut, the Washington \nvocabulary which is applied to the bill, we find that the increase for \nGoals 2000 is $224 million more will be spent on Goals 2000 in fiscal \nyear 1995 than was spent in fiscal year 1994.\n  So people who are worried about that, ``Gee, you are cutting back \nGoals 2000,'' be reassured we are spending $224 million more on Goals \n2000 than we did last year.\n  Chapter 1, this is a very emotional area. If the Senator from \nMinnesota was concerned about Head Start, I am sure he is very \nconcerned about chapter 1 children. In this bill, there is a cut, \nWashington style vocabulary, of $80.4 million. However, be reassured \nthose of you who are afraid that there is going to be an $80 million \ncut from the level spent in 1994, the actual number spent in fiscal \nyear 1995 will be $321.6 million more in fiscal 1995 than was spent in \nfiscal year 1994. The total spent on chapter 1 money is $7.1 billion. \nAgain, Mr. President, $321 million more this year than last, not the \n$80 million cut that a lot of people think they are protesting.\n  The Eisenhower Professional Development State Grant, a $69 million \ncut. I list this in the name of fairness because this is the only one \non the list where I cannot say, in fact, we are going to spend more in \n1995 than we spent in 1994. The effect of this action in the rescission \npackage will be that the Eisenhower Professional Development State \nGrant Program will be frozen at the same level in 1995 as it was in \n1994. So if you are concerned about that, you can be reassured there \nwill be exactly the same amount of money this year as there was last \nyear.\n  There are more on the list. I will just touch a few of them. School \nto Work, people say, ``Oh, there is a $15 million cut in School to \nWork. We love School to Work.'' In fact, School to Work has more than \ndoubled in fiscal year 1995 over the level it had in fiscal year 1994. \nSo if you like School to Work in fiscal year 1994, be reassured there \nis more than double the money available in fiscal year 1995, and so on \nit goes on through.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list appear in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will leave this issue without getting \ninto the merits of the cuts, or the Washington style cuts, rather, that \nwe have been debating here. But I think it is something that everyone \nin America needs to understand. In these programs I've listed, we are \nnot talking about \n[[Page S5216]] cutting back from prior levels, as many people are \nafraid we are. We are simply talking about holding down the increases, \nincreases that in many cases, as I say, are double what they were last \nyear, which seems to me in many cases that is enough.\n  To my colleagues who say, no, these problems are so pressing that \neven a doubling of the money is insufficient to solve the needs, I \nshare with you my perspective from the experience I have had in the \nbusiness world, which is that many times the worst thing you can do to \na promising program or a business circumstance, product development \nactivity, is to give it too much money too fast. There are many times \nthe temptation to say, ``Oh, this problem is not solving itself fast \nenough. Let us give it more money. This problem is not moving as \nrapidly. Let us fully fund it.'' And you push money at a problem at \nsuch a rate that the managers of the program simply cannot absorb it \nand spent it intelligently.\n  I served, Mr. President, in the executive branch. I can tell you the \nmost hectic day in the life of anyone who serves in the executive \nbranch is the last day of the fiscal year because on that day the \nspending authority expires, and all effort is exerted to get the money \nspent before the year ends. And money is being pushed out the door as \nrapidly as it possibly can be because they live on a use-it-or-lose-it \ncircumstance. They say, ``If we do not spend the money this year, we \nwill not get the same appropriation next year.'' Then the managerial \ndata come back. And they say, ``You know. We had to spend it so fast \nthat we had to take care of this artificial requirement that we do it \nby the end of the fiscal year that we spent it badly, we spent it \nsloppily, in many cases we spent it in a fashion that was \ncounterproductive to the program we were supporting.''\n  That is the real reason for these rescissions, Mr. President. As a \nMember of the Appropriations Committee I can assure you and the \nAmerican people that we went through these programs, and said, ``Where \nis the money that is not likely to be fenced in 1995 for intelligent \nmanagement reasons? And, if we can find money of that kind, let us \nrescind the budget authority and only give them the amount of money \nthey can intelligently and properly spend as good managers.'' And for \nthat we are being accused of cutting vital programs and throwing people \nout into the snow, and all of the other rhetoric that has come along on \nthis floor.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that the information developed by my staff and \navailable to readers of the Record following my remarks will make it \nclear that in many programs, we are not cutting, we are simply \nrescinding money that could not be intelligently spent and properly \nspent during this fiscal year, and, in fact, in the programs listed we \nare funding at a level equal to, or in some cases double, that of the \nlevel of fiscal year 1994.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    WHEN IS A CUT A CUT?--LIST OF CUTS THAT INCREASE FY 1994 APPROPS    \n                    [As Contained in Rescission Bill]                   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Proposed                               \n           Program               ``Cuts''    Increases over FY94 (Total:\n                                (millions)        Approp w/cut'').      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJTPA: Adult Job Training.....        $33    $33 million increase 3.4%   \n                                             increase over FY94.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the two \nleaders with several other Members have been working in good faith all \nday to reach a compromise with respect to the consideration of the \nDaschle and Dole/Ashcroft amendment. I hope to reach a unanimous-\nconsent agreement early tomorrow which would allow us to complete \naction on this bill by noon or shortly thereafter with no further \namendments in order. Therefore, Members should be on notice that votes \ncan be expected to occur during Thursday's session of the Senate \nincluding final passage of the rescissions bill.\n  Also, the Senate is expected to consider and pass the paperwork \nreduction conference report, H.R. 1345, D.C. financial board. I \nunderstand there may be some amendments. They are trying to work those \nout. I also understand it is \n[[Page S5217]] very important we do this before the recess. Then if we \ncomplete action on the defense supplemental conference report, H.R. \n1240 regarding child pornography, executive calendar nominations, and I \nthink we are working together on all those, we hope to get them all \ndone by tomorrow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I concur with the information that has \njust been provided by the distinguished majority leader. Let me say, as \nI understand it, at some point he will be putting into the Record the \nsummary of our progress so far in our negotiations.\n  I think it certainly accurate to say that there is complete agreement \non the add-backs. We have a number of issues that we have to raise with \nour caucus. That caucus will take place at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning, \nand I urge all Senators to be there for this very important discussion. \nWhether or not we have any amendments will be dependent upon our \ndiscussion there.\n  We have come a long way in the last day or so, and as the \ndistinguished majority leader has indicated, there have been a lot of \ngood-faith discussions on both sides of the aisle. I am pleased with \nour progress, but I think we are now at a point where this ought to be \nsubject to a good discussion within our caucus. And we will be prepared \nto talk more about the specifics of this compromise as soon as that \ncaucus is complete.\n  But I do hope we can finish our work as a result of our negotiations. \nAnd I am confident that, as a result of our progress, we are much \ncloser tonight.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. President, I will place in the Record at this point a description \nof the Daschle-Dole compromise, which includes the add-backs and the \noffsets and the total cost of the add-backs, plus total deficit \nreduction, in addition to paying for the add-backs.\n  So my colleagues will have notice, it will appear in the Record \ntomorrow morning and they will have a chance to go over it.

A bill to provide a streamlined contracting and ordering \npractices for automated data processing equipment and other commercial \nitems; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                        streamlining legislation\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have been fighting for more than a \ndecade to streamline the Federal procurement system and save taxpayer \ndollars by encouraging the use of more off-the-shelf products. Buying \ncommercial products can lower costs by reducing or eliminating the need \nfor research and development. The time and effort needed to buy a \nproduct can be reduced since commercial products are readily available \nand can be produced on existing production lines. Because the product \nis already built and has been shown to work, the need for detailed \ndesign specifications and expensive testing is also reduced.\n  Last fall we addressed this issue when we enacted the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act. This statute, which is the culmination of \na comprehensive, 4-year review of the statutes governing the Federal \nprocurement system, will substantially streamline the Federal \nprocurement system and make it easier for Federal agencies to buy off-\nthe-shelf commercial products instead of paying extra to design \nGovernment-unique products.\n  I am today introducing a bill to build on the achievement of that \nlandmark legislation and further simplify the process of entering \ncontracts and placing orders for commercial, off-the-shelf products. In \nparticular, my bill would provide for streamlined contracting and \nordering practices in multiple award schedule contracts for automated \ndata processing equipment and other commercial items.\n  Mr. President, too often when we draft legislation to address a \nperceived problem, we ignore systems that are already in place and \nworking well.\n  The multiple awards schedules are an example of a system that has \nserved the taxpayers well. Since the 1950's, the Multiple Award \nSchedule Program has provided Federal agencies with a simplified method \nof purchasing small quantities of off-the-shelf commercial items, \nranging from paper and furniture to sophisticated computer and \ntelephone equipment. According to the General Accounting Office, the \nmultiple award schedules cover in excess of 1.5 million line items, \noffered for sale by more than 4,000 vendors.\n  The multiple award schedules enable agencies to order small \nquantities of commonly used goods and services at a fair and reasonable \nprice without going through the complex procurement process. They \nenable commercial companies to sell their products to a large number of \npotential customers without having to negotiate separate contracts with \neach. The taxpayers save and the vendors save.\n  Even so, the Multiple Award Schedule Program is not without its own \nproblems. The negotiation of a single multiple award schedule contract \ncan involve the review and analysis of thousands of pages of financial \ndocuments and may require hundreds of staff hours by both the \ngovernment and the vendor. These paperwork demands are particularly \nunwelcome to commercial vendors, who complain that the negotiations are \ndivorced from the reality of the commercial marketplace, in which \nprices are established by competition, not negotiation.\n  At the same time, the cumbersome process of negotiating multiple \naward schedule contracts sometimes locks in prices that turn out to be \nhigher than the going market rate. This has been a particular problem \nin the case of rapidly developing products such as computer software, \nfor which aggressive competition may cause prices to drop quickly in a \nshort period of time.\n  Finally, because each vendor maintains its own price lists, it is \nextremely difficult for the thousands of agency officials purchasing \nproducts under the schedules to make any kind of effective comparison \nin vendor products and prices. As the GAO found in a June 1992 report:\n\n       For the most part, procurement offices filled users' \n     requests for a specific manufacturer's product without \n     determining if other [Multiple Award Schedule] products could \n     satisfy the requirement at a lower cost.* * * Procurement \n     officials said that it is an unreasonable administrative \n     burden to require buyers to consider all reasonably available \n     suppliers and determine the lowest overall cost alternative \n     before placing [Multiple Award Schedule]orders. They said \n     that because many schedules have numerous suppliers offering \n     many similar items, comparing all products and prices is too \n     difficult and time-consuming, particularly because [Multiple \n     Award Schedule] information is not automated.\n\n  All too often, this means that agencies continue to purchase the same \nproducts from the same vendors, even when other vendors offer better \nproducts through the schedules at lower cost.\n  For a number of years, I have pressed the General Services \nAdministration to address these problems by automating the multiple \naward schedules, using modern computer technology to make it possible \nfor agency officials to compare vendor products and prices. Such \nautomation would bring real competition to the desks of individual \npurchasing officials, enabling them to select the best value product \nfor their agencies' needs. Happily, such competition should also reduce \nor even eliminate the need for lengthy negotiations and burdensome \npaperwork requirements placed on vendors to ensure fair pricing.\n  With the enactment of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, we \nnow have the means to make such competition a reality. The new statute \ncreates a system for electronic interchange of procurement information \nbetween the private sector and Federal agencies, known as the Federal \nAcquisition Computer Network or ``FACNET.''\n  FACNET provides the ideal mechanism for automating the multiple award \nschedules. By integrating the multiple award schedules into FACNET, GSA \ncan take advantage of a system that is already being developed and will \nbe in place in the near future to bring the multiple award schedules \ndirectly to the desks of purchasing officials throughout the \nGovernment.\n  The bill I am introducing today would require the General Services \nAdministration to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by FACNET \nto bring the multiple award schedules on-line. Under the bill, GSA \nwould be required to establish a system to provide Governmentwide, on-\nline access to products and services that are available for ordering \nthrough the multiple award schedules, and to establish that system as \nan element of FACNET.\n  Once the Administrator has determined that the required computer \nsystems have been implemented, it should be possible to reduce or even \neliminate the need for lengthy negotiations and burdensome paperwork \nrequirements placed on vendors to ensure fair pricing. Accordingly, the \nbill would establish a pilot program, under which direct competition at \nthe user level would substitute for lengthy and paperintensive price \nnegotiations with vendors.\n  The pilot program would sunset after 4 years, to give Congress an \nopportunity to evaluate the impact of the new approach on competition, \non prices, on paperwork requirements, and on the small business \ncommunity. A GAO review of the pilot program would be required to \naddress these issues, as well.\n  Mr. President, I am well aware that we have just completed a complete \noverhaul of the Federal procurement laws. I tend to agree with those \nwho believe that it would be a mistake to reopen issues directly \naddressed by last year's legislation without first giving the \nprocurement community an opportunity to absorb the changes we have \nalready made.\n  However, the change contemplated by the bill that I am introducing \ntoday is simple, feasible, and will save money and effort for both \ncontractors and the \n[[Page S5219]] taxpayers. This change is possible today, in large part, \nbecause of last year's enactment of the Federal Acquisition \nStreamlining Act. I believe it is an idea whose time has come. \nRegardless of how this Congress may choose to address other procurement \nproposals, I hope that this measure will be considered and \npassed.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 676. A bill for the relief of D.W. Jacobson, Ronald Karkala, and \nPaul Bjorgen of Grand Rapids, MN, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I introduce S. 676 and submit Senate \nResolution 104, a congressional reference bill and companion a private \nrelief bill for Norwood Manufacturing of Grand Rapids, MN.\n  On May 26, 1987, Norwood Manufacturing was awarded a contract by the \nU.S. Postal Service to manufacture wooden nestable pallets. On February \n9, 1988, the U.S. Postal Service informed Norwood that it was \nterminating the contract.\n  The Postal Service first sought to terminate the contract for failure \nto make timely deliveries. But, when it appeared that this was not a \nlegitimate claim, the Postal Service indicated that Norwood's pallets \ndid not meet specification. This claim came even though Norwood's \npallets passed all of the tests required under the contract. Norwood \ndisputes the Postal Services claim and, if given a chance, can present \nevidence from the Postal Services' own inspectors that support this \ncontention.\n  Norwood claims that any termination by the Postal Service should have \nbeen for convenience, whereby the Postal Service would pay Norwood for \nits costs of producing the pallets. Instead, the Postal Service chose \nto terminate the contract for fault causing the company to dissolve, \nleaving the small businessmen who owned and operated Norwood in debt.\n  The company contested the Postal Service's decision in the U.S. Court \nof Claims. On August 10, 1990, the Court of Claims ruled against \nNorwood on summary judgement; the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \naffirmed the Court of Claims without any explanation or opinion. This \ncame as a surprise to both the Postal Service and their lawyers in the \nDepartment of Justice. In fact, Justice Department lawyers had already \nindicated to Norwood a desire to discuss a settlement of the matter as \nsoon as the Court of Claims denied the Postal Service's motion for \nsummary judgement. Naturally, when the judge ruled in favor of the \nPostal Service the Justice Department saw no need to further negotiate \na settlement.\n  Mr. President, Norwood deserves an impartial review of the facts. \nThis is why I have submitted Senate Resolution 104, which merely \nrequests a review of this case by the U.S. Court of Claims. After a 1-\nyear review by the court, Congress will possess a determination by the \ncourt which will enable Congress to consider if the relief requested in \nthe private bill is justified. Therefore, at this time, I am not \nadvocating passage of the private bill, but instead, seeking Senate \napproval of Senate Resolution 104 that this matter deserves further \njudicial review.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 677. A bill to repeal a redundant venue provision, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                           venue legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill that would \nimplement a proposal made by the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates to eliminate a redundant provision governing venue, section \n1392(a) of title 28. This bill would make no substantive change in the \nlaw governing venue. Instead, it would simply clean up the United \nStates Code by eliminating a provision that no longer serves any \npurpose.\n  Section 1392(a) states in its entirety: ``Any civil action, not of a \nlocal nature, against defendants residing in different districts in the \nsame State, may be brought in any of such districts.'' I have no \nquarrel with the rule set forth in this section. I note, however, that \nit is entirely redundant of provisions of the Judicial Improvements Act \nof 1990. In that act, Congress rewrote entirely the rules in section \n1391 governing venue in diversity and Federal question cases. In so \ndoing, it incorporated the rule of section 1392(a) directly into the \nprovisions of section 1391. Section 1391(a)(1) now provides that venue \nin diversity cases is proper in ``a judicial district where any \ndefendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State.'' \nSection 1391(b)(1) uses the identical language for venue in Federal \nquestion cases.\n  In short, these 1990 changes have exactly duplicated the rule of \nsection 1392(a) within the structure of the new section 1391. Section \n1392(a) remains as a useless vestige of an earlier structure.\n  Again, I note that my bill implements a proposal made by the Judicial \nConference of the United States. Specifically, in its September 20, \n1993, report, the Judicial Conference states, ``The [Judicial] \nConference also approved the [Federal-State Jurisdiction] Committee's \nrecommendation to propose a repeal of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1392(a) as \nredundant because of recent amendments to Sec. Sec. 1391 (a)(1) and \n(b)(1).''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Craig, Mr. Campbell, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 678. A bill to provide for the coordination and implementation of \na national aquaculture policy for the private sector by the Secretary \nof Agriculture, to establish an aquaculture development and research \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n    the national aquaculture development research and promotion act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nAquaculture Development, Research, and Promotion Act.\n  Our bill is virtually identical to the bill which the Senate \nAgriculture Committee reported to the floor last year. More than 50 \nSenators cosponsored last year's legislation, but like many bills \nduring the 103d Congress, we did not take final action before Congress \nadjourned.\n  This bill is much more than a simple reauthorization of an expiring \nlaw. It will stimulate one of the fastest growing components of \nagriculture in the United States. The bill promotes policies which will \nallow our country to become more competitive in the expanding global \nmarket for aquaculture products. The National Aquaculture Development, \nResearch, and Promotion Act can serve as a road map for America's \nfuture success in aquaculture.\n  This legislation addresses some of the most pressing needs of \naquaculture farmers, such as research, credit assistance, production \nand market data, conservation assistance, and better coordination among \nFederal agencies. But the bill can best be summarized in a simple, \nthree word statement: aquaculture is agriculture.\n  For too long, aquaculture farmers have suffered because of the \nabsence of a consistent Federal policy to promote this important sector \nof agriculture. Aquaculture has also been limited by an inability to \nfully participate in many of the farm programs available to dry-land \nagriculture. The time has come for the Federal Government to recognize \nthat just because the crop you harvest has fins and gills instead of \nhoofs and horns, it is still agriculture and you deserve to be treated \njust like any other farmer who works hard for a living.\n  The world market for aquaculture is vast, and the United States is \nwell-equipped to become a leader in aquaculture production and \ntechnology. Supported by a national commitment, American farmers have \ndeveloped the most productive terrestrial agriculture system on earth. \nA similar effort is needed to help the United States increase its share \nof the rapidly expanding market for aquaculture products. Such a \nnational commitment is essential to the future success of aquaculture \nin the United States. America has the finest research institutions in \nthe world. We simply need to redirect some of our research energy \ntoward new, promising technologies like aquaculture.\n  Efforts to expand the U.S. aquaculture industry will not go\n   unrewarded. The United States imports 60 percent of its fish and \nshellfish, \n[[Page S5220]] which results in a $3.3 billion annual trade deficit for \nseafood. If we could reduce our seafood trade deficit by one-third \nthrough expanded aquaculture production, we would create 25,000 new \njobs. That is what this aquaculture bill is about--creating jobs and \nputting Americans to work in new, promising industries.\n  By the year 2000, nearly one-quarter of global seafood consumption \nwill come from fish farming. In order to keep pace with the rising \ndemand for seafood, world aquaculture production must double by the end \nof this decade and increase sevenfold in the next 35 years. This \nestimate is based on current population projections and assumes a \nstable wild fishery harvest. The important question is whether U.S. \naquaculture will share in this explosive growth.\n  Aquaculture is a diverse industry that affects all regions of the \ncountry. More than 30 States produce at least two dozen commercially \nimportant aquaculture species. Yet it is disturbing that the United \nStates ranks 10th among nations in the value of its production. China, \nJapan, India, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines, Norway, Thailand, and \nthe Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union, all enjoy a \nlarger share of the global aquaculture market. As we work to resolve \nthis problem with our balance of trade, aquaculture can be part of the \nsolution.\n  Nowhere is the opportunity for aquaculture more promising than in \nHawaii. We have a skilled labor force, access to Asian and North \nAmerican markets, and a climate that permits harvesting throughout the \nyear. Aquaculture can strengthen our employment base and help fill the \ngaps caused by the decline in sugar. Aquaculture farming is capable of \nsupporting more jobs per acre than plantation agriculture, and these \nare usually high-wage and high-technology jobs. With the right \nencouragement, aquaculture can become a cornerstone of diversified \nagriculture in Hawaii.\n  More than 100 Hawaiian production and service businesses generate \nannual aquaculture sales of $25 million from the production of 35 \ndifferent aquaculture species. Over the last 15 years, the State has \nspent $15.7 million to grow our aquaculture industry. This investment \nhas helped generate cumulative revenues of $315.9 million during the \nperiod. The industry in Hawaii, like many other regions in the United \nStates, is poised to increase production, sales revenues, and generate \nnew employment opportunities.\n  However, the legislation I have introduced today was not designed \nmerely to promote aquaculture in Hawaii. The bill was drafted with one \nbasic principle in mind; namely, to assist all aquaculture farmers \nequally. It would be wrong to promote any segment of the industry--\nwhether it is marine or fresh water aquaculture farming, or a \nparticular species of fish or shellfish--over another.\n  In summary, this bill has the potential to diversify our agricultural \nbase, strengthen rural economies, increase worldwide demand for U.S. \nagricultural commodities, and thereby reduce the U.S. trade deficit. I \nhope that we can consider this legislation as part of the 1995 farm \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 678\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

With global seafood demand \n     projected to increase 70 percent by 2025, and harvests from \n     capture fisheries stable or declining, aquaculture would have \n     to increase production by 700 percent, a total of 77 million \n     metric tons annually.\n       ``(15) Private aquaculture production in the United States \n     has increased an average of 20 percent by weight annually \n     since 1980, and is one of the fastest growing segments of \n     United States and world agriculture.\n       ``(16) In 1990, private United States aquaculture \n     production was 860,750,000 pounds, worth $761,500,000, up \n     from 203,178,000 pounds, worth $191,977,000, in 1980.\n       ``(17) Since 1960, per capita consumption of aquatic foods \n     in the United States has increased by 49 percent to 14.9 \n     pounds in 1991, and could reach 20 pounds by the year 2000. \n     Total United States demand is projected to double by 2020.''.\n     [[Page S5221]]   (b) Purpose.--Subsection (b) of section 2 \n     (16 U.S.C. 2801(b)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to promote \n     aquaculture in the United States by--\n       ``(1) declaring a national aquaculture policy;\n       ``(2) establishing private aquaculture as a form of \n     agriculture;\n       ``(3) establishing cultivated aquatic animals, plants, \n     microorganisms, and their products produced by private \n     persons and moving in standard commodity channels as \n     agricultural livestock, crops, and commodities;\n       ``(4) establishing the Department as the lead Federal \n     agency for the development, implementation, promotion, and \n     coordination of national policy and programs for private \n     aquaculture by--\n       ``(A) designating the Secretary as the permanent \n     chairperson of a Federal interagency aquaculture coordinating \n     group;\n       ``(B) assigning overall responsibility to the Secretary for \n     coordinating, developing, and carrying out policies and \n     programs for private aquaculture; and\n       ``(C) authorizing the establishment of a National \n     Aquaculture Information Center within the Department to \n     support the United States aquaculture industry; and\n       ``(5) encouraging--\n       ``(A) aquaculture activities and programs in both the \n     public and private sectors of the economy of the United \n     States;\n       ``(B) the creation of new industries and job opportunities \n     related to aquaculture activities;\n       ``(C) the reduction of the fisheries trade deficit; and\n       ``(D) other national policy benefits deriving from \n     aquaculture activities.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require that Federal agencies differentiate animal \nfats and vegetable oils from other oils and greases in issuing or \nenforcing regulations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  THE EDIBLE OIL REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nPressler, Senator Harkin and others in introducing legislation to \nencourage regulatory common sense. Our legislation will correct two \nproblems: First, the regulation of edible oils in a manner similar to \ntoxic oils like petroleum, and second, the requirement that \nCertificates of Financial Responsibility [COFR] accompanying vessels \ncarrying edible oils equal those of vessels carrying toxic oils. This \nbill is similar to legislation which passed Congress last year, but was \nnot given final approval.\n  In response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1990, Congress passed \nthe Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which requires several Federal agencies \nto enhance regulatory activities with regard to the shipping and \nhandling of hazardous oils.\n  In 1993, the Transportation Department proposed regulations to guard \nagainst oil spills, and require response plans if spills did occur. DOT \nproposed to treat vegetable oils--that is, salad oils--in the same way \nas petroleum. Among other things, salad oils would have been officially \ndeclared ``hazardous materials,'' with all the regulatory requirements \nand extra costs which that designation entails.\n  This was a classic example of regulatory overreaching. Vegetable oil, \nof course, is distinctly different from petroleum. Vegetable oil \nprocessors thought it entirely appropriate that they undertake response \nplans to guard against major spills. The industry did not argue that \nthey should be exempt from regulation.\n  The industry argued that regulators should take into account obvious \ndifferences--in toxicity, biodegradability, environmental persistence \nand other factors--between vegetable oils on the one hand, and toxic \npetroleum oils on the other.\n  Secretary Pena eventually agreed with us and prompted modification of \nDOT's position. However, he does not have jurisdiction over all \nagencies with a role in regulating oil spills. More recently, the \nindustry has been working with other agencies which have a role in \nregulating oils and ensuring adequate financial responsibility in the \nevent of a spill.\n  No one is any longer proposing to call salad dressing or mayonnaise \n``hazardous material,'' but agencies are requiring that spill response \nplans for vegetable oils be quite similar to those for petroleum.\n  The most recent problem arose in December when Coast Guard \nregulations subjected vessels carrying vegetable oil to the same \nstandard of liability and financial responsibility as supertankers \ncarrying petroleum. On December 28, 1994, the Coast Guard began \nrequiring the same standard--a $1,200 per gross ton or $10 million of \nfinancial responsibility--on vessels carrying vegetable oil and \npetroleum oil in U.S. waters or calling at U.S. ports. On July 1, \nsimilar standards will be phased in on barges operating on U.S. \nnavigable waterways.\n  Prior to December 28, a COFR requirement of $150 per gross ton \napplied to all vessels regardless of the hazardous nature or toxicity \nof the cargo. The vegetable oil industry does not seek a\n return to this earlier standard, but seeks regulation under a $600 per \ngross ton COFR requirement that Coast Guard regulations apply to \nvessels carrying other commodities. It is worth noting that this new \nfinancial responsibility standard for edible oil would be four times \nthe COFR required on toxic petroleum oils prior to December 28, 1994.\n\n  Application of the most stringent standard to vessels carrying \nvegetable oil adds to the cost of transporting U.S. vegetable oil to \nforeign markets. The additional costs of these burdensome regulations \nare passed back to farmers in reduced prices for commodities. Consumers \nmay also bear a burden in higher food prices. In addition, there have \nalready been instances in 1995 where this unjustified additional cost \nhas made U.S. vegetable oil uncompetitive and has resulted in lost \nexports. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a February 15, \n1995 Journal of Commerce report detailing these losses be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Our bill would not exempt vegetable oil shipments from COFR \nrequirements or regulation. It would only apply a more appropriate \nstandard of financial responsibility to vegetable oil, similar to that \napplied to vessels carrying other commodities.\n  The scientific data collected to date indicate that the animal fats \nand vegetable oils industry has an excellent spill history justifying \ndifferentiation of these edible materials from toxic oils. \nSpecifically, these products account for less than one-half of 1 \npercent of all oil spills in the U.S. In addition, most spills of these \nproducts are less than 1,000 gallons.\n  The industry seeks a separate category for vegetable oils. This is as \nmuch because of scientific differences in the oils as it is for \neconomic reasons. There is no reason why non-toxic vegetable oils must \nbe in the same category as toxic oils.\n  Second, the industry seeks response requirements that recognize the \ndifferent characteristics of animal fats and vegetable oils within this \nseparate category. A separate category without separate response \nrequirements reflecting different toxicity and biodegradability is \nnothing more than a hollow gesture.\n  The Senate and House of Representatives last year passed virtually \nidentical legislation on different legislative vehicles to ensure that \nboth of these objectives were accomplished. Under our bill, the \nunderlying principles of Oil Pollution Act of 1990 would remain \nunchanged with the language to require differentiation of animal fats \nand vegetable oils from other oils. The House approved this language \ntwice last year as part of H.R. 4422 and H.R. 4852. The Senate passed \nthe bill as S. 2559. Since final action on this legislation was not \ncompleted in the last Congress, we have introduced it again.\n  This bill does not tell the Coast Guard or any other agency what it \nmust put into regulations. The legislation simply says that in \nrulemaking under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990, these agencies must differentiate between \nvegetable oils and animal fats on one hand, and other oils including \npetroleum on the other.\n  [[Page S5224]] The bill specifies that the agencies should consider \ndifferences in the physical, chemical, biological or other properties \nand the effects on human health and the environment effects of these \noils.\n  This bill does not exempt vegetable oils from the Oil Pollution Act \nof 1990 or any other statute. It is a modest effort to encourage common \nsense in an area of regulation that has not always been marked by that \ncharacteristic. I hope my colleagues will cosponsor the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 679\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Edible Oil Regulatory Reform \n     Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Animal fat.--The term ``animal fat'' means each type of \n     animal fat, oil, or grease (including fat, oil, or grease \n     from fish or a marine mammal), including any fat, oil, or \n     grease referred to in section 61(a)(2) of title 13, United \n     States Code.\n       (2) Vegetable oil.--The term ``vegetable oil'' means each \n     type of vegetable oil (including vegetable oil from a seed, \n     nut, or kernel), including any vegetable oil referred to in \n     section 61(a)(1) of title 13, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 3. DIFFERENTIATION AMONG FATS, OILS, AND GREASES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In issuing or enforcing a regulation, an \n     interpretation, or a guideline relating to a fat, oil, or \n     grease under a Federal law, the head of a Federal agency \n     shall--\n       (a) differentiate between and establish separate categories \n     for--\n       (A)(i) animal fats; and\n       (ii) vegetable oils; and\n       (B) other oils, including petroleum oil; and\n       (2) apply different standards to different classes of fat \n     and oil as provided in subsection (b).\n       (b) Considerations.--In differentiating between the classes \n     of animal fats and vegetable oils referred to in subsection \n     (a)(1)(A) and the classes of oils described in subsection \n     (a)(1)(B), the head of the Federal agency shall consider \n     differences in physical, chemical, biological, and other \n     properties, and in the effects on human health and the \n     environment, of the classes.\n\n     SEC. 4. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.\n\n       (a) Limits on Liability.--Section 1004(a)(1) of the Oil \n     Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2704(a)(1)) is amended by \n     striking ``for a tank vessel,'' and inserting ``for a tank \n     vessel (other than a tank vessel carrying animal fat or \n     vegetable oil),''.\n       (b) Financial Responsibility.--The first sentence of \n     section 1016(a) of the Act (33 U.S.C. 2716(a)) is amended by \n     striking ``in the case of a tank vessel,'' and inserting ``in \n     the case of a tank vessel (other than a tank vessel carrying \n     animal fat or vegetable oil),''.\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Lugar \nin introducing legislation that will clarify the regulatory treatment \nof edible oils, including vegetable oils and animal fats. This \nlegislation is very similar to legislation that we introduced last year \nand to legislation that both the Senate and House of Representatives \npassed last fall, but unfortunately not in the same bill.\n  Common sense would dictate that regulations governing the \ntransportation, handling and storage of edible oils should not be as \nstringent as those applicable to other oils, such as petroleum oils or \nother toxic oils, which pose a far more significant level of health, \nsafety, and environmental risk in the event of a spill, discharge or \nmishandling. Animal fats and vegetable oils are essential components of \nfood products that we consume every day. The scientific evidence \nindicates they are not toxic in the environment, are essential \nnutritional components, are biodegradable and are not persistent in the \nenvironment. In any event, spills of animal fats and vegetable oils are \nrelatively infrequent and small in quantity. Such spills accounted for \nless than 1 percent of oil spills in and around U.S. waters between \n1986 and 1992, and were generally very small in quantity, with only 13 \nspills of more than 1,000 gallons in that period.\n  Regrettably, a common sense approach to regulation of animal fats and \nvegetable oils has been more difficult to achieve than one might think, \nas the experience under implementation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 \ndemonstrates. At one point, it was proposed that edible vegetable oils \nbe regulated as ``hazardous material''. Although some of the problems \nhave been worked out, whether regulators will properly differentiate \nedible fats and oils from petroleum and other toxic oils in applying \nthe Oil Pollution Act and other Federal laws. This kind of \noverregulation imposes costs which must be borne by the industry and by \nfarmers, in the form of lower prices, and by consumers, in the form of \nhigher prices.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is simply designed to bring \nsome clarity to this situation by ensuring that overly restrictive or \nunreasonable interpretations of Federal laws do not impose excessively \nburdensome or irrational regulations with respect to edible oils. The \nbill would not exempt edible oils from regulation, but would only \nrequire that regulators differentiate animal fats and vegetable oils \nfrom other oils, including petroleum oil, considering differences in \nphysical, chemical, biological and other properties, and in the effects \non human health and the environment, of the classes of oils.\n  To address a specific issue that has arisen, language has been added \nto this bill that was not in the previous version to clarify that under \nthe Oil Pollution Act vessels carrying animal fats and vegetable oils \nare not subject to the same level of financial responsibility \nrequirements as are applicable to vessels carrying petroleum oils. \nAgain, this is a common sense approach, recognizing that animal fats \nand vegetable oils simply do not pose risks comparable to those \nassociated with other oils such as petroleum oils.\n  In conclusion, this legislation will alleviate the substantial threat \nof overregulation of animal fats and vegetable oils in ways that \nclearly could not have been intended by Congress. It will bring some \nreasonableness and clarity to issues that are now characterized by \nconfusion and uncertainty. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant, straightforward legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 680. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation and coastwise trade endorsement for the \nvessel Yes Dear; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                coastwise trading privileges legislation\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \ndirect that the vessel Yes Dear, official number 578550, be accorded \ncoastwise trading privileges and be issued a certificate of \ndocumentation under section 12103 of title 46, United States Code.\n  The Yes Dear was constructed in Hong Kong in 1976, and the vessel is \na wooden trawler. It is 53.6 feet in length, 15 feet in breadth, has a \ndepth of 6.5 feet, and is self-propelled.\n  The vessel was purchased by R. Milledge Morris of Beaufort, SC, who \npurchased it in 1991 with the intention of chartering the vessel for \nshort sailing tours. The vessel was in disrepair, and Mr. Milledge has \nspent a considerable amount of time, effort, and resources in repairs. \nHowever, because the vessel was built in Hong Kong, it did not meet the \nrequirements for coastwise license endorsement in the United States. \nSuch documentation is mandatory to enable the owner to use the vessel \nfor its intended purpose.\n  The owner of the Yes Dear is seeking a waiver of the existing law \nbecause he wishes to use the vessel for charters. His desired \nintentions for the vessel's use will not adversely affect the coastwise \ntrade in U.S. waters. If he is granted this waiver, it is his intention \nto comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety requirements. The \npurpose of the legislation I am introducing is to allow the Yes Dear to \nengage in the coastwise trade and the fisheries of the United \nStates.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 681. A bill to provide for the imposition of sanctions against \nColombia with respect to illegal drugs and drug trafficking; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n         the narcotics national emergency sanctions act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the drug problem today is worse then it was \nin 1992. Drug use by young people is up; addiction is up; and drugs on \nAmerican streets can be acquired at cheaper prices and with greater \npurity levels than ever before. The most destructive \n[[Page S5225]] drug remains cocaine, which means the availability of \n``crack'' continues unabated; and there are worrisome reports of \nincreasing heroin availability and use.\n  The world's primary source of cocaine is Colombia. It is the \nheadquarters for the international cocaine cartels, who are operating \nwith virtual impunity in Colombia. Colombia is also a significant \nproducer of heroin, having overtaken Mexico as the major Western \nHemisphere heroin producer; and Colombia's cultivation and export of \nmarijuana is increasing.\n  On March 1, as required by law, the Clinton Administration announced \nits annual decision regarding Colombian cooperation with the United \nStates in the fight against drugs. The Administration said Colombia \nfailed to cooperate, the result of which is, in the Clinton \nAdministration's own words, that ``* * * the activities of the \nColombian drug syndicates continue to ensure that the flow of cocaine, \nheroin, and marijuana from Colombia to the United States remains \nundiminished.''\n  This is a startling conclusion. Yet, the Clinton administration then \ngave Colombia a ``national interest'' waiver. The effect of this \ndecision is to do nothing about Colombia's abysmal record, with our \nbilateral relationship continuing as if nothing is wrong. This is a \ngrave moral and geopolitical mistake.\n  This is way Senator Mack and I are introducing the Narcotics National \nEmergency Sanctions Act of 1995, a bill to cut off all economic aid, \ntrade benefits, and military assistance to Colombia if the nation does \nnot fulfill the antinarcotics agenda outlined by Colombia's own \nPresident, Ernesto Samper.\n  This legislation requires the President to certify to the U.S. \nCongress that Colombia has made demonstrable progress in fighting drugs \nbetween now and February 6, 1996. If Colombia cannot fulfill what \nPresident Samper himself has outlined as his Government's antidrug \nagenda, then sanctions go into effect.\n  The objectives outlined by President Samper, and contained in the \nlegislation, include: investigating the financing of political parties \nand candidates by the drug lords; capturing and imprisoning the major \ndrug kingpins; confiscating the profits from illegal drug activities; \nreforming the penal code and plea-bargaining system, and increasing \npenalties for drug trafficking; and destroying 44,000 hectares of \nillegal coca and poppy plants in Colombia by February 6, 1996, and all \nremaining illegal crops by February 6, 1997.\n  These initiatives are in the legislation as the specific conditions \nthat Colombia must meet. They were not created by this Senator, another \nSenator, or by anyone in the U.S. Government. They were announced by \nPresident Samper as his Government's own antidrug program in his July \n15, 1994, letter to the U.S. Congress and in a February 6, 1995, \nspeech.\n  We expect President Samper and the Colombian Government to fulfill \ntheir promises, and we will judge Colombia by their own standards.\n  I do not see how we can accept a national policy that fails to hold \nthe Colombian Government responsible for the poison they are allowing \nto be sent to our children, especially in the inner cities. I recognize \nthat Colombia's Government is not the only one at fault. However, \nColombia is the corporate headquarters for the booming international \ndrug trade.\n  How can we ask our local police and our Federal law enforcement \nagencies to continue a tough fight--including risking their lives--if \ntheir own national Government won't get tough with foreign governments \nprotecting the drug bosses?\n  I find this situation amazing, given that the Clinton\n   administration was prepared to sanction China for pirating video \ntapes and computer programs. Why is the United States prepared to \nsanction nations that harm U.S. businesses that allow the theft of \nintellectual property but is not prepared to take equally strong \nmeasures against a Government that allows the poisoning of our \nchildren?\n\n  Let me clearly state that I have no quarrel with the Colombian \npeople. There are many dedicated Colombians who risk their lives every \nday fighting the drug cartels. Colombian citizens have suffered more \nwanton violence from greedy drug lords than any people on Earth. My \nconcern is that the Colombian Government is not supporting these \ncourageous individuals.\n  Mr. President, here is just a brief review of Colombia' record:\n  No arrest of any significant member of the Cali drug cartel, which \naccounts for 80 percent of the cocaine shipped into the United States. \nThe brother of a major Cali cartel trafficker was arrested recently, \nbut there are many--including some law enforcement agencies--who doubt \nthat this person is a ``big fish.'' He may be a sacrifice by the drug \nlords to try to help the Colombian Government show resolve.\n  No significant steps have been taken to investigate or prosecute some \n15,000 drug corruption cases, including no serious investigations into \nallegations that Colombian President Samper's Presidential campaign \nreceived millions of dollars from the Cali cartel or into corruption of \nMembers of the Colombian Congress.\n  A plea-bargaining system that Colombia's own Justice Ministry \ncriticized for its lenient use, noting that nearly 40 percent of \nconvicted drug traffickers have been freed on parole, without serving a \nday in prison. According to Colombia's Chief Prosecutor, ``the system \nresults in virtual impunity.''\n  Mr. President, the American people have every right to expect full \ncooperation in the ``drug war'' so long as our youth are being poisoned \nby Colombian cocaine. Countries that produce drugs should be put on \nnotice that the United States will not look the other way.\n  William J. Bennett, former U.S. ``drug czar,'' and I jointly prepared \nan op-ed piece for yesterday's Wall Street Journal in which we \nasserted:\n\n       The Colombian leaders must be sent a clear and unmistakable \n     message: In the war on drugs, they can either continue to \n     ally themselves with the [drug] cartels, and thereby become a \n     pariah state like Libya and Iran; or they can return to the \n     community of civilized nations, fulfill the promises \n     President Samper made, and join with the U.S. in an effort to \n     put the cartels out of business. The choice is theirs.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Bennett-Helms Wall \nStreet Journal op-ed piece, along with President Samper's July 15, \n1994, letter to Senator Helms and his February 6, 1995, counterdrug \nspeech, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of The Narcotics \nNational Emergency Sanctions Act of 1995 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 681\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Narcotics National Emergency \n     Sanctions Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cocaine is the primary drug threat to the United \n     States, and heroin poses an increasingly serious drug threat \n     to the United States.\n       (2) Colombia is the ``corporate headquarters'' for the \n     international cartels responsible for the production and \n     distribution of at least 80 percent of the cocaine that \n     enters the United States.\n       (3) Colombia is the primary producer of heroin in the \n     Western Hemisphere and is a significant cultivator of \n     marijuana.\n       (4) Courageous and dedicated Colombians risk their lives \n     every day in order to fight drug traffickers, and these \n     Colombians deserve the support of the United States and of \n     the Government of Colombia.\n       (5) The Government of Colombia did not take significant \n     actions in 1994 to dismantle drug cartels in Colombia, \n     capture drug kingpins, or reverse the influence of drug-\n     related corruption on the political system of Colombia.\n       (6) The lack of achievement of the Government of Colombia \n     in 1994 in its efforts against drugs raises significant \n     questions as to whether the Colombian people presently \n     receive the support of that government in such efforts.\n       (7) The political and judicial systems of Colombia are \n     plagued by drug-related corruption, including an ineffective \n     plea-bargaining system that leaves law-abiding citizens \n     virtually unprotected against crime.\n       (8) The plea-bargaining system in Colombia is so \n     ineffective that at least 33 percent of the convictions for \n     drug-related crimes do not result in imprisonment.\n       (9) The Prosecutor General of Colombia has stated that the \n     judicial process in Colombia system ``results in virtual \n     impunity [for drug traffickers]''.\n     [[Page S5226]]   (10) Colombia is a significant center for \n     money-laundering activities, and, as a result, the financial \n     system of Colombia is inundated with illegal monies.\n       (11) Despite repeated assurances it considers the war \n     against drugs to be a ``moral imperative'' and a ``matter of \n     national security'' requiring ``an all out effort, without \n     limits,'' the Government of Colombia has failed to keep \n     specific commitments made on July 15, 1994 by President-elect \n     Samper that Colombia would--\n       (A) devote law enforcement resources, including creating an \n     elite corps of investigators, to the investigation, \n     apprehension, arrest, prosecution, and imprisonment of major \n     drug traffickers and their accomplices, including political \n     allies;\n       (B) rapidly reform the penal code of Colombia, including \n     increasing penalties for drug traffickers, closing loopholes \n     in the plea bargain system, and strengthening anti-corruption \n     and money-laundering laws; and\n       (C) participate in the creation of an anti-narcotics force \n     for Caribbean Basin countries and the implementation of a \n     global export monitoring system for precursor chemicals.\n       (12) Evidence suggests that the influence of drug kingpins \n     reaches the Congress of Colombia and the Office of the \n     President of Colombia.\n       (13) The Government of Colombia has not taken any \n     significant steps to investigate or prosecute cases of drug-\n     related corruption, nor has that government undertaken a \n     meaningful investigation into allegations that the campaign \n     treasury of President Samper received millions of dollars \n     from the Cali cartel or into allegations of extensive \n     corruption in the Congress of Colombia.\n       (14) The Government of Colombia has not demonstrated the \n     political will to move against major drug traffickers in \n     Colombia, and President Samper has not used his considerable \n     public influence to build political support for direct, \n     effective action against drug kingpins and the scourge of \n     drugs in Colombia.\n       (15) The Government of Colombia has not arrested or \n     imprisoned any significant member of the Cali drug cartel, a \n     cartel which accounts for at least 80 percent of the cocaine \n     that is shipped into the United States.\n       (16) Colombia has in effect laws to address drugs and drug-\n     related corruption in a meaningful manner, but the Government \n     of Colombia does not enforce such laws.\n       (17) The democratically-elected Government of Colombia is \n     being subjugated to the interests of drug traffickers in \n     Colombia.\n       (18) On February 6, 1995, the President of Colombia \n     outlined a program of the Government of Colombia called the \n     ``Program of the War Against Illicit Drugs''.\n       (19) In promising to pursue the program, the President of \n     Colombia stated that Colombia ``will continue fighting \n     [narcotics] because we are convinced that the struggle \n     against this serious scourge is a moral imperative, a \n     response to a public health problem, and, most of all, an \n     issue of national security.''\n\n     SEC. 3.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate committees of congress.--The term \n     ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Drug.--The term ``drug'' refers to any substance that, \n     if subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, would be \n     a controlled substance within the meaning of section 102(6) \n     of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(6)).\n       (3) Drug trafficker.--The term ``drug trafficker'' means \n     any person who transports, transfers, or otherwise disposes \n     of illegal drugs, to another, as consideration for anything \n     of value, or makes or obtains control of illegal drugs with \n     the intent to so transport, transfer, or dispose of.\n       (4) Multilateral development banks.--The term \n     ``multilateral development banks'' includes the International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \n     Development Association, and the Inter-American Development \n     Bank.\n                                                                    ____\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 4, 1995]\n\n            Colombia, America's Favorite ``Narco-Democracy''\n\n                (By William J. Bennett and Jesse Helms)\n\n       The deluge of illegal drugs flooding into the U.S. has \n     become one of the principal threats to our national security. \n     More Americans die each year from the use of cocaine, heroin \n     and other illegal drugs than from international terrorism. \n     Yet, while the Clinton administration has rightly maintained \n     a tough line with Libya, Iran and other governments known to \n     be sponsoring terrorism, it has let Colombia--which ships \n     more cocaine into the U.S. than any other country--completely \n     off the hook. It is time for the administration to stiffen \n     its spine and show some resolve in its anti-drug efforts.\n       The administration's recent annual review of international \n     cooperation on counter-drug efforts by major drug-producing \n     and trafficking countries is instructive. Under this review, \n     countries that fail to meet certain minimum standards of \n     performance in combating drug trafficking are supposed to be \n     denied U.S. aid. The Clinton administration acknowledged in \n     its report that Colombia has indeed failed to meet minimum \n     standards, yet, amazingly, granted Colombia a ``national \n     interest waiver'' allowing U.S. aid to flow into Colombia \n     despite its miserable record.\n       This is a grave moral and geopolitical mistake. All \n     available evidence clearly indicates Colombia has totally \n     capitulated to the drug lords. By extending certification to \n     Colombia, despite overwhelming evidence that its government \n     is rife with narco-corruption, the Clinton administration has \n     sent a troubling signal to all drug-producing nations: The \n     U.S. will impose no penalty for collusion in trafficking with \n     the drug lords.\n       Colombia is no borderline case. It has indisputably become \n     a ``narco-democracy''--a country with a facade of democratic \n     government that is effectively controlled by drug kingpins \n     who manipulate the political establishment with cocaine \n     money. According to the administration's own background \n     papers on Colombia:\n       The Cali cartel has been left free by the Colombian \n     government to exploit the banking system and launder vast \n     sums of drug money with impunity.\n       [[Page S5228]] There is practically no effective \n     investigation or prosecution of the more than 15,000 current \n     cases of corruption involving government officials (more than \n     half of them senior-level authorities).\n       A ``guilt-laundering'' system exists, in which Cali drug \n     lords surrender, and submit to a jerry-rigged plea-bargaining \n     system that leaves their assets intact and allows them to \n     plead to minor charges.\n       The government's eradication programs have been half-\n     hearted at best, despite massive increases in the growing of \n     opium and new cocaine cultivation.\n       High-level government collusion enables the shipment of \n     enormous quantities of cocaine into the U.S., with 727 jets \n     transiting in Mexico with tons of the drug.\n       There is evidence of the corruption of many members of the \n     Colombian Congress, and increasing evidence of presidential \n     ties to the drug cartels.\n       The Clinton administration cannot plead ignorance as the \n     excuse for its abdication of responsibility. But conditions \n     in Colombia are in fact worse than even the administration's \n     report acknowledges. The influence of the cartels and their \n     blood money pervades almost all aspects of Columbia's \n     political, social and economic life. Cartel money finances \n     political campaigns. It silences journalists. It buys judges. \n     It infiltrates virtually every major business activity in \n     Columbia--from cut flowers, to oil, to paper, to banking.\n       Colombia is now the primary base for the cartels to extend \n     their drug operations throughout the hemisphere. Despite the \n     fact that the Cali cartel now supplies more than 80% of all \n     the cocaine entering the U.S., the Colombian government has \n     failed to arrest or prosecute even one significant cartel \n     member. To the contrary, Colombia has given the cartel cover \n     and protection from international extradition, allowing these \n     drugs to end up on American streets and in American schools, \n     where they destroy the lives of American children.\n       We believe the Colombian government collusion with the drug \n     lords poses a direct threat to the national security of the \n     U.S. It is time to meet this threat head-on. And since the \n     Clinton administration has failed to provide leadership on \n     this issue, it is all the more important that Congress assume \n     responsibility. That is why a Senate Foreign Relations \n     subcommittee will hold a hearing today on the issue. And why \n     legislation will be introduced this week to cut off all \n     economic support, trade benefits, and military assistance to \n     Colombia by Feb. 6, 1996, unless the president of the United \n     States can certify that Colombian President Ernesto Samper \n     has implemented the reform agenda he promised the U.S. \n     Congress he would enact.\n       Elements of this agenda include investigating the financing \n     by drug traffickers of political parties and candidates in \n     Colombia; putting law enforcement resources behind \n     investigating, capturing, convicting and imprisoning major \n     drug lords in Colombia; ending the ``guilt-laundering'' \n     system; confiscating assets of cartel leaders; and destroying \n     44,000 hectares (108,680 acres) of coca and poppy plants in \n     Colombia by Jan. 1, 1996 (and all remaining acreage by Jan. \n     1, 1997).\n       The Colombian leaders must be sent a clear and unmistakable \n     message: In the war on drugs, they can either continue to \n     ally themselves with the cartels, and thereby become a pariah \n     state like Libya and Iran; or they can return to the \n     community of civilized nations, fulfill the promises \n     President Samper made, and join with the U.S. in an effort to \n     put the cartels out of business. The choice is theirs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    July 15, 1994.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Ranking Committee on Foreign Relations, Senate Dirksen Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: Next month I will assume the Presidency \n     of Colombia at a very important time in the relations between \n     our two countries and in our common struggle against drug \n     trafficking. I am well aware of your dedication and interest \n     in this issue and I appreciate your efforts in support of \n     Colombia. As I prepare my administration for the challenges \n     which lie ahead, I wanted to take this opportunity to share \n     with you my views about the ways we can strengthen our fight \n     against drug trafficking.\n       I know, in a very personal way, the kind of threat \n     drugtraffickers represent to our democracies. The four \n     bullets still lodged in my body are a constant reminder of \n     the 1989 Cartel attempt to assassinate me at Bogota \n     International Airport. I was lucky, unlike many of my \n     compatriots who have fallen victim of the brutal violence the \n     cartels have wreaked in my country.\n       Once again, we are the target of their diabolic \n     machinations. The taping of telephone conversations between a \n     Cali Cartel leader and a journalist known to be on the \n     Cartel's payroll revealed their frustrated efforts to \n     infiltrate the campaign organizations of Colombian \n     presidential candidates.\n       I was perfectly aware of this threat when I entered the \n     Presidential race. That is why I established an independent \n     moral ombudsman in my campaign. That is why my campaign books \n     and records have always been open to public scrutiny. I also \n     expelled several sympathizers when it became evident that \n     they were not up to our rigid ethical standards. We rejected \n     several contributions because of their unclear or obscure \n     origin. That is why I am completely confident that my \n     campaign was successful in rejecting drug traffickers \n     undercover efforts to spread their corrupting influence. \n     Nevertheless, I have called for a special investigation to\n      carefully examine all of these issues and will take further \n     action as needed to protect the integrity of my \n     government.\n       Those who thought that the drug war was over with the \n     destruction of Pablo Escobar's organization were wrong. We \n     are entering what could be the last but decisive phase of the \n     drug war. The Cartels know that their campaign of terror and \n     intimidation has failed. Nevertheless, they will try to \n     regain the ground lost during the past years. The Cali Cartel \n     will rely on powerful weapons of choice: violence and fear, \n     bank accounts, legal loopholes, computer networks and \n     corruption.\n       Today, the task is much more complex and the international \n     community has to readjust its strategy, sharpen its skills \n     and develop new legal and institutional tools. Starting on \n     the day of my inauguration, I will aggressively seek to \n     secure the tools we will need to win, both at home and \n     abroad. I invite the United States to join Colombia in \n     leading this effort.\n       First, we will continue doing what we have done \n     successfully: vigorously applying all our law enforcement \n     resources to investigate, track and put in jail the drug \n     lords and their accomplices. We know who the bosses of the \n     Cali Cartel are and we will capture them. To achieve that \n     goal we need a continuous commitment from the U.S. in terms \n     of technical support, training, intelligence and evidence \n     sharing. We must establish a high-level bilateral commission \n     to permanently evaluate our cooperation, improve its \n     performance and promptly overcome any problem or obstacle.\n       My administration will accelerate the reform of Colombia's \n     penal code, increasing the penalties for drug traffickers and \n     removing the loopholes in our plea-bargaining system. We will \n     not tolerate leniency.\n       Drug traffickers failed in taking over our democracy \n     through terrorism and assassination. Now they want to destroy \n     it through infiltration and corruption. They will not \n     succeed. An ``elite corp'' of investigators will be created \n     to track down corruption and send the political cronies of \n     the cartels to jail and we will present to Colombia's \n     Congress stringent anti-corruption legislation. Additionally, \n     we will introduce new legislation to strengthen our laws \n     against money-laundering, that should be enforced with the \n     support of a U.S.-Colombian financial crime task force, \n     conformed by our best prosecutors and experts.\n       Equally important, we will urge the U.S. Congress to \n     establish mandatory targets for the reduction of domestic \n     drug consumption and to provide the resources needed to \n     achieve those targets.\n       Our two countries cannot solely bear the burden of the \n     global war on drugs. Consequently, my administration will \n     work towards the enactment of the following initiatives:\n       The creation of a Caribbean Basin multilateral anti-\n     narcotics force.\n       Joining current radar capabilities in a Hemispheric network \n     to track trafficking activities.\n       The implementation of a global export monitoring system to \n     impose strict controls on the flows of precursor chemicals, \n     crucial to drug production, as well as assault and automatic \n     weapons used by cartel hitmen.\n       The adoption of a new Inter-American convention to ban \n     financial safe havens in the hemisphere. Drug Traffickers \n     cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of their ill-gotten \n     gains.\n       These are concrete initiatives I will launch August 7th, \n     the day of my inauguration. I hope the United States will \n     choose to help Colombia win the drug war instead of being \n     paralyzed by the drug lords' disinformation campaign. I \n     invite the United States to redouble its faith in the \n     determination and courage of Colombians by joining us again \n     in the difficult battles that lie ahead.\n       My administration looks forward to working with you on \n     these issues and others of interest to both our countries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Ernesto Samper-Pizano,\n     President-elect of Colombia.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Speech by Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of Colombia, at the \n Presentation of the Policy Against Drugs, Santafe de Bogota, February \n                                6, 1995\n\n       I wish to take the opportunity, on the occasion of the \n     appointment of the Manger of the Illicit Crops Alternative \n     Development Plan, to outline the Program of the War Against \n     Illicit Drugs that my Administration will carry out in the \n     years ahead. At the same time, I also wish to inform you \n     about what we have already achieved in the first few months \n     of my Administration.\n       Colombia has been seriously engaged for several years in \n     the war against drug trafficking. Many of our countrymen have \n     fallen in this battle, and the economic price we have had to \n     pay has been very high, requiring us to postpone other \n     important needs and make great sacrifices.\n       We are fighting this battle and we will continue fighting \n     because we are convinced that the struggle against this \n     serious scourge is a moral imperative, a response to a public \n     health problem, and, most of all, an issue of national \n     security.\n                   [[Page S5229]] an integrated policy\n\n       The challenge posed by drug traffickers demands an \n     integrated policy. We cannot continue in a cycle of action \n     and reactions. This leads to doubt and uncertainty about the \n     effectiveness of what we are doing. My Government is \n     committed to an integrated policy that will be led and \n     supervised directly by the President of the Republic.\n       The new policy's components are as follows:\n\n                          1. Crop eradication\n\n       Unfortunately, Colombia has become a coca producing \n     country: 14 percent of the land under coca cultivation \n     worldwide is in our country.\n       Between 1993 and 1994, the number of hectares under \n     cultivation increased 13 percent.\n       We will eradicate the coca and poppy crops. We will take \n     advantage of the fact that most of these crops are grown for \n     commercial reasons and are not for traditional use, as in \n     other neighboring countries.\n       We have begun ``Operation Radiance'' that will destroy all \n     existing illicit crops in the country in the next two years. \n     The target for this year is 44,000 hectares.\n       The Government will be especially careful to ensure that \n     these operations cause the least adverse social and \n     environmental impact.\n       Those who criticize spraying operations often forget that \n     the worst ecological damage is being caused by those who are \n     destroying our natural reserves to grow illicit drugs. Two \n     and a half hectares of forest are destroyed in order to plant \n     one hectare of illicit crop, at the expense of approximately \n     180,000 hectares each year. If production continues like \n     this, according to U.N. calculations, before the end of the \n     century Colombia will have lost one-third of its tropical \n     rain forest.\n\n                    2. Alternative development plan\n\n       The objective of the Alternative Development Plan that we \n     are announcing today is to provide an alternative means of \n     living for the 300,000 small coca growers.\n       And, simultaneously to develop preventive programs in other \n     areas of the country which are abandoned and could become \n     areas for producing new crops. We do not want confrontations \n     to happen again like the ones in Guaviare and Putumayo last \n     year.\n       I have requested the Solidarity Network to institute \n     programs in the most sensitive areas so that government \n     programs will begin work before the drug traffickers arrive.\n       The Plan will provide better roads, health, education and \n     working conditions to small farmers in isolated areas.\n       Likewise, with the assistance of government programs, the \n     trading and marketing of substitute crops will begin.\n       The Plan will duplicate substitution programs that have \n     been successful in other places.\n       In order to finance this ambitious crop substitution \n     program, we have a US$150 million budget which we hope to \n     double with international assistance.\n       My goal is to eliminate all illicit crops by the end of my \n     term in office.\n\n                   3. Industrial production of drugs\n\n       In addition to coca cultivation, we are also a drug \n     producing country. To eliminate production, we will attack \n     the infrastructure used for the processing of drugs, such as \n     laboratories, importation of processing chemicals, and \n     vehicles used to transport drugs.\n       With the use of the reinstalled radar system in the South, \n     we will interdict the entry of coca paste, the essential raw \n     material for the production of cocaine.\n\n                            4. Distribution\n\n       Colombia will take strong actions to destroy the internal \n     systems for the distribution and export of drugs through the \n     following programs:\n       Investment in technology to improve the control capacity of \n     airports, waterways and seaports.\n       Build a coast guard base on San Andres Island with \n     resources already allocated in the 1995 and 1996 budgets, \n     that will control all air and sea traffic arriving and \n     departing from the island.\n       Improve the airplane interception system through the \n     purchase of detectors, aerial platforms, and electronic \n     intelligence gathering equipment.\n\n                          5. Money laundering\n\n       Recent estimates show that profits from drug trafficking \n     can reach nearly US$500 billion a year, which is ten times \n     Colombia's gross national product.\n       Most of these funds are ``laundered'' through world \n     financial markets. It is very important that controls be \n     established in each country as well as at the international \n     level.\n       If we allow the income produced by drugs, 75 percent of \n     which is held in international financial centers, to be \n     ``recycled'' into legitimate business, we will never be able \n     to end drug trafficking.\n       At the hemispheric summit called by President Clinton and \n     held in Miami, Colombia suggested that the countries of the \n     region hold a convention to consider a War against Money \n     Laundering. This initiative was received with enthusiasm. The \n     organizational details of this convention will be spelled out \n     during the first quarter of 1995.\n       On the domestic front, with the support of the Attorney \n     General's Office, the Banking Superintendency, the DIAN (tax \n     and national customs department), and the Stock Market \n     Superintendency, we will act more forcefully to confiscate \n     profits from illicit enrichment. We have already proposed \n     changes in the law to give my Government the necessary powers \n     to carry this out.\n\n                  6. The rise of domestic consumption\n\n       Colombia is at risk of becoming a drug consuming country, \n     according to the figures during the last few years.\n       We will strongly fight against any increase in drug use, \n     particularly among our youth.\n       The Government's action in this regard will be directed at \n     drug prevention, rehabilitation, special attention to \n     individuals that are vulnerable to becoming drug users, and a \n     massive education effort through the media and education \n     centers, under the coordination of the Youth Vice-Ministry, \n     on the harmful effects of drug use.\n            7. Law enforcement and administration of justice\n\n       The ``Surrender to Justice'' policy has become an open door \n     to impunity because of inadequate convictions and sentencing \n     by certain judges and prosecutors.\n       Its implementation included minimum sentences and granted \n     maximum benefits.\n       We are going to reformulate the policy, so that turning \n     oneself in is no longer perceived as a way to avoid \n     prosecution.\n       We know that criminals will not turn themselves in if we do \n     not maintain pressure on them. We will pursue them until \n     either we catch them or they surrender.\n       We are convinced that the new policy, with international \n     judicial cooperation, will enable us to successfully fight \n     against criminal cartels.\n\n                  8. Changes in justice administration\n\n       Those who think that all these changes require basic reform \n     of our justice system are right. The battle against drugs \n     must be fought within the rule of law. With our current weak \n     judicial system and inefficient criminal policy, we will not \n     be able to subject organized crime to the laws and justice of \n     the State.\n       A Justice Department Plan, with allocations of around $500 \n     million, will make the administration of justice more \n     effective.\n       It is the intention of my Government to modernize the \n     justice system to include a new program to find ways to \n     defeat organized crime, especially kidnappers and drug \n     cartels.\n\n                       9. Prosecution of cartels\n\n       The Government has the clear intention to pursue, \n     apprehend, prosecute, and convict drug traffickers. We are \n     actively working to achieve this goal as soon as possible. To \n     obtain it, we will improve our intelligence gathering \n     capabilities against drug cartels with technical assistance \n     from various foreign governments, starting, of course, with \n     help from the Government of the United States.\n\n                    10. International responsibility\n\n       It is clear that our objectives cannot be fulfilled \n     entirely without more help and support from the international \n     community. Colombia's efforts will have little impact on \n     international narco-trafficking--\n       If the rising levels of consumption do not decrease;\n       If the control of air and sea traffic is not intensified;\n       If progress is not made to control international money \n     laundering activities; and,\n       If the sale of precursor chemicals is not reduced.\n       Colombia will be alert to the international achievements on \n     each of these issues while maintaining its own responsibility \n     to combat the drug problem.\n       It is not a matter of unloading one's responsibility onto \n     others. It is simply a matter of understanding that the \n     complexity and seriousness of the drug trafficking problem \n     are so extensive that its solution requires EVERYONE'S \n     PARTICIPATION, with no exceptions nor excuses.\n\n\n                                results\n\n       Now let me review the results obtained in the first few \n     months since we began this integrated program.\n       During the first months of my Administration, until \n     December 1994:\n       1. 6,950 hectares of illicit crops were eradicated, double \n     the amount from the same period last year.\n       2. 18,416 kilos of cocaine were seized, an increase of 428% \n     compared to the same period last year.\n       3. 20,200 kilos of coca paste was seized, 782% more than \n     the same period the year before.\n       4. 194 cocaine laboratories were destroyed.\n       5. 530,000 gallons of fluid and 213,000 kilos of solid \n     chemical precursors were seized, up from 219,000 gallons and \n     108,000 kilos seized the previous year.\n       6. 940 people linked to drug trafficking activities were \n     arrested, of them 59 were foreigners and 5 were extradited.\n       7. Special Joint Command operations, whose basic \n     responsibility is to pursue the heads of the drug trafficking \n     cartels, were doubled.\n       It is clear that these statistics indicate progress in the \n     eradication, capture, and interdiction campaign that we \n     expect to continue.\n       More than that, during the first six months of my \n     Government:\n       1. A disciplinary emergency was declared for the City of \n     Cali police. More than half of the officers were dismissed.\n       2. The National Police Anti-Corruption Unit was created.\n       [[Page S5230]] 3. The United Nations Convention Against \n     Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances \n     was ratified.\n       4. Thanks to the action of the National Government and the \n     cooperation of the political parties, we were able to defeat \n     a legislative proposal that would have greatly weakened the \n     legal barriers to illicit enrichment.\n       5. Money laundering was classified as a crime and national \n     legislation has been drafted and submitted to Congress as \n     part of the anti-corruption statute, which will soon be \n     passed by Congress.\n       6. A budget of $150 million per year was allocated for the \n     next three years for the Alternative Development Plan we are \n     presenting today.\n       7. The Attorney General's Office was reorganized to make it \n     more effective in the fight against drug trafficking.\n       8. The Security Administration Department (DAS) was \n     reorganized in order to improve the professional capabilities \n     to combat organized crime.\n       9. Prison Emergency was declared in order to control highly \n     dangerous prisoners, to clean up the areas surrounding \n     maximum security prisons, and to improve performance of \n     prison guards.\n       10. The Surrender to Justice Policy Study Commission was \n     created by decree No. 159, 1995, in order to study and report \n     on sentences and benefits adjustments, as well as to suggest \n     any other reforms to the policy by March 6.\n\n\n                              CONCLUSIONS\n\n       The Government of Colombia has been active for several \n     years in the struggle against drug trafficking.\n       My Government reiterates its commitment to continue our \n     efforts as I have described above.\n       The country has an excellent team to undertake this program \n     including: The Attorney General of the Nation, the Ministers \n     of Defense and Justice, as well as the DAS Director and the \n     National Police Director, who have been working coherently \n     and effectively since the beginning of my Administration in \n     this struggle against drugs.\n       In the development of this program, Colombia has had the \n     cooperation of several foreign governments among them the \n     U.S. Government.\n       We trust that the policies and the facts presented here, \n     together with the achievements of my predecessor's \n     government, will renew the confidence that has characterized \n     the relations between our two countries over the years.\n       Anything other than a strong bilateral relationship based \n     on confidence would weaken the joint efforts we have \n     undertaken and would only benefit the drug cartels' \n     interests.\n       Colombia accepts international cooperation to achieve its \n     anti-drug objectives, but only after acknowledgment of its \n     sovereign right to formulate this policy on its own.\n       Over the years, during many administrations, we have never \n     accepted any type of conditions from abroad.\n       I am optimistic that in the near future we will defeat the \n     scourge of narco-trafficking.\n       The Colombian people deserve a better international image \n     than that created by organized crime.\n       We deserve to be known as a country that respects the law.\n       We deserve to be judged on the basis of the majority of our \n     hard working citizens who love their country, who fight for \n     its progress, and who desire to leave their children the \n     possibility of a life led with dignity.\n       To achieve this, we all have to make a commitment to fight \n     against violence, beginning with narco-trafficking, which has \n     plagued us like a curse.\n       We do not want any more heroes or martyrs buried in our \n     cemeteries. Therefore, we must and we will bring crime and \n     violence under control.\n       As President, I am sure that this would have been the wish \n     of the four presidential candidates, the 23 magistrates, the \n     63 journalists, and the three thousand policemen who in the \n     last ten years lost their lives fighting narco-trafficking.\n       In their memory we will overcome future difficulties. We \n     are working very hard on this problem and we will continue to \n     do so.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there are any number of reasons, from the \nmassive amount of cocaine entering the United States from Colombia, to \nthe rise in high school drug use over the past 2 years, that I could \nrely on to explain my decision to cosponsor the Narcotics National \nEmergency Sanctions Act [NNESA]. The poor performance of Colombia's \ngovernment in interrupting the flow of heroin, marijuana, and cocaine \nthat originates or is processed in Colombia, would be justification \nenough for the extraordinary measures created by the NNESA. Above all, \nhowever, I am moved by the rank corruption the drug trade has spawned \nin Colombia and the colossal abuse of public trust by officials who \nally themselves with criminals rather than the people they serve.\n  Colombia's government institutions, including the courts, the \nCongress, and the highest levels of the executive, have been penetrated \nby the influence of narcotics traffickers. Not surprisingly, in 1994, \nColombia failed to meet minimum standards of performance in combating \ndrug trafficking. The Clinton administration responded by granting a \nnational interest waiver. Although it is possible to imagine \ncircumstances in which a national interest waiver might be justified, \nColombia is not such a case.\n  Colombia deserves to be taken out of the normal narcotics cooperation \ncertification process because it is in a league of its own. We do not \nseek to penalize Colombia unnecessarily, or to impose an arbitrary \nstandard. The NNESA responds directly to public commitments President \nSamper has repeatedly made to improve Colombia's anti-narcotics \nperformance.\n  Unfortunately, the Clinton administration itself has sent mixed \nsignals about its commitment to the fight against illegal drugs. \nEnforcement of drug laws enjoys low priority at the Justice Department \nwhere Federal mandatory minimum prison terms are criticized as too \nharsh. Nationwide, Federal prosecutions of narcotics-related crimes \nhave dropped dramatically since 1992. Colombia and Peru were refused \nintelligence information crucial to the interdiction of narcotics \nflights for several months in 1994. Although later overturned, the \ndecision to cut off intelligence sharing dealt a severe blow to \ncounter-drug efforts and broadcast the administration's ambivalence \nabout the drug war. Overall, international interdiction efforts receive \nlittle support and dwindling resources in spite of efforts by some \nofficials to protect this indispensable function.\n  The Clinton White House must restore anti-narcotics policy to the top \npriority status it has enjoyed under previous administrations. It can \nstart by endorsing the NNESA and sending an unambiguous message to \nColombia: the United States has no national interest in cooperating \nwith any government that colludes with drug traffickers.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FORD:\n  S. 682. A bill to provide for the certification by the Federal \nAviation Administration of airports serving commuter air carriers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                  commuter airport safety legislation\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwill provide authority for the Federal Aviation Administration to issue \nsafety certificates to airports serving commuter aircraft of 10 or more \npassenger seats. The FAA's authority to issue airport certificates is \ncurrently limited to airports serving air carrier aircraft with more \nthan 30 passenger seats. This legislation is a result of a recent study \nof commuter airline safety conducted by the National Transportation \nSafety Board, which led the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a \nseries of recommendations. The legislation I am proposing today \ncompliments that regulatory effort by providing specific authority for \nthe Federal Aviation Administrator to insure the safety of commuter \nairports. Safety improvements called for by new airport certification \nrequirements will be eligible for grant funding consideration under the \nFAA's Airport Improvement Program.\n  This legislation will not mandate the issuance of airport \ncertificates to commuter airports. It will only provide general \nauthority pursuant to which the FAA Administrator may promulgate \nappropriate regulatory standards. To do so, the FAA will need to issue \na proposed regulation that will undergo a public comment process before \nany final regulation will be issued as they do with any other safety \nregulation.\n  I am aware of a serious sense within the airport community with this \nnew FAA authority. I would urge the FAA to initiate a negotiated \nprocess with the airport community which has been successful in the \npast. I understand the FAA is currently organizing a working group of \naffected aviation groups to assist in defining potential costs and \nreasonable certification requirements. I would urge the FAA to work \nwith the industry as the goal of all concerned is safety.\n   [[Page S5231]] FAA is often criticized for the tombstone mentality \nin that safety regulations are often the result of major accidents. The \nnew authority in this legislation is proactive in nature. This \nlegislation will put in place reasonable safety standards to protect \ncommuter airline passengers before there are any fatalities. Let us not \nwait until an accident to justify the need for safety improvements. I \ncommend the leadership at the FAA--David Hinson, Administrator and \nLinda Daschle, Deputy Administrator for this change in attitude. It is \nrefreshing that FAA is looking forward instead of backward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       Section 44706(a)(1) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) that serves any scheduled passenger operation of an \n     air carrier aircraft designed for more than 9 passenger seats \n     or any unscheduled passenger operation of an air carrier \n     aircraft designed for more than 30 passenger seats;''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Brown, Mr. Inhofe, \n        and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 683. A bill to protect and enforce the equal privileges and \nimmunities of citizens of the United States and the constitutional \nrights of the people to choose Senators and Representatives in \nCongress; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                    electoral rights enforcement act\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a strong supporter of congressional term \nlimits and one who has promised voluntarily to limit my own tenure in \nCongress, I am today introducing a bill that would allow States to set \ntheir own limits.\n  The American people have spoken. Approximately 80 percent of them \nsupport term limits. Measures limiting congressional service have been \npassed in one form or another in 22 States. This Congress needs to \nrestore the faith of a wary American public in its Federal Government \nby addressing this issue.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today would recognize the \nrights of the States to place term limits on their elected officials. \nSome may view this statute as redundant because the States already have \nthe right to impose term limits on their Members of Congress. But a \nlegal challenge by term-limit opponents is currently under \nconsideration by the Supreme Court.\n  This legislation is designed to insulate State-imposed term limits \nfrom court challenges. It is based on section 5 of the 14th amendment, \nwhich lets Congress enforce the rights to due process and equal \nprotection of the laws. To enhance fair and open competition for \nelective offices and promote effective representative government, \nStates should be allowed to limit congressional terms. The legislation \nis also based on other rights afforded in other amendments to the \nConstitution.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this bill would restore the power to the \nAmerican people to set the limits they prefer, without congressional \ninterference. This Congress has already acknowledged that many of the \nimportant decisions about how this country is run should be left to the \nStates. I believe that our citizens should determine whether and how to \nimpose limits on their congressional representatives.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nmeasure.\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. \nAkaka] was added as

himself, Mr. Nunn, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Cochran, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \nFrist, and Mr. Rockefeller) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 103\n\n       Whereas young people will be the stewards of our \n     communities, nation, and world in critical times, and the \n     present and future well-being of society requires an \n     involved, caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas concerns about the character training of children \n     have taken on a new sense of urgency as violence by and \n     against youth threatens the physical and psychological well-\n     being of the United States;\n       Whereas, more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families, their communities, \n     and institutions such as schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of the individual citizens comprising the nation;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character, and that character \n     counts in personal relationships, in school, and in the \n     workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by youth-influencing \n     institutions and individuals to help young people develop the \n     essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas character development is, first and foremost, an \n     obligation of families, efforts by religious institutions, \n     schools, and youth, civic, and human service organizations \n     also play a very important role in supporting family efforts \n     by fostering and promoting good character;\n       Whereas the Senate encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the valuable role \n     youth in the United States play in the present and future of \n     the United States, and to recognize that character plays an \n     important role in the future of the United States;\n       Whereas, in July 1992, the Aspen Declaration was written by \n     an eminent group of educators, youth leaders, and ethics \n     scholars for the purpose of articulating a coherent framework \n     for character education appropriate to a diverse and \n     pluralistic society;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states that ``Effective \n     character education is based on core ethical values which \n     form the foundation of democratic society'';\n       Whereas the core ethical values identified by the Aspen \n     Declaration constitute the 6 core elements of character;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character are \n     trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, justice and \n     fairness, caring, and civic virtue and citizenship.\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character transcend \n     cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the Aspen declaration states that ``The character \n     and conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of \n     society; therefore, every adult has the responsibility to \n     teach and model the core ethical values and every social \n     institution has the responsibility to promote the development \n     of good character.'';\n       Whereas the Senate encourages individuals and \n     organizations, especially the individuals and organizations \n     that have an interest in the education and training of our \n     youth, to adopt the 6 core elements of character as intrinsic \n     to the well-being of individuals, communities, and society as \n     a whole; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages communities, especially \n     school and youth organizations, to integrate the 6 core \n     elements of character into programs serving students and \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate proclaims the week of October 15 \n     through October 21, 1995, as National Character Counts Weeks, \n     and requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     upon the people of the United States and interested groups to \n     embrace the 6 core elements of character and to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today in the City of Roswell, NM, the \nwater bills that are sent out by the utility companies has this on \nthem, and everyone will receive this as part of their water bill in \nthis city: ``Character counts. Trustworthiness. Tell the truth. Be \nsincere.''\n  One of the six pillars of character established by a broad-based \ncoalition some 2\\1/2\\ years ago, a broad-based group of Americans, was \ntrustworthiness. That means do not lie, be sincere, tell the truth--all \nthe basic things that we thought were part of the character of America.\n  In addition, five other pillars of character were determined to be \nthe essence--the essence--of the character of the United States in the \npast that we have lost and that we must get back. The remaining ones \nare respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship.\n  Today, on the floor of the Senate, a number of Senators have joined \nme in a Character Counts Coalition, which has in the U.S. Senate one \nprincipal objective; that is, the introduction and passage of a \nresolution which will set aside the week of October 15 through the 21 \nas ``National Character Counts Week.''\n  That resolution will be adopted by the Senate and the House, and it \nwill go out into the land--hopefully, the President will speak to it--\nand the budding, blooming, blossoming enthusiasm among the people to \nreinject into society these six pillars of character will, once again, \nget a spurt of support from us.\n  But far more important than the 10 Senators--five from each party: \nSenator Nunn joining me as vice chair, Senator Dodd, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Bennett, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nKempthorne and Senator Dorgan and Senator Frist, who is on the floor, \njoin me in this resolution.\n  What is going on out there in the country? First of all, Mr. \nPresident, I am very, very proud that the State of New Mexico is moving \ninto the forefront of States that are trying to build a broad-based \ncommunity support for these six pillars of character. I am very pleased \nto suggest that in New Mexico, there are now four cities that, with \ntheir school boards, are moving in harmony to make these six pillars of \ncharacter part of daily life, believe it or not, on a volunteer basis.\n  Public schools in the State of New Mexico are saying to their \nteachers, ``Let's make these six pillars of character part of our daily \ncurriculum.'' In fact, in the city of Albuquerque, 36 teachers have \nbeen trained so that they can begin to put into the curriculum of our \ngrade schools instruction, activities, examples of these six pillars of \ncharacter. As a matter of fact, there is sort of a model evolving out \nof New Mexico, wherein a public school will take one of these pillars \nof character by the month. And so in a month, it will be \ntrustworthiness month and the children will work on it with their \nteachers and the teachers will work among themselves to let \ntrustworthiness permeate the school and what it means truly counts. \nMaybe the next month they will do responsibility, and for a month \nresponsibility will permeate the classroom.\n  Now we are trying to go one step further, Mr. President, and let \nthese permeate the community, so that in each of our cities, there is a \nbroad-based council--all volunteers, from all walks of life and all \ninstitutions--who are building a format to get each of these pillars of \ncharacter to permeate the community in one way or another.\n  I just gave an example of this very interesting city, Roswell, which \nhas already decided to put the first of the pillars on their electric \nor water bills. I do not remember which. If I said water bill, let us \nstay with it. But essentially, everybody will receive in the mail at \nleast a little notice: ``Character counts. Trustworthiness. Tell the \ntruth. Be sincere.''\n  Think if this happens, if we are able to join the people of this \ncountry, the grassroots of this country in our cities and in our States \nto mobilize their enthusiasm to get this message across to our \nchildren, to our businessmen, to their employees, to those who take \ncare of our families or the families themselves, we may indeed--not \nthis Senator, and not the 10 who are joining on this resolution--but \nthose who had the idea to begin with and those who are working hard at \nit in the communities, this may turn into a huge chorus to be followed \nby actions to be followed by change, wherein maybe--maybe--society, \nwhich is yearning for something, will end up saying maybe it is we want \npeople to be responsible, maybe it is that we want our people to learn \nwhat fairness is, what respect is, what responsibility is, what caring \nis and, yes, in a broader concept of what citizenship is.\n  Now, frankly, in the State of New Mexico, the city of Albuquerque, we \nhave now put a major manual together which other cities are asking for \nas to how we did this.\n  Who got together and formed the counsel? How did the school board get \ninvolved? How are the schools reacting to it? Most of all, how are the \nparents \n[[Page S5233]] reacting to it? Is there any antagonism towards it? We \nwould like to say we have found none.\n  Who will stand up and say that it is not right that we put back into \nour schools the concept of trustworthiness or responsibility or caring \nor respect. Nobody yet has done that. We think that these words are \nacceptable to everyone.\n  Everyone knows they would like to see this back into the fabric of \nthis country. In my own State, the Governor has decided that Character \nCounts Will be a major effort of him and his wife in their term.\n  In the city of Albuquerque, I was joined by the mayor, and \nAlbuquerque has declared itself the character community. Soon they will \nput forth a public relations campaign, joined by the media, we hope, \nwhich will try to make this pervasive within the community of \nAlbuquerque.\n  Every city can do this, not because of the 10 Senators, and maybe 70, \nwho will join this resolution and help pass it, but because we are \nmerely supporting the effort which is budding among our people for \nsomething different in the classroom, something different on the street \ncorner, something different in our businesses. There is much enthusiasm \nfor this as one of those rare possibilities.\n  I do not claim to be either the inventor of this or the one that \ndreamt it up. What I am very proud of is that I saw it, and joined with \nother Senators to at least lend our support in the U.S. Congress to \ndesignating a week in our country when we thoroughly respect and help \npromote those in our country who are talking about the six pillars of \ncharacter, and that character counts.\n  I have a statement which quotes a number of columnists and \njournalists in my State, editorials of the major papers, placing \ngreater emphasis on common values that have served America so well. It \nis worth the extra effort that this will involve. There is no other \npractical way to make children safe and at the same time fight the \nviolence, drugs, disrespect for property rights and others, speaking of \nthis program of Character Counts, Albuquerque Journal.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nresolution submitted by my distinguished colleague Senator Domenici, \nSenate Resolution 103. This resolution, which would designate the week \nof October 15-21, 1995, as the second annual National Character Counts \nWeek.\n  Last year I joined with Senator Domenici and several of our other \ncolleagues in introducing similar legislation, and was very pleased \nthat the proposal was extremely well-received by my colleagues, as well \nas people in New Mexico, Georgia, and throughout our Nation. This \nresolution represents a renewal of that effort.\n  This group of our Senate colleagues has come together again this year \nto continue its recognition of the fact that our Nation is experiencing \na crisis of values. This crisis is reflected in the rising tide of \nviolence that kills little children in the cross-fire on school yards \nand in front of their houses, in the increasing number of children who \nkill each other and others. This crisis goes beyond crime. It is \nreflected, also, in the recent survey of youngsters conducted by the \nJosephson Institute of Ethics. These ordinary youngsters may never by \ninvolved in crime, drug abuse, or teenage pregnancy, but they still \nacknowledge disturbing ethical lapses: 2 out of 5 high school age boys \nand one in four girls have stolen something from a store; nearly two-\nthirds of all high school students and one-third of all college \nstudents had cheated on an exam, and more than one-third of males and \none-fifth of females aged 19-24 said they would lie to get a job and \nnearly one-fifth of college students had already done so in the last \nyear; 21 percent said they would falsify a report to keep a job.\n  As a character in John Steinbeck's novel ``Of Mice and Men'' \ncomplained, ``Nothing is wrong anymore.'' Unfortunately, a lot is \nwrong, and our society seems reluctant to admit the problem.\n  This is the core message of character counts, that there are core \nvalues that our society agrees on and that should guide our \ndecisionmaking. These values, as set out in the resolution, are \ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship. These values are supported by an extremely broad and \ndiverse coalition of people, including former Secretary of Education \nWilliam Bennett, former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, actor-producer \nTom Selleck, and Children's Defense Fund Founder Marian Wright Edelman. \nAmong our colleagues, Senators with such diverse political viewpoints \nas Senator Helms and Senator Boxer consponsored last year's resolution. \nI come before the Senate today on behalf of this group to urge \ncontinued attention to this important problem.\n  We must remember that all those children who are never taught the \nvalues of trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, \nand citizenship are future citizens.\n  This is a resolution considered by Members of the Senate and House in \nWashington, DC. But it is the parents, teachers, coaches, ministers, \nbig brothers and sisters in local communities who will lead the fight \nfor values in our Nation. As a result of the efforts by the character \ncounts coalition, people in all areas of the country are more aware of \nthe problems we face, and have begun to incorporate these values into \ntheir everyday lives and those of their children. Senator Domenici has \noutlined some of these efforts. This year, we introduce this resolution \nto remind the Senate that the work on this issue is far from over, and \nagain to enlist their support in reinstating these values to their \nproper places as fundamental to our society. I am proud to join my \ncolleagues, especially Senator Domenici, in this effort once again, and \nI urge the Senate to support this resolution.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  He has taken this time this morning to talk about a project that he \nand the senior Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn] initiated in the 103rd \nCongress, of which I was delighted to be a member. This is the program \ncalled character counts, whereby we are talking on the floor of the \nSenate and in our home States about the six pillars of character which \nthe Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Georgia have outlined, \nalong with others in the character counts coalition, others outside of \nGovernment. I will not review all of those details because they have \nbeen spread on the record, but I think it is appropriate for us to \npause for a moment and talk about the impact that we have had with this \neffort.\n  As I have talked about this in my own home State, the reaction has \nbeen: ``Why are you doing this? Why take the time to talk about \nsomething so much a cliche as character-- character counts for our \nkids. Well, everybody is for that. It is like the old cliche, truth, \njustice and the American way coming out of the comic book character. We \ndon't need to talk about that. Everybody agrees about that.''\n  And then, as I talk about it, some more people begin to realize that \nmaybe we do need to talk about it. Because bit by bit over the years, \nthe American commitment to individual character, the American \ncommitment to teaching individual character attributes to our children \nhas diminished, not by design but more by inertia.\n  If you watch the television today, that being our principal source of \nentertainment and information, you find that references to character \nare constantly being eroded. For the sake of today's television drama, \nwe glorify selfishness. For the sake of today's television action, we \nglorify someone who triumphs in a physical way out of a sense of \nselfishness, and cleverness and character and commitment and \ncooperation all seem to be disappearing.\n  What we have done with the character counts coalition is reintroduce \ninto the national dialog those aspects of character that we ought to be \ntalking about. Have we made a dramatic impact? No. Have we caused great \nnational consciousness to rise on these issues? No. But have we begun \nto turn over one little pebble at a time in the great national mosaic \nreferences to selfishness and self-glory and turn them over to become \nreferences to cooperation and character? Yes. Over time, that is the \nslow, steady process that will change the mosaic, that will change the \noverall look of the national scene.\n  So we are in this, I say to the Senator and to the Senate as a whole, \nfor the long term. We are in this to keep \n[[Page S5234]] this dialog going one stone at a time in the mosaic. \nWhen we view it in that fashion, I am very gratified by the progress we \nhave made since the last Congress. As we keep the dialog going, as we \nkeep the steady drumbeat going, we have hopes and, indeed, indication \nthat we are succeeding in quietly and slowly turning around this \ndebate.\n  So I hope that we can keep this up. I commend the Senator from New \nMexico for his diligence and his persistence, and that in some future \nCongress, people will look back and say, ``You know, it was slow and \nsteady, but ultimately those people determined to inject character \neducation into our national fabric have produced the long-term effects \nthat they were hoping for.''\n  Thus, Mr. President, I am delighted to be associated with this. I \npledge myself to stay in for the long term, the way the Senator from \nNew Mexico is in for the long term, and I have hope that in the long \nterm we will see the deterioration of character that has been going on \nin this country for so long begin to turn around and change and go in \nthe right direction.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership and pledge my myself to this \neffort.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n\n\n                         character is universal\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to speak just for a few moments on character.\n  Last year, this body passed a resolution that formally endorsed the \nsix character traits set forth in Aspen, CO, in 1992 by a group of \nscholars, educators, and youth advocates.\n  People with different backgrounds came together in Aspen in search of \nconsensus on character. Despite their differences, they found that all \ncould agree on those values of trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship.\n  Mr. President, consensus on character is possible because character \nis universal, because character counts. The stamp of character has \nalways been unmistakable. We have seen it in our leaders, in people \nlike Abraham Lincoln and Rosa Parks. We have seen it in our \ncommunities, in volunteers who give of their time, their energy, and \ntheir resources on behalf of those less fortunate.\n  We have all glimpsed the glory of character in our lifetimes. And in \nour heart of hearts, we know that the worth of character outweighs \nthose fleeting benefits of cheap substitutes such as wealth and power.\n  Yet, throughout history, Mr. President, character has been under \nunrelenting assault. Today in this country, many of our children simply \ndo not even know the meaning of the word. There are very few role \nmodels, very few heroes. Even here in Washington, where character \nshould be synonymous with leadership, many pursue less worthy goals.\n  The time has come, Mr. President, for those in Washington to stand up \nand up the ante. Battles have been lost but the war is far from over.\n  Having just spent every day of last year interacting with \nTennesseans, traveling to every county throughout Tennessee, I can say \nthat there is a hunger across America for community built on character.\n  We must teach our children, first by example, and then through \nlessons of the past, that character counts.\n  Today, I urge my colleague to renew their commitment to high personal \nstandards, whatever the cost, and endorse this resolution. We were \nelected to do no less.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Do I not have \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator is correct. The \nSenator has 4 minutes and 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was going to yield the remainder of the time to \nSenator Dorgan, a new member of the coalition.\n\n\n                            Character Counts\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague from \nNew Mexico on this resolution, proclaiming that character counts. A \ngroup of people in this body and in our country have put together an \neffort here that I think is important to our young people.\n  As I was thinking about coming over and talking about character \ntoday, I remembered something I read about an 11-year-old boy named \nRobert Sandifer. Robert is dead. He lies today in a coffin somewhere in \nthe city of Chicago, killed by a bullet to the back of his head at age \n11.\n  At that young age, Robert, who by then had 23 felony charges, was 4 \nfeet 6 inches tall and weighed no more than about 85 pounds. He was \nburied with a stuffed animal in his casket, as family and friends said \ntheir goodbyes.\n  In Robert's 11 years, he lived the life of a hardened criminal. Yet, \nif we look at the rest of his life, when he was taken from his mother \nin 1986, State social workers found scars on his face, cord-like marks \non his abdomen, and cigarette burns on his neck and his buttocks. He \nwas a victim of substantial abuse, who turned to a life of crime and \nthen was executed at the age of 11.\n  As we look at Robert's life, we can feel sorry for him for the abuse \nhe suffered, but we shouldn't make excuses for his behavior. During the \ncourse of his young life, Robert had already committed substantial, \nviolent criminal acts. And it seems to me, there comes a time when we \nneed to stand up and say what he did was wrong, despite the reasons he \nmight have had for turning to a life of crime.\n  Is Robert's story unusual? No, not really. Day after day, in city \nafter city, we hear stories like this. And it breaks your heart. \nSomething is wrong in this country. Something is dramatically wrong, \nand we need to fix it.\n  How do we fix it? Well, we have to again begin teaching values and \ncharacter in this country--in our homes, in our communities, in our \nschools, in our churches. We need to reinforce the importance of good \nmoral character every day, in every way.\n  Edmund Burke once stated, ``All that is necessary for evil to triumph \nis for good people to do nothing.'' Good people all across this country \nmust look around and understand that, in many respects, our moral \ncompass is off.\n   Two of our major growth industries in America are security and \ngambling. Those are the growth industries. If you want to get in on the \nground floor and get a good job, work as a prison or security guard or \nfor the gambling industry.\n  Or, for another indication of what's wrong in our country, turn on \nthe television this morning; what do we see? We entertain ourselves by \nother people's dysfunctional behavior and portray it as normal. Oprah, \nPhil, Ricki, Geraldo--we amuse ourselves by watching all of this \ndysfunctional behavior.\n  What are our children to think, watching violence hour after hour, \nnight after night, on television? The average child will see 8,000 \nmurders on TV before leaving elementary school. What are our people, \nespecially our young people, to think?\n  The effort called for in the character counts resolution is very \nsimple. It is to say that all people, good people in this country, \npeople in their homes and in their communities, in school after school \nacross our country, need to, every day and in every way, teach our kids \nabout certain basic values--about trustworthiness, about respect, about \njustice, about caring, about responsibility, about citizenship. It is \nour job to reinforce in every conceivable way those kinds of values in \nAmerica's youth.\n  I understand that bad news travels halfway around the world before \ngood news gets its shoes on. I understand all that. There is plenty of \nbad news and there are plenty of storm clouds in this country when we \ntalk about American youth.\n  But I also recognize that there are many wonderful stories as well, \nabout young people across our country doing well and caring and helping \nothers, and we should reaffirm their efforts.\n  On the other hand, when we see and hear the gripping, wrenching \nstories of Robert Sandifer and others, we need to understand that these \nare things we can do something about.\n  Character counts is an effort, an educational effort and a \ncitizenship effort all across this country, to say kids matter, values \nmatter, character matters, and we can do something about it if we only \nwork together and try. That is why I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom New Mexico and others in \n[[Page S5235]] this Chamber as a sponsor of this resolution, and I hope \nwe will pass this measure and give voice to this kind of initiative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased this morning to join with the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico and a bipartisan group of my \ncolleagues to submit this Senate Resolution designating October 15 \nthrough October 21, 1995, as National Character Counts Week.\n  One does not need a doctorate in sociology to know that something has \ngone terribly wrong for many young Americans. Teen pregnancy is \nexploding; violence by and against children is out of control; basic \nnorms of civility have broken down in too many troubled communities.\n  Births to unwed women increased 70 percent between 1983 and 1993, \naccording to the Census Bureau. Last year, one in four American \nchildren under 18 lived with a single parent who had never been \nmarried. Deaths of children due to homicide have tripled since 1960, \nbecoming the fourth leading cause of death among children ages 1 to 9, \nthe third leading cause for children 10 to 14, and the second leading \ncause of death for adolescents ages 15 to 19. The perpetrators of these \ncrimes are very often other children.\n  A series of complex trends have caused these problems, and there are \nno easy solutions to them. Better education, prevention, and \npunishment, and help for families in trouble must all play a role. But \nwe must also acknowledge that there is only so much government can do. \nAn effective cure for the plagues devastating young America must \ninclude a large dose of individual responsibility and character \nbuilding.\n  That is why I am so pleased to continue to be a part of the informal \nSenate Character Counts Coalition, led by Senator Domenici. My \ncolleagues and I began last year to promote the idea of character \neducation in our public schools as a part of the solution to the \nproblems that plague young America. And we continue that effort today.\n  I believe that it is entirely appropriate for schools to teach \nstudents the importance of qualities like honesty, courage, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and loyalty. These \nideals are not controversial, revolutionary concepts. They transcend \nindividual religions and philosophies.\n  Education should be more than the transmission of facts. It should be \nmore than the molding of an intellect. Education should help teach \nyoung people all they need to know to be full participants in our \nsociety. Strengthening the mind is not enough: We should also nurture \nthe character.\n  While I believe this approach is common sense to most Americans, it \nhas nonetheless raised eyebrows and concerns about the appropriate role \nof the schools. I believe these concerns are unfounded. Clearly, \nschools will never replace the family. Parents and grandparents, \nchurches, and synagogues should and will always be the primary \ninfluences on children's values and systems of belief. To promote \ncharacter education is not to challenge those influences, but to \ncomplement them.\n  Character education is an idea whose time has come, and Congress has \nbegun to recognize that fact. Last year's Improving America's Schools \nAct included several provisions that offer new support for character \neducation. An amendment I offered to the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \nCommunities Act provides local schools with more flexibility to use \nthese Federal funds for character education.\n  During consideration by the full Senate of the same bill, Senator \nDomenici and I expanded on this effort by adopting an additional and \ndistinct programs to provide grants for States and local partnerships \nthat want to implement character education programs. In addition, \nCongress also established the first National Character Counts Week, \nwhich was celebrated in schools and communities across the country.\n  Character education alone will obviously not solve this country's \nmoral crisis or save young America. But it should certainly be part of \nany plan to help young America save itself.\n  For these reasons, I am very pleased to join once again with Senator \nDomenici, Senator Nunn, and others to submit this resolution to \nestablish a 1995 National Character Counts Week. I hope my other \ncolleagues will join us in supporting this and other character \neducation efforts.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New \nMexico for being the organizer of the Character Counts Coalition here \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  We are men and women, Democrats and Republicans, from all geographic \nparts of the United States of America, and we are united with one voice \ntoday to talk about why character counts and why we need to instill \nthese pillars of character in our public schools, our nonprofit \norganizations, and throughout the United States of America through \nevery cultural method of communication.\n  Mr. President, we are 6 years from the year 2000. A new century is \ncoming. A new millennium is about to be born. We in America need to ask \nourselves, what will the United States of America be in the 21st \ncentury? Will we be a superpower? Yes. We will be a superpower because \nof our economic structure. We will be a superpower because of our \nmilitary might. But we will also be a superpower because the people of \nthe United States have been empowered by a set of values.\n  I believe the continuity that will sustain us between the centuries \nis our values. It is the core values that are expressed in the pillars \nof character, trustworthiness, fairness, justice and caring, civic \nvirtue, and citizenship. These are the aspects of continuity that will \nhelp us not only cope with change but to embrace change and lead us \ninto the 21st century.\n  For some time, I have been concerned that in the United States of \nAmerica we have gone from being a progressive society to being a \npermissive society. Instead of having character, you are rewarded if \nyou are a character.\n  To that end, I have been concerned that we call celebrities heroes. I \nwill tell you what a hero really is. It is a man or woman who makes \nsignificant personal sacrifice, maybe even risking their lives for a \ngreater good with no personal gain.\n  Right now, there are foster mothers throughout the United States of \nAmerica caring for children who are abused, caring for children who \nhave AIDS. Those people are heroes.\n  They are willing to make personal sacrifices with no personal gain \nfor the greater good. They are people with strong values.\n  They know they have a call to duty, a call to responsibility and \nunderstanding that for every right there is a responsibility, for every \nopportunity there is an obligation.\n  Mr. President, we need to keep advocating a society based on virtue \nand value and not a society where every aspect of our cultural \ncommunication regards and exploits violence and vulgarity. This is not \nwhat the United States is about, and this is not what built the United \nStates of America.\n  What built America was virtue and value. Those are the ties that \nbind, the habits of the heart, neighbor helping neighbor, personal \nrespect for yourself and respect for others.\n  This coalition wants to reinforce those values that have sustained \nAmerica through good times and bad, through war and through peace. That \nis why I am advocating the Character Coalition and the inculcation of \nthese values once again through our public schools and nonprofits.\n  My State of Maryland has been dedicated to character education. Over \na decade ago, Blair Lee, a former Governor, had a values commission. \nOur Maryland attorney general encouraged values to be taught in the \nschools. We are now again moving on innovative character education \nprograms.\n  In my own hometown of Baltimore, the public schools are making sure \nthat character counts. In many of our schools and higher education \nfacilities, they are looking at how to have institutes to be able to \nadvocate character.\n  Mr. President, this initiative is important because we need to \nconcentrate on community building and individual capacity among our \nyoung people so they can be part of a larger community. We need to be \nsure that we strengthen the American family and extend that to a larger \ncommunity.\n  I am happy to lend my voice and my efforts for a cause that I believe \ntranscends party and geographic lines because it is not only the laws \non the books that help govern us as a society, \n[[Page S5236]] it is the laws you carry in your heart that govern your \nday to day behavior, and the way you react with one another, your \nneighbors, and the larger community. I believe the pillars of character \ncount, and I am happy to be part of this coalition.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici \nand other cosponsors of this resolution designating the week of October \n15, 1995, as Character Counts Week. This is the second year I have \nworked with a bipartisan group of Senators to promote character \neducation. Our goal is to support the many Americans who are working to \nstrengthen the moral fiber of our children through character education. \nThe resolution specifically embraces six ethical values common to this \ndiverse group of Senators and, we believe, to all Americans--\ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship.\n  We are dedicated to instilling these six pillars of character in our \nyouth. Too many forces in our society teach children to reject these \nvalues and too few individuals and institutions reinforce them. The \nmedia often glorifies deceitful, violent characters. The breakdown of \nthe family has left many children without consistent caretakers and \nrole models that can nourish their moral development. Even some \ngovernment policies send the wrong message. Our current welfare system, \nfor example, fosters dependency rather than responsibility and self-\nsufficiency.\n  This resolution reflects our support for the education, community, \nand religious organizations that are working at the grassroots level to \npromote character education. As politicians we should reinforce their \nefforts wherever we can. Too often politicians are wary of using their \nposition and the law to reinforce specific moral objectives for fear of \nweakening the separation of church and state. But the laws society \nenacts and observes are ultimately expressions of values. They serve as \na moral structure for our civilization. We cannot and should not \ndownplay this connection.\n  This resolution will help reinforce the importance of developing our \nchildren's character and will add momentum to the many character \neducation programs underway today. I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues to find other ways to build character education into public \nand private programs through our political leadership and legislative \nwork.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5232-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               SENATE RESOLUTION 104--RELATIVE TO S. 676\n\n  Mr. GRAMS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.Res. 104\n\n       Resolved, That the bill S. 676 entitled ``A bill for the \n     relief of D.W.

Mr. President, I submit a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution condemning the violent suppression of a protest in Southern \nTeheran yesterday by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and the political \nmilitia. The protesters were demonstrating against the doubling of \npublic transportation, gasoline, basic foodstuffs, and drinking water.\n  When the protesters gathered in the morning of April 4, 1995, their \nnumbers were few. By the afternoon, the crowd swelled to over 100,000. \nAccording to Iranfax, a daily brief on Iranian affairs, the crowd \noverwhelmed police who were shooting tear gas at them and seized their \nweapons. As the protests spread to other districts in Teheran, the \nGovernment called out the Revolutionary Guards and the Bassidj, a \npolitical militia, to quell the riots.\n  Soon, helicopter gunships and troops arrived and began to fire into \nthe crowds. According to the latest reports, at least 150 people died \nin the attacks. We have no way of knowing how many were injured. Owing \nto the order of last year that allowed for a shoot-to-kill policy by \ngovernment troops against civilians, this outcome should have been \nexpected.\n  Nor should this be surprising because it came from this terrorist \nregime. Any government willing to do this to its own people, will have \nno qualms about killing and maiming foreigners. This is why Iran is so \ndangerous.\n  This resolution is simple. It requests that the President immediately \ncondemn this brutal act and instruct the United States Ambassador to \nthe United Nations to bring this matter before the Security Council \nwith the intent of pursuing a Security Council condemnation of Iran.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow Iran to slaughter its people. This \nbrutal regime has abused the human rights of so many people, inside its \ncountry and outside. The time for their atrocious abuses to end is now.\n  I hope that my colleagues join me in support of this important \nresolution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5236-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5236-S5267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n       EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        INOUYE AMENDMENT NO. 453\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. INOUYE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (H.R. 1158) making emergency supplemental appropriations for \nadditional disaster assistance and making rescissions for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 1995, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In chapter V of title I, under the heading ``CONSTRUCTION'' \n     under the heading ``Smithsonian Institution'' under the \n     heading ``OTHER RELATED AGENCIES'' strike ``: Provided \n     further, That notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act shall not apply to any \n     contract associated with the construction of facilities for \n     the National Museum of the American Indian.''.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   WELLSTONE AMENDMENTS NOS. 454-456\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE submitted three amendments intended to be proposed by \nhim to amendment No. 420 proposed by Mr. Hatfield to the bill (H.R. \n1158), supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 454\n\n       On page 31, strike lines 10 through 13.\n       On page 55, line 4, strike ``$4,800,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$4,758,000,000''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 455\n\n       On page 31, strike lines 14 through 18.\n       On page 55, line 4, strike ``$4,800,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$4,758,000,000''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 456\n\n       On page 6, strike lines 8 through 13.\n       On page 55, line 4, strike ``$4,800,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$4,765,000,000''.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       PACKWOOD AMENDMENT NO. 457\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. PACKWOOD submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \namendment No. 420 proposed by Mr. Hatfield to the bill (H.R. 1158), \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following new section:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has raised an \nimportant issue, whether the benefits of national nutritional standards \nfor families and children receiving Federal food assistance could be \nreduced if each State were given the power to determine its own \nstandards. There is another issue which is also overlooked: Federal \nnutritional messages are sometimes inconsistent and can result in \nnational standards taht do not make sense. Such standards should be \namended to be more consistent with USDA's nutritional advice to WIC and \nother food program participants.\n  The USDA and other Federal agencies and nutritional experts advise \nthat fruit is an essential element of a nutritional diet. The USDA's \nfood pyramid specifically recommends that people eat 2 to 4 servings of \nfruit per day. The WIC Program distributes literature urging that \nparticipants eat fruit and ``use fruit in cereal.'' Yet, USDA still \nenforces a regulation prohibiting the inclusion of certain nutritious \ncereals, such as Raisin Bran, in the WIC food package because of the \nsugar content of the fruit they contain.\n  That makes no sense.\n  USDA should revise its current WIC Program regulations to conform to \nits own dietary and nutritional guidelines. USDA is being inconsistent \nwhen it does not allow WIC participants to purchase cereals because of \nthe recommended fruit they contain. It is because of this kind of \nregulation that national standards fall into disrepute, and encourage \ncalls for State assumption of Federal standard-making authority.\n\n                           Amendment No. 459\n\n       On pages 35 through 43, strike all beginning with \n     ``$15,200,000'' on page 35, line 21, through \n     ``$1,300,000,000'' on page 43, line 17, and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following: ``$5,200,000 are rescinded as follows: \n     from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, \n     title X-B, $4,600,000; from the Goals 2000: Educate America \n     Act, title VI, $600,000.\n\n\n                               libraries\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-333, $2,916,000 are rescinded from title II, part B, \n     section 222 of the Higher Education Act.\n\n                            Related Agencies\n\n                  Corporation for Public Broadcasting\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-112, $26,360,000 are rescinded.

PELL. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Feingold, Senator Simon, and Senator \nMoseley-Braun.\n  The amendment will ensure continued funding for the National Center \nfor Research in Vocational Education. The Center is a consortium of \ninstitutions of higher education in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, \nNew York, and Virginia. The Center is widely recognized for the \nimportant research work it does in vocational education, and it would \nbe very unfortunate, indeed, if funding to permit it to continue its \nwork were curtailed.\n  As my colleagues know, we will soon be considering reauthorization of \nthe Vocational Education Act. The work of the Center has provided the \nauthorizing committee invaluable information to help guide and \nfacilitate our work. But even more critical, their research efforts are \nvital to improving the quality of vocational education throughout our \nNation.\n  I view the amendment as an important placeholder so that when the \nSenate and House conferees meet on this legislation, they will have the \nopportunity to give this matter full and complete consideration. I am \nvery hopeful they will ultimately decide to retain funding for the \nCenter, but without this amendment there will be no chance whatsoever \nto provide continued funding for the Center and the important work it \ndoes.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   WELLSTONE AMENDMENTS NOS. 491-495\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE submitted five amendments intended to be proposed by \nhim to amendment No. 420 proposed by Mr. Hatfield to the bill, H.R. \n1158, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No, 491\n\n       On page 29, strike ``$2,185,935,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,191,435,000''.\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the amount \n     to become available on October 1, 1995, for necessary \n     expenses in carrying out the functions of the Robert T. \n     [[Page S5253]] Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), shall not exceed \n     $4,794,500,000.\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                           Amendment No. 492\n       On page 31, strike lines 10 through 13.\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the amount \n     to become available on October 1, 1995, for necessary \n     expenses in carrying out the functions of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), shall not exceed $4,785,500,000.\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                           Amendment No. 493\n       On pages 6, strike lines 8 through 13.\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the amount \n     to become available on October 1, 1995, for necessary \n     expenses in carrying out the functions of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), shall not exceed $4,785,500,000.\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                           Amendment No. 494\n\n       On page 31, strike lines 14 through 18.\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the amount \n     to become available on October 1, 1995, for necessary \n     expenses in carrying out the functions of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), shall not exceed $4,785,500,000.\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                           Amendment No. 495\n       On page 14, line 12, strike ``$81,500,000 are rescinded'' \n     and insert ``$67,000,000 are rescinded.\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the amount \n     to become available on October 1, 1995, for necessary \n     expenses in carrying out the functions of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), shall not exceed $4,785,500,000.''\n                                 ______\n\n                     KERRY AMENDMENTS NOS. 496-498\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KERRY submitted three amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto amendment No. 420 proposed by Mr. Hatfield to the bill, H.R. 1158, \nsupra; as follows:\n                           Amendment No. 496\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, of the \n     funds made available under the heading ``DEPARTMENT OF \n     EDUCATION'', under the heading ``school improvement \n     programs'', in Public Law 103-333, no funds are rescinded \n     from title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act: \n     Provided, That notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the additional amount otherwise provided in this Act in \n     Chapter XI for ``disaster relief emergency contingency fund'' \n     for necessary expenses in carrying out the functions of the \n     Robert T.

Mr. President, I am introducing an amendment for myself \nand my colleagues from Illinois and Missouri. Quite simply it restores \n$700,000 to the land acquisition account of the National Park Service \nfor the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. One hundred acres on the \nriverbank of the Mississippi River in East St. Louis, IL was designated \nin 1992 as a National Park. Included in the authorization was $2 \nmillion allocation for land acquisition. This $700,000 is well within \nthat allocation.\n  The park is designed to be an extension of the Arch Park in St. \nLouis, MO. It enjoys the bipartisan support of Governors and \ndelegations in both Illinois and Missouri and for a good reason. \nSimilar to the resources and effort that went into revitalizing the \nriverfront in St. Louis, investors on both sides of the river have and \nwill continue considerable private sector donations towards development \nof the park.\n  Those important investment by the private sector are jeopardized if \nthe Federal Government backs out of its commitment to share in the \ndevelopment of the park. A great deal is at stake in the development of \nthe park. It's influence in the years ahead on the economy of East St. \nLouis could be significant. For that reason my colleagues and I share a \ncommitment to this project and its success.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        SIMON AMENDMENT NO. 514\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SIMON submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \namendment No. 420 proposed by Mr. Hatfield to the bill H.R. 1158, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       On page 26, strike lines 12 through 20 and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following: ``Public Law 103-333, 1,359,210,000 \n     are rescinded, including $46,404,000 for necessary expenses \n     of construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of new Job \n     Corps centers, $15,000,000 for the School-to-Work \n     Opportunities Act, $15,600,000 for title III, part A of the \n     Job Training Partnership Act, $20,000,000 for the title III, \n     part B of such Act, $3,861,000 for service delivery areas \n     under section 101(a)(4)(A)(iii) of such Act, $33,000,000 for \n     carrying out title II, part A of such Act, $310,000,000 for * \n     * *.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        SIMON AMENDMENT NO. 515\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SIMON submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill H.R. 1158, supra, as follows:\n\n       Strike page 34 and insert:\n\n\n                     vocational and adult education\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-333, $52,779,000 are rescinded as follows: from the \n     Carl D.

We have since \nreceived the estimate, and, for the information of the Senate, I ask \nthat a copy of the cost estimate be printed in the Record. The estimate \nstates that enactment would not affect direct spending or receipts and \ntherefore pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply to the bill:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 523, a bill to \n     amend the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act to \n     authorize additional measures to carry out the control of \n     salinity upstream of Imperial Dam in a cost-effective manner.\n       Enactment of S. 523 would not affect direct spending or \n     receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply \n     to the bill.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James J. Blum\n                                            (For June E. O'Neill).\n\n       Congressional Budget Office--Cost Estimate, April 3, 1995\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 523.\n       2. Bill title: A bill to amend the Colorado River Basin \n     Salinity Control Act to authorize additional measures to \n     carry out the control of salinity upstream of Imperial Dam in \n     a cost-effective manner.\n       3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources on on March 29, 1995.\n       4. Bill purpose: S. 523 would authorize appropriations of \n     $75 million for the Bureau of Reclamation to develop a new \n     program to reduce salinity in the Colorado River basin from \n     saline springs, leaking wells, irrigation sources, industrial \n     sources, erosion of public and private land, or other \n     sources. The authorized funds also could be used to cover \n     costs associated with ongoing salinity control projects. The \n     federal government would be reimbursed over time for 30 \n     percent of any appropriations provided for S. 523 through the \n     Upper Colorado River Basin Fund (UCRBF) and the Lower \n     Colorado River Basin Development Fund (LCRBDF), which collect \n     surcharge from power users through the Western Area Power \n     Administration.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Based on \n     information from the Department of the Interior, CBO \n     estimates that the $75 million in appropriations authorized \n     by S. 523 would be used entirely for new salinity control \n     projects. We expect that funding for these new projects would \n     be required beginning in fiscal year 1996, and that outlays, \n     would reflect historical spending patterns for similar \n     construction projects. Estimated outlays for these projects \n     would total $52 million over the 1996-2000 period, as shown \n     in the following table. Because of the anticipated length of \n     the project, additional outlays would continue beyond fiscal \n     year 2000.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        1996   1997   1998   1999   2000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthorization of appropriations......      6      8     10     15     15\nEstimated outlays....................      5      8     10     14     15\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The costs of this bill fall within budget function 300.\n       The bill's reimbursement requirements would not affect \n     outlays over the 1996-2000 period. Fifteen percent of the \n     reimbursable portion of the appropriation would be paid from \n     collections to the UCRBF within 50 years after a project \n     becomes operational, \n     [[Page S5269]] and the remaining 85 percent of the \n     reimbursable costs would be paid from collections to the \n     LCRBDF as costs for construction are incurred. To cover the \n     reimbursable costs allocated to the UCRBF, CBO expects that \n     the federal government would increase its power surcharge \n     rate beginning in fiscal year 2002. We expect that no rate \n     change would be made to cover costs allocated to the LCRBDF \n     because this fund is currently running an annual surplus of \n     about $9 million.\n       6.

Mr. President, William Raspberry's column in the \nWashington Post and other newspapers around the Nation frequently gives \nus insights into our society and our policies that are important.\n  Recently, he had a column under the title ``Get Off Cuba's Back'' \nthat pointed out how ridiculous our current policy toward Cuba is.\n  As I have said on the floor before, if Fidel Castro and the Soviet \nUnion had a series of meetings to create an American policy that would \nmake sure Castro would remain in power, they could not have devised a \nbetter policy than the one the United States has followed.\n  We should forget our illusions about overthrowing Castro, and move in \nthe direction of trying to influence him to ameliorate his policies.\n  The William Raspberry column hits the nail on the head.\n  I ask that the column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 3, 1995]\n\n                          Get Off Cuba's Back\n\n                         (By William Raspberry)\n\n       Why doesn't the United States get off Cuba's back?\n       The question is meant literally, not rhetorically. In what \n     way is it in the interest of the United States to cut Cuba \n     off from the rest of the world, to wreck its economy and \n     starve its people?\n       When there was a Cold War, the reasons were understandable \n     enough--even to those who disagreed with them. Cuba was on \n     outpost of international communism and right in our back \n     yard. Communist leaders, whether in the Soviet Union or in \n     China, were eager to use Fidel Castro as an annoyance to the \n     United States and as the means of spreading communism \n     throughout the hemisphere. There were even times when the \n     communist-expansion-by-proxy scheme seemed to be working, and \n     it didn't make sense for us to sit idly by and let it happen.\n       The alternate? Isolate Cuba from its neighbors, crush pro-\n     communist revolutions wherever they occurred in the region, \n     encourage the Cuban people to overthrow their despotic leader \n     and serve notice to the communist world that it would be \n     permitted no exploitable foothold 90 miles from our shores. \n     That, as far as I can figure it, is how our opposition to \n     Castro's Cuba became such an obsession.\n       But that was then. This is now, and I cannot find any \n     logical reason for continuing our Cold War attitude toward \n     Cuba--or Castro. Certainly there is no threat that anyone \n     else in Latin America will be tempted to follow Cuba's \n     disastrous economic path. Cuba, no longer anyone's well-\n     financed puppet, is hardly a military or political threat to \n     destabilize its neighbors. And If anything is clear, it's \n     that the Cubans (in Cuba) have no intention of overthrowing \n     the aging Castro.\n       But even if they did, so what? Absent the Cold War, why do \n     we care that Castro continues to try to manage a communist \n     state? Doesn't China, with whom we are panting to do more \n     business? We're buddy-buddy with the Russians now--lending \n     them money, supporting their leaders and again, doing \n     business with them.\n       Isn't there business to be done with Cuba? To this recently \n     reformed cigar smoker, the answer is obvious. And not just \n     Habanas, either. There's sugar and rum and tourism on their \n     side and (prospectively) cars and machinery and other sales \n     and service opportunities on ours.\n       Isn't it likely that international trade and the \n     concomitant exposure of Cuban citizens to the advantages of \n     capitalism would do more to move Cuba away from communism \n     than has a 30-year U.S.-led embargo of the island?\n       Or can it be that we don't care whether Cuba abandons \n     communism or not? Officially, of course, we do care. It is, \n     ostensibly, what our policy is about. Members of Congress--\n     notably Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and much of the Florida \n     delegation--justify their call for yet tougher sanctions \n     against Cuba on the ground that the new measures will finally \n     topple the regime.\n       My fear is that the motivations are less philosophical--and \n     significantly less noble--than that. Two things seem to be \n     driving our anti-Castro policy: Cubans in Florida and sheer \n     vengeance.\n       Few politicians with aspirations for national leadership \n     seem willing to take on the Miami-based Cubans who (like the \n     followers of Chiang Kai-shek) see themselves as a sort of \n     government-in-exile and dream of a triumphant return to their \n     homeland. There being no significant pro-Castro lobby here, \n     the hopeful antis carry the political day.\n       Keeping these next-Christmas-in-Havana dreamers tractable \n     is, I suspect, one reason for our policy. The other may be a \n     sort of institutional rage that Castro has withstood an \n     international missile confrontation, the Bay of Pigs, any \n     number of unsuccessful CIA plots against him and the demise \n     of international communism--and still sits there as a rebuke \n     to our hegemony.\n       Our officials keep hinting that Castro is ailing, or aging \n     or losing his iron-fisted control. No need to think of \n     economic concessions or diplomatic rethinking now. . . just \n     hold out a few months longer, and watch him fall like a ripe \n     plum.\n       And, of course, use our political and economic power to \n     shake the tree.\n       But to what purpose of ours? Isn't it time to stop making \n     our official hatred of one increasingly harmless old man the \n     basis of our foreign policy?\n       Why don't we get off Cuba's back?\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5269-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        LONDONDERRY HIGH SCHOOL BAND PERFORMS IN WASHINGTON, DC.\n\n Mr. SMITH.

The Lancers recently performed here in the Nation's \nCapital for the 1995 Washington, DC St. Patrick's Day parade and \nreceived awards for their performance.\n  The Lancer Marching Band and Colorguard, under the able direction of \nMr. Andrew Soucy, have a proud tradition of representing the Granite \nState in parades across the country.

They \nhave proven that determination and teamwork are the hallmark of success \nboth as musicians and students. The Lancer Band and Colorguard are \noutstanding ambassadors for New Hampshire.\n  Mr. President, I want to express my thanks to both the students and \nfaculty at Londonderry High School for their commitment to excellence. \nIt is an honor to represent them in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5269-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5269-S5270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     INVEST NOW, OR PAY MORE LATER\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I respectfully submit into the \nCongressional Record a statement from Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los \nAngeles on the issue of the Davis-Bacon Act and Prevailing Wage laws.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Mayor Riordan's full statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                     Invest Now, or Pay More Later\n\n                     (By Mayor Richard J. Riordan)\n\n       ``You can pay now or pay later'' is more than grandmotherly \n     advice. It is a healthy dose of financial wisdom which all \n     levels of government ought to heed. In fact, the pay now \n     approach is a goal-oriented investment strategy that \n     considers current and future needs. The pay later scenario is \n     highly reactive, unpredictable and void of strategy.\n       Unfortunately for Angelenos and our local businesses \n     community, Los Angeles city government is too reliant on the \n     pay later approach, which really translates to ``pay more \n     later.'' The cost to the city by failing to invest is \n     hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred maintenance and \n     the taking of precious investment dollars for short-term \n     crises. For example, due to years of inadequate funding for \n     street maintenance, 111 miles of Los Angeles City streets are \n     beyond repair and must be totally reconstructed at an \n     estimated cost of $150 million. It costs five times as much \n     to reconstruct a street as it does to maintain it.\n       Investment in affordable housing, streets, sidewalks, \n     parks, library buildings, schools, water storage, railways, \n     airports and port facilities is good business. Directly, this \n     investment in infrastructure generates tens of thousands of \n     construction jobs. Over the long-term, it creates a climate \n     where businesses will stay and come out of their own self-\n     interest because the quality of life is better--streets are \n     safer, long term economic \n     [[Page S5270]] investment is more secure and more jobs are \n     available.\n       But it takes a lot more taxpayer dollars to build \n     infrastructure.\n       It takes investment in human capital, too, and the same \n     ``invest now or pay more later'' logic should apply. There \n     are some existing strong partnerships between the public and \n     private sectors and organized labor which have wisely adopted \n     a goal-oriented strategy. Prevailing wage laws--created by \n     the federal, state and local governments, in partnership with \n     the building trades and business--have attracted skilled \n     labor with the expertise and experience to complete projects \n     on time and within budget. The Santa Monica Freeway is a \n     shining example; it was reconstructed to the highest quality \n     standards, ahead of schedule and under budget in the \n     aftermath of the Northridge earthquake. Public infrastructure \n     projects have also expanded career opportunities for young \n     people. Some of the best technical training in our region is \n     available through the organized building trades. The \n     facilities are first rate, and the curriculum is fully up-to-\n     date and forward looking.\n       Against the strong arguments for pay-now versus pay more \n     later, those in the Washington beltway who would eliminate \n     the Davis Bacon Act are shortsighted in their thinking. \n     According to a recent study by the University of Utah \n     Economics Department, in the nine states which have repealed \n     prevailing wage laws, the pay more later rule has kicked in, \n     with the net result being reduced wages for construction \n     workers, increased workplace injuries and deaths, a decline \n     in job training, a loss of tax revenue to the state and \n     increased cost overruns.\n       Retaining the Davis-Bacon Act and our prevailing wage laws \n     is critical to the public private partnership which has \n     worked so well in developing our public infrastructure and \n     the highly skilled workforce upon which it depends. In so \n     doing, we can continue to build great projects, produce the \n     good paying jobs and careers our economy must have, and save \n     millions of taxpayer dollars in the process. And we can all \n     rest a little easier knowing that the next time the earth \n     moves, we will still have skilled contractors and \n     construction workers needed to get the job done.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5269-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             KOWTOW: THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S BOW TO BEIJING\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, Lorna Hahn had an op-ed \npiece in the Washington Post titled, ``Kowtow: The State Department's \nBow to Beijing.''\n  What she says there makes eminent sense.\n  I cannot understand our continuing to give a cold shoulder to \nPresident Lee of Taiwan.\n  I trust our Government will make its decision known soon that it will \ndo the responsible thing and let President Lee come to our country. He \nis a freely elected president of a multiparty country with a free \npress. We should not give him the cold shoulder because another nation \nwithout these human rights objects.\n  I ask that the Lorna Hahn item be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  The item follows:\n\n             Kowtow--The State Department's Bow to Beijing.\n\n                            (By Lorna Hahn)\n\n       Lee Teng-hui, president of the Republic of China on Taiwan, \n     wishes to accept an honorary degree from Cornell University, \n     where he earned his PhD in agronomy.\n       Last year, when Cornell made the same offer, Lee was \n     refused entry into the United States because Beijing \n     belligerently reminded the State Department that granting a \n     visa to a Taiwanese leader would violate the principle of \n     ``One China.'' (Cornell subsequently sent an emissary to \n     Taipei for a substitute ceremony.) This year, on Feb. 9, \n     Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord told a \n     congressional hearing that our government ``will not reverse \n     the policies of six administrations of both parties.''\n       It is high time it did. The old policy was adopted at a \n     time when China and Taiwan were enemies, Taiwan's government \n     claimed to represent all of China, and Beijing's leaders \n     would never dream of meeting cordially with their \n     counterparts from Taipei. Today, things are very different.\n       Upon assuming office in 1988, Lee dropped all pretense of \n     ever reconquering the mainland and granted that the \n     Communists do indeed control it. Since then, he has eased \n     tensions and promoted cooperation with the People's Republic \n     of China through the Lee Doctrine, the pragmatic, flexible \n     approach through which he (1) acts independently without \n     declaring independence, which would provoke Chinese wrath and \n     perhaps an invasion; (2) openly recognizes the PRC government \n     and its achievements and asks that it reciprocate, and (3) \n     seeks to expand Taiwan's role in the world while assuring \n     Beijing that he is doing so as a fellow Chinese who has their \n     interests at heart as well.\n       Lee claims to share Beijing's dream of eventual \n     reunification--provided it is within a democratic, free-\n     market system. Meanwhile, he wants the PRC--and the world--to \n     accept the obvious fact that China has since 1949 been a \n     divided country, like Korea, and that Beijing has never \n     governed or represented Taiwan's people. Both governments, he \n     believes, should be represented abroad while forging ties \n     that could lead to unity.\n       To this end he has fostered massive investments in the \n     mainland, promoted extensive and frequent business, cultural, \n     educational and other exchanges, and offered to meet \n     personally with PRC President Jiang Zemin to discuss further \n     cooperation. His policies are so well appreciated in \n     Beijing--which fears the growing strength of Taiwan's pro-\n     independence movement--that Jiang recently delivered a highly \n     conciliatory speech to the Taiwanese people in which he \n     suggested that their leaders exchange visits.\n       If China's leaders are willing to welcome Taiwan's \n     president to Beijing, why did their foreign ministry, on \n     March 9, once again warn that ``we are opposed to Lee Teng-\n     hui visiting the United States in any form''? Because Beijing \n     considers the ``Taiwan question'' to be an ``internal \n     affair'' in which, it claims, the United States would be \n     meddling if it granted Lee a visa.\n       But Lee does not wish to come here in order to discuss the \n     ``Taiwan question'' or other political matters, and he does \n     not seek to meet with any American officials. He simply \n     wishes to accept an honor from a private American \n     institution, and perhaps discuss with fellow Cornell alumni \n     the factors that have contributed to Taiwan's--and China's--\n     outstanding economic success.\n       President Clinton has yet to make the final decision \n     regarding Lee's visit. As Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) \n     recently stated: ``It seems to me illogical not to allow \n     President Lee on a private basis to go back to his alma \n     mater.'' As his colleague Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) added: \n     ``It is embarrassing for many of us to think that, after \n     encouraging the people and government on Taiwan to \n     democratize, which they have, [we forbid President Lee] to \n     return to the United States * * * to receive an honorary \n     degree.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5270-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              ETNA SWIMMER WINS GOLD IN PAN AMERICAN GAMES\n\n Mr. SMITH.

She is a three-time U.S. national champion. \nCurrently, B.J. is training for the 1996 Olympics in Gainsville, FL.\n  B.J. is the daughter of Frederick and Jane Bedford of Etna. She \nattended Hanover High School and Kimball Union Academy in New Hampshire \nwhere she swam with the North Country Aquatics Club.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMrs. Nancy D'Alesandro, a first-class First Lady of Baltimore. She was \na dedicated wife, mother of 6, grandmother of 16 and the driving force \nbehind a family that distinguished itself in Baltimore and in \nWashington.\n  Nancy D'Alesandro was a Baltimore institution. There was nobody \ncloser to the street or closer to the people. From 1947 to 1959, her \nhusband Thomas D'Alesandro served as mayor of Baltimore and Nancy was a \nhands-on first lady. Likewise, she provided endless support during her \nhusband's years in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Devoted to her children, she was there for her son, Thomas \nD'Alesandro III, who also served a term as mayor of Baltimore and she \nwas there for her daughter Nancy Pelosi, who currently \n[[Page S5271]] serves California's Fifth District in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  She was such an important part of not just the Little Italy section \nof Baltimore, but of the whole city and its history. She was a tireless \nworker and a great woman.\n  She immigrated to Baltimore from Italy and graduated from my high \nschool, the Institute of Notre Dame, in 1926. She and her husband were \nmarried for nearly 60 years, until his death in 1987.\n  Nancy was so good to so many people--the nuns, the people in her \nneighborhood, people all over town. The city of Baltimore and the State \nof Maryland are proud and honored to have known her. The great First \nLady of Baltimore has been called to glory. We will miss her.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5270-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5271-S5272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            HEAVEN CAN WAIT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, the Jerusalem Report had a \nfascinating story about a 15-year-old boy who narrowly missed being \nrecruited for a suicide mission.\n  It is an important story because of its insight into how people with \nthe wrong motivation can cause such horrible and needless tragedy.\n  This is a story that ended positively, and the young man, Musa \nZiyada, hopes to become a physician. I hope he will, and I wish him the \nbest.\n  I ask that the Jerusalem Post story be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  The story follows:\n\n                            Heaven Can Wait\n\n       Musa Ziyada arrives for our meeting late. The 15-year-old \n     schoolboy had come home from classes and fallen asleep. Still \n     rubbing his huge almond eyes and yawning occasionally, he \n     finally shuffles into his father's office at 3 in the \n     afternoon in the Rimal district of Gaza city and takes a seat \n     across the table.\n       It's a wonder he's here at all. On the fifteenth day of \n     Ramadan (or February 14), the anniversary in the Muslim \n     calendar of the 1994 Hebron massacre, Musa, an intelligent \n     and earnest Hamas activist, was supposed to have strapped a \n     belt of eight kilograms of TNT around his waste and entered \n     Israel as a human bomb. By blowing himself up along with as \n     many Israelis as he could manage, he was expecting to go \n     directly to heaven; his victim, he says, would go to hell. He \n     was stopped just days before his mission by his alert father \n     and an uncle, who had grown suspicious and handed him over to \n     the Palestinian police.\n       ``In the mosque, they told me that martyrdom means \n     paradise, and that the only way to paradise is through \n     martyrdom,'' Musa explains. ``But I thank God that the \n     suicide act didn't happen, because now I'm convinced it's \n     wrong--both from a religious and personal point of view.\n       Musa's smooth olive skin and the downy shadow over his \n     upper lip give him a look of innocence that belies the nature \n     of the lethal journey he almost took. Paradise, he says, is a \n     place where he would find ``all the pleasures of life and \n     more.'' A place with no death (``the last station''), full of \n     palaces and gardens flowing with rivers of milk and delicious \n     wine--with the alcohol taken out.\n       ``They'' told him that as a martyr, he could gain entry to \n     heaven for 70 relatives and friends, no questions asked. And \n     that 70 virgin brides would await him there. ``Wine and \n     women,'' interjects his father, Hisham, with a hearty laugh. \n     ``That was it! Admit it!'' It's in the Koran. Musa retorts \n     quietly, trying not to look embarrassed.\n       ``They'' are two members of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam \n     brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, men in their mid-30s who \n     told Musa he was true martyr material and started to train \n     him. ``They're just ordinary people,'' he says, giving the \n     word `ordinary' a whole new meaning. ``Their main job is to \n     persuade boys of our age to be suicide bombers.'' Asked \n     whether he questioned why the two didn't go themselves, Musa \n     replies: ``I didn't want to argue, just to be convinced.''\n       Musa was born in the Bureij refugee camp south of Gaza city \n     in 1980, the fourth of nine children. His father, Hisham, a \n     slim, European-looking man of 43 with blue-green eyes and a \n     loud, ready laugh, hardly looks the part of a parent of a \n     would-be suicide bomber. Sitting in the front office of his \n     family firm, an aluminum window-frame workshop, he is \n     sporting a red polo-neck, black silky jacket, jeans and \n     tartan suspenders.\n       Hisham can joke about the experience now, and never misses \n     an opportunity to do so. His son solemnly explains that a \n     suicide bomber who blew himself up in Jerusalem in December \n     but who didn't manage to take any Israelis with him will \n     still go to heaven, because his intentions were ``jihadi.'' \n     But he'll only get 35 virgins, the father gaffaws.\n       The Ziyadas are not a religious family, though Musa's \n     mother and grandfather pray as many ordinary Muslims do. But \n     from an early age, Musa was particularly attracted to Islam. \n     At 10, he was a regular at the mosque and was considered \n     something of a prodigy in Koran. By 12, he was a member of \n     Hamas.\n       ``Despite his youth, he was given the title of `emir,' or \n     prince, because of his religious proficiency and knowledge of \n     the Koran,'' Hisham relates, with a mixture of pride and \n     bewilderment. ``Musa was trusted. Doctors and engineers used \n     to flock to visit him in our home.'' Musa also loves soccer \n     and played no the mosque team (``a Hamas team--no shorts,'' \n     says Hisham).\n       About eight months ago, the family left Bureij and moved to \n     Gaza city's Darraj neighborhood, to be closer to the \n     business. Musa was happy with the move and immediately joined \n     the Izz al-Din al-Qassam mosque near his new home. He came \n     with recommendations form the mosque at Bureij, and quickly \n     became something of a local celebrity.\n       When the bombs started exploding, killing dozens of \n     Israelis from Afulah to Tel Aviv's Dizengoff Street, Musa \n     began to talk about martyrdom and heaven. ``He began to \n     mention it more and more,'' says the father. ``When bombs \n     went off, he'd say `Wow, I wish I was that martyr.''' He \n     thought the suicide bombing at the Beit Lid junction in \n     January, which killed 21 Israelis, was excellent. ``Still, we \n     didn't think much of it,'' Hisham says. ``That's how some of \n     the boys in the street talk.''\n       It was the winter vacation from school. Musa said he wanted \n     to spend some time at Bureij with his friends and family that \n     he'd left behind there. He was given permission, and after \n     about 10 days, his father traveled down to check up on him. \n     When he heard from Musa's aunt and sisters there that they \n     had hardly seen him, he began to get suspicious.\n       One of Hisham's brothers, Samir, is an intelligence officer \n     in the Palestinian police. He was hearing from ``his boys'' \n     in Bureij that Musa had been attending secret sessions in the \n     mosque; he finally came to Hisham and told him he'd better \n     watch his son. The father went to Bureij and made Musa come \n     home.\n       Musa, meanwhile, had attended two secret sessions with his \n     Hamas operators. The first, he says, was to tell him he'd \n     been chosen and to get his agreement. ``I wanted to be a \n     martyr but I wasn't a volunteer,'' Musa says. ``They \n     convinced me.''\n       The second session was to explain the outline of what he \n     would have to do. ``I wasn't told the location of the attack, \n     but I was told people would help me and be with me all the \n     time, even inside Israel,'' Musa relates. The third session, \n     for the final details, was set for the 13th of Ramadan. He \n     had told his father that he absolutely had to go back to \n     Bureij that day, to help with a Hamas food distribution. But \n     by then, Hisham had made up his mind that Musa was in \n     trouble, and took him to the police.\n       ``I was scared,'' Musa recalls. ``The police were very \n     nervous around me at the beginning and I was confused. I \n     didn't know what to say.'' Before he could say much, his \n     interrogators found on him a handwritten will that said it \n     all. In it, Musa had asked forgiveness from his family and \n     wrote that he'd see 70 of his relatives and friends in \n     heaven.\n       Musa spent the next week-and-a-half in custody, and was \n     released a few days before the end of the Ramdan feast. At \n     that point, Hamas spokespeople denied Musa's story, and said \n     the police had tortured him into giving a false confession. \n     Musa claims he was beaten by his interrogators (his father \n     vehemently denies it), but says matter-of-factly that, truth \n     aside, Hamas has to defend its interests.\n       After months of admonishment from Israel that it has done \n     little to stop Palestinian terrorism, the Palestinian \n     Authority in Gaza is now making efforts, at least to improve \n     its image and impart a sense of goodwill. Yasser Arafat has \n     announced that his police have prevented at least 10 terror \n     attacks recently; and Musa and two other teenage would-be \n     suicide bombers who had changed their minds have been \n     presented to the press in Gaza.\n       The Israeli public has been outraged by the recent levels \n     of Palestinian terrorism, and after the Beit Lid attack, \n     Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin predicated a resumption of the \n     autonomy talks with the Palestinians on a serious attempt by \n     Arafat to quell the phenomenon.\n       Since then, the Palestinian Authority has announced the \n     establishment of military courts and the Palestinian police \n     have carried out a mini-crackdown on the radical Islamic \n     Jihad, which claimed responsibility for Beit Lid and which is \n     an easier target than the more popular Hamas. The offices of \n     the Islamic Jihad newspaper, Istiqlal, have been closed and \n     several of the radical organization's leaders are in \n     detention.\n       The talks have resumed, but there is evidently still a way \n     to go. Brig. Sa'eb al-Ajez, the National Security Forces \n     commander of the northern Gaza Strip, can barely bring \n     himself to accept any Palestinian responsibility for attacks \n     that have taken place outside Gaza, and instead hints at an \n     Israeli hand in the suicide bombings. ``One has to ask how \n     come the bombs used in Dizengoff and Beit Lid were of such \n     high technical quality, when all the ones we've found in Gaza \n     are so crude,'' he tells The Jerusalem Report in an \n     interview. ``How come someone carrying 20 kgs of explosives \n     creates a blast with the force of 50 kgs?''\n       He goes on to relate that, according to the Palestinian \n     police, the Beit Lid bombers set out from an area of the Gaza \n     Strip under Israel's control, wearing Israeli army uniforms \n     and driving an Israeli military vehicle. When told that his \n     conspiracy theory would be considered shocking and ridiculous \n     by most \n     [[Page S5272]] Israelis, he replies, ``I'm not accusing \n     anyone, I'll leave it up to the reader to decide.''\n       But at the same time, he tells of the exchange of \n     information taking place between Israelis and Palestinians on \n     the military liaison committee, which he terms a success. And \n     he himself has been taking part in joint anti-terror training \n     at the sensitive Erez checkpoint and industrial zone at the \n     Strip's northern border with Israel. The training isn't a \n     formal part of the Oslo agreement. ``The need just arose,'' \n     says Ajez. ``It's in our interest. We need to protect the \n     Erez area, for the sake of our economy.''\n       What's more, Palestinians argue, they are better positioned \n     to police the Gaza Strip than the Israelis could ever have \n     been. ``We know our people,'' says Brig. Ajez. ``From the \n     first glance we can tell things about them that the Israelis \n     can't. The Palestinian police have only been in Gaza for a \n     matter of months. In another five or six months,'' he \n     declares, ``we'll control the whole area. We'll even know who \n     is blinking and who is not.''\n       Says another police source, who works in the southern half \n     of the Strip: ``Believe me, when we are on a case, we do a \n     hundred times what the Israelis used to do. We arrest many \n     more people, because we know who they are.''\n       Musa's father Hisham stresses his abhorrence of terrorism. \n     ``I want you to explain in your magazine that we are \n     completely against these attacks and are doing our best to \n     stop them.'' But asked whether he'd have turned Musa in to \n     the Israelis had they still been in control of Gaza, he \n     replies, ``Of course not, I'd have been a collaborator! I'd \n     just have kept him at home myself. But many people support \n     the Palestinian Authority, like me, and will help for no \n     money.''\n       Musa has now been persuaded by his father, and an Islamic \n     authority he went to for a second opinion, that it is un-\n     Islamic to appoint the time of one's own death. Musa says he \n     still wants to be a martyr, preferably dying for the cause, \n     ``but not in a suicide attack.''\n       He expresses no remorse about the fact that he planned to \n     kill as many Israeli bystanders as possible in the process, \n     and says he still supports Hamas's religious and political \n     program. Despite having been saved from the jaws of death, he \n     says he is not angry at Hamas, ``but I may argue with them \n     now.'' At times a little sheepish in front of his father, he \n     comes across as little more than a teen rebel, if a \n     potentially murderous one. He's not too religious to shake a \n     woman's hand, and when an electronic pager goes off in the \n     room, he asks if it's a Gameboy.\n       When he grows up, Musa says, he wants to be a doctor. ``To \n     heal people?'' this reporter asks, incredulous after hearing \n     the tale of heaven and hell, of eternal life, death and \n     destruction, ``Yes,'' Musa replies quietly, ``to heal \n     people.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/05/senate-section/article/S5271-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
