Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. 956. \nThe time between now and 12 noon is equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     956), a bill to establish legal standards and procedures for \n     product liability litigation, and for other purposes, having \n     met, after full and fair conference, have agreed to recommend \n     and do recommend to their respective Houses this report, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as we proceed toward the climax of the \ndebate on product liability and a vote on the bill at noon, I believe \nit appropriate to state what I think the issues in this debate truly \nare. The question involved in whether or not we wish to reform the \nproduct liability litigation system of this country has, I think, \nprimarily to do with the products that are available to the American \npeople, the rapidity with which new products are researched, developed, \nintroduced, and marketed, and the cost of those products to the people \nof the United States.\n  In each of these cases, the closely related question, of course, is \nthe system of justice by which people who believe that they have been \nwronged get a determination as to whether or not such a wrong has been \ncommitted and how much compensation should be granted when a wrong is \ndetermined.\n\n  Our present legal system serves well neither of these goals. We have, \nin many areas, a frequent reduction in the number of companies that are \nwilling to engage in vitally important businesses: a reduction from \nsomething like a dozen to one, in the producers of serum for whooping \ncough; a reduction from 20 to 2, in the number of companies willing to \nproduce helmets, football helmets, for players, whether professional or \ncollege or high school or otherwise.\n  There is a constant fear on the part of product developers that the \nunpredictable costs of product liability litigation, whether or not it \nis successful, are simply greater than any potential profits that can \nbe gained from the development and marketing of a product. For example, \nScience magazine has identified three U.S. laboratories that suspended \nor canceled research on promising AIDS vaccines. Union Carbide funded \nand developed a suitcase-size kidney dialysis unit for home use. It was \nsold to a foreign corporation\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\nafter the company determined that potential liability risks under the \npresent system of law made the product uneconomical.\n  Another company developed a phosphate fiber substitute for asbestos, \nthe subject, obviously, of a tremendous amount of litigation. Not only \nwas the product safe, it was biodegradable and environmentally sound. \nAlthough the product could have generated an estimated $100 million a \nyear in revenues, the company concluded that plaintiffs' attorneys \nwould make the product a target for expensive legal claims, and it was \ntherefore too risky to market.\n  Another company developed a chemical process that would speed up the \nnatural bacterial decomposition of hazardous materials and might have \nbeen used to clean up hundreds of leaking underground storage sites. \nDespite its successful demonstration at several sites, the new \ntechnology was abandoned because the risk from potential lawsuits was \ntoo great.\n  In addition, even those companies that have been willing to stay in a \nparticular business have been forced to increase the charges for the \nproducts they market, sometimes astronomically, in order to cover their \ncost of product liability litigation. Lederle Laboratories, which is \nnow the lone maker of the DPT vaccine, all other manufacturers having \nabandoned the field, raised its price per dose from $2.80 in 1986 to \n$11.40 in 1987 to pay for the cost of lawsuits. One other company does \ncontinue to produce, solely out of a feeling of social responsibility.\n  This chart behind me indicates the litigation tax cost of a number of \nproducts produced and marketed in the United States: almost $24 for an \n8-foot aluminum ladder; $3,000 for a heart pacemaker; $170 for a \nmotorized wheelchair; 18 cents for a regulation baseball. There are \nexample after example of the added costs to American consumers to pay \nfor the lottery that is product liability litigation today.\n  What do we have in the litigation system itself? We have a system \nthat is truly a lottery, one in which the average small claimant with a \nvery minor injury is likely to recover much more than that person's \nactual losses, while the average seriously injured individual recovers \nmuch less, with a few lucky ones in a few States with high punitive \ndamage award histories receiving much more. But the bottom line, the \ntotal cost, is that for every dollar which the system itself costs, \nevery dollar that goes into the product liability litigation system, \nwell under 50 cents goes to the victim. Mr. President, 50 cents or more \ngoes to the lawyers, and an additional amount in transaction costs for \nrelated professions. There is no wonder the defense of the present \nsystem is so fierce.\n\n  So this bill is designed to do two things. It is designed, to a \ncertain degree, to make more uniform and predictable the way in which \nthe product liability litigation or claim system will work; to make it \nmore just, actually to increase claimants' rights in some areas, like \nthe statute of limitations; to reduce the cost of litigation and the \noverall transaction costs; to restore the competitiveness of American \nindustry; to provide additional incentives for research, to develop, to \noffer for sale in the market widely the kinds of new and better medical \ndevices, mechanical products, sporting goods that we, as Americans, \nhave come to expect.\n  No one else in the world has a system like ours. No one else has a \nsystem more expensive, no one else has a system that so discourages \nresearch and development and marketing of new products.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we already have an example of how legislation \nlike this works in the real world. In August 1994, less than 2 years \nago, this Congress passed and this President signed an 18-year statute \nof repose for piston-driven aircraft, small aircraft. An industry that \nhad almost been driven out of the United States--famous companies like \nPiper went into bankruptcy and others like Cessna, with barely one-\ntenth of the production that they had a decade earlier because of the \ncost of litigation--has now begun a recovery, a recovery which has \nproceeded much more rapidly, I think, even than the sponsors of that \nbill hoped, but one which is symbolized better than anything else by \nthe construction of a new plant for Cessna at a cost of some $40 \nmillion to employ some 2,000 men and women at highly skilled, first-\nrate jobs, producing high-quality private aircraft for American \npurchasers.\n  This kind of legislation works, Mr. President. It works for the \neconomy, it works for our consumers, it works for our system of \njustice. It should be passed and should become law.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from South \nCarolina will yield me 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will be delighted to yield the distinguished Senator \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just in terms of schedules, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from California be recognized for 15 \nminutes for her comments at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think it is only appropriate that we \nlook at the context in which this legislation has been presented to the \nSenate. Others have described the bill in great detail, and, if time \npermits, I will mention the various provisions in the bill that I find \nmost objectionable. But I think this body and the American people ought \nto understand in a comprehensive way what is happening to consumer \nprotections during the course of this Congress in this and other bills.\n  This bill is supported by a number of big business, special interest \ngroups who have advanced a series of legislative and regulatory \ninitiatives designed to protect those interests.\n  We cannot just look at this legislation in a vacuum, Mr. President. \nFor example, we have to look at what is happening in the Appropriations \nCommittees, where the appropriators are cutting back on inspections by \nthe various agencies of Government responsible for protecting health \nand safety in the workplace. In the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, there is a 20-percent reduction in enforcement. In the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, there is a 25-percent reduction in \nenforcement. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has been cut and is \nnow at its lowest level of enforcement funding since 1972. Even the \nNational Transportation Safety Administration is facing cuts, and that \nis an agency whose total enforcement budget is only about $8 million to \nbegin with.\n  What is happening? The same forces that are supporting this tort-\nrelated legislation are trying to reduce protection for the American \nworker and the American consumer in the regulatory agencies by denying \nadequate enforcement of existing regulations.\n  Second, these same forces are proposing sweeping changes in the \nlandmark legislation that established the regulatory agencies. In the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, for example, last week we \nconsidered a bill to weaken the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and \nnext week we're moving on to the Food and Drug Administration. In the \nOSHA bill, 90 percent of all the companies would be excluded from any \nkind of inspection at all. That so-called reform bill would reduce the \npenalties and reduce the kinds of enforcement mechanisms that would be \navailable to OSHA.\n  So you have the cutbacks in inspections and you have the efforts by \nthe same interests to reduce the effectiveness of the enforcement tools \navailable to OSHA, FDA, EPA, and these other agencies. And at the same \nmoment that is happening, we are presented with this product liability \nlegislation. Anybody who believes that we are considering this in a \nvacuum does not understand what the legislative process is all about.\n  Nor are the limits on tort liability in this bill the only ones under \nconsideration in this Congress. The Republican leadership in the House \nof Representatives has added medical malpractice liability limits to \nthe bipartisan bill that Senator Kassebaum and I introduced. We will \nhave a chance to debate that next month. And it was not long ago that \nwe were debating the loser pays concept, an antiquated system used in \nGreat Britain which is now being abandoned there because it fails to \nprotect the consumers in that country. And no doubt we will again face \nproposals to create an ``FDA Defense''\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\nunder which medical devices or pharmaceuticals approved by the FDA \nwould be immune from lawsuits, no matter how recklessly they are \nmanufactured. How long are we going to have to wait for that particular \nproposal? And the list goes on and on.\n  So, Mr. President, we have to ask ourselves: What are the two major \nprotections for American consumers? They are the tort system and \nregulatory protection. Those are the twin pillars under which the \nAmerican people are protected. They are the twin pillars that assure us \nof the safest food, the safest water and the safest consumer products \navailable. They are the twin pillars for the protection of the American \nworker in the workplace and against environmental hazards.\n  But both pillars are under assault. That is the context in which this \nbill comes before the Senate.\n  The other context in which we operate is a Republican Congress that \nhas told us over and over again that Washington does not know best. But \nin the tort area, which has been recognized for over 200 years as being \na State prerogative, its a different ballgame. I suppose our good \nfriends who are proposing this bill say, ``All right, Washington knows \nbest on this one.''\n  Well under this bill, it appears that Massachusetts does not know \nbest. Because even though my State legislature has decided that \nMassachusetts consumers should have the benefit of no statute of \nrepose, this bill is going to impose a Federal 15-year period of repose \non them. So there is going to be fewer protections for the people of \nMassachusetts because Washington knows best. Any State that has \nprovided additional kinds of protections for their consumers, they are \nout of business.\n  We have been listening to a lot of speeches in the last year and a \nhalf about how Washington does not always know best, there is local \nknowledge, States can fulfill their responsibilities to the people. I \nhope we will hear a diminution of the number of those speeches, because \nwhat in this particular proposal it turns out that the special \ninterests, the special business interests, know what is best for the \nAmerican consumer. That is hogwash, Mr. President, absolute hogwash.\n  The American consumer wants to know who is going to be on their side. \nThey want a safe workplace, safe food, inspections to ensure that we \nare going to have clean air, clean water, and a safe transportation \nsystem.\n  All those are under assault in this Congress, and now in this product \nliability bill we are going to immunize the major companies that may \neven willingly or knowingly commit grievous negligence. In 15 years \nafter they put a ticking time bomb on the market they are going to be \nimmunized under this statute of repose. So, Mr. President, we should \nunderstand that this really is not about the research costs. This is \nnot about health and safety costs to the consumer.\n  What about those 2,700 women who died from perforated uteruses from \nthe Dalkon shield before we passed the medical device legislation? We \nhad those hearings. It was not long ago. You talk to individual after \nindividual who appeared at those hearings and they say, ``Why didn't \nsomeone do something to protect us? Why didn't someone speak out?'' \nThis is the responsibility of Government. Individual citizens have \nlimited resources. They do not have the great financial resources to \nprotect their interests alone.\n  So, Mr. President, I agree with those who say to the consumer--\nbeware, beware. This legislation has a head of steam. It is bad enough. \nBut, my friends, this is just the camel's nose under the tent with \nregard to the attack on consumer protections in this country.\n  For that reason, and for all of the reasons that have been outlined \nin considerable detail in my statement which I will include in the \nRecord, I hope this bill will be rejected in the Senate. And I admire \nthe President of the United States for standing up against the special \nbig business interests. He understands the anticonsumer context in \nwhich this bill may come before him. He understands what I am saying \nabout the camel's nose under the tent. He understands that the next \nbill he sees may include medical malpractice liability limits.\n  According to the Harvard public health study, tens of thousands of \npeople died in hospitals in this country last year from negligence in \nthe medical system. We will have an opportunity to debate that issue in \nthe coming months.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a matter of fundamental protection of \nAmerican consumers. These extreme regulatory reform and tort reform \nbills are poised to deprive the American people of the safest food in \nthe world, the safest air and water in the world and the safest \nproducts on the market. We must not sacrifice the interests of the \nAmerican consumer.\n  If we accept this bill, Mr. President--and if we did not have a \nPresident with the guts to stand up and veto it--we would be retreating \non our commitment to the American consumer to protect them from death \nand serious bodily injury. I hope this bill is rejected, and I ask that \nthe text of my prepared statement, be printed in the Record, along with \nan editorial from today's New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Statement of Senator Edward M. Kennedy on H.R. 956 The Product \n                      Liability Conference Report\n\n       I strongly oppose the conference report on the product \n     liability bill, and I urge my colleagues to reject it, \n     because it constitutes an unacceptable threat to the health \n     and safety of American consumers.\n       This is not ``common sense legal reform.'' It is special \n     interest legislation of the worst kind. Our Republican \n     friends pretend that it is designed to end current abuses of \n     the legal system. In reality, this bill panders to the worst \n     instincts of big business. President Clinton has promised to \n     veto this bill, and it eminently deserves the veto it will \n     get.\n       This bill has three grave flaws. It arbitrarily caps \n     punitive damages against the most reckless manufacturers of \n     deadly products. It nullifies the sound common law principle \n     of joint and several liability. And it preempts State law in \n     ways that are both unwise and unfair.\n       Even worse, this bill does not come before the Senate in \n     isolation. It is part of a shameful pattern. It comes before \n     the Senate at a time when the Republican Congress is waging \n     an all-out assault on the health and safety of the American \n     public:\n       So-called regulatory reform bills would drastically weaken \n     the existing rules that protect public health and safety.\n       Republican appropriations bills would drastically slash \n     enforcement funds for agencies that carry out the current \n     health and safety laws.\n       And now, the entire tort system, which provides basic legal \n     protections for the public against defective products, is \n     under Republican attack in this bill.\n       This is not a liability reform bill at all--it is an avoid-\n     liability bill. It is part of a Republican triple play \n     against the health and safety of the American people by \n     irresponsible business interests.\n       The strategy is all too clear--undermine the Government's \n     ability to protect health and safety by slashing agency rules \n     and budgets, then slam the courthouse door in the face of all \n     those harmed by the lack of consumer protections.\n       Wise regulation, effective enforcement, and access to the \n     courts are three basic pillars of consumer protection. \n     Regulation is intended to prevent the manufacture of \n     defective products in the first place. Enforcement keeps \n     business honest. Tort law guarantees adequate remedies for \n     victims of dangerous and unsafe products when regulation and \n     enforcement fail.\n       The same business interests who support this bill are also \n     urging Congress to weaken the regulatory protections and \n     defund enforcement.\n       It is ironic that the many Republican supporters of this \n     bill who preach respect for the States refuse to practice \n     what they preach. This legislation is intentionally designed \n     to ride roughshod over State law.\n       For the past year and a half, we have heard a great deal \n     from the Republican majority about States' rights. On issues \n     such as welfare, education and crime, the Republican majority \n     says it wants to return power to the States.\n       But when it comes to making sure that big business is \n     protected from lawsuits brought by injured consumers, \n     suddenly ``Washington knows best.''\n       Tort law is traditionally a State responsibility. In fact, \n     in recent years, many State legislatures have enacted genuine \n     reforms to address the problems of frivolous lawsuits and \n     excessive damage awards. Federal intervention is completely \n     unnecessary--and in this case, counter-productive.\n       This bill is also very different from the securities \n     litigation reform bill enacted earlier this year, which I \n     supported. The integrity of the stock market is clearly a \n     Federal concern, and Congress has legislated in that area for \n     over 60 years. The field of product liability law, in \n     contrast, has been the province of State legislatures for \n     over 200 years. There is no compelling reason for \n     substituting the judgment of Congress for the judgment of \n     elected State officials and the State courts where the vast \n     majority of these cases are resolved.\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\n       Our specific objections to this bill are numerous and \n     serious. It denies adequate compensation to victims of \n     defective products, and undermines necessary incentives for \n     manufacturers to produce safe products.\n       The cap on punitive damages will limit the ability of the \n     courts to punish the most flagrant conduct by reckless \n     manufacturers. Punitive damages serve a valid purpose by \n     deterring wrongful conduct that injures innocent victims. \n     Such damages are especially justified as a deterrent against \n     manufacturers who engage in intentional wrongful conduct, or \n     who are recklessly indifferent to the safety of others. They \n     should not be let off with a slap on the wrist. Such extreme \n     misconduct must be fully punished in a manner that creates a \n     clear deterrent to future wrongdoing.\n       The so-called ``waiver'' in the conference report is \n     supposed to permit courts to exceed the cap in flagrant \n     cases. But there is serious doubt about the constitutionality \n     of that provision under the seventh amendment. If it is \n     struck down, all that is left will be a rigid Federal cap on \n     damages.\n       The nullification of the common law principle of ``joint \n     and several liability'' is also unacceptable. It will \n     severely hamper the ability of innocent victims to obtain \n     compensation for their injuries. For at least 100 years, \n     courts and State legislatures have recognized the \n     unfairness of forcing an innocent party to bear the cost \n     of other people's negligence, if one or more of the \n     wrongdoers are available to pay compensation. That is a \n     sensible rule, and Congress should not undermine it.\n       Proponents of Federal product liability reform say they \n     want national standards for goods that are sold across State \n     lines. But the conference report before us achieves no such \n     uniformity. It preempts State laws in an uneven and unfair \n     manner.\n       Punitive damage laws favorable to plaintiffs will be \n     replaced by the new Federal standard. But laws prohibiting \n     punitive damages altogether will stand. Similarly, the bill \n     creates a 15-year Federal statute of repose, but permits \n     State statutes of shorter length to remain in effect.\n       The end result is not uniformity, but unfairness. This bill \n     is rigged to benefit negligent manufacturers and their \n     insurance companies, while ignoring injured plaintiffs and \n     the millions of American consumers who will no longer be \n     protected adequately from dangerous and defective products.\n       All of these flaws were present in the Senate bill that \n     many of us opposed. But the anticonsumer bias of this \n     legislation became even worse after the conference with the \n     House of Representatives.\n       For example, the Senate bill contained a 20-year statute of \n     repose, but the conferees have adopted a 15-year period. As a \n     result, after 15 years, manufacturers of even the most \n     defectively designed or recklessly produced products are \n     immunized from liability and will get off scot-free, no \n     matter how much injury their products may cause.\n       In addition, types of products that qualify for this \n     blatant protection are expanded dramatically. In the Senate \n     bill, only workplace machinery was covered. But now, all \n     durable goods, including common household products, are given \n     this unjustified protection.\n       Massachusetts currently has no statute of repose, so this \n     bill represents a major loss of protection for consumers in \n     my State.\n       When the Senate debated this bill last year, I spoke at \n     length in opposition to medical malpractice amendments. I am \n     pleased that the conference report does not include such \n     amendments. Nor does it include the so-called ``FDA defense'' \n     in the House bill, which would prevent punitive damages in \n     cases involving drugs or medical devices approved by the FDA.\n       But the bill does apply to manufacturers of drugs and \n     medical devices, just as it applies to other products. The \n     cumulative effect of the many anticonsumer provisions in the \n     bill is to protect these manufacturers at the expense of the \n     health and safety of the people who rely on these products.\n       This bill is nonsense, not common sense. It pretends to \n     support the legitimate goals of reducing frivolous litigation \n     and improving the civil justice system. In reality, it is \n     special interest legislation that denies fair compensation to \n     victims of negligence and limits the ability of the tort \n     system to deal effectively with gross misconduct by business.\n       If this bill came off the factory assembly line, it would \n     be labeled ``unsafe for human use.'' And if the principle of \n     quality control applies in the United States Senate, this \n     bill would be soundly rejected. It is a sweetheart deal for \n     business and insurance interests, and a raw deal for the \n     public interest.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 21, 1996]\n\n                     The Anti-Consumer Act of 1996\n\n       The Senate is preparing to vote today on a pernicious piece \n     of anti-consumer legislation masquerading as product \n     liability ``reform.'' The measure is little more than a \n     bipartisan gift to manufacturers and trade associations that \n     supplemented their lobbying and generous campaign \n     contributions with misleading propaganda exaggerating the \n     problem of high verdicts. The bill would arbitrarily cap the \n     punitive damages that juries may award--dangerously weakening \n     the ability of the civil justice system to punish, and \n     thereby deter, the reckless manufacture or sale of unsafe \n     products.\n       If a majority of senators will not heed legitimate concerns \n     about the measure's rollback of consumer protection, \n     President Clinton must be prepared to make good on his veto \n     threat.\n       The bill is a convenient exception to Capitol Hill's \n     prevailing philosophy of devolving power to the states. It \n     would compel all states, even in their own courts, to limit \n     punitive damages. The phony rationale given is the need to \n     create a single national commercial standard. But that \n     standard would be applied only when it would benefit the \n     manufacturers. The bill would override the product liability \n     laws of states that allow unlimited punitive damages, for \n     example, but it would impose no such damages on states that \n     do not now have them.\n       Under the measure, plaintiffs who sue successfully for farm \n     from faulty products could be compensated, as they should be, \n     for medical expenses, lost wages, damaged property and other \n     actual damages. But punitive damages, which are awarded by \n     juries in cases of egregious misconduct, would be limited in \n     most cases to $250,000 or two times actual damages, whichever \n     is greater. That is hardly enough money to serve as a \n     deterrent to major corporations.\n       Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, a \n     Democratic architect of this attack on civil justice, has \n     suggested that President Clinton is trying to scuttle the \n     bill to reward major campaign contributors, like trial \n     lawyers. True, the American Association of Trial Lawyers has \n     been one of Mr. Clinton's strongest political and financial \n     backers. But by now it is laughable for Mr. Rockefeller to \n     make purity an issue, given the far greater sums tossed into \n     this fight by the powerful business interests amassed on the \n     other side.\n       ``For irresponsible companies willing to put profits above \n     all else, the bill's capping of punitive damages increases \n     the incentive to engage in the egregious misconduct of \n     knowingly manufacturing and selling of defective products,'' \n     Mr. Clinton said last week. On the merits, the President was \n     right.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Massachusetts for explaining, in his \nusual way, why this bill deserves to be defeated. Explaining that it \nis, in fact, part of a pattern of this Congress which continually \nbrings up legislation that does not make life better for people, but in \nfact, puts them at risk. In fact, puts them at risk, whether it is \ncutting, as the Senator said, enforcement funds from the Environmental \nProtection Agency, or weakening our laws that have worked well to bring \nus the safest products in the world.\n  Mr. President, I come to this debate by asking a very straightforward \nquestion. I am not an attorney, and I tend to look at things in a \ndifferent way. This is the question I ask: If a young woman, say age \n21, is working in a factory and a faulty machine blows up in her face \nand she is disfigured beyond belief for the rest of her life, should \nthe company who made that faulty product be penalized in such a way \nthat they, and for that matter no other company, will ever make such a \nfaulty product again? I say yes. I say yes.\n  The company that made that faulty product, and as you will see in \nmany cases, knew they were doing it, should face damages that act as a \ndeterrent for the future. This bill does just the opposite. It will let \na company that made such a product, and other companies that might make \nsuch a product, off the hook. If we pass this bill, such a company, \nwhich might well have profits in the billions of dollars, will be given \nthe equivalent of a slap on the wrist. Because those punitive damages \nmeant to punish them--that is what punitive damages mean, punishment--\nwill be so low they will not be large enough for them to care. Those \nare the brutal and cold facts. I wish they were not true, but they are \ntrue.\n  I have heard many businesses use words like this: ``Oh, well, it is \njust a cost of doing business.'' ``Just a cost of doing business.'' In \nother words, they will factor in lawsuits that go against them into \ntheir bottom line. I think the Senator from Washington has proved the \npoint. They factor it into their bottom line. He shows it on his chart.\n  How cold can you get? If we cap punitive damages, as is put forth in \nthis bill, we are taking the safest system in the world for consumers, \nchanging it, and putting people at risk.\n  There are other problems in this bill that deal with the statute of \nrepose. Some machinery has a lifetime of 30, or 40 years. In 15 years, \nthose companies are completely off the hook under this bill.\n  I also join with the Senator from Massachusetts in thanking our \nPresident. He is taking the heat on this one. He is standing up for the \nconsumers.\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\n He is standing up for future victims. He is standing up so that we \nwill not have so many victims of faulty products.\n  I want to give you some examples of actual cases. We are going to \ntake the case of the Pinto automobile, and a young man named Richard \nGrimshaw. The exploding Pinto tank is a very clear example of what I am \ntalking about. The gas tank exploded and burned in rear-end collisions. \nMany of us remember this. The company knew this was a problem. It all \ncame out in court. But they sold the car anyway after they did a cost-\nbenefit analysis and found out it would save them $21 million to delay \nthe corrections for 2 years.\n  What happened when that fatal decision was made? A 13-year-old boy \nfrom my State, Richard Grimshaw, was badly burned in a rear-end \naccident while driving from Anaheim to Barstow. In the words of the \nCalifornia State court judge who presided over Richard's lawsuit, he \nsuffered ``ghastly'' burns over 60 percent of his body, had whole \nfingers burned off, and required 60 surgeries over a 10-year period.\n  That was 25 years ago. That tragic accident is still with Richard. \nFor the rest of his life, it will be with Richard. Is that the kind of \nworld we want to encourage, where a company figures it is more cost \neffective to delay fixing a dangerous product than to risk a lawsuit? I \nhope not. Yet, if this bill passes, my friends, that is what is going \nto happen in the boardrooms across America.\n  Now, not all people in business fall into that category, but \nunfortunately we have got to look at history, my friends, and learn \nfrom it. The memos clearly showed in the Pinto case that a calculated \ndecision was made to delay fixing that car.\n  Let me read from the pen of the California State judge who upheld \nthat award. In part, ``Punitive damages remain the most effective \nremedy for consumer protection against defectively designed mass \nproduced articles.'' ``* * *. Punitive damages thus remain the most \neffective remedy.'' What does this bill do? It guts that. The court \nconcluded, ``Ford could have corrected the hazardous design defects at \nminimal cost but decided to defer defection of the shortcomings by \nengaging in a cost-benefit analysis, balancing human lives and limbs \nagainst corporate profits.''\n  Mr. President, are we going to ignore this judge's warning and turn \nback the clock to a time when callous companies ruined the lives of \nchildren, like that boy in Barstow, because of their bottom line? God, \nI hope we do not do that. If we do, in this particular Congress, I hope \nthis President sticks with it and vetoes this bill.\n  Did you ever hear about the baby crib story? Another example of a \nsituation that happened in California in the 1970's. A baby crib \ncompany produced a dangerous crib where side slats would strangle a \nbaby trying to climb out. Six babies were strangled and the company \nstopped selling the crib, but it refused to warn the existing owners \nthat there was a problem. They refused to do that. So the parents of \nGail Crusan, she was 13 months old, did not know it was a dangerous \ncrib. The company even refused a request by the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission to issue a national press release. It took an award of \n$475,000 in punitive damages against the company to finally get them to \nnotify parents who had bought that crib. Punitive damages did what the \nGovernment could not do. It caused the manufacturer to warn parents \nthat their children were in cribs that could kill them.\n  What are we going to do? We are going to make it possible for future \ncompanies to put our children at risk. I do not want to go back to \nthose days, Mr. President. The proponents of this bill want us to \nsubstitute the long arm of the U.S. Senate and the Congress for the \nlocal jury of peers who sit in a courtroom.\n  Again, I back up what my colleague from Massachusetts says. State \ncontrol, local control, give them the welfare, give them the Medicaid, \ncancel national nursing home standards, let the local people decide--\nthat is what we hear out of the Republicans in this Congress, day in \nand day out. But when it comes to this, protecting consumers, we are \ngoing to pass a weaker law and force it on the States? Not on my watch. \nNot if I can help it. And not on this President's watch. Not if he can \nhelp it.\n  I cannot believe the selective logic that we hear around here. When \nit suits this Republican Congress, they are all for shipping things \nback to the States. But when it is in their interest, keep the control \nin Washington. Boy, I tell you, there is not much shame about that. It \nsimply does not add up.\n  Now, we hear talk about special interests. Face it, there are special \ninterests here. There are the lawyers on the one side and there are the \ncorporations on the other. So I want to look at who does not have an ax \nto grind. Who are they? Let me tell you some of the people who oppose \nthis bill. They have no ax to grind. They are not on one special \ninterest or the other. The Brain Injury Association, the Center for \nAuto Safety, Children Afflicted by Toxic Substances, Citizen Action, \nCoalition for Consumer Rights, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Consumer \nFederation of America, Consumers Union, the Gray Panthers, National \nConsumers League, National Hispanic Council on Aging, Public Citizen, \nRemove Intoxicated Drivers, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, \nViolence Policy Center, Nuclear Information and Resource Services, \nClean Water Action, the Sierra Club, Dalkon Shield Information Network, \nDES Action USA, the Feminist Majority, the National Organization of \nWomen, the National Women's Health Network, the National Women's Law \nCenter, and Women Employed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of all of these groups.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Thirty-Seven Citizen Groups Opposing the Product Liability Conference \n                                 Report\n\n       AFL-CIO.\n       Brain Injury Association.\n       Center for Auto Safety.\n       Children Afflicted by Toxic Substances.\n       Citizen Action.\n       Coalition for Consumer Rights.\n       Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n       Consumers Union.\n       The Empower Program.\n       Gray Panthers.\n       International Association of Machinists and Aerospace \n     Workers.\n       Int'l Union, United Automobile Aerospace & Agricultural \n     Implement Workers of America.\n       Nat'l Conference of State Legislatures.\n       National Consumers League.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Hispanic Council On Aging.\n       Public Citizen.\n       Remove Intoxicated Drivers.\n       Safe Tables Our Priorities.\n       United Food and Commercial Workers.\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n       United Steelworkers of America.\n       Violence Policy Center.\n       Nuclear Groups:\n       Nuclear Information & Resource Service.\n       Public Citizen's Critical Mass.\n       Safe Energy Communication Council.\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n       Environmental Groups:\n       Clean Water Action.\n       Sierra Club.\n       Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund.\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n       Women's Groups:\n       Dalkon Shield Information Network.\n       DES Action USA.\n       Feminist Majority.\n       National Organization for Women.\n       National Women's Health Network.\n       National Women's Law Center.\n       Women Employed.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we should not look to the lawyers and we \nshould not look to the companies. We should look to the people who \nstand up and speak for consumers and speak for victims.\n  Now, I think this bill is particularly tough on women. I do not know \nwhat has happened to this place, but do we forget things that just \nhappened? Do we forget about the silicone gel breast implants which \nwere introduced in the market in 1962 with no long-term testing before \nbeing placed inside women? Implant patients and some doctors were told \nby manufacturers that the implants were safe and would last a lifetime. \nHowever, the implants were found to leak or rupture, releasing silicone \ninto the body, now known to migrate to the brain, liver, spinal fluid, \nand kidneys. Now many women with ruptured implants are sick with a \nvariety of autoimmune diseases.\n  It was because of a lawsuit that included a punitive damage award of \n$6.5 million that the full extent of the hazards associated with \nsilicone gel breast implants were brought to the public's attention. \nThe availability of silicone\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\ngel breast implants were restricted only after Dow-Corning was held \nliable for punitive damages.\n  Do we not think more about women's health? Have we forgotten that? \nHave we forgotten the Copper-Seven IUD? The manufacturer knew for more \nthan 10 years that their product could cause loss of fertility, serious \ninfection, and the need to remove reproductive organs. Instead of doing \nanything about it, the manufacturer continued to earn profits and put \nmillions of women at risk. A jury awarded one $7 million punitive \ndamage award for what it determined to be the manufacturer's \nintentional misrepresentation of its birth control devices. Under this \nbill, that manufacturer would have had to pay $250,000, or double the \nplaintiff's compensatory damages, whichever is higher. We know in most \ncases women do not get as much in compensatory damages as men because \nwomen often earn less money. We know that. This bill is antiwomen. We \nshould call it what it is.\n  How about the Dalkon shield? You heard the Senator from Massachusetts \ntalk about that. It took eight punitive damage awards before A.H. \nRobins discontinued the Dalkon shield. A $7.5 million punitive damage \naward was awarded to a 27-year-old woman who had to have her uterus \nremoved, rendering her sterile and in need of dangerous synthetic \nhormone treatments. That was extraordinary. But it took more than one \npunitive damage award. They made so much profit they kept on producing \nit. They concealed studies of the dangerous effects and even misled the \ndoctors into prescribing the IUD.\n  If it takes multiple punitive damage awards to force a major \ncorporation like A.H. Robins to stop selling dangerous products, how \ncould dangerous products be stopped by this legislation which caps \npunitive damage awards to relatively low amounts? The Dalkon shield is \nyet another example of how the current system finally took a dangerous \ncontraceptive off the market.\n  I cannot believe there are those in this body who feel that this \nlegislation can make life better for the people of this country, just \non the few examples that I have brought here today. To the contrary, it \nwill put our people at great risk.\n  The Senator from Washington shows you with his chart that businesses \nwrite it into the bottom line.\n  The proponents of this legislation argue that the current system \nprevents women from having more choices when it comes to \ncontraceptives. Well, I have a daughter, and a lot of you have \ndaughters. Do you want to see dangerous contraceptives come on the \nmarket? Let me tell you unequivocally--and I will debate this point toe \nto toe with anyone in this Chamber--if the current system is preventing \nother Copper-7 IUD's or Dalkon shields, or other dangerous \ncontraceptives from coming on the market, I say that is good. Because I \ndo not want my daughter sterile, and I do not want my daughter sick, \nand I want her to have more children if she chooses to do that, and to \nlive a healthy life. We want contraceptives, but we want them to be \nsafe.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let there be no mistake as to what this \nconference report is all about. This is not proconsumer legislation. \nThis legislation is anticonsumer. That is why every major consumer \ngroup in this country opposes it strongly.\n  The conference report is about protecting wrongdoers. Now, if some of \nmy colleagues, for whom I have great respect, see it another way, that \nis their right. But I am here to call it the way I see it. It is \ndesigned to relieve corporate America of its proper legal duty to make \nsafe products, represent them accurately, and treat consumers fairly.\n  I have seen no justification put forth thus far in this debate by the \nproponents of this conference report that leads me to believe that it \nwill help our people. I believe it will, in fact, trample on the rights \nof American consumers. We, in this Senate, are the last line of defense \nof the rights of the American consumers and for working families. I \ntell you, we need to protect them from this legislation.\n  Again, I thank the President for getting out there and saying he is \nstanding on the side of the consumers. To those who say, ``He is doing \nit for lawyers,'' we can argue that from night until day, lawyers on \none side, big business on the other. For some, that is a tough choice. \nThat is not what the choice is about. The choice is about the consumer. \nThe choice is about little babies in cribs. The choice is about women's \nreproductive health, safety in the workplace, at home, and when we are \nat leisure. That is what it is about. I say that this U.S. Senate \nshould stand with the consumers. If you do that, you are fulfilling \nyour responsibilities.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Hollings.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, \nfirst, from Massachusetts, for his presentation this morning, in a most \nmeaningful way and, of course, the Senator from California. She really \nkeynoted the issue as it should be in a very cogent and persuasive \nfashion. When we say consumers, that is the people versus those making \na profit on defective products, with shoddy manufacturing.\n  America is the safest place in the world to live. That is part and \nparcel, as mostly I would say, I guess, because of our State \nlegislatures. The State legislatures have acted on the need of product \nliability provisions. They have acted and they have maintained their \nlaws. But it now becomes an assault in the name of a cost of a hotel \nroom, or a ski lift, and such nonsense as that, trying to really move \nthe attention, I guess, of the Senators, thinking they, frankly, do not \nhave much sense and will go along with that kind of nonsense. Thinking \nthat Senators will not understand what the Senator from California is \ntrying to emphasize--these are real life injuries, and the more we get \ninto them in a very meaningful way, as we do in trial law practice, the \nless danger and injury has been caused. So I could not express my \ngratitude enough to the Senator from California. I wish we could go \nahead and vote right now, but I will retain the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from West \nVirginia may desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my colleague. Mr. President, I am very happy \nthat we are here this morning with this remaining part of the debate. \nAlready, a variety of charges have been made, which have no basis in \nfact, as they relate to the product liability reform. But I think \nrather than to try to go into that, it would be better to focus on what \nthis law is trying to do and why it is a good conference report.\n  In a matter of a couple of hours, we are going to pass this \nconference report. It will pass. The House and the Senate, for the \nfirst time, I believe, in recent history will have passed product \nliability tort reform. So it is an interesting and, I think, a rather \nnoteworthy point of history.\n  We have had really a couple of decades of hearings, markups, and \narguments. I remember one time a number of years ago we actually had 60 \nvotes on cloture, and the majority leader at that time--it was still \nlegal to do so--stopped the vote, actually stopped the vote. The \nPresiding Officer was not here in this body yet. For 45 minutes we \nwaited, and all of a sudden, two ``yes'' votes became two ``no'' votes. \nI retain in a desk drawer in my office the sheet which is held at the \nDemocratic desk, which shows how the numbers go up, and they went up to \n57, 58, 59, and got to 60, and then it went from 60 to 59 to 58. So \nthere is a lot of history on this. Of course, there is a lot of \nemotion. A lot of that emotion is justified. Some of it is not. But \nhistory, there is.\n\n  I expect the House to approve this report in short order and send it \non to the President, who has a chance, I think, to do something \nremarkable and significant for this country, if he should choose to \nsign what will then be the legislation.\n  I regret that yesterday's debate demonstrated--and already this \nmorning some, too--there are some very fundamental misunderstandings. I \nthink some of the misunderstandings are very deliberate. They are \ndeliberately put forward to obscure and obfuscate. I think the reason \nfor that is understandable. Product liability tort reform law is not \neverybody's first choice of the day when they get up in the morning. \nThey do not say, ``How can I get deeper into product liability tort\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\nreform law?'' Those of us who are not even lawyers understand best what \nI am talking about.\n  Therefore, it becomes easy to mislead. I suppose it is easy for the \nproponents, as well as for the opponents of this legislation, to \nmislead. But I think that the proponents have really tried not to \nmislead, to stick to what is in the legislation. The opponents have \nbeen vigorous in their work, which is part of the legislative process.\n  I want to emphasize that this conference report is only, Mr. \nPresident, about something called product liability reform. That is all \nit is. It does not pretend to be more. It does not pretend to solve the \ncrisis in Bosnia or hunger in Rwanda, nor anything else. It is just \nabout product liability reform.\n  It establishes some uniformity for consumers and businesses in our \nproduct liability system. That is what we attempted to do. That is it. \nProduct liability reform. This is not broad civil justice reform. This \nis not an overreaching House contract item. This is not a bill that \nprotects drug traffickers, or gun users, or those who sell drugs or \nguns. This is not an extreme bill. This is a limited bill.\n  The Senator from the State of Washington, who has been credible \nthroughout this process, has been extraordinary, I think, in helping to \ndiscipline and to make sure that we sculpted this bill and then kept \nthis bill basically in the form --virtually, with the main exception of \nthe statute of repose--as the Senate passed it last May, which is \nalmost a year ago.\n  One of the reasons for this long, long period of time is that it took \na long time for the House to accept that we really meant it, and that \nwhen we said we were going to stick with the Senate bill, we really \nmeant it, and that in fact we had to, in any event because it was a \nmatter of mathematics. Yesterday we did not get 58 votes, we got 60 \nvotes. Finally that was understood.\n  So what this bill does is establish a fair and a balanced commonsense \nrule which benefits both consumers and business persons, and it will \ncreate jobs. The Senator from Washington has discussed the aviation \nliability reform. I think it will improve product safety because it \nwill allow manufacturers to make improvements.\n  Now, manufacturers often decline to make improvements to their \nproduct because they are afraid that if they make an improvement, it \nwill infer somehow that their previous iteration of the same product \nwas deficient or unsafe. So rather than take that chance they do not \nmake the improvement. That does not help consumers.\n  I think it will encourage innovation. I know it is going to encourage \ninnovation. And I think it will stimulate economic growth just as the \naviation bill did.\n  I have to say once again that there are all kinds of ways of \nprotecting the consumer. We can do it through being sure that there are \npunitive damages available. That is the reason for the additional \namount that was added, and that is also the reason that at the \nsuggestion of the Department of Justice we clarify, the additional \namount to make it a stronger case should there be a constitutional \nchallenge against it--because we are determined that there will be no \ncap on punitive damages except whatever the jury decides.\n  I am forced just by definition of the world that we live in to look \nat, once again, at our competition. You know that when people lose jobs \nin our country or do not gain jobs that they might gain, that is one of \nthe worst things you can do to them. It is injuring them in a very \nsevere way. It is depriving them of family and economic justice. In the \ncase where it puts people on Medicaid, that is very obviously the \nconsequence of that. Not having a job is a way to hurt somebody deep \nand hard.\n  In the European Economic Community, which has, I think, 350 million \nconsumers--Europe is one of our huge competitors--there are 13 \ncountries in that community. Those countries presumably have provinces, \nor whatever they call them. It does not make any difference. They \noverrun all of that, and they have one uniform product liability law \nfor all of those countries because they want to be able to minimize \ntransactional costs, maximize research and development, maximize jobs, \nand maximize their competition against the United States of America, \nwhich is their principal competitor. So they have banded together to do \nthis because they know that, if they do that, they will have a leg up \non us in terms of the creation of jobs.\n  Japan, which I think very few would argue is not a competitor to the \nUnited States economically, has just this year done the same thing. So \nthey have a single uniform liability law for their entire nation. They \ndo not sue a whole lot anyway. I think there are 13,000 lawyers in \nJapan, and there are 600,000 or 700,000 in the United States. \nNevertheless, they are ready.\n  So they understand that the system that America has has very, very \nhigh transaction costs, and they understand that the high transaction \ncosts exceed the compensation that is ultimately paid to the victims of \ndefective products. That is great for lawyers--both for trial lawyers \nand defense lawyers. They are both equally guilty. But they get the \nmoney, not the victim. They get the majority of it. It used to be that \nin the Wild West people carried six-shooters, and they would just \nshoot. We have a different, more modern way of doing it now, and we \ndestroy ourselves in other kinds of ways.\n  So these transaction costs, of course, are then real costs, and they \nhave to be passed on to the consumers through higher priced products. \nPeople say when you pay more for a product that, ``Well, that is the \nkind of argument people make.'' It is true. We pay more. The Senator \nfrom Washington is prepared to give all kinds of statistics about that. \nHe did yesterday. We pay more. Consumers pay more so that the trial \nlawyers and the defense lawyers can make more. In a sense, I am not \nblaming them because that is the system of law that they live under, as \ndo we. That is why we are trying to change the law--so as to bring some \nmore common sense into this process.\n\n  The system's unpredictability and inefficiency are big items. \nUnpredictability is a bad thing. It is a bad thing. It is a lack of \nuniformity, a lack of predictability. It is harmful. It stifles \ninnovation. It stifles research and development.\n  What is the very first thing that happens in this country? I have \nheard many times the distinguished Senator from South Carolina say \nthis. When a company gets in trouble, or a company is up against a \nlawsuit, or a company is whatever for whatever reason in trouble, what \nis the first thing they do? They cut out research and development. That \nis the first thing they cut, which is, in fact in many instances, one \nof the last things they should cut.\n  It is just like a hospital. When a hospital gets in trouble \nfinancially, what is the first thing they do? They close the emergency \nroom because it is the most expensive, which is often the last thing \nthey should do in terms of the community they serve. But they act as \nthey believe they have to act, and we have to understand that.\n  So, stifling innovation and keeping beneficial products off the \nmarket has handicapped American firms as they try to compete in a \nglobal marketplace. The current system is simply unfair, therefore, \nagain to consumers and to businesses alike, and that is why we are \nprojecting this conference report forward.\n  Of course, many of the States have fully recognized the inequities of \nthe current system, as has been pointed out by a number on the other \nside of this argument. The States are very aggressive on this, and they \nhave moved ahead to enact product liability reform. Thirty States have \nmade major changes in joint and several, for example, and in most \ncases--virtually all cases--it is limiting joint and several. But by \ndoing so, while solving some issues, they have inadvertently created \nother kinds of problems.\n  Only through Federal product liability reform can we, in this \nSenator's judgment, resolve the problems caused by the current State-\nby-State product liability system. State legislatures can be very \nhelpful in this area, but it is virtually impossible for them to be \nuniform because they are all different.\n  We have 134 legislators in our State of West Virginia in the senate \nand house. They are not going to do the same thing that Ohio does, or \nthat Kentucky does, or that Virginia or Maryland do. They are just not \ngoing to. So you have, in fact, 51 different laws relating to product \nliability in our country.\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\n  As I said yesterday, years and years ago I suppose that the majority \nof products made in the States were sold in those States. That is no \nlonger true. Seventy percent of products made in the State of Ohio, and \nin the State of the Presiding Officer, if it is at the national \naverage, are sold outside of Ohio. The same is true with the State of \nWest Virginia, the State of Washington, and the State of South \nCarolina. So we are an interstate as well as an international economy. \nTherefore, we need uniformity at certain points to shape and adapt to \nthat.\n  For this reason, State reform legislation--because of the 70 percent \nbeing shipped outside of the State of manufactured goods, less than 30 \npercent effectiveness is the standard for State law. I mean, by \ndefinition, they have to be less than 30 percent effective. On the \nother hand, all of the State citizens who sue in the State are governed \nby that State's product liability statute, and thus they fall victim to \nan antiquated system, and the people here want to protect them.\n  That is why the National Governors' Association recognized both the \nneed for product liability reform and the necessity of Federal action \nto effectuate that reform. They did not say, well, States, you have to \ndo a better job and do things more alike. They said, no, there have to \nbe places where the Federal Government sets uniform standards.\n  The Senator from South Carolina was talking yesterday about how the \nStates always want to have more power; they want to have the power \nshifted to them. That is the direction in which our country is going.\n  That is not the direction of the National Governors' Association on \nproduct liability and tort reform. They want more Federal action. That \nis why the American Legislative Exchange Council, not very well-known, \nbut it is a bipartisan group of over 2,500 State legislators--that is a \nlot of them--representing all 50 States, three times has called upon \nCongress to enact product liability law which is Federal. That is why \nPresident Clinton has said that he supports the enactment of limited \nbut meaningful product liability reform at the Federal level. He said \nthat in a number of statements--in a letter to us, in a statement of \npolicy to us--during the course of this debate. H.R. 956 contains that \nlimited but meaningful product liability reform which makes common \nsense and which has measures which are good for ordinary consumers and \nbusinesses.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, I wish to make one point. People keep \nreferring--and even there was an article this morning in the Washington \nPost--to big business versus trial lawyers. On the business side, it is \nnot big business which is really at stake here. It is small business. \nThat is the reason for the support of the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses.\n  Mr. President, 98 percent of businesses in America are small. Those \nare the people who get put out of business most quickly. Those are the \npeople who have the least cash reserve. Those are the people who live \nat the margins. Those are also places, we have long established, from \nwhere often the best ideas come. That is the overwhelming dynamic \ncenter of the American economy.\n  So H.R. 956 contains, as I have said, what I believe is needed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list describing the \nmajor provisions of the conference report be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the conference report does, however, \nprovide the following: legal fairness for product sellers; a rule to \ndiscourage illegal use of alcohol and drugs--we cannot stop it but to \ndiscourage it, certainly not to reward it--a proconsumer statute of \nlimitations, an enormously proconsumer statute of limitations; a \nstatute of repose that will stimulate jobs and economic growth; \nalternative dispute resolution as a way of settling some of these \nmatters. It is voluntary, which is not so thrilling to me. I wish it \nwere not. I wish it were mandatory, but it is voluntary. At least it is \nthere. That is the way they do things in Japan. That is why they settle \neverything over there, which is not to say they do not have their \neconomic problems, but product liability is not one of their problems. \nPunitive damages fairness is in this bill. Opponents of the bill say we \ncap punitive damages. Untrue. Untrue. I will not vote for legislation \nwhich caps punitive damages, as I would not vote for legislation that \ncaps what lawyers can make. Part of me would like to, but I do not \nbelieve that because I believe the market should make that decision. \nBut punitive damages are not capped.\n  We added the additional amount provision, originally called the judge \nadditur provision, a suggestion which was endorsed by a number of high-\nup folks at the White House and then the whole idea for making sure \nthat it was more constitutional came from the Department of Justice, \nwhich I presume to be the executive branch of Government. So there are \nno caps on punitive damages, and I will assert there could not be \nbecause I was a part of this bill. I was not going to go along with a \nbill that would allow such a thing.\n\n  There is several liability for noneconomic loss; workers compensation \nsubrogation; biomaterials access assurance.\n  These, Mr. President, are some of the highlights.\n  Now, in winding up here, I should like to take a moment to comment on \nwhere we stand in the legislative process. I wish to be hopeful; I try \nto be hopeful; I am hopeful; I will insist on being hopeful; I will be \neverlastingly hopeful that the President will reconsider his decision \nto veto this product liability conference report and that in fact he \nwill sign it. I firmly believe that the President can sign this bill, \neven recognizing that he will not support each of its provisions. There \nare some provisions that I think ought to be in this. There are some \nprovisions which I think ought to be changed, some. Nobody gets \neverything they want. There are 535 people in the Congress.\n  Even though the President might not support each of its provisions, \nwhen the product liability conference report is considered in its \ntotality, in balance with the need for this reform, I remain hopeful \nthat the President will still seize this opportunity to participate in \nproduct liability reform which will benefit in fact the American people \nand the American economy. From my point of view, I stand ready to work \nwith the President to achieve what I believe is our common goal, his \ngoal, my goal, our goal, of fairly balancing what needs to be fixed in \nour broken product liability system, which he surely must recognize, \nwhile preserving important rights for consumers. This is not business \nversus consumers. We are trying to achieve a balance where each \nbusiness and consumer gets certain improvements, and providing business \nwith the predictability that they need to compete in today's economy.\n  In conclusion, because I do not know how much time is remaining--and \nI am not interested--I wish to thank a few people. First of all, I \nagain wish to thank Senator Gorton, Senator Slade Gorton from the State \nof Washington, G-o-r-t-o-n. That is his name. He has been absolutely \nincredible over the years and continues to be in this process--\nremarkable, calm, intellectual, unflappable, fair, flexible. It is just \na stunning privilege to be able to work with Slade Gorton and with his \nstaff, Jeanne Bumpus, Trent Erickson; Commerce Committee staff, Lance \nBultena. We spend a lot of time together. When you do these things, you \nget real close.\n  I thank all of the Democratic supporters, not that that is a \nconvention full of people, but I thank each and every one of them and \nall of their staff. And, obviously and particularly, I want to thank my \nown staff: Jim Gottlieb, a superb lawyer--inventive, flexible, calm, \ntough, a great negotiator and a marvelous human being; Ellen Doneski, \nwho is just indefatigable. She is just like some kind of a rolling \narmy--cannot be stopped. She has a tremendous sense of humor, is \nrelaxed, adamant, just puts her mind to this or other things. She is \nactually part of my health care staff, but she is so smart and so \nflexible she can get this mastered. She is not a lawyer, but do not \ntell anybody that because everybody thinks she is.\n  Then I want to thank another person who is not here because her \nfiance has been through, and is still going through, a terrible, \nterrible crisis, and that is Tamera Stanton, who is kind of\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nhere in spirit. When we were having this debate last year, she sat next \nto me. She is my legislative director, an extraordinary, brilliant, \nwonderful person who is now going through a very, very tough--but also \nencouraging--experience in terms of the health of her fiance, as they \nhope and plan to get married in June.\n  So, I am mindful of these people, grateful to these people, and I \nthank my colleagues for their forbearance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that numerous fact sheets, and \na list and letter from small business organizations, be printed in the \nRecord. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                 major provisions of conference report\n\n       Legal Fairness For Product Sellers: Product sellers are \n     held liable only for their own negligence or failure to \n     comply with an express warranty. The product seller, however, \n     remains liable as if it were the manufacturer if the \n     manufacturer cannot be brought into court or is unable to pay \n     a judgement. This provision assures injured persons will \n     always have available an avenue for recovery, while relieving \n     retailers and wholesaler-distributors of substantial \n     unnecessary legal costs. The provision is ``consumer \n     neutral'' and any attempt to characterize it another way \n     lacks credibility.\n       Rule to Discourage Illegal Use of Alcohol and Drugs: The \n     defendant has an absolute defense in a product liability \n     action if the plaintiff was under the influence of \n     intoxicating alcohol or illegal drugs and as a result this \n     influence was more than 50 percent responsible for his or her \n     own injuries. The alcohol/drug defense in H.R. 956 is \n     consistent with law of the substantial majority of states \n     implements sound public policy. It tells persons that if they \n     are drunk or on drugs and that is the principal cause of an \n     accident, they will not be rewarded through the product \n     liability system. It also relieves law-abiding citizens from \n     having to subsidize others' irresponsible conduct through \n     higher consumer prices. This provision has not been \n     controversial or challenged by professional consumer groups \n     as unfair.\n       Pro-Consumer Statute of Limitation: H.R. 956 permits a \n     plaintiff to file a complaint within 2 years after he or she \n     discovers or should have discovered both the harm and its \n     cause. This is a liberal, pro-claimant provision, which will \n     be particularly helpful to persons who have been injured by \n     products that result in latent inquiries (e.g., drugs and \n     chemicals). Contrary to the suggestion by some opponents, \n     this provision will create a uniform, fair national standard \n     which will open courthouse doors to plaintiffs in many \n     states, such as Virginia.\n       Statue Of Repose Will Create Jobs and Stimulate Economic \n     Growth: A limited statistic of repose of 15 years is \n     established for durable goods used in the workplace, unless \n     the defendant made an express warranty in writing as to the \n     safety of the specified product involved, and the warranty \n     was longer than the period of repose (15 years). Then, the \n     statue of repose does not apply until that warranty period is \n     complete. The statute of repose provision will not apply in \n     cases involving a ``toxic harm.''\n       Strong support exists for this reform, particularly as a \n     result of the enactment of the General Aircraft \n     Revitalization Act of 1994, signed by President Clinton in \n     August 1994, which created a federal eighteen year statute of \n     repose of general aviation aircraft. This law has resulted in \n     production of safer aircraft and the creation of thousands of \n     new jobs and has not been perceived as unfair to consumers. A \n     growing number of states have enacted legislation in this \n     area as well. The statute of repose in H.R. 956 is both \n     longer and more limited in scope than any existing law.\n       As one might expect, there are very few cases involving \n     older workplace durable goods and they are generally won by \n     defendants. Nevertheless, cases involving very old products \n     bring about substantial legal costs and put American machine \n     tool builders and other durable goods manufacturers at a \n     disadvantage with foreign competitors. Foreign competitors \n     rarely have machines in this country that are thirty or more \n     years old, so they pay less liability insurance than their \n     American competitors.\n       Alternative Dispute Resolution: Either party may offer to \n     participate in a voluntary, non-binding state-approved \n     alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedure. This pro-\n     consumer provision is intended to promote the use of ADR \n     procedures, which can provide a quicker and cheaper mechanism \n     of handling legal claims. This provision should help such \n     individuals receive compensation for their claims more \n     quickly and bypass the need to retain costly legal \n     representation.\n       Punitive Damages Fairness: Punitive damages are quasi-\n     criminal punishment for wrongdoing; they are a windfall to \n     the claimant and have nothing to do with compensation for \n     injury. H.R. 956 permits punitive damages to be awarded if a \n     plaintiff proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the \n     harm was caused by the defendant's ``conscious, flagrant \n     indifference to the rights or safety of others.'' The \n     standard is consistent with law in most states.\n       Punitive damages may be awarded against a larger business \n     up to the greater of $250,000 or two times the claimant's \n     total economic and noneconomic damages; against an individual \n     or small business, punitive damages can be awarded up to the \n     lesser of $250,000 or two times the claimant's total economic \n     and noneconomic damages. The provision is ``gender neutral'' \n     and places no limitation on compensatory damages (economic \n     damages plus ``noneconomic damages'' such as pain and \n     suffering). A special rule allows a judge to augment the \n     punitive damages award against a big business when the \n     ``proportionate'' award is ``insufficient to punish the \n     egregious conduct of the defendant.'' A controversial \n     provision that would allow the defendant the right to a new \n     trial if the court used this special power has been removed \n     from the legislation and does not appear in the conference \n     report--as Senator Gorton and I vowed it would not.\n       Approximately one-quarter of the States have set forth \n     guidelines on punitive damages awards, including Illinois, \n     Indiana, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Texas in \n     1995. Because H.R. 956 is not preemptive, the outcome of many \n     punitive damages cases involving larger businesses would not \n     be affected. In some cases against small businesses, however, \n     the outcome may help the business survive, because the bill \n     limits the amount of punitive damages recoverable against a \n     small business to $250,000. This is a particular benefit to \n     the small business community, since an award exceeding \n     $250,000 could virtually wipe out most small businesses.\n       Several Liability For Noneconomic Loss: The rule of joint \n     liability, commonly called joint and several liability, \n     provides that when two or more persons engage in conduct that \n     might subject them to individual liability and their conduct \n     produces a single, indivisible injury, each defendant will be \n     liable for the total amount of damages. This system is unfair \n     and blunts incentives for safety, because it allows \n     negligent actors to under-insure and puts full \n     responsibility on those who may have been only marginally \n     at fault. Thus, a jury's specific finding that a defendant \n     is minimally at fault gets overridden and the minor player \n     in the lawsuit bears an unfair and costly burden.\n       Joint and several liability produces extreme harm for our \n     society. For example, Julie Nimmons, CEO of Shutt Sports \n     Group, Inc. in Illinois, has testified that joint liability \n     has caused manufacturers of protective sporting goods \n     equipment, such as safety helmets, to withdraw products from \n     the market or be chilled from introducing new products. \n     Recognizing the urgent need for reform of this unfair \n     doctrine, 33 states have already abolished or modified the \n     principle of joint and several liability.\n       H.R. 956 adopts a balanced approach between those who call \n     for joint liability to be abolished and those who wish for it \n     to remain unchecked. The legislation eliminates joint \n     liability for ``noneconomic damages'' (e.g., damages for pain \n     and suffering or emotional distress), while permitting the \n     states to retain full joint liability with respect to \n     economic losses (e.g., lost wages, medical expenses, and \n     substitute domestic services). This means that each defendant \n     will be liable for noneconomic damages in an amount \n     proportional to its percentage of fault of the harm. This \n     ``fair share'' rule is based on a joint liability reform \n     enacted in California through a ballot initiative approved by \n     the majority of voters in 1986. The same approach was enacted \n     by the Nebraska legislature in 1991.\n       It has been argued by some opponents that the provision is \n     ``anti-women'' because their economic damages may be lower \n     than men and, for that reason, they depend on noneconomic or \n     so-called ``pain and suffering'' damages. However, there has \n     been absolutely no showing in California, a large and \n     litigious state, that the California approach discriminated \n     against any sex or any group. In fact, noted California trial \n     attorney Suzell Smith has testified that the California law \n     is fair and has worked well for consumers.\n       Workers' Compensation Subrogation: This provision preserves \n     an employer's right to recover workers' compensation benefits \n     from a manufacturer whose product harmed a worker unless the \n     manufacturer can prove, by clear and convincing evidence, \n     that the employer caused the injury. This provision would \n     modify state law in a very positive way. It would create a \n     new private incentive on employers to keep their workplace \n     safe and achieve this goal without reducing the amount an \n     injured employee can recover in a product liability action. \n     This provision has not been challenged by professional groups \n     as controversial or unfair.\n       Biomaterials Access Assurance: Millions of citizens depend \n     on the availability of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical \n     devices, such as pacemakers and hip and knee joints. The \n     availability of these devices is critically threatened, \n     however, because suppliers have ceased supplying basic raw \n     materials to medical device manufacturers. A 1994 study by \n     Aronoff Associates concluded that there are significant \n     numbers of raw materials that are ``at risk'' of shortages in \n     the immediate future. Suppliers have found that the risks and \n     costs of responding to litigation related to medical \n     technology far exceeds potential sales revenues, even though \n     costs are not finding suppliers liable!\n       H.R. 956 will safeguard the availability of a wide variety \n     of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices. The \n     provision was introduced in this Congress as S. 303, the\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\n     ``Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1995,'' by Senators \n     Lieberman and McCain and was added to the Senate version of \n     H.R. 956 during the Commerce Committee's markup. The \n     provision, which has been the subject of hearings and enjoys \n     very strong bipartisan support, will help prevent a public \n     health crisis by limiting the liability of biomaterials \n     suppliers to instances of genuine fault and establishing a \n     procedure to ensure that suppliers--not manufacturers, can \n     avoid litigation without incurring heavy legal costs. This \n     provision is critically important to all Americans, \n     particularly women, according to Phyllis Greenberger, \n     Executive Director for the Society for the Advancement of \n     Women's Health Research.\n       Ironically, even though this bipartisan provision would \n     unquestionably provide a tremendous public health benefit and \n     would not adversely affect consumers, it is not well \n     understood by some and, therefore, becomes a target by those \n     who are willing to concoct and perpetuate untruths in the \n     desperate attempt to selfishly promote their own economic \n     agenda. The fact is that this is a proconsumer provision \n     which does not in any way limit the ability of claimants to \n     seek recovery from medical device manufacturers; the \n     provision recognizes the ``common sense'' principal that \n     suppliers of basic materials, who are not dcurrently found \n     liable, should not be permitted to be indiscriminately hauled \n     into court.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                     the facts on product liability\n\n       Fact: There is no cap on economic or noneconomic damages. \n     Claimants will continue to be able to recover whatever they \n     are awarded in a court.\n       Fact: The statue of repose remains limited to durable goods \n     in the workplace only. Statements being made that we now \n     cover all goods are simply wrong.\n       Fact: Product sellers, lessors, or renters will NOT be \n     protected from negligent entrustment liability. That is \n     precisely why the ``negligent entrustment'' exception was \n     moved to the product sellers section of the bill.\n       Fact: Dow Corning, and other companies who made or make \n     breast implants will NOT be shielded from liability. Whether \n     or not they supplied the silicone, they remain liable as \n     manufacturers.\n       Fact: Drunk drivers, gun users, etc will NOT be protected \n     from liability in any way. Opponents are intentionally trying \n     to confuse harm caused by a product, which IS covered in the \n     bill, and harm cause by the products' use by another, which \n     is NOT covered in the bill and remains totally subject to \n     existing state law. (See Sec 101 (15) and 102 (a)(1)--\n     definition of product liability action includes only ``harm \n     caused by a product'' not ``use.'' This is a big difference.\n       Fact: In all states that permit punitive damages, they will \n     continue to be available, and the ``additional amount'' \n     provision will apply in all those states, regardless of \n     whether caps are higher or lower in that state.\n       Fact: Tolling of the statue of limitations will be covered \n     as they now are, by applicable state and federal law. For \n     example, see 11 USC 108c automatic tolling in bankruptcy \n     cases. Nothing in the bill or omitted from the bill will \n     change state law on tolling.\n       Fact: State law will continue to control whether or not \n     electricity, stem, etc is considered a product or not.\n       Fact: This is NOT one-way preemption, but a mix of state \n     and federal rules. Products are in interstate commerce, and \n     should be subject to more uniform rules for businesses and \n     consumers.\n       Fact: 30 states have modified joint and several liability \n     at this point. The federal proposal follows the California \n     law affecting ONLY noneconomic damages.\n\n\n   provision and product liability conference report, march 13, 1996\n\n     Liability of Product Seller\n       Same as Senate bill--Product seller can be held liable as \n     manufacturer only in limited circumstances.\n     Applicability/Preemption\n       Same as Senate bill--Applicable to product liability cases \n     only.\n     Alternative Dispute Resolution\n       Same as Senate bill--Dispute Resolution (ADR), with no \n     defendant loser pays provision.\n     Defenses Regarding Alcohol or Drugs\n       Same as Senate bill--Complete defense if claimant was more \n     than 50 percent responsible.\n     Reduction for Misuse or Alteration\n       Same as Senate bill--Reduction of damages by the percentage \n     of harm which is the result of the misuse or alteration.\n     Punitive Damages\n       Same as Senate bill: (a) Ceiling of greater of $250,000 or \n     2 compensatory; (b) DeWine Amendment including assets in \n     determination of damages; (c) DeWine small business amdt--\n     limits punitive damage awards for business under 25 \n     employees, to the lesser of $250,000 or 2 compensatory \n     damages; and (d) Judge can award an additional amount for \n     punitive damages in egregious cases, under factors set forth \n     in bill. [Clarification that judge can award all the way up \n     to the initial jury award.]\n     Statute of Limitations\n       Same as Senate bill--Two years after date of discovery of \n     the harm and cause of harm or date that these should have \n     been discovered.\n     Statute of Repose\n       Retains Senate scope--Limits to 15 years for durable goods \n     in the workplace only, with exception for toxic harm.\n     Joint and Several Liability for Noneconomic Loss\n       Same as Senate bill--Joint and several liability for all \n     economic damages, and several liability for noneconomic \n     damages.\n     Federal Cause of Action\n       Same as Senate bill--No new federal cause of action.\n     Biomaterials\n       Same as Senate bill--Biomaterial suppliers who furnish raw \n     materials or component parts, but who are not manufacturers \n     or sellers, are protected from liability; amendments \n     addressing shell corporation concerns and deleting the \n     certificate of merit requirement.\n\n                      Is this one-way pre-emption?\n\n       This is a real red herring argument. The truth is this is a \n     balanced bill--for consumers and for business. In some cases \n     state law prevails, and in some cases, the federal law \n     controls.\n       The goal of federal legislation, especially where you are \n     dealing with interstate commerce, is uniformity, fairness, \n     and predictability. It naturally follows that Federal laws \n     very often must preempt inconsistent state laws. And this \n     product liability bill allows maximum flexibility for the \n     states within a uniform federal system.\n       The interpretation of which laws apply to which situations, \n     is complicated (and is best left to the lawyers). But lets \n     look at a few of the specifics of the bill:\n       If a state has a shorter statute of limitations, and many \n     do, this bill makes it longer. Period. Which way is that \n     preemption?\n       If a state has a statute of repose, this bill makes no \n     change as to the time period, but does make sure that victims \n     of toxic harm receive compensation regardless of the time \n     that their injury is discovered.\n       If a state doesn't allow punitive damages, at all under \n     current law, this bill makes no change in that state's laws.\n       In some states that do permit punitive damages, such as \n     Colorado and Maryland, the standard for allowing punitive \n     damages is lessened, not stricter. (The standard goes from \n     one requiring proof ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' and \n     ``actual malice'' to ``clear and convincing evidence.)\n       If a state does permit punitive damages, I believe that the \n     new federal rules will, for the first time, permit judicial \n     flexibility in determining the amount of punitive damages, \n     even if there is a cap on the amount of punitive damages \n     under that state's law which is different that the new \n     federal bill.\n       So, in summary, yes this bill does preempt state law in \n     some situations. But to suggest that it is totally one-way is \n     misleading at best.\n       The conference report is a tightly balanced bill seeking to \n     make some uniformity out of a patchwork of conflicting state \n     laws.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1996.\n     Katherine Prescott,\n     National President, MADD, Irving, TX.\n       Dear Ms. Prescott: Your letter of March 19 is wrong, and \n     based on a totally incorrect quoting of the proposed law.\n       Your letter says that the product liability bill covers \n     ``harm caused by a product or product use.'' that is \n     incorrect.\n       The legislation reads: ``harm caused by a product'' only.\n       You have been misinformed, perhaps intentionally, in an \n     effort to convince you that cases of drunk driving would be \n     covered under the bill. The fact is that cases of drunk \n     driving or so-called dram shop cases would not be covered by \n     this legislation.\n       In addition, those who ``negligently entrust'' a product, \n     such as alcohol, resulting in drunk driving situations, would \n     not be protected in any way under the law.\n       I will read your incorrect letter, and this response, into \n     the Congressional Record today, and I expect you will want \n     for me to include your retraction letter as well.\n       Kindly FAX your retraction to me immediately at 202-224-\n     9575.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     John D. Rockefeller IV.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n IMPACT OF FEDERAL PROVISIONS ELIMINATING JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY \n           FOR NONECONOMIC DAMAGES IN PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES\n\n       The Conference Committee version of the product liability \n     bill is currently expected to retain the Senate bill's \n     provision eliminating joint liability for noneconomic \n     damages. This Federal law provision would not significantly \n     change the law in those states which already either have \n     eliminated or severely limited joint liability, or have \n     imposed specific limitations on the award of noneconomic \n     damages.\n       Twelve states have eliminated joint liability altogether: \n     Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, \n     North Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Wyoming.\n       Two states have eliminated joint liability for noneconomic \n     damages: California and Nebraska.\n       Ten states have otherwise limited the availability of joint \n     liability as to noneconomic damages or damages generally, so\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\n     as to make it significantly less likely that noneconomic \n     damages would be subject to joint liability: Florida, \n     Illinois, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New \n     Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Texas.\n       Three states have eliminated joint liability in cases in \n     which the plaintiff is negligent: Georgia, Ohio and Oklahoma.\n       Five states (including three already mentioned) have capped \n     awards of noneconomic damages: Alaska, California, Kansas, \n     Maryland, Massachusetts and Michigan.\n       In all, 30 states have adopted measures that already limit \n     the recovery of noneconomic damages. These include eight of \n     the nine largest states in the union--California, New York, \n     Texas, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and New Jersey.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n    SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTING PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM\n\n       National Federation of Independent Business (600,000 small \n     businesses).\n       National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors (156 trade \n     associations representing 250,000 small businesses).\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce (215,000 small businesses).\n       National Association of Manufacturers (10,000 small \n     businesses).\n       Small Business Legislative Council.\n       National Association of Women Business Owners.\n       National Small Business United.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n   joint letter to members of congress from american small business \n           leaders on product liability reform, april 3, 1995\n\n       Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the nation's more \n     than 21 million small and growing businesses, we are writing \n     to strongly urge your support of S. 565, The Product \n     Liability Fairness Act of 1995.\n       You know the problem: A single lawsuit can and has put many \n     small business owners out of business.\n       For many small businesses, the explosion in product \n     liability cases means it is simply impossible to find and \n     keep affordable liability insurance.\n       You've heard the horror stories. (If you haven't, give us a \n     call.)\n       Why should you care? Small businesses create virtually all \n     the net new jobs in the economy. And businesses owned by \n     women now employ more people than the entire Fortune 500 \n     combined. While most of our company names are not household \n     words, small business comprises the backbone of the nation's \n     economy--from Main Street to Wall Street.\n       We need your help.\n       Product liability reform was the #1 issue at the White \n     House Conference on Small Business in 1986. Finally, after \n     more than a decade of struggle, product liability reform \n     seems within our reach.\n       Please support S. 565, The Product Liability Fairness Act \n     of 1995, and help protect U.S. consumers, workers and small \n     businesses. Our future and the future of our nation's \n     economy, depends on it.\n       Thank you for your support.\n     Gary Kushner, President, Kushner & Company, Inc., President, \n         National Small Business United, Kalamazoo, Michigan\n     Carol Ann Schneider, President, Seek, Inc., President, \n         Independent Business Association of Wisconsin\n     Patty DeDominici, President, National Association of Women \n         Business Owners (NAWBO), Los Angeles, California\n     Willis T.

Who yields time?\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia just thanked a group of people. I wondered who they were. I \nknew no lawyer who had ever tried a case in a courtroom would ever put \nup a bill of this kind. So, having sponsored this measure, they would \nhave to have some extraneous help of some kind to fashion an abortion \nas this ``conspiracy''--not conference--report. I emphasize \n``conspiracy,'' Mr. President.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia says when you work with \nhim, it is very close and everything else. Of course, he did not thank \nthe Senator from South Carolina because we never got close because we \nnever conferred and we never were told about a meeting. We could not \nsee the draft. We heard first about this so-called conference, or \nconspiracy, report, with Richard Threlkeld on CBS at 7:20 last Thursday \nevening on the evening news, when he said it was coming up. I had yet \nto get a copy, even though I am a member of the conference, struggling \naround on Friday to try to find out what we were going to have.\n  The story down in the local press, the way they politically work it, \nwas that the Senator from South Carolina was going to filibuster. We \nhad not had a chance to debate. We had not had a chance to debate. But \nthe point of the matter is that, as the Senator from West Virginia \ntalks about small business, small business--look at the chart. That is \nnot small business. I think he ought to talk more closely with the\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\ndistinguished Senator from Washington, whom he has been working with, \nbecause they are not quite in step.\n  These heart pacemakers at $3,000, motorized wheelchairs, hotel bills, \ntonsillectomies, maternity stays, and all--maybe somebody is selling a \nbaseball. We will let that one go by--18 cents. I hope we are not \nfinding a Federal need up here, with all the States rights atmosphere, \nto all of a sudden pass a Federal law on account of 18 cents on the \ncost of a baseball.\n  We go through, and it is really sad, because, going right to the \nchart, we have never seen that before. I guess that is the option of \nthose who do not have a case, to try to do it by sheer surprise. They \ncame in first years ago--I will never forget it--and said there was a \nlitigation explosion. You do not hear them arguing about the litigation \nexplosion anymore.\n  They said there was an insurance crisis. We have here in the record \nthat insurance companies are making billions and billions of dollars, \nso there is not that. Their reserves are up to an all-time high. They \nare doing great. So the insurance company is doing well, so you do not \nhave that.\n  Then they had the matter of uniformity. Mr. President, they were \ngoing to get all the States together and have uniformity, but it is \nquite obvious that the many splendored thing, the test tube of \nfederalism at the State level, clashed with that uniformity. And they \ncreated specific exemptions for those States who had more stringent \nrequirements of an injured party. Those State laws could hold. Those \nwho had less stringent laws would have to come under the stringent \nrestrictions of this particular measure. So on the face of it, it \nshowed absolutely no uniformity. So they gave up on uniformity, in a \nfashion.\n  Then they went to the matter of global competition. That is a sort of \nmystique around this Congress. We in Washington have discovered global \ncompetition. The matter of losing your job is psychological--the \n``anxiety society'' they write about. ``Downsizing.'' It is all so \npolite. Heck, they have been fired, and they moved the jobs overseas. \nWho has moved them? It is not global; it is us.\n  It is like the Spanish Civil War with the fifth column. Over half of \nwhat we are importing in here are American multinational generated. I \nused the figure that they had researched back in the late 1970's. It \nwas 41 percent. I know over 50 percent of the imports are by 200 \ncompanies of the Fortune 500. They are the big, powerful people who can \nafford it. Small business cannot move overseas, but big business has \nmoved overseas and continues, in a veritable hemorrhage. We explained \nit to everyone so they could understand the cost of manufacture. It was \n30 percent of volume for the associates or workers, employees--you can \nsave as much as 20 percent.\n  It is a given, if you move to a low-wage country, a $500 million \ncompany can save $100 million if they just keep their executive office \nhere, their sales force, but move their manufacture to a low-wage \ncountry. They can move offshore and get rich, or they can continue to \nstay and work their own people and go broke. That is the trade policy \nof this Congress. These companies are not greedy. If I ran the company, \nif you ran the company, we would do the same thing. Competition has \nmoved. So are we going to sit around here and wonder--what? That \nCongress is running around in a circle about term limits and all these \nother little funny things they can think of, including product \nliability that the States have long handled.\n  The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island got up and said ``15 \nyears, 15 years'' the Congress has considered this issue. But the State \nof Rhode Island has responded. That is the mystery to me, that the \nproponents come around and act, all of a sudden, like they have \ndiscovered these things. Assume everything is true on that chart next \nto the Senator of Washington. What has the legislature of the State of \nWashington done about it? They have acted. The State of Georgia has \nacted. The State of South Carolina had product liability reform back in \n1988. It was fully debated. But all of a sudden, we in Congress \ndiscover things. Why? Because we take a poll. None of these pollsters \nhas ever served in public office, but they get the hot-button items, \nsix or seven of them--and you have Victor Schwartz, that is a good \none--saying how they went after the lawyers. They go after the doctors. \nEverybody is against the doctors, until they need one. Everybody is \nagainst the lawyers, until they need one. That is a given in society.\n\n  But you do not just pass Federal laws to vitiate the laws of the 50 \nStates on a statute of repose. Take the referendum they had in the \nState of Arizona. The proponents of this measure say, ``Forget about \nyour referendum.'' They want to get back to the people, but ``we are \ngoing to tell you from Washington what to do, State of Arizona, \nregardless of your referendum.'' So what is going on up here?\n  Now they come with the shunt. We are used to trying cases. You are \nlimited to the record and the proof that you have, but this crowd just \nmakes it up at the last minute. They have gone back to the products \nthat have been kept off the market, and the shunt. I had not heard \nabout the shunt, so we called up the Food and Drug Administration and \nthey said there is no problem.\n  Yes, Dow has been cited by our distinguished colleagues from \nConnecticut and Washington as going broke. It ought to go broke. They \nwill never make--and a lot of other companies will never make--those \nimplants like that again and try to sell them like hot cakes. Yes, \nsirree, that is what happens in our society, and we repair that kind of \nnonsense that goes on. Innocent women going in and thinking they are \ngetting a health cure and instead they are ending their lives.\n  So Dow does not sell them anymore, but Applied Silicon sells silicon, \nNeusal sells silicon. And we get another list of those--that little bit \nof material that goes into the shunt that takes the water off the \nbrain. The inference of the Senators here trying to use that argument \nis that children and individuals are going to die unless we pass \nproduct liability at the Federal level. Come on.\n  Take that chart next to the Senator from Washington. If a pacemaker \ncosts $3,000, that has far more intricate materials than a shunt. They \nwould take pacemakers off the market if you followed the logic of their \nargument. You could not afford $3,000 for that. I question that figure, \nto tell you the truth. I wish I had a chance to try it. My mother \npassed on just a few years ago, dying at 95 years of age, but she had \nfour pacemakers and we never paid that. Maybe it is cheaper in Georgia \nand South Carolina than up here in this land--$18,000.\n  But let us assume the truth. If the truth is there, then pacemakers \nhave to get off the market, using the logic of the argument about the \nshunt and a little bit of silicon material that goes into it. Come on. \nIt is available. It is a false argument.\n  We are going to have to have a legislative congressional committee \nappointed on ski lifts, because it is only $2. It is way more dangerous \nthan $2. I have been on them. The Presiding Officer has been on them. \nGet on one of those things and find out they are only spending $2 for \nsafety. We have to get that up.\n  That is the real Federal problem. Their little charts. They had the \ncoffee chart yesterday. They took down the coffee chart. At least they \nhave some shame. We proved that punitive damages award had been cut. \nThe judges in New Mexico have sense, but the coffee case had no sense. \nWhen the proponents finally found that out, they took the chart down.\n  What do they do here? Assuming all of that, as I say, is true, they \nact like the States have never acted before. I wanted to emphasize, \ntoo, coming in with this thing. Now let me read you this particular ad \nby the American pharmaceutical research companies, which appeared on \nthe Federal page of the Washington Post on March 27, 1995. Here is what \nthe American pharmaceutical group of manufacturers advertise in this \nad:\n\n       Drug companies target major diseases with record R \n     investment. Pharmaceutical companies will spend nearly $15 \n     billion on drug research and development in 1995. New \n     medicines in development for leading diseases include 86 for \n     heart disease and stroke, 124 for cancer, 107 for AIDS and \n     AIDS-related diseases, 19 for Alzheimer's, 46 for mental \n     diseases, and 79 for infectious diseases.\n\n  In this ad the pharmaceutical companies include a bar graph showing \ntheir steady increase in R investment\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\nsince 1977. They spent $1.3 billion in 1977, $2 billion in 1980, $3.2 \nbillion in 1983, $4.7 billion in 1986, $7.3 billion in 1989, $11.5 \nbillion in 1992, and an estimated $14.9 billion in 1995.\n  Maybe they will go out and research a new kind of silicon--they spent \nalmost $15 billion on overall research in 1995. But if you listen to \nthe Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Washington, you would \nthink you cannot get the drugs on account of product liability; the \ndrug companies are all going out of business.\n  In fact, the foreign drug companies are all coming from Europe over \nhere like gangbusters and investing. I will have a list before we end \nthis debate this morning of the pharmaceutical companies joining in and \nthey are not complaining. They are coming from Switzerland to South \nCarolina and Hoffmann-La Roche is not complaining about product \nliability. Wellcome is coming in with Glaxo in North Carolina. They are \nnot complaining about product liability. We have product liability laws \nin our States.\n  What they do in this measure, Mr. President, if you read it, goes way \ntoo far. We see this the more we now have a chance to look at it and \nwonder why. For example, I wondered why MADD came out against this \nbill, and then when I read that provision about punitive damages and \nsubstances--let us have all the drunk drivers not worry about punitive \ndamages, do not worry about punishment, go ahead, drive drunk. Here we \nhave the finest movement under MADD at the Federal and the State level. \nBut this crowd now wants to write a bill so zealous about punitive \ndamages and getting rid of it--at least one Senator said he did not \neven believe in punitive damages--that I can tell you now that they \nsaid tell the drunk drivers to go ahead, do not worry about punishment, \ndrive. Tell the trial judge that you are obligated under the common law \nto charge the jury with the law, but keep it a secret.\n  The Senator from West Virginia said we do not have a cap. I guess \nthat is the part he is reading in the bill, because as far as the jury \nknows, there is no cap. Why? Because that is the law under the common \nlaw, but they have a provision in here where the judge does not tell \nthe jury about the law.\n  Now come on, what kind of laws are we passing here? Tell the drunk \ndrivers, ``Go ahead, drive drunk.'' Tell the judge who has the \nresponsibility to stay out of the facts of the case, to, by gosh, keep \nthe law secret and then come around and have a new hearing on the facts \nin violation of the Constitution.\n  The Cessna crowd, tell them now with the statute of repose, ``Don't \nworry about it, as long as the part would last for 15 years.'' Most of \nthe planes I have been flying in are more than that. When you fly \naround in a State in small planes, you will find they are more than 15 \nyears old. But tell Cessna that they can go like gangbusters, do not \nworry about the parts.\n  There, shoot the Maytag man. Put him out of business. He does not \nhave to stand there and say, ``My refrigerator is not going to catch \nfire. It is 30 years old, and they still haven't called me to repair \nit.'' Shoot the Maytag man.\n  Blow up the furnaces. I went through a textile plant just the other \nday. It is 100 years old, but the machinery is brand new. They are \ncompetitive. When I first started, the shunts, as they call them, in \nthe weaving machines used to be about 200; then they got to 400, then \n1,500. The Japanese made machines up above that, I do not know how many \nthousands. They have the newest machinery.\n  Yes, somebody in the plant may have been hurt. But now, hereafter, \nwhen you have to put all that investment in there, do not worry about \nthe cost of the safety of the worker after the machine is 15 years old. \nI think they will close down the textile show we have in Greenville for \nnew machinery because we are going to pass the law that after 15 years \nyou can forget about how safe a machine is. There is no more product \nliability. They will take the hindmost. Just get hurt. Do not worry \nabout it. Let society take care of the injuries and everything else \nbecause the national Congress, in the face of the State laws and \nprovisions that are working extremely well as of now, decided exactly \nwhat to do.\n  The utilities, oh, heavens, we had a good half-hour show on yesterday \nabout the utilities. The utilities, now they did not want to write \nstrict liability, so they wrote a double negative in the particular \nprovision. Of course, the distinguished Senator had a difficult time \ntrying to answer the questions because you could tell the lawyers \ndowntown wrote this thing, not the staff. If the staff had written it, \nyou would have seen somebody getting cussed out for writing that kind \nof thing. But the lawyers downtown were writing that thing up. They did \nnot want to mention what they really meant.\n  That is, for the utilities, do not worry about the highest degree of \ncare we require in Georgia, South Carolina and the States of America \nbecause now we have a provision in here to tell the utilities to go \nahead, forget about the highest degree of care.\n  Then, the corporate head was riding with his worker after work in the \nevening. They get into a wreck. A big trucking company runs the red \nlight. The corporate head can get $16 million--no, excuse me, it says \ndouble economic damages. We had one corporate head making $16 million, \nso he could get a $32 million verdict. But the poor fellow sitting in \nthe front seat with him has got a cap--the gentleman said it ``ain't no \ncap'' --but he gets $250,000. He is capped.\n  That is how the workers and consumers got this. The proponents of the \nbill discriminate against the people they say they are trying to help. \nThey cannot name an organization of workers, consumers or others who \nare not affluent that favors this nonsense. The proponents come around \nand discriminate against those of modest means--the senior citizens, \nwomen, children.\n  Oh, on pain and suffering, well, they are compensated. They have to \nhave another hurdle. We put in another hurdle for them regarding joint \nand several liability. Mr. President, they come right down to the wire.\n  I was watching this morning when the distinguished majority leader \nwas on TV. He was talking about guns and the second amendment. Let me \nread two other amendments.\n\n       In suits at common law [amendment VII], where the value in \n     controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial \n     by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, \n     shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United \n     States, than according to the rules of common law.\n\n  They absolutely mandate it be reexamined by the trial judge. That is \nin violation of amendment VII.\n\n  Then amendment X:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  The distinguished majority leader always comes and says, ``Look, I \nhave got here in my pocket'' the 10th amendment--some carry around the \ncontract. The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia carries \naround the Constitution. The distinguished majority leader carries \naround the 10th amendment, until this.\n  When it comes to Medicaid, let the States handle it. When it comes to \neducation, abolish the Department; that is a function of the States. \nWhen it comes to welfare, the Governors come in and say, let the States \nhandle it. When it comes, by cracky, to crime, we have had a 2-year \nintramural around here trying to make sure that we get back to a \nprogram that we know did not work.\n  President Nixon put in LEAA, block grants, to the States. The next \nthing you know, they had a tank down in Hampton, VA, to protect the \ncourthouse. I do not know what was going to attack the courthouse in \nHampton. They had the Governor of Indiana buying a plane, a Beechcraft, \nso his wife could go and buy her clothes in New York. They were buying \nplanes and buying tanks and everything else. Trying to get the money \ndown to the officer on the beat was like delivering letters by way of a \nrabbit; you could not get it there.\n  At the time the city, the council, got it, the State, whatever, a \npolitician got his hands on it. It was all for law enforcement, but law \nenforcement never saw it. But they say, ``Oh, no, we've got to have \nblock grants.'' After the experience where we had to abolish the LEAA, \nthey come with this one on account of the political poll.\n  Lawyers. They have two giants, they say, the consumers and the trial \nlawyers, consumers and trial lawyers. The\n\n[[Page S2567]]\n\nSenator from California emphasized what needs to be emphasized, and \nthat is that we are looking out for individuals and individual \ninjuries. It is not easy to try these injury cases. As we all know, \nless than 4 percent of all civil cases are product liability, less than \n1 percent get to the courts, and product liability accounts for less \nthan 1 percent of the cost of any of these products. They can keep on \nputting up charts, but the Conference Board refuted that. They said \nless than 1 percent of the cost of any of their articles were \nattributable to product liability. So what did we do? What did we do? \nWe pass a totally unconstitutional measure. But more than anything \nelse, Mr. President, the word ``greed'' has been used around here. I \ncould not, in conscience, come and say, now, let us apply this all to \ninjured individuals but not to injured businesses. Oh, no. No, no.\n  I see where United Airlines wants to sue that manufacturer of the \nbaggage handler. It got loose up in Denver, that machine. We had one of \nthose machines, Mr. President, when I was in college. It had the \nlaundry where you sent your clothes over there, and it had a machine \nthat ripped the buttons off your shirt and shot them through your \nsocks. I know that machine now is up at the Denver airport. It tears up \nthe package, rips into the bags, and skirts it into the gears, stopping \neverything.\n  So now, Mr. President, we have the business that can go ahead and get \nits way on punitive damages--do not worry about any $250,000, keeping \nit a secret, and then tell the trial judge later to start on his own \nfactual findings and everything else like that in violation of the \nConstitution. Do not worry about any of that. Sue, like Pennzoil did \nTexaco--get a $10 billion verdict, $10.2 billion. That is more than all \nthe product liability verdicts for injured matters in the last 20 years \nput together--$10.2 billion. Add them up. One business.\n  The overwhelming majority of product liability is businesses suing \nbusinesses. They believe when they get a bad product misrepresented, \nthey ought to have a cause of action. But they have done everything in \nthe world to put hurdles in this thing, unconstitutional provisions, \nseparating the injured parties, separating the businesses out, making \nsure that the corporate heads and those of affluence get big economic \ndamages. They can get big verdicts; not women, not children, not senior \ncitizens who have retired. They have all of a sudden become second \nclass citizens.\n  That is the bill. It is a shame. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I think a few brief moments in outlining \nwhat this bill does and what it does not do may be particularly in \norder at this stage in the debate.\n  If we were to take at face value what we have heard from my \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina, coupled with his \ncolleagues from Massachusetts and California, we would entirely lose \nsight of the fact that nothing in this bill limits in any respect the \nability of any individual to recover a verdict in any court for all of \nthe actual damages suffered by that individual as a result of what a \njury may determine to have been a defective product.\n  Let me repeat that. The Presiding Officer, if he is injured by a \ndefective product, will recover in the future, as he has in the past, \nall of his actual and provable damages. Obviously, there will be a \ndifference in those damages from one person to another, even with \nsimilar injuries.\n  Second, Mr. President, nothing in this bill limits the ability of an \ninjured person to recover as a result of a jury verdict all of the \ndamages that jury may attribute to pain and suffering or to noneconomic \ndamages.\n  I find the argument of the Senator from South Carolina particularly \ncurious. He says this is a terrible bill because an executive making $2 \nmillion a year can recover more than someone making the minimum wage. \nMr. President, that seems to me to be an argument that we ought to \nimpose caps, caps that we have not imposed. Perhaps the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is suggesting a reform which no one, as far as I know, \nhas ever proposed anywhere in the United States. That is, that there \nought to be a cap on the economic damages that any individual can \nreceive, and that if an individual making $100,000 loses a year of \nwork, that person should not be able to recover any more than a person \nwho makes $20,000, or vice versa. But that is a change in the law that, \nas far as I know, no one has ever proposed.\n  This bill allows you, Mr. President, to recover all of the actual \ndamages that you have suffered as a result of an accident that is the \nfault of some product, including your lost wages, based on whatever \nyour wages are. Is that unequal justice because some people have higher \nwages than others? I do not think so. It also allows the jury to award \nyou or anyone else whatever it may determine in the way of noneconomic \ndamages.\n  We did have a debate on this subject in this body the first time \naround, not in connection with punitive damages but in connection with \nmedical malpractice. There was an attempt on the floor to put a ceiling \non the amount of noneconomic damages that could be recovered in a \nmedical malpractice case. That proposition lost on the floor of the \nSenate, Mr. President, and ultimately the entire medical malpractice \nsection was taken out of the bill, to be dealt with separately.\n  This bill proposed no such limit in committee, no such limit on the \nfloor when it was being debated last year, and has no such limitations \nnow. What is limited in any respect is the imposition of punitive \ndamage awards--by definition, an award that is above and beyond all of \nthe damages caused by the defective product.\n  My distinguished friend and colleague who is so complimentary to me, \nthe Senator from West Virginia, has said that he would not vote for a \nbill that had an absolute cap on punitive damages. This is a field in \nwhich we disagree. I would. In fact, I do not believe, as an individual \nSenator, that there is any place in the civil justice system for \npunitive damages at all. They are not permitted in tort litigation in \nthe State of Washington and in a handful of other States.\n\n  There are very few serious arguments made that there is no justice \navailable for civil litigants as a result. There is an extremely strong \nargument, it seems to me, against punitive damages at all. Why should \nany individual recover more than a jury thinks that individual has \nactually suffered, especially when there is no limitation on the \nability of the jury to make an award for pain and suffering for \nnoneconomic damages in addition to the proven actual damages in a case?\n  We have a system in this country that is peculiar with respect to \npunitive damages designed as punishment without any limitations \nwhatever. Every criminal code, for every crime up to and including \nfirst-degree murder and treason, has some kind of limitation. You \ncannot be executed twice for two murders. But with respect to punitive \ndamages, in most places there are no limitations at all.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has asked us to address this \nissue. I think we ought to address this issue. We do address it in a \nmodest fashion in this bill, a very modest fashion, but only punitive \ndamages, not any of the actual losses to any plaintiff in a product \nliability action whatever.\n  If you heard only the arguments on the other side of this case, you \nwould think everyone was being denied justice, that no one was going to \nbe able to recover their losses, their actual damages in a piece of \nproduct liability litigation.\n  Why should there be some predictability, some limitation on punitive \ndamages? First, of course, because under the present system there can \nbe an infinite number of actions with respect to the same product. We \nhave a sentence, a punishment imposed, not with all of the protections \nof the criminal code, not with the usual unanimous jury requirement, \nbut just at the total, complete and unfettered discretion of juries.\n  I think, as I say, that it is a terribly poor system. I did not \nprevail in my debates with my allies on my own side of the aisle or \nwith my friend from West Virginia. I cannot remember what the views of \nmy friend from Connecticut are on the subject. So we have a form of \ncontrol which is not a cap. The Senator from West Virginia is entirely \ncorrect with respect to that; however, nothing with respect to \nrequiring a company or an individual to pay its full share of the \ndamages that it has caused, whether noneconomic or economic.\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is about people. I spoke yesterday, and \nspeak again today, briefly, about young Miss Tara Ransom in the State \nof Arizona who has spoken to Senator McCain and to people in my office \nabout her silicon-based shunt for hydrocephalus.\n  The great and deep concern that she and thousands of others have \nabout the availability of a medical device, which has literally given \nher life and made that life worth living, is that it is increasingly \nunavailable due to a present system of absolutely uncontrolled and \nunlimited punitive damages.\n  The next to the last paragraph in the article about this young lady \nfrom Arizona reads:\n\n       The good news is that there are reform efforts underway in \n     Arizona and at the Federal level. The Senate is planning to \n     vote, as early as today, on legislation to place reasonable \n     limits on punitive damages and eliminate unfair allocations \n     of liability in all civil cases. This would protect all \n     Americans --not just the manufacturers of medical products, \n     but also small businesses, service providers, local \n     governments, and non-profit groups. Above all, it would save \n     children like Tara.\n\n  This is about American business, and competitiveness, and low prices \nfor products. But it is even more about the people who use those \nproducts.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we get this nonsense about drunk drivers, \nthis utter nonsense about the drunk drivers. Well, of course, nothing \nin this bill has anything to do with suing drunk drivers. The \nimplication that it has something to do with suing the people who \nsupply them with alcohol negligently, the so-called dram stop \nsituation--well, this bill specifically says, ``A civil action for \nnegligent entrustment shall not be subject to the provisions of this \nsection but shall be subject to any applicable State law.''\n  That argument, Mr. President, is pure nonsense. This is a product \nliability bill. It is not a negligent entrustment bill. It has nothing \nto do with someone who deliberately sells a gun to someone to kill a \nthird person, or deliberately allow someone to become drunk and is sued \nunder dram stop statutes at all. It does have to do with product \nliability, with people like Tara Ransom, with companies like Cessna, \nwith those who manufacture devices and therapeutic drugs, and a myriad \nof other products for the American people. It does have to do with \ngiving them a better deal than the present system does, which is a \nlottery for plaintiffs and a bonanza for those who represent them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama 15 or more minutes, as he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I just found out that Senator Rockefeller \nis going to vote for the conference report. Senator Gorton has said \nthat Senator Rockefeller could never vote for a bill if it had a cap in \nit, a definite cap. And as I read it--now, maybe he can, in some way or \nanother, explain this language --we have a language on page 10 of the \nreport relating to punitive damages. First, the language in the report \nsays the ``greater'' of two times the sum of the amount awarded to a \nclaimant for economic loss and noneconomic loss, or $250,000. That is \nnot a definite cap because the amount of economic loss and noneconomic \nloss is a variable. But language immediately thereafter says, ``special \nrule.'' This applies to the rule on punitive damages for small \nbusinesses where these corporations have 25 employees or less. I might \nadd that this language applies also to individuals. The ``special \nrule'' provides that punitive damages shall not exceed the ``lesser'' \nof two times the economic loss and noneconomic loss, or $250,000. So \npunitive damages cannot exceed, in any event, $250,000. So that is a \ndefinite, established cap.\n  I am not going to hold Senator Rockefeller to that since he did not \nmake the statement to me. He must have made that statement to Senator \nGorton who is present on the floor. I would not want to put him in an \nembarrassing situation. But I think this special rule shows very \ndefinitely that there is a cap in the bill.\n  Now, that also points out that a lot of language in this bill is \nslyly inserted, and so craftily placed, that I think some of its key \nfeatures have escaped a great number of people's attention. That is \ntrue with regard to the biomaterials provision. The biomaterials \nprovisions, to which Senator Lieberman refers regarding raw materials, \nalso contains language regarding component parts. There are numerous \nimplants that have component parts. I mentioned before that I have a \npacemaker which has numerous component parts. There is a battery, and \nthere are various wires that go down into the chambers of the heart \nthat causes electrical charges to emit; it has various sensors and a \ncomputer that records the history of my heartbeats over a period of \ntime. When doctors check it, they can check and see whether or not \nthere was some unusual rhythm or unusual activity taking place. \nBasically under the provisions of title II, on an implant that has \ncomponent parts, there is complete immunity in regard to the supplier \nof the component parts, or the raw materials of an implant.\n  Now, there is an exception in the event the manufacturer of the \ncomponent part is also the manufacturer of the entire device or also \nthe seller. But most medical devices are made from component parts, \nsuch as the batteries, and people furnish those separately. Title II \ngives complete immunity to suppliers with no chance to even discover \nwhether or not there was any negligence on the part of the supplier. It \nis interesting to see where the crafty language is written. It \nindicates that ``implant'' means--and this is the definition on page 17 \nof the conference report--\n\n       a medical device that is intended by the manufacturer of a \n     device to be placed into a surgically or naturally formed or \n     existing cavity of the body for a period of at least 30 days, \n     or to remain in contact with bodily fluids, or internal human \n     tissue through a surgically produced opening for a period of \n     less than 30 days.\n\n  Well, what is less than 30 days? I would assume that less than 30 \ndays could mean 2 seconds or 1 second. It is very craftily designed. \nWhat is a surgically produced opening? Well, there is no definition in \nhere, but a surgically produced opening would appear to me to be an \nopening in which you use surgical tools. Of course, that would mean \nthat you normally think of a knife, of a scalpel, or of something like \nthat. But what about intravenous materials, one of these locks where \nyou tie it into you? You have devices where they put it in and out of \nyour body, and they can put fluids into the body such as a blood \ntransfusion. Consider a hypodermic needle--is that a surgical tube?\n\n  You have a situation where we find that title could have some \napplicability with a blood transfusion. We should consider where a \nblood transfusion occurs, and we know that blood has to be highly \ninspected and is subject to the highest standard of care because of \nAIDS and other matters. This bill is designed toward an interpretation \nthat could mean that AIDS in blood is subject--where someone has made a \nmistake, who has been negligent or otherwise--to the provisions and the \nlimitations and protections that are put within this bill.\n  It is very carefully crafted, as I pointed out yesterday, in \ninserting a comma in the definitions section of durable goods, now \nwithin the purview of the report is any type of a product that has a \nlife of more than 3 years--baby cribs, lawn mowers, toasters, or \nvirtually any type of kitchen appliance.\n  There are a great number of provisions in the bill that disturb me, \nin particular, the way that they are designed to favor the manufacturer \nor the seller, and it puts the injured party at such a disadvantage. \nFor example, there is the misuse or alteration provision, which \nprovides that in a product liability action, the damages of a defendant \nwill be reduced by the percentage of responsibility for a claimant's \nharm attributable to the misuse or alteration. But I see problems where \nthere could phantom defendants--the phantom defendants where there is \nnobody there to be held responsible--and they can try to invoke the \nseveral liability provisions in the report as to noneconomic damages. \nThese phantoms are the ones that are all at fault and there is nobody \nleft responsible for a claimant's injury.\n  Then we have a situation in regard to employer and coemployee, as to \nwhether or not they might have misused or\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\naltered, or were at fault. So, in order to leave the impression on the \njury, this bill requires that that be the last issue that is presented \nto a jury, because when they leave and go back to the jury room to \ndecide, that is the last thing that they heard. So they are trying to \nput it off--the negligence or the lack of responsibility on the part of \nthe manufacturer--and impose it on someone else and to give it to that \nperson just as he goes into the jury room as the last thing that they \nhear that will be predominantly on their mind. Is that fair to the \nclaimant?\n  There are numerous other aspects of that which disturb me. I suppose \none of the things that I just cannot understand at all in regard to \nthis is how--if it is good for the goose, why is it not good for the \ngander? And they exempt business losses. One business suing another \nbusiness can bring his suit for commercial losses, losses of profit, \nunlimited amount, unlimited amount relative to punitive damages, and \ndifferent statutes of limitation.\n  The Uniform Commercial Code, I assume, is uniform everywhere. I \nunderstand there are a few differences in it. But in our State in \nAlabama, you have a 4-year statute of limitations in regard to the \nUniform Commercial Code. The conference report imposes a shorter 2-year \nstatute of limitations.\n  The Senate-passed bill contained an exception to the 2-year statute-\nof-limitation provision stating that if a civil action under the bill \nis stayed or enjoined, the statute of limitation is suspended or tolled \nuntil the end of the injunction. That provision was deleted from the \nconference report. Is that fair? I think not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-four minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. How much of that time does the Senator from Connecticut \nrequest?\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from the State of \nWashington.\n  Mr. President, I have been thinking as I listened to the debate this \nmorning, and what preceded it yesterday and before that, that there is \na way of thinking around the Capitol that is not the way of thinking \nthat I hear back home in Connecticut. It is what I call either-or. You \nknow if an idea is put forward by a Republican, no Democrat shall be \nfor it. If an idea is put forward by a Democrat, no Republican should \nbe for it, or, in this case, if something is good for business, it has \nto be bad for consumers. That does not figure, particularly if you look \nat the overall effects of this bill.\n  What I want to contend here is that because of the extraordinary work \ndone by Senators Gorton and Rockefeller, and by the conferees from the \nSenate and the House, this is a win-win bill.\n  This is a bill that is good for consumers and good for business. In \nthat sense, it is good for our country overall.\n  There is a way in which the opponents to the legislation approach it \nwith such skepticism, turning every word in the most potentially \ndamaging light and not considering the intentions of the sponsors and \nthe authors and the record that we have tried constantly to build on \nthe floor.\n  Everybody in America knows, at least most everybody knows, that our \ncivil justice system is not working well. I do not think anybody really \ncan stand up and defend the status quo of the litigation system in \nAmerica. Nothing is wrong with it. That is preposterous. The average \nperson on the street--I stop them in Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport--\nknows that lawsuits take too long; that people do not get justice in a \ntimely fashion; that too much of the money goes to lawyers. They know \nthat.\n  I think the question is, how are we going to make it better? Why \nshould we make it better? Because of the specific problems and \nshortcomings of the current system I just referred to and also because \nthe public, the people have as little faith as the people of our \ncountry do today in our system of justice. That is a profound problem \nthat goes beyond tort reform and anything else. It strikes at the very \nheart of people's faith in the Government they have. Lord knows, we \nknow they have enough lack of confidence in the legislative branch, \nmaybe some in the executive, but it goes to the judicial as well.\n  I honestly believe, deeply believe that this bill--moderate, modest, \nsensible, small, incremental reform--is a step in the direction of \nbeginning to restore some faith in the system, making it work for \npeople who are injured and making sure that it does not destroy faith \nin the system by punishing people who are not guilty and letting those \nwho are guilty often off without being punished.\n  So I say this is win-win. It is good for business and it is good for \nconsumers. It will create jobs by removing a deterrent to innovation \nand investment. It will reduce consumer prices by making litigation \nless expensive. If 20 percent of the costs that we are paying for a \nladder is litigation-related costs, the cost of that ladder is going to \ngo down if we can reduce that litigation cost some, and it goes on and \non throughout the system.\n  I wish to talk particularly again about this biomaterials section of \nthe bill of which I am a cosponsor. It comes from something that is \nvery real that is threatening something very good. The very real \nelement here is that there is an unnatural shortage of raw materials. \nJudge Heflin referred to it. Thank God, Judge Heflin is healthy and \nwell today because of the pacemaker he has. He is one of 8 million \npeople who have benefited from medical implants of one kind or another. \nThe device is put together by a manufacturer but it takes parts they \nbuy from people who do not make these parts particularly for this \npurpose. They are not making much money on selling those parts. \nBatteries are one. The information I put into the Record yesterday \nshows that one of the manufacturers of batteries--a couple actually--\nused in pacemakers have stopped selling to the manufacturers of \npacemakers because they are afraid they are going to get sued for \nsomething that is not their fault. They would just as well sell the \nbatteries to somebody else where the chance of a lawsuit is not as \ngreat. They are not worried about the negligence. They are worried \nabout what it is going to cost them if they get tied up in a lawsuit.\n  In the debate there is such skepticism expressed about these medical \ndevices and pharmaceutical companies, et cetera. Sometimes when I look \nback and read history and I say, now, how far have we really come; how \nmuch better is the human race? I wonder if we have ascended very far in \nthe way in which we deal with one another.\n  However, there is one way we can objectively show that there has been \nextraordinary progress in human experience and that is in our health. \nWe are living longer. You can see it year-by-year. We are up, I guess, \nin the mid-seventies now in terms of average life-span. A lot of that \nhas to do with pharmaceuticals, these wonder drugs that have been \ninvented. And a lot of it has to do with these medical devices that we \nare trying to protect by making sure that the manufacturers can \ncontinue to get the parts, the materials and the component parts, and \nare not frightened out of supplying those parts because of the fear of \nlawsuits.\n\n  I said yesterday, when I talked about the allegations, the opponents \nof this bill keep lighting fires around the periphery to sort of stop \npeople from voting for the bill. Those of us who support it put out one \nor two fires and there are three more burning over here. And one of the \nfires has been lit about how this bill would affect the existing breast \nimplant procedure. I said at length yesterday--I will not repeat it \ntoday--the bill will not impact this procedure. This is prospective, \nonly affects people who may file claims later. Breast implants are not \nbeing done any more. They were stopped by the FDA, except for a small \nnumber of clinical trials in 1992.\n  With regard to new products, you cannot escape liability under the \nbiomaterials section of this bill, if you are not just a supplier but \nyou are a manufacturer or a seller or what you have done is negligently \ndone in the sense that it violates either the contract requirements \nthat the manufacturer has given you for the raw material or component \npart, which obviously would be for a part or material\n\n[[Page S2570]]\n\nthat is not negligently made, or the specifications for that part that \nare issued as part of the approval process. Every one of these medical \ndevices has to go through the FDA before it can be sold and used to \nbenefit people.\n  Senator Gorton has spoken about one young girl and the extraordinary \nbenefit to her life from the shunt that was put in her brain. We had \ntestimony at a hearing I conducted from a Mr. Martin Reily of Houston, \nTX, about his young child, Thomas, who was discovered when he was 8 \nmonths old to have water on the brain, hydrocephalus. Mr. Reily said:\n\n       Jane and I will never forget the Saturday in late October \n     1985, when we learned that Thomas had hydrocephalus. We \n     initially were told that based on the level of fluid \n     accumulated on his brain and the resulting pressure, he would \n     surely have brain damage, probably severe. Surgery to place a \n     shunt in Thomas was scheduled for the first thing Monday \n     morning [2 days later]. The hours from late Saturday to \n     Monday morning were the longest and darkest we have ever \n     experienced.\n       The thought of waiting even 1 day to have the surgery was \n     almost unbearable, for each minute that passed the pressure \n     was building in Thomas' head, which could further damage him. \n     . . .\n       On Monday morning, Thomas received a shunt. Within hours, \n     he was showing improvement. His lethargy disappeared. He was \n     alert. He smiled again for the first time in weeks and even \n     stood up in his hospital crib. Within 36 hours, we were back \n     home with the new Thomas. How different the outcome would \n     have been for Thomas that day without the availability of the \n     medical device he so desperately needed.\n\n  What a miracle. Mr. Reily continues:\n\n       Six months after his original surgery, Thomas' shunt \n     clogged and required revision. In the 6 hours that Thomas \n     waited for his shunt revision surgery, he became violently \n     ill, vomiting continuously and finally becoming semi-\n     comatose. Mercifully, his revision was successful and \n     immediately he regained his old form, laughing and smiling \n     while playing games in his hospital bed. Again, how different \n     yet predictably sad and final would have been Thomas' fate \n     without this medical device. As I reflect on Thomas' brief \n     life, I see a child who has already overcome a lifetime of \n     medical difficulties.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Early on, Thomas' mother and I went through a grieving \n     process. We were grieving for the death of our vision of our \n     perfect child. It was not until we let that vision go that we \n     were able to see something much more beautiful; a young boy \n     with an indomitable yet loving spirit who will not let his \n     personal medical setbacks defeat him. I think that must be \n     surely God's spirit living inside him.\n\n  Mr. Reily concluded:\n\n       So I stand before you today, as the guardian of that \n     spirit, as Thomas' father, beseeching you to do everything in \n     your power to ensure that the biomaterials necessary for \n     Thomas' medical implant device be readily available and of \n     the highest quality. For some time in the future, perhaps \n     next month or next year, Thomas will wake me in the middle of \n     the night to tell me that his head hurts and that he thinks \n     his shunt has broken. He will ask if we can go to the \n     hospital to get a new one right away. I pray I will be able \n     to give him the only acceptable answer.\n\n  It is remarkable testimony. We had other testimony that day from a \nmost impressive woman, Peggy Phillips, who has worked for awhile as \nchief of congressional affairs for the Air Force Surgeon General, going \nto law school in the evening, getting home at 10 p.m., working until \nmidnight, and so on, office work, very busy. ``However, on November 26, \n1986,'' as she says, ``my life changed. I am told that I collapsed as I \nwalked from my office to my car. I stopped breathing. I had no pulse. I \nhad no blood flow to my brain, I was clinically dead.''\n  The story ends happily. She agreed to have an automatic implantable \ncardioverter defibrillator put into her stomach.\n  ``Following a few minor adjustments,'' she says, ``life with the AICD \nhas not been much different than before.'' She goes on to document \nchanges that have occurred, and appeals to us to make sure that some of \nthe simple parts of that AICD, which keeps her going, monitors her \nheartbeat, gives her a shock when there is a danger that her heart is \ngoing to stop, keeping her alive--that flow of materials is not going \nto stop.\n  These are consumers. Does this help business? It helps the businesses \nthat make the medical devices; it helps Thomas Reily; it helps Peggy \nPhillips; it helps 8 million other people who are going to be kept \nalive, allowed to live normally by these devices.\n  Earlier this morning my friend from California made some references \nabout the impact of this legislation--somewhat on breast implant cases \nwhich I have spoken to earlier--but on women generally. I do want to \nput into the Record a statement here. I am going quote from it.\n  Phyllis Greenburger, who is the executive director of a group called \nthe Society for the Advancement of Women's Health Research, testified \non April 4, 1995, to that same Senate subcommittee, that, `` * * * the \ncurrent liability climate is preventing women from receiving the full \nbenefits that science and medicine can provide. That,'' she says, ``is \nthe reason I am here before you today.''\n  She went on to say:\n\n       . . . there is evidence that maintaining the current \n     liability system harms the advancement of women's health \n     research.\n\n  She completed her testimony by stating:\n\n       Manufacturers of raw materials, unwilling to risk lawsuits, \n     are limiting, and in some cases, terminating the sale of \n     their product for use in an implantable medical device. . . . \n     The threat to health is further magnified in cases where \n     suitable substitute materials are not available.\n       Women may be disproportionately impacted by such a shortage \n     simply because they live longer than men, and as a result, \n     suffer more from chronic disease, increasing their chances of \n     needing a medical device, such as hip or joint replacements. \n     For those of us currently in good health, the loss of these \n     substances seems inconsequential. Yet for those like Peggy \n     Phillips . . . [Whom I spoke of before] and others suffering \n     from osteoporosis, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, \n     and other diseases, access to a full range of medical \n     devices is crucial.\n\n  I wonder if I might ask the Senator from Washington for 5 more \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Nebraska also wishes to speak on our \nside. Will the Senator from Connecticut settle for 2?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will settle for 3.\n  Mr. GORTON. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. A study by the Committee for Contraceptive \nDevelopment, jointly staffed and administered by the National Research \nCouncil and the Institute of Medicine, found that only one major U.S. \npharmaceutical company still invests in contraceptive research. Why? \nThe study blamed the legal climate, fear of lawsuits, for this \nsituation. H.R. 956, this bill before us, would make these drugs and \nother medical devices more available.\n  We have said over and over again, this bill protects the right of an \ninjured plaintiff to get full recovery for damages, cost of medical \ncare, loss of wages, any other provable item. It goes beyond, and says \nyou can get recovery for noneconomic losses, intangibles like pain and \nsuffering, from those who are responsible for the negligence.\n  It simply puts a small limit on punitive damages. In doing so, yes, \nit helps some businesses expand, provide the miraculous products I have \ntalked about, sell products for less; but it helps millions of other \npeople. In a way, the beneficiaries of this legislation are not so \nvisible. That is why I read from this testimony. But they, and millions \nand millions of others of them, are counting on us to pass this bill to \nbring balance and trust back to our legal system.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me just for a minute respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will yield to the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut is very persuasive and I \nwanted to answer these pleading comments about ``walking down the \nstreet'' and ``everybody knows the litigation system is in disrepair.'' \nAbsolutely false, with respect to the civil justice system.\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\n  We have all seen the O.J. case and that jury of 12 let him go. But \nthe American public jury did not let him go. Everybody knows that.\n  We have, here, just this past week, March 18, U.S. News & World \nReport:\n\n       In New York City, a movement is under way to impeach \n     Criminal Court Judge Laurin Duckman. A 33-year-old woman \n     sought court protection from a former boyfriend, a convicted \n     rapist, who had attacked her three times. Despite the \n     beatings, Judge Duckman coolly noted that the woman was \n     ``bruised but not disfigured,'' lowered bail in the case and \n     suggested that the man would stop bothering the woman if she \n     gave back his dog. Three weeks later, the man shot her to \n     death.\n\n  In another case:\n\n       Police in a high-activity drug area at 5 a.m. noticed a \n     slowly moving car with out-of-state plates. The car stopped, \n     the driver popped the hood of the trunk and four men placed \n     two large duffel bags inside. When police approached, the men \n     moved away rapidly in different directions. One ran. Police \n     searched the trunk and found 80 pounds of cocaine. The \n     driver, a Michigan woman, confessed in a 40-minute videotaped \n     statement, saying that this was just one of more than 20 \n     large drug buys she had made in Manhattan. But Judge Baer \n     ruled that police had conducted an unreasonable search. What \n     about the men bolting from the scene? Since residents in the \n     area regard cops as corrupt and abusive, opined the judge, it \n     would have been unusual if the men hadn't run away, so \n     fleeing was no cause for a search. In other words, the perps \n     had reason to be suspicious of police, but police had no \n     reason to be suspicious of the perps.\n  Come on. I ask unanimous consent to have this list of cases printed \nin the Record\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We are all disturbed about the criminal court system. \nBut not, where the distinguished Senator from Connecticut served as the \nmajority leader in the State legislature of Connecticut, he acts--\n``walking down the street,'' that he is the only one walking down the \nstreet talking.\n  Come on. We even had one former member went up as Governor and pull \nan income tax on the people of Connecticut, Governor Weicker. The \npeople of Connecticut will respond, with leadership. And they do have a \nproduct liability statute in that State.\n  But these folks come and talk about fair. ``Yes, I hope I can \ncertainly get this shot so I can continue breathing.'' I mean, grown \nfolks, men and women in the U.S. Senate, acting like this? That case \nwould be thrown out. Talking about what is not good for the consumer, \ngood for business.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record ``Suing For \nSafety.'' It is by Thomas Lambert, Jr. I ask to have this printed in \nthe Record, included with the ``Stupid Court Tricks.'' Include them \nboth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that ``Suing for Safety'' gives case \nafter case after case where it had not been good for the consumer. The \nconsumer had to get a trial lawyer, had to go before 12 jurors in his \ncommunity, had to go up on appeal and pay all the court costs and \nfinally get a verdict.\n  Why is it good for the consumer and good for the business? On account \nof product liability. We have it at the State level, and it is working. \nThat is why I put that case in the Record.\n  We know what business does. Some businesses will cut corners, they \nwill not give warnings, they try to save money. Everybody knows there \nwere a few dollars in the Pinto case. Now we see time and again, week \nafter week, recalls. They just recalled one of my cars to put another \nsafety device on.\n  Why do you think that was done? On account of the trial lawyers. \nProduct liability. That is why they have done it, and everybody in the \nSenate knows it. But the little poll says get rid of the lawyers, like \nDick the Butcher in Henry VI, ``Kill all the lawyers.'' That is a \npopular thing.\n  So that is what we have. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From U.S. News & World Report, Mar. 18, 1996]\n\n                          Stupid Court Tricks\n\n                             (By John Leo)\n\n       Some judges and some judges' decisions are better than \n     others. Here are some others:\n       In New York City, a movement is under way to impeach \n     Criminal Court Judge Laurin Duckman. A 33-year-old woman \n     sought court protection from a former boyfriend, a convicted \n     rapist, who had attacked her three times. Despite the \n     beatings, Judge Duckman coolly noted that the woman was \n     ``bruised but not disfigured,'' lowered bail in the case and \n     suggested that the man would stop bothering the woman if she \n     gave back his dog. Three weeks later, the man shot her to \n     death. In another domestic violence case, Judge Duckman \n     allowed a beater to go free hours after a jury had found him \n     guilty. Last month, the man was charged with another attack \n     on the same woman.\n       North of the border, the loopiest judicial decision of the \n     year came when the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that \n     drunkenness was a defense against rape charges. It ordered a \n     new trial for a Montreal man who had been convicted of \n     sexually assaulting a 65-year-old woman in a wheelchair. The \n     court predicted that the alcohol defense would be rare, but \n     within weeks drunks and addicts were being acquitted across \n     Canada. Sanity prevailed, however. Parliament passed a law \n     banning the drunkenness defense.\n       Judge Rosemary Barkett, a Clinton appointee, has brought \n     sexual harassment litigation into the fifth grade. Writing \n     for the majority on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals last \n     month, she said that the mother of a fifth grader who was \n     repeatedly pestered by another fifth grader could sue the \n     school district under Title IX of the 1972 Education \n     Amendments. In a recent dissent in another case, Barkett \n     implied that a statute requiring drug tests for some state \n     jobs in Georgia may violate the First Amendment by seeking to \n     keep persons ``who might disagree with the current policy \n     criminalizing drug use'' out of government.\n       Another Clinton appointee, Judge Harold Baer, caused a \n     spreading uproar with his colorful botching of a drug case. \n     Police in a high-activity drug area at 5 a.m. noticed a \n     slowly moving car with out-of-state plates. The car stopped, \n     the driver popped the hood of the trunk and four men placed \n     two large duffel bags inside. When police approached, the men \n     moved away rapidly in different directions. One ran. Police \n     searched the trunk and found 80 pounds of cocaine. The \n     driver, a Michigan woman, confessed in a 40-minute videotaped \n     statement, saying that this was just one of more than 20 \n     large drug buys she had made in Manhattan. But Judge Baer \n     ruled that police had conducted an unreasonable search. What \n     about the men bolting from the scene? Since residents in the \n     area regard cops as corrupt and abusive, opined the judge, it \n     would have been unusual if the men hadn't run away, so \n     fleeing was no cause for a search. In other words, the perps \n     had reason to be suspicious of police, but police had no \n     reason to be suspicious of the perps. Since the confession \n     stemmed from the search, Baer threw it out. The prevailing \n     New York opinion: Judge Baer is an idiot.\n       Can the state legally confiscate the property of innocent \n     people? The U.S. Supreme Court said yes this month in a \n     Detroit case. A 5-to-4 ruling allowed confiscation of a 1977 \n     Pontiac half-owned by a woman after her husband was arrested \n     for having sex with a prostitute in the car. The Wayne County \n     prosecutor's office had sued to confiscate the car under \n     Michigan's public nuisance statutes. In a dry dissent, \n     Justice John Paul Stevens said that until this case, no state \n     had ``decided to experiment with the punishment of innocent \n     third parties.''\n       In a notably tortured decision, the federal 10th Circuit \n     Court of Appeals ruled that a male prisoner who wishes to \n     become a female is not entitled to get hormone injections at \n     public expense under the 14th Amendment, but he may be \n     entitled to them under the Eighth Amendment, which bans cruel \n     and unusual punishment.\n       Much egg on is on the faces of federal judges of the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals for their handling of the Rodney \n     Hamrick case. While serving prison time for threatening the \n     life of President Reagan, Hamrick built five bombs and \n     threatened to blow up a courthouse, an airplane and NAACP \n     headquarters. While serving more time for threatening to kill \n     the judge in his case, he built and mailed a bomb to a U.S. \n     attorney who had prosecuted him. The bomb fizzled, scorching \n     the envelope but not detonating. Hamrick was convicted, but a \n     three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed the \n     conviction on grounds that the bomb was not a deadly or \n     dangerous weapon because it had been badly built. This \n     decision flew in the face of a relevant Supreme Court ruling \n     that even an unloaded gun could be considered dangerous. For \n     some strange reason, Solicitor General Drew Days did not \n     request a rehearing on the Hamrick ruling by all the judges \n     of the entire Fourth Circuit. But the judges decided to do so \n     on their own, and they narrowly upheld Hamrick's conviction. \n     Eight judges thought that the faulty bomb qualified as \n     dangerous, while six judges disagreed. No word yet from Drew \n     Davis. Is anybody in charge here?\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the Trial magazine, November 1983]\n\n                            Suing for Safety\n\n                      (By Thomas F. Lambert, Jr.)\n\n       It has been well and truly said, ``If you would plant for a \n     year, plant grain; for a decade, plant trees; but if you \n     would plant for eternity, educate a man.'' For nearly four \n     generations, ATLA has been teaching its men and women, and \n     they have been demonstrating to one another, that you can sue \n     for safety. Indeed, one of the most practical measures for \n     cutting down accidents and injuries in the field of product \n     failure is a successful lawsuit against the supplier of the\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\n     flawed product. Here, as well as elsewhere in Tort Law, \n     immunity breeds irresponsibility while liability induces the \n     taking of preventive vigilence. The best way to make a \n     merchant responsible is to make him accountable for harms \n     caused by his defective products. The responsible merchant is \n     the answerable merchant.\n       Harm is the tort signature. The primary aim at Tort Law, of \n     the civil liability system, is compensation for harm. Tort \n     law also has a secondary, auxiliary and supportive function--\n     the accident prevention function or prophylactic purpose of \n     tort law--sometimes called the deterrent or admonitory \n     function. Accident prevention, or course, is even better than \n     accident compensation, an insight leading to ATLA's \n     longstanding credo: ``A Fence at the Top of the Cliff Is \n     Better Than an Ambulance in the Valley Below.''\n       As trial lawyers say, however, ``If you would fortify, \n     specify.'' The proposition that you can sue for safety is \n     readily demonstratable because it is laced and leavened with \n     specifics. They swarm as easily to mind as leaves to the \n     trees.\n\n\naccident prevention through successful suits in the products liability \n                                 field\n\n       (1) Case for Charcoal Briquets Causing Death from Carbon \n     Monoxide. Liability was imposed on the manufacturer of \n     charcoal briquets for the carbon monoxide death and injury of \n     young men who used the briquets indoors to heat an unvented \n     mountain cabin. The 10-pound bags read, ``Quick to Give Off \n     Heat'' and ``Ideal for Cooking in or Out of Doors.'' The \n     manufacturer was guilty of failure to warn of a lethal latent \n     danger. Any misuse of the product was foreseeable because it \n     was virtually invited. Next time you stop in at the local \n     supermarket or hardware store, glance at the label on the \n     bags of charcoal briquets. In large capital letters you will \n     find the following: ``WARNING. DO NOT USE FOR INDOOR HEATING \n     OR COOKING UNLESS VENTILATION IS PROVIDED FOR EXHAUSTING \n     FUMES TO OUTSIDE. TOXIC FUMES MAY ACCUMULATE AND CAUSE \n     DEATH.'' Liability here inspired and exacted a harder, more \n     emphatic warning, once again reducing the level of excessive \n     preventable danger.\n       (2) Case of the Exploding Cans of Draino. When granular \n     Drano is combined with water, its caustic soda interacts with \n     aluminum, another ingredient in its formula and produces \n     intensive heat converting any water into steam at a rapid \n     rate. If the mixture is confined, the pressure builds up \n     until an explosion results. The manufacturer's use of a \n     screw-on top in the teeth of such well known hazard was a \n     design for tragedy. The expectable came to pass (as is the \n     fashion with expectability). In Moore v. Jewel Tea Co., a 48-\n     year-old housewife suffered total blindness from the \n     explosion of a Drano can with a screw-on top, eventuating in \n     a $900,000 compensatory and $10,000 punitive award to the \n     wife and a $20,000 award to her husband for loss of conjugal \n     fellowship.\n       A high school chemistry student could see that what was \n     needed was a ``flip top'' or ``snap cap'' designed to come \n     off at a pressure of, say, 15-20 pounds per square inch. \n     After a series of adverse judgments, the manufacturer \n     substituted the safer flip top. Of course, even the Drano \n     flip top will be marked for failure if not accompanied by \n     adequate testing and quality control. Capers involved a suit \n     for irreversible blindness suffered by 10-year-old Joe Capers \n     when the redesigned flip top of a can of Drano failed to snap \n     off when the can fell into the bathtub and the caustic \n     contents spurted 8\\1/2\\ feet high impacting Joe in the face \n     and eyes with resulting total blindness. The shortcomings in \n     testing the can with the reformulated design cost the company \n     an award of $805,000. As a great Torts scholar has said, \n     ``Defective products should be scrapped in the factory, not \n     dodged in the home.''\n       Drayton v. Jiffee Chemical Corp., is a grim and striking \n     companion case to the Drano decisions mentioned above, and it \n     underscores the same engineering verities of those cases: the \n     place to design out dangers is on the drawing boards or when \n     prescribing the chemical formula. A one-year-old black girl \n     suffered horrendous facial injuries, ``saponification'' or \n     fusion of her facial features, when an uncapped container of \n     Liquid-Plumr was inadvertently tipped over. At the time of \n     the accident, this excessively and unnecessarily caustic \n     drain cleaner was composed of 26 percent sodium hydroxide, \n     i.e., lye. No antidote existed because, as the manufacturer \n     knew, Liquid-Plumr would dissolve human tissue in a fraction \n     of a second. To a child (or any human being) a chemical bath \n     of this drain cleaner could be as disfiguring as falling into \n     a pool of piranha fish. Liquid-Plumr, mind you, was a \n     household product, which means that its expectable \n     environment of use must contemplate the ``patter of little \n     feet,'' as the children's hour in the American home \n     encompasses 24 hours of the day.\n       At the time of marketing this highly caustic drain cleaner, \n     having made no tests as to its effect on human tissue, within \n     the existing state of the art, the defendant could have \n     reformulated the design to use 5 percent potassium hydroxide \n     which would have been less expensive, just as effective and \n     much safer. After some 59 other Liquid-Plumr injuries were \n     reported to defendant, it finally reformulated its design to \n     produce a safer product. In Drayton the defendant was allowed \n     to argue in defense and mitigation that its management was \n     new, that it had learned from its prior claims and litigation \n     experience and that it had purged the enterprise of its prior \n     egregious misconduct.\n       To open the courtroom door is often to open a school door \n     for predatory producers.\n       (3) Case of the Tip-Over Steam Vaporizer. A tip-over steam \n     vaporizer, true to that ominous description, was upset by a \n     little girl who tripped over the unit's electric outlet cord \n     on the way to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The \n     sudden spillage of scalding water in the vaporizer's glass \n     jar severely burned the 3-year-old child. The worst injuries \n     in the world are burn injuries. The cause of the catastrophe \n     was a loose-lidded top which could have been eliminated by \n     adopting any one of several accessible, safe, practical, \n     available, desirable and feasible design alternatives, such \n     as a screw-on or child-guard top. The truth is that the \n     manufacturer, Hankscraft, had experienced a dozen prior \n     similar disasters. In the instant case, the little girl \n     recovered a $150,000 judgment against the heedless \n     manufacturer, impeaching the vaporizer's design because of \n     lack of a screw-on or child-guard top. When the manufacturer, \n     with icy indifference to the serious risks to infant users of \n     its household product refused to take its liability carrier's \n     advice to recall and redesign its loose-lidded vaporizer, \n     persisting in its stubborn refusal when over 100 claims had \n     been filed against it, the carrier finally balked and refused \n     to continue coverage unless the company would recall and \n     redesign. Then and only then did Hankscraft stir itself to \n     redeem and correct the faulty design of its product, \n     thereafter proudly proclaiming (and I quote), ``Cover-lock \n     top protects against sudden spillage if accidentally \n     tipped.'' Once again Tort Law had to play professor and \n     policeman and teach another manufacturer that safety does not \n     cost: It pays. Under what might be called the Cost-Cost \n     formula, the manufacturer will add safety features when it \n     comes to understand that the cost of accidents is greater \n     than the cost of their prevention. The Tip-Over Steam \n     Vaporizer case is the most graphic example known to use \n     showing that corporate management can be recalled to its \n     social responsibilities by threat of stringent liability, \n     enhanced by deserved civil punishment via punitive \n     damages, and that belief in such a proposition is more \n     than an ivory tower illusion.\n       A good companion case to the Tip-Over-Steam-Vaporizer case, \n     serving the same Tort Touchstone of Deterrence, is the \n     supremely instructive Case of the Remington Mohawk 600 Rifle. \n     While a 14-year-old boy was seeking to unload one of these \n     rifles, pushing the safety to the ``off'' position as \n     required for the purpose, the rifle discharged with the \n     bullet entering the boy's father's back, leaving him \n     paralyzed and near death for a long time. The agony of his \n     guilt, his feeling that he was to blame for his father's \n     devastating injuries, pressed down on the boy's brow like a \n     crown of thorns and almost unhinged his sanity. Assiduous \n     investigation by the family's lawyer unearthed expert \n     evidence of unsafe design and construction and lax quality \n     control of the safety selector and trigger assemblies of the \n     Mohawk 600.\n       The result of the exertions of the plaintiff's lawyer, \n     deeply and redoubtedly involved in challenging the safety \n     history of the rifle model, was a capitulation by Remington \n     and an agreement to settle the father's claim (he was a \n     seasoned and successful defense trial lawyer) for $6.8 \n     million. Remington also wrote the son a letter, muting some \n     of his anguish by stating that the weapon was the whole \n     problem and that he was in no way responsible for his \n     father's injuries. Then, facing the threat of cancelled \n     coverage from its carriers for skyrocketing premiums in the \n     projection of other multimillion dollar awards, Remington \n     commendably served the public interest by announcing the \n     recall campaign in which we see another electrifying example \n     of Tort Law litigating another hazardous product feature from \n     the market.\n       Remington's nationwide recall program affected 200,000 \n     firearms; notices in newspapers and magazines similar to this \n     one that appeared in the January 1979 issue of Field and \n     Stream cut back on the harvest of hurt and heartbreak: \n     ``IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO OWNERS OF REMINGTON MODEL 600 AND 660 \n     RIFLES, MOHAWK 600 RIFLES, AND XP-100 PISTOLS. Under certain \n     unusual circumstances, the safety selector and trigger of \n     these firearms could be manipulated in a way that could \n     result in accidental discharge. The installation of a new \n     trigger assembly will remedy this situation. Remington is \n     therefore recalling all Model 600 rifles except those with a \n     serial number starting with an `A' . . . Remington recommends \n     that prior to any further usage of guns included in the \n     recall, they be inspected and modified if necessary. \n     [Directions are then given for obtaining name and address of \n     nearest Remington Recommended Gunsmith who would perform the \n     inspection and modification service free of charge.].''\n       Tort Law forced Remington to look down the barrel and see \n     what it was up against. Once again Tort Law was the death \n     knell to excessive preventable danger.\n       For a wonderfully absorbing account of the Mohawk 600, see \n     Stuart M. Speiser's justly praised Lawsuit (Horizon Press, \n     New York, 1980) 348-55.\n       (4) Case of MER/29, the Anti-Cholesterol Drug Which Turned \n     out to Cause Cataracts. Many trial lawyers will recall the \n     prescription drug MER/29 marketed for its benign and \n     benevolent effect in lowering blood cholesterol levels and \n     treating hardening of the\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\n     arteries but which turned out to have an unpleasant and \n     unbargained-for effect on users, the risk of causing \n     cataracts. As Peter DeVries recently observed, ``There is \n     nothing like a calamity to help us fight our troubles.'' \n     Blatant fraud and suppression of evidence from animal \n     experiments were proved on the manufacturer's part in the \n     marketing of this dangerous drug. Who did more--the federal \n     government or private trial lawyers--in getting this \n     dangerous drug off the market and compensating the numerous \n     victims left in its wake? The question carries its own \n     answer. The United States drug industry has annual sales of \n     16 billion dollars per year, while the Food and Drug \n     Administration has an annual budget of 65 million dollars to \n     oversee all drug manufacture, production and safety. How \n     can the foothills keep the Alps under surveillance? Worse, \n     as shown by the MER/29 experience, enforcement of the law \n     in that situation, far from being vigorous and vigilant, \n     was lame, limp and lack-luster. It was only private suits \n     advanced by trial lawyers that furnished the real muscle \n     of enforcement and sanction, compensation for victims, \n     deterrence of wrongdoing, and discouragement of corporate \n     attitudes toward the public recalling that attributed to \n     Commodore Vanderbilt.\n       As to the indispensible role and mission of the trial \n     lawyer in Suing for Safety, it should not be overlooked that \n     the current Administration has moved to sharply restrict the \n     regulation of product safety by the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission. The 1982 budget for the commission was reduced by \n     30 percent in the first round of Reagan Administration budget \n     cuts and is marked for further cuts in the future.\n       As the Thalidomide, MER/29, Dalkon Shield, Asbestos, DES, \n     Slip-into-Reverse Transmissions and Fuel Tank scandals have \n     been starkly revealed, we have crime in the suites as well as \n     crime in the streets. Corporate culpability calls for \n     corporate accountability, and our society has developed no \n     better instrument to encourage socially responsible corporate \n     behavior than the vehicle of adverse judgments beefed up by \n     punitive damages. In the MER/29 situation, for example, the \n     criminal fines levied on the corporate producer and its \n     executives were slap-on-the-wrist trivial when contrasted \n     with the deterrent impact of punitive damage awards in \n     current uncrashworthiness cases where flagrant corporate \n     indifference to public safety was established.\n       Our leading scholar in the field of punitive damages, \n     writing with verve and virtuosity on that subject, concluded \n     in 1976 that punitive damages awards should be permitted in \n     appropriate products liability cases. Writing in 1982 with \n     the same unbeatable authority, Professor David G. Owen traces \n     the ferment and developments of doctrine in the ensuing years \n     and then delivers a conclusion informed by exhaustive \n     research, seasoned reflection, and an obvious morality of \n     mind. ``I remain convinced of the need to retain this tool of \n     legal control over corporate abuses. . . .''\n       (5) Case of the Infant Who Died from Drinking Toxic \n     Furniture Polish Where Manufacturer Failed to Warn Mother to \n     Keep Toxic Product out of Reach of Children. This is the \n     celebrated case of Spruill v. Boyle-Midway, Inc., in which a \n     14-month-old child reach over from his crib and pulled a \n     doily off a bureau, causing a bottle of Old English Red Oil \n     Furniture Polish, manufactured by the defendant, to fall into \n     the toddler's crib. During the few minutes his mother was out \n     of the room, the baby got the cap off the bottle and drank a \n     little bit of the polish. He was dead within two days of \n     resulting chemical pneumonia. The bottle had a separate \n     warning about combustibility in letters \\1/8\\ inch high, but \n     only in the midst of other text entitled ``Directions'' in \n     letters \\1/32\\ inch high did it say ``contains refined \n     petroleum distillates. May be harmful if swallowed, \n     especially by children.'' The mother testified that she saw \n     the warning about combustibility but did not read the \n     directions because she knew how to use furniture polish. In a \n     negligence action against the maker, the jury found that both \n     defendant and the baby's mother were negligent and awarded \n     wrongful death damages to the child's father and siblings but \n     not to the mother. The Fourth Circuit in keeping with the \n     grain of modern authority held that it was irrelevant that \n     the child's ingestion of the toxic polish was an unintended \n     use of the product. The jury could properly find that in the \n     absence of an adequate warning to the mother that she could \n     read and heed--to keep the polish out of the reach of \n     children--such misuse of the product was a foreseeable one. \n     The defect was to be tested not only by intended uses but by \n     foreseeable misuses.\n       The jury could find that the manufacturer's placement of \n     the warning was designed more to conceal than reveal, \n     especially in view of the grater prominence given the fire \n     warning (\\1/8\\ of an inch compared to the Lilliputian print, \n     \\1/32\\ of an inch, as to the contents containing ``refined \n     petroleum distillates''). The poison warning could be found \n     to fall short to what was required to convey to the average \n     person the dangerous nature of this household product. The \n     label suggested that harm from drinking the polish was not \n     certain but merely possible, while experts on both sides \n     agreed that a single teaspoon would be lethal to children.\n       The warning in short could properly be found to be \n     inadequate--too soft, mispositioned and not sufficiently eye-\n     arresting. Defendant admitted in answer to interrogatories \n     that it knew of 32 prior cases of poisoning from ingestion of \n     its ``Old English Red Polish.''\n       Did the imposition of liability in this seminal Spruill \n     case supra stimulate, goad or spur the manufacturer to take \n     safety measures against the foreseeable risk of ingestion by \n     innocent children? A trip to the local hardware store a \n     couples of days ago reveals that Old English Red Oil Polish \n     now sports the following on its label: ``DANGER HARMFUL OR \n     FATAL IF SWALLOWED. COMBUSTIBLE. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF \n     CHILDREN. SAFETY CAP.''\n       An error is not a mistake unless you refuse to correct it.\n       (6) Case Holding Manufacturer of PAM (Intended to Keep Food \n     from Sticking to Cooking Surfaces) Liable for Death of Teen-\n     Ager from Inhalation of PAM's Concentrated Vapors. Harless v. \n     Boyle-Midway Div. of Amer. Home Products, involved an \n     increasing number of teenagers who were dying of a ``glue-\n     sniffing syndrome,'' inhaling the concentrated vapors of PAM, \n     a household product intended to keep food from sticking to \n     cooking surfaces. Originally, the manufacturer used only a \n     soft warning on the can's label: ``Avoid direct inhalation of \n     concentrated vapors. Keep out of the reach of children.'' \n     However, to the knowledge of defendant, the children \n     continued sniffing and dying. Then the manufacturer, as an \n     increasing number of lawsuits were pressed upon it for the \n     preventable deaths of such children, changed the warning on \n     its labels. shifting to harder warning: ``CAUTION: Use only \n     as directed, intentional misuse by deliberately concentrating \n     and inhaling the contents can be fatal.'' This was, of \n     course, a much harder and more emphatic warning. The Fifth \n     Circuit held that it was reversible error to exclude \n     plaintiff's evidence (in an action for the wrongful death of \n     a PAM-sniffing 14-year-old) that no deaths had occurred from \n     PAM sniffing after the defendant had hardened its warning by \n     warning against the danger of death, the ultimate trauma.\n       On remand the jury brought in a verdict for the boy's \n     estate in the amount of $585,000 with an additional finding \n     by the jury that the lad's administrator was entitled to an \n     award of punitive damages. Prior to the punitive damages \n     suit, the case was settled for a total of $1.25 million. It \n     was uncontested that prior to the lad's death the \n     manufacturer knew of 45 inhalation deaths from foreseeable \n     misuse of its product, and upon remand admitted to an \n     additional 68 from the same expectable cause.\n       If you will examine the label on the can of PAM on your \n     shelf, as the writer has just done, you will find: ``WARNING: \n     USE ONLY AS DIRECTED. INTENTIONAL MISUSE BY DELIBERATELY \n     CONCENTRATING AND INHALING THE CONTENTS CAN BE HARMFUL OR \n     FATAL.'' Once again the pressures of liability stimulated a \n     producer to avoid excessive preventable dangers in its \n     product's use by strengthening its warning label, thereby \n     enhancing consumer protection.\n       (7) Case of the Poisonous Insecticide Holding That Warnings \n     Must Contain Appropriate Symbols. Such as Skull and \n     Crossbones, Where Manufacturer knows That Product May Be Used \n     by Illiterate Workers (Spanish-Speaking Imported Puerto Rican \n     Laborers) Who Would Not Understand English. This is the \n     salutary holding in the celebrated case of Hubbard-Hall Chem. \n     Co. v. Silverman. The First Circuit upheld judgments entered \n     on jury verdicts for the wrongful death of two illiterate \n     migrant farm workers who were imported by a Massachusetts \n     tobacco farmer and killed by contact with a highly toxic \n     insecticide manufactured and distributed by defendant. Even \n     though the comprehensive and detailed danger warnings on the \n     sacks fully complied with label requirements of the \n     Department of Agriculture, the jury could properly find that \n     because of the lack of a skull or crossbones or other \n     comparable symbols the warning was inadequate. Use of the \n     admittedly dangerous product by persons who were of limited \n     education and reading ability was within the range of \n     apprehension of the manufacturer. While evidence of \n     compliance with governmental regulations was admissible, it \n     was not decisive. Governmental standards are ``minimums,'' a \n     floor not a ceiling, and so far as adequate precautions are \n     concerned, federal regulations do not oust the possibly \n     higher common-law standards of the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts.\n       The steady, unflagging pressures of litigation against the \n     inertia, complacency and moral obtuseness of manufacturers \n     have not only resulted in enhanced safety in the field of \n     conscious design choices (substituting child-guard screw-on \n     tops on tip-over steam vaporizers or over-the-axle fuel tanks \n     for those mispositioned more vulnerably in front of the axle \n     or adding rear-view mirrors to blind behemothic earth-moving \n     machines whose design obstructs the vision of a reversing \n     operator, etc.) But also in inducing product suppliers to \n     reduce marketing defects in the products they sell by \n     strengthening the adequacy of the instructions and warnings \n     that accompany their products set afloat in the stream of \n     commerce.\n       The net effect of such benign and beneficial litigation has \n     been to improve the adequacy and efficacy of the educational \n     information given to consumers by producers via improvements \n     in the conspicuousness of warnings given; making them more \n     prominent, eye-arresting, comprehensive, complete and \n     emphatic; placing the warnings in more effective locations; \n     avoiding ambiguous warning; extending warnings to the safe \n     disposition of the product; and avoiding any dilution of the \n     warnings given. In short, the\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\n     bottom line, as indicated in the cited representative \n     sampling of cases, is that successful lawsuits operate as \n     safety incentives to ``inspire'' product suppliers to furnish \n     instructions and warnings that are in ratio to the risk and \n     in proportion to the perils attending foreseeable uses of the \n     marketed products.\n       Here, too, we see the conspicuous usefulness of the lawsuit \n     as the weapon for ferreting out marketing defects, whether \n     ingenious or ingenuous, in selling dangerously defective \n     products.\n       (8) Case of Marketing Carbon Tetrochloride Using Warnings \n     Found to Be Inadequate Because Inconspicuous. Suppose a \n     defendant sells carbon tetrachloride and places on all four \n     sides of the can, in large letters, the words ``Safety \n     Kleen,'' and then uses small letters (Lippiputian print) to \n     warn of the serious risk of using the cleaning fluid in an \n     unventialated place (of places the fine print warning only on \n     the bottom of the can). It requires no tongue of prophecy to \n     predict that this warning will be found inadequate because \n     too inconspicuous. It was so held in Maize v. Atlantic \n     Refining Co. Not only was the warning inadequate because \n     not conspicuous enough, but the representation of safety \n     (``Safety Kleen'') operated to dilute, weaken, and \n     counteract the warning. Moreover, in Tampa Drug Co. v. \n     Wait, the court upheld a judgment for the wrongful death \n     of a 38-year-old husband who died from carbon \n     tetrachloride poisoning after using a jug of the product \n     to clean the floors of his home. While the label warned \n     that the vapor from the liquid was harmful and that \n     prolonged breathing of it or repeated contact with the \n     skin should be avoided and that the product should only be \n     used in well ventilated areas, the court with laser-beam \n     accuracy ruled that the warning nonetheless could be found \n     inadequate because of its failure to warn with qualitative \n     sufficiency as to deadly effects or fatal potentialities \n     which might follow from exposure to its fumes.\n       Decisions such as Maize and Wait supra were the prologue \n     and predicate for the action taken by the FDA in 1970, under \n     the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, to ban and outlaw \n     carbon tetrachloride.\n       Torts archivists know that successful private lawsuits to \n     recover for harm from products simply too dangerous to be \n     sold at all, regardless of the completeness or urgency of the \n     warning given, frequently lead to a recall and reformulation \n     of the product's design or to a decision to ban the product \n     from the market. Life and limb are too important to trade off \n     against unmarketed inventory.\n       (9) Case of the 8-Year-Old Boy Who Choked to Death from \n     Strangling on a Quarter-Inch Rubber Rivet, Part of a Riviton \n     Toy Kit Given Him for Christmas. This case will indeed rivet \n     the attention (in the sense of attract, fasten and hold) of \n     concerned citizens who wish to understand how the threat of \n     liability operates as a spur to safety on the part of product \n     producers. The present example involves a toymaker whose work \n     is indeed ``child's play.''\n       Parker Brothers, a General Mills subsidiary headquartered \n     some 18 miles north of Boston, had big plans for Riviton. \n     This was a toy kit consisting of plastic parts, rubber rivets \n     and a riveting tool with which overjoyed children could put \n     together anything from a windmill to an airplane. In the \n     first year on the market in 1977, the Riviton set seemed on \n     its way to becoming one of those classic toys that parents \n     will buy everlastingly. However, one of the 450,000 \n     Riveton sets bought in 1977 ended up under the Christmas \n     tree of an 8-year-old boy in Menomonee Falls, Wis. He \n     played with it daily for three weeks. Then he put one of \n     the quarter-inch long rubber rivets into his mouth and \n     choked to death. Ten months later, with Riveton sales well \n     on their way to an expected $8.5 million for the year, a \n     second child strangled on a rivet.\n       What should the company do? Just shrug off the two fatal \n     child strangulations, ascribe the deaths to freakish \n     mischance, try to shift the blame to parental failure to \n     supervise and police their children at play, or assign \n     responsibility to the child's abnormal misuse or abuse of \n     their product? Could not the company cap its disavowal of \n     responsibility by a bromidic disclaimer that, ``After all, \n     peanuts are the greatest cause of strangulation among \n     children and nobody advocates the banning of the peanut.''\n       However, as manufacturers, Parker Brothers well knew that \n     they would be held liable to an expert's skill and knowledge \n     in the particular business of toymaking and were bound to \n     keep reasonably abreast of scientific knowledge, discoveries \n     and hazards associated with toys in their expectable \n     environment of use by unsupervised children in the home. The \n     toymaker knew that the Riveton set must be so designed and \n     accompanied by proper instructions and warnings that its \n     parts would be reasonably safe for purposes for which it was \n     intended but also for other uses which, in the hands of the \n     inexperienced, impulsive and artless children, were \n     reasonably foreseeable. When you manufacture for children, \n     you produce for the improvident, the impetuous, the \n     irresponsible. As a seasoned judge put it: ``The concept of a \n     prudent child, God forbid, is a grotesque combination.'' Much \n     must be expected from children not to be anticipated when you \n     are dealing with adults, especially the propensity of \n     children to put dangerous or toxic or air-stopping objects \n     into their mouths. The motto of childhood seems to be: ``When \n     in doubt, eat it.'' Knowledge of such childish propensity is \n     imputed to all manufacturers who produce products, especially \n     toys, which are intended for the use of or exposure to \n     children. Cases abound to document this axiom.\n       Recently, Wham-O Manufacturing Co. of San Gabriel, Calif., \n     voluntarily recalled its Water Wiggle, a garden hose \n     attachment that drowned a child when it jammed in its throat. \n     Still more recent, Mattel, Inc. of Hawthorne, Calif., \n     initiated a recall of missiles fired by it Battlestar \n     Gallactica toys when a 4-year-old boy inhaled one and died. \n     The manufacturer of a ``Play Family'' set of toy figurines \n     would have been well advised to pull from the market and \n     redesign the small carved and molded figures in the toy set, \n     intended for children of the teething age. A 14-month-old \n     child swallowed one of the toy figures 1\\3/4\\'' high and \\7/\n     8\\'' in diameter, and before it could be extricated from his \n     throat at a hospital's emergency room, the child was reduced \n     to vegetable status as a result of irreversible brain damage \n     from the toy's windpipe blockage of air supply to the brain. \n     The manufacturer's dereliction of design and lack of product \n     testing were to cost it a $3.1 million jury verdict for the \n     child and his parents.\\24\\\n       Against the marketing milieu and the legal setting sketched \n     above, what should be the proper response of Parker Brothers, \n     manufacturers of the Riviton toy set, when its executives \n     learned of the second child's death from strangulation on the \n     quarter-inch rubber rivet in the toy kit? Should they have \n     tried to tough it out or luck it out in the well known \n     lottery called ``do nothing and wait and see''? The company \n     was sensitive not only to the constraints of the law \n     (liability follows the marketing of defective products), but \n     also to the imperatives of moral duty and social \n     responsibility, and the commercial value of an untarnished \n     public image. Parker Brothers decided to halt sales and \n     recall the toy. As the company president succinctly stated, \n     ``Were we supposed to sit back and wait for death No. 3?''\n       Business, the Frenchman observed, is a combination of war \n     and sport. Tort Law pressures business to realize how \n     profitless it may provide to war against children or to \n     trifle and jest with their safety. The commendable conduct of \n     Parker Brothers in this case is one of the most striking \n     tributes we know to the deterrent value and efficacy of Tort \n     Law and the example would make a splendid case study for the \n     nation's business schools.\n       (10) Case of the Recycling Washing Machine That Pulled Out \n     a Boy's Arm. In Garcia v. Halsett, the plaintiff, an 11-year-\n     old boy, sued the owner of a coin-operated laundromat for \n     injuries inflicted while he was using one of the washing \n     machines in the launderette. He waited several minutes after \n     the machine had stopped its spin cycle before opening the \n     door to unload his clothing. As he was inserting his hand \n     into the machine a second time to remove a second handful of \n     clothes the machine suddenly recycled and started spinning, \n     entangling his arm in the clothing, causing him serious \n     resulting injuries. The evidence was clear that a common $2 \n     micro switch--feasible, desirable, long available--would have \n     prevented the accident by automatically shutting off the \n     electricity in the machine when the door was opened. The \n     reviewing court held the launderette owner strictly liable \n     for defective design because the machine lacked a necessary \n     safety device, an available micro switch. Shortly thereafter \n     the defendant obtained 12 of these micro switches and \n     installed them himself on the machines. Once again, the \n     threat of tort liability serves to deter--the prophylactic \n     purpose of Tort Law at work. The deterrent function of Tort \n     Law is not just an idea in the air; it has landing gear, has \n     come down to earth and gone to work.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       The foregoing 10 cases and categories are merely random and \n     representative examples, not intended to be complete or \n     exhaustive, of the deterrent aim and effect of Tort Law in \n     the field of product failure or disappointment.\n       It needs to be emphasized that the preventive aim of Tort \n     Law is pervasive and runs like a red thread throughout the \n     entire corpus of Torts. For example, the private Tort \n     litigation system has served, continues to serve, as an \n     effective and useful therapeutic and prophylactic tool in \n     achieving better health care for our people by discouraging \n     and thereby reducing the incidence of medical mistakes, \n     mishaps and ``misadventures.'' An error does not become a \n     mistake unless you refuse to correct it. For example, \n     successful medical malpractice suits have induced \n     hospitals and doctors to introduce such safety procedures \n     as sponge counts, electrical grounding of anesthesia \n     machines, the padding of shoulder bars on operating \n     tables, and the avoidance of colorless sterilizing \n     solutions in spinal anesthesia agents. Remember, the \n     fraudulent butchery practiced on defenseless patients by \n     the notorious Dr. John Nork was not unearthed, pilloried \n     or ended by the vigilant action of hospital \n     administrators, peer review groups, or medical societies \n     but by successful, energetically pressed malpractice \n     actions prosecuted by trial lawyers in behalf of the \n     victimized patients.\n       So we come full circle and end as we began: Accident \n     Prevention Is Better Than Accident Compensation: ``A Fence at \n     the Top of the Cliff Is Better Than an Ambulance in the \n     Valley Below.'' A successful lawsuit and the pressures of \n     stringent liability are one of the most effective means for \n     cutting down on excessive preventable dangers in our risk-\n     beleaguered society.\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\n       My hero in the foregoing chronicle of good lawyering has \n     been the hard-working trial lawyer with his care, commitment \n     and concern for public safety, the civil religion of us all.\n       He more than any other professional has proved that we can \n     indeed Sue for Safety. My tribute to him is in words Raymond \n     Chandler used to salute his hero: ``Down these mean streets a \n     man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished \n     nor afraid.''\n\n       product liability does not extend to negligent entrustment\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator from Washington yield for a \nquestion about the applicability of the bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, I would be glad to do so.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we have been seeing a lot of paper \nabout this conference reports' effects on so-called dram shop laws \nwhich allow victims of drunk driving crashes to seek recovery from \nthose individuals or establishments who negligently sell, or serve, \nalcoholic beverages to persons who are intoxicated or to minors who \nsubsequently kill or injure someone while driving under the influence.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, we have. I believe those laws can be valuable and \nhelp enhance highway safety and antidrunk driving initiatives, as well \nas encourage the responsible service of alcoholic beverages. Section \n104 of the conference report is an example of a provision in the very \nbill we are considering which tries, in a small way, to discourage \nalcohol and drug abuse in this country. Section 104 tells persons that, \nif they are drunk or on drugs and that is the principal cause of an \naccident, they will not be rewarded through the product liability \nsystem.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I agree. I am troubled that I continue to hear \nopponents of product liability reform, claim that these laws will be \nadversely affected by the proposed legislation.\n  Mr. GORTON. The short response, Senator, is these laws will not be \nadversely affected or affected in any way. The Senate Commerce \nCommittee report, which has been adopted as the legislative history of \nthe conference report, states unequivocally at page 25, footnote 90:\n\n       [T]he provisions of the Act would not cover a seller of \n     liquor in a bar who sold to a person who was intoxicated or a \n     car rental agency that rents a car to a person who is \n     obviously unfit to drive or a gun dealer that sells a firearm \n     to a ``straw man'' fronting for children or felons. These \n     actions would not be covered by the Act, because they \n     involved a claim that the product seller was negligent with \n     respect to the purchaser and not the product. Such actions \n     would continue to be governed by state law.\n\n  Clearly, H.R. 956 will not in any way affect State law regarding the \nliability of those individuals who serve additional alcohol to persons \nwho are obviously under the influence. Similarly, H.R. 956 will not \naffect State law regarding the liability of a product seller who fails \nto exercise reasonable care in selling a weapon, such as a handgun, to \na minor or known criminals. The legislation also will not affect State \nlaw regarding the liability of a rental agency that fails to exercise \nreasonable care by renting an automobile to someone who, at the time, \nis obviously unfit to drive.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I think we should say to our \ncolleagues that the product seller provision's application does not \nmean that these cases will be affected.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is absolutely correct, these cases are not \naffected. First and foremost, this is a product liability bill and it \napplies to product liability actions. Product liability actions \ngenerally involve harm caused by alleged product defect.\n  As all are aware, the harm in cases involving drunk drivers is often \nsevere, indeed, and may even mean the death of an innocent person or a \nchild. It is important, however, to avoid the misleading arguments by \nthose who oppose legal fairness and who intentionally attempt to \nconfuse product liability actions, which are covered by the conference \nreport, with negligent entrustment cases, which are not covered by the \nlegislation. As in the past, they use attention-getting, but totally \nirrelevant examples, such as drunk driving cases and gun violence.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. And that remains true, regardless of the fact that \nthe applicability section of the conference report, says that the act \napplies to ``any product liability action brought in any State or \nFederal Court on any theory for harm caused by a product.'' Is that not \nright?\n  Mr. GORTON. The reason for this broad definition is to assure that \nthe bill covers all theories of product liability, such as negligence, \nimplied warranty, and strict liability. It is not broadly defined in \norder to extend to cases beyond product liability, and certainly not to \nextend the bill to cases involving negligent entrustment, such as in \ncases involving the sale of alcohol to an obviously intoxicated \nindividual or the sale of a gun to a known felon.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, section 103 of the bill, the so-\ncalled product sellers provision, imposes liability when a product \nseller fails to exercise reasonable care with respect to a product. If \na tavern owner fails to exercise reasonable care in selling alcohol to \nan intoxicated person, would that case be subject to the bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. No. The case against the tavern owner is based on the \ntavern owner's action; it is not based on an alleged defect in the \nproduct, that is, the alcohol. Cases in which a tavern owner sells \nalcohol to an intoxicated person involve negligent entrustment and are \nnot subject to the provisions of the conference report; State law \ncontinues to apply.\n  To hold that such laws were affected by the bill would be a clear and \nobvious misconstruction of the bill. To make this clear, one only need \nlook to the acts covered by product sellers in the conference report. \nThis appears in the definition of product seller, which is set forth in \nsections 101(11)(B), 101(16)(A). H.R. 956 is applicable to product \nsellers, ``but only with respect to those aspects of a product (or \ncomponent part of a product) which are created or affected when before \nplacing the product in the stream of commerce.'' The definition then \naddresses those things where the product seller ``produces, creates, \nmakes, constructs, designs, or formulates * * * an aspect of the \nproduct * * * made by another.'' This is classic product liability and \nsimply does not apply to the negligent tavern owner.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. And would you agree with me that the ``product \nsellers'' provision, as it applies to rented or leased products \n(section 103(c)(2)) in the conference report which states that a `` \n`product liability action' means a civil action brought on any theory \nfor harm caused by a product or product use,'' cannot be interpreted to \nmean use of alcohol, or use of a gun?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. First, the clarification is only \nincluded in the rented or leased products portion of the product seller \nprovision. Thus, by way of example, in a situation where a car rental \nagency has exercised reasonable care with respect to maintaining and \ninspecting a vehicle, for example, the brakes, the engine, or the \ntires, and the person who shows up at the desk to rent the vehicle has \nan impeccable driving record, does not appear unfit to drive, and has a \nvalid driver's license. The renter then takes the car and is \nsubsequently involved in an accident. The product use language in \nsection 103(c)(2) holds that the rental company cannot be held \nvicariously liable for the negligence of the renter simply because the \ncompany owns the product and has given permission for its use.\n\n  In contrast, if the rental agency rented a car to an obviously \nintoxicated person and that person was in a subsequent accident, then \nthe rental agency would have been negligent in renting, or in \nnegligently entrusting, the car to the person who was, at the time, \nobviously intoxicated. As spelled out clearly in the legislative \nhistory, ``Such actions would continue to be governed by State law,'' \nand are not subject to H.R. 956.\n  Thus, even in the renter and lessor context, the distinction comes \ndown to whether the seller was negligent as to the product, such as by \nfailing to inspect the brakes, or negligent as to the person, such as \nby renting to a person with no driver's license and a notorious \ncriminal record. H.R. 956 covers product liability actions; it does not \ncover negligent entrustment actions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Thank you for that discussion. I hope it will help \ncounter some of the misinformation that has been circulating regarding \nthis provision. Is there any special provision of the bill that \nemphasizes what you have said here today?\n  Mr. GORTON. In fact, in order to address these very concerns you have\n\n[[Page S2576]]\n\nthoughtfully raised, Senator, the product seller section specifically \nprovides that the conference report does not cover negligent \nentrustment or negligence in selling, leasing or renting to an \ninappropriate party. Section 103(d) expressly states: ``A civil action \nfor negligent entrustment shall not be subject to the provisions of \nthis Act, but shall be subject to any applicable State law.'' Frankly, \nI believe this provision is superfluous, and for this reason, it does \nnot matter if, or where the provision appears in the conference report.\n  In sum, the product liability bill covers product liability, not \nnegligent entrustment or failure to exercise reasonable care with \nregard to whom products are sold, rented or leased. H.R. 956 clearly \nwould not cover ``a seller of liquor in a bar who sold to a person who \nwas intoxicated or a car rental agency that rents a car to a person who \nis obviously unfit to drive or a gun dealer that sells a firearm to a \n`straw man' fronting for children or felons.''\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 956, a \nbill to reform product liability law.\n  A few months ago, the 104th Congress took the first momentous step \ntoward legal reform. Over President Clinton's veto, we passed H.R. \n1056, a bill to reform securities litigation.\n  This legislation will significantly curb the epidemic of frivolous \nlawsuits that are diverting our Nation's resources away from productive \nactivity and into transaction costs.\n  In passing H.R. 956, the Senate will be taking an equally important \nsecond step on the road toward a sane legal regime of civil justice.\n  Our current legal system, under which we spend $300 billion or 4.5 \npercent of our gross domestic product each year, is not just broken, it \nis falling apart.\n  This is a system in which plaintiffs receive less than half of every \ndollar spent on litigation-related costs. It is a system that forces \nnecessary goods, such as pharmaceuticals that can treat a number of \ndebilitating diseases and conditions, off the market in this country.\n  This is a system in which neighbors are turned into litigants. I was \nparticularly struck by a recent example reported in the Washington \nPost. This case involved two 3-year-old children whose mothers could \nnot settle a sandbox dispute--literally, a pre-school altercation in \nthe sandbox--without going to court.\n  Something must be done about this situation and this litigious \npsychology, Mr. President, and this bill puts us on the road to real, \nsubstantive reform.\n  It institutes caps on punitive damages, thereby limiting potential \nwindfalls for plaintiffs without in any way interfering with their \nability to obtain full recovery for their injuries.\n  It provides product manufacturers with long-overdue relief from \nabusers of their products.\n  And it protects these makers, and sellers, from being made to pay for \nall or most non-economic damages when they are responsible for only a \nsmall percentage.\n  First, as to punitive damages. No one wants to see plaintiffs denied \nfull and fair compensation for their injuries. And this bill would do \nnothing to get in the way of such recoveries.\n  Unfortunately, punitive damages have come to be seen as part of the \nnormal package of compensation to be expected by plaintiffs. George \nPriest of the Yale Law School reports that in one county, Bullock, AL, \n95.6 percent of all cases filed in 1993-94 included claims for punitive \ndamages.\n  Punitive damages are intended to punish and deter wrongdoing. When \nthey become routine--one might say when they reach epidemic \nproportions--they end up hurting us all by increasing the cost of \nimportant goods and services.\n  For example, the American Tort Reform Association reports that, of \nthe $18,000 cost of a heart pacemaker, $3,000 goes to cover lawsuits, \nas does $170 of the $1,000 cost of a motorized wheelchair and $500 of \nthe cost of a 2-day maternity hospital stay.\n  We can no longer afford to allow this trend to continue. I am glad, \ntherefore, that this bill begins to cap punitive damages--although in \nmy judgment it only makes a beginning in that area.\n  I am particularly glad that the bill imposes a hard cap of $250,000 \non punitive damages assessed against small businesses--the engine of \ngrowth and invention in our Nation.\n  Of course, punitive damage awards are not the only things increasing \nthe costs of needed products.\n  Throughout the debate over civil justice reform I have been referring \nto the case of Piper Aircraft versus Cleveland. I use that example \nbecause it shows how ridiculous legal standards can literally kill an \nindustry--as they did light aircraft manufacturing in America--and cost \nthousands of American jobs.\n  In Piper Aircraft, a man took the front seat out of his plane and \nintentionally attempted to fly it from the back seat. He crashed, not \nsurprisingly, and his family sued and won over $1 million in damages on \nthe grounds that he should have been able to fly safely from the back \nseat.\n  These are the kinds of decisions we must stop. Drunken plaintiffs, \nplaintiffs who abuse and misuse products--plaintiffs who blame \nmanufacturers and sellers for their own misconduct--should not be \nrewarded with large sums of money. They may deserve our concern and \nsympathy, but we as a people do not deserve to pay for their misconduct \nthrough the loss of entire industries.\n  I am happy that this bill establishes defenses based on plaintiff \ninebriation and abuse of the product because I believe these defenses \nwill benefit all Americans.\n  Finally, it seems clear to me that no manufacturer should be held \nliable for non-economic damages which that individual or company did \nnot cause.\n  In its common form, the doctrine of joint liability allows the \nplaintiff to collect the entire amount of a judgment from any defendant \nfound partially responsible for the plaintiff's damages.\n  Thus, for example, a defendant found to be 1 percent responsible for \nthe plaintiff's damages could be forced to pay 100 percent of the \nplaintiff's judgment.\n  This is unfair. And the unfairness is aggravated when noneconomic \ndamages are awarded.\n  Noneconomic damages are intended to compensate plaintiffs for \nsubjective harm, like pain and suffering, emotional distress, and \nhumiliation.\n  Because noneconomic damages are not based on tangible losses, \nhowever, there are no objective criteria for calculating their amount. \nAs a result, the size of these awards often depends more on the luck of \nthe draw, in terms of the jury, than on the rule of law. Defendants can \nbe forced to pay enormous sums for unverifiable damages they did not \nsubstantially cause.\n  This bill would reform joint liability in the product liability \ncontext by allowing it to be imposed for economic damages only, so that \na defendant could be forced to pay for only his proportionate share of \nnoneconomic damages.\n  As a result, plaintiffs would be fully compensated for their out-of-\npocket losses, while defendants would be better able to predict and \nverify the amount of damages they would be forced to pay.\n  This reform thus would address the most pressing concerns of \nplaintiffs and defendants alike.\n  Mr. President, problems will remain with our civil justice system \nafter this bill is made into law--if this bill is signed by President \nClinton and made law.\n  Charities and their volunteers will remain unprotected from frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  Our municipalities will remain exposed to profit-seeking plaintiffs.\n  And the nonproducts area of private civil law in general will remain \nunreformed--3-year-olds and their mothers may still end up in court \nover a sandbox altercation.\n  In the last session I and some of my colleagues fought for more \nextensive, substantive, and programmatic reforms to our civil justice \nsystem. These were consistently turned back.\n  I believe at this point it is time for us to consider more neutral, \nprocedural reforms, such as in the area of Federal conflicts rules, to \nrationalize a system we cannot seem to tame.\n  But I am certain, Mr. President, that this bill marks an important \nstep toward a fairer, more reasonable and less expensive civil justice \nsystem.\n  This is why I am frustrated that President Clinton has threatened to \nveto this bill.\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\n  The President has stated repeatedly that he would support balanced, \nlimited product liability reform. He has been singularly unhelpful in \nhis opposition to more far-reaching reforms that would do more for \nAmerican workers and consumers. But he has claimed that he would \nsupport product liability reform.\n  Now the President is claiming that this legislation is somehow \n``unfair to consumers.''\n  Mr. President, is a system in which fifty-seven cents of every dollar \nawarded in court goes to lawyers and other transaction costs fair to \nconsumers of legal services?\n  Is it really pro-consumer to have a system in which, as reported in a \nconference board survey, 47 percent of firms withdraw products from the \nmarketplace, 25 percent discontinue some form of research, and 8 \npercent lay off employees, all out of fear of lawsuits?\n  Please tell me, Mr. President, are consumers helped by a system in \nwhich, according to a recent Gallup survey, one out of every five small \nbusinesses decides not to introduce a new product, or not to improve an \nexisting one, out of fear of lawsuits?\n  The clear answer, I believe, is that consumers are hurt by our out-\nof-control civil justice system, a system which makes them pay more for \nless sophisticated and updated goods.\n  I respectfully suggest that President Clinton look beyond the \ninterests of his friends among the trial lawyers to the interests of \nthe American people as a whole.\n  If he looks to that interest he will find a nation hungry for reform, \nyearning to be freed from a civil justice system that is neither civil \nnor just, seeking protection from egregious wrongs, but not willing to \nsacrifice necessary goods, important public and voluntary services, and \nthe very character of their communities to a system that no longer \nproduces fair and predictable results.\n  If we in this chamber consult the interest of the people, Mr. \nPresident, we will pass this bill. If President Clinton consults that \nprimary interest, he will sign the bill and make it law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, for those who were becoming skeptical, the \nconference report before us demonstrates that bipartisanship is still \nalive and well in the U.S. Congress.\n  First, I would like to express my appreciation to those who have \ncontributed so greatly to the completion of this legislation--not only \nin the 104th Congress, but in some cases for more than a decade. The \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler, has been \ninstrumental in shepherding this legislation from the committee, to the \nSenate floor, into conference, and now back to the Senate floor. Also, \nSenator Rockefeller and Senator Gorton--whose commitment and leadership \non this issue have been unsurpassed in the Senate, and without whose \nefforts we would not be voting on this conference report today--were \ninvaluable in crafting this legislation.\n  As I stated during the markup of S. 565 in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, and later during consideration of the bill on the floor of \nthe Senate, I believe there is a compelling case for product liability \nreform in this country.\n  I firmly believe the legislation the Senate adopted early last year \nwas a critical and long overdue first step to reforming an area of law \nthat touches each and every one of us as consumers in America. \nTherefore, I am now eager to see a well-conceived and balanced bill \naccomplishing this goal enacted during the 104th Congress. It is a goal \nI think we can and should reach. I believe the conference report before \nus is well-conceived and balanced, and am particularly pleased that it \ncontains the punitive damage cap I offered, and which was adopted, \nduring consideration of the Senate bill.\n  In my statement on product liability on the floor of the Senate many \nmonths ago, I established my own personal checklist of critical issues \nI believed this legislation ought to address to make the bill fair, \nequitable, and effective. That is now also true for this conference \nreport.\n  First, we must allow safe consumer products to be developed to meet \nconsumer needs, and ensure that consumers can seek reasonable \ncompensation when injuries and damages occur.\n  Second, the law must dissuade consumers from filing frivolous \nlawsuits, without discouraging Americans who have substantive \ncomplaints from filing legitimate suits.\n  Third, a uniform law must encourage companies to police the safety of \ntheir own products--both by providing incentives for excellence in \nsafety and strong punishment when product safety is breached.\n  Last, and perhaps most importantly, one of our fundamental goals must \nbe to ensure that this legislation protects the interests of the \naverage American consumer who makes hefty use of products, but knows \nlittle of their innate safety or risk.\n  I believe that this conference report--like the Senate-passed bill--\nmeets these criteria. One component of this conference report that I \nconsidered crucial to fulfilling these requirements is the cap on \npunitive damages.\n  To understand the issue of a punitive damage cap, I think it is \nvaluable to remember what punitive damages are--and are not. I believe \nthis issue is particularly important before today's vote because of \nrecent reports in various news sources that have confused a cap on \npunitive damages with a cap on pain-and-suffering, or a cap on economic \ndamages.\n  Punitive damages are punishment that serve an invaluable role in \ndeterring quasi-criminal behavior by businesses. They have nothing to \ndo with providing compensation to a person who has been harmed and are \nnot intended in any way to make the plaintiff. That purpose is served \nby compensatory damages, which provide recovery for both economic \ndamages--which include lost wages and medical expenses--and noneconomic \ndamages, which include pain and suffering and other losses, such as \nthose cased by the loss of one's sight, appendage, or reproductive \norgans.\n  One of the overriding problems in our current system is the absence \nof any consistent, meaningful standards for determining whether \npunitive damages should be awarded and--if so--in what amounts. The \nabsence of consistent standards not only leads to widely disparate and \nrunaway punitive awards, but it also affects the settlement process. \nIndividuals and companies that are sued often face a catch 22: pay high \nlegal fees to fight a case through trial, verdict, and appeal--or \nsimply settle out of court for any amount less than these anticipated \nlegal fees.\n  Even for the defendant who recognizes the cost of proving innocence \nto be too great, or simply hopes to avoid the lottery nature of a \npossible punitive award--seeking a settlement carries a hidden cost. \nThe lack of a uniform national standard--or simply the existence of \nvague State standards--forces the defendant to include a punitive \npremium in their settlements, even when the likelihood of a punitive \naward is small or even nonexistent. In addition, the high reversal rate \nof punitive damage awards underscores the absence of clear and \nunderstandable rules.\n  Therefore, in establishing a cap, I considered it vital that the \nmeasure we chose be fair, uniform, act as adequate punishment, and \nserve as an adequate deterrent. I believe a cap based on compensatory \ndamages accomplishes all of these objectives, which is why I fought to \ninclude such a measure in the Senate bill. This measure is fair because \nit is blind to the socioeconomic position of the plaintiff. In \naddition, because a punitive cap that includes noneconomic damages in \nits formula is inherently unpredictable, one cannot argue that a \nbusiness with quasi-criminal intents will be able to predict the \nultimate cost of all possible punitive claims and make a financial \ndecision to produce a dangerous product.\n  At the same time, I do not believe that a cap based on a measure of \neconomic damages alone would accomplish all of these objectives in all \ncircumstances. Although such a measure might serve as adequate \npunishment and act as an adequate deterrent in many cases, it relies \ntoo greatly on the economic position of the plaintiff in establishing a \nsufficient level of punishment.\n\n  While the Senate bill also included an additur provision that allowed \nthe judge to impose a higher punitive damage award in particularly \negregious circumstances--and this conference report also includes a \nmodified additur\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\nprovision--I believe the measure based on compensatory damages will \nwork for everyone and will subject egregious offenders to strong \npunishment. This standard is fair and nondiscriminatory. It will apply \nto all litigants equally--whether you are a man or woman, wealthy or \npoor, a child or an adult. Therefore, I am particularly pleased that \nthe conference report before us maintains the Snowe amendment on \npunitive damages. And while I believe that the additur will be proven \nto be unnecessary due to the inherently even-handed and unpredictable \nnature of total compensatory damages, I accept its inclusion in the \nconference report as a means of providing the opportunity for \nadditional punishment in cases where a judge--staying within the \nparameters set by the jury--deems it necessary.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us--as outlined by Senators Gorton and \nRockefeller--is a targeted bill that brings common sense and reform to \none class of lawsuits: those pertaining to product liability. I believe \nthis legislation is sound and will benefit consumers and businesses. As \na result, I share the disappointment of other Members of this body in \nPresident Clinton's statement that he would veto this bipartisan \nlegislation. At the least, I found it surprising that President Clinton \nopposes legislation that he endorsed as a member of the National \nGovernors' Association when he was Governor Clinton. I remain hopeful \nthat President Clinton will reconsider his opposition in the coming \ndays. I think a strong bipartisan vote in favor of this legislation is \njust what the President needs in order to see the light on this issue.\n  Mr. President, we must be able to show the American people that we \nnot only considered this essential and historic legislation, but that \nwe passed it with strong bipartisan support as well. There is simply no \nquestion that, if enacted, this reform will have a positive and wide-\nranging impact on millions of Americans. Thank you, Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I continue to oppose the product liability \nreform bill for two main reasons: it unnecessarily intrudes upon the \nprerogatives of our State governments and the purported problem the \nbill attempts to address--the impact of punitive damages--is \noverstated.\n  For over two centuries, tort law has been developed by our common law \ncourts and State legislatures. The same is true for our contract law, \nreal property law, insurance law, and a host of other subjects. The \ncore principles of tort law are the same across the country, but each \nState has adjusted its laws to suit its individual needs, experimented \nwith liability reforms, and attempted to strike a careful balance the \ninterests of business and consumers.\n  The Federal product liability bill would put an end to this era of \nlocal experimentation and adjustment. Instead, it would contribute to \nthe trend of the last half century of centralizing power in Washington. \nUnfortunately, the product liability bill will be only the first step \nin this process. Once it is completed other interests will follow with \npleas for Federal intervention. And eventually the States will be \nstripped of yet another area of authority. This trend runs entirely \ncounter to the generally accepted principle that the Federal Government \nis too big and that more authority should be returned to the States and \nlocalities.\n  Ironically, we are taking this step at a time when the States are \nvigorously engaged in the topic of tort reform. Just this year, New \nJersey, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Texas have passed tort reform \nlegislation. In fact, since 1986, 31 States have altered their product \nliability laws, 30 States limit the amount of punitive damages in some \nmanner and 41 States have changed or abolished the rule of joint and \nseveral liability. With this much activity on the state level, there is \nno justification for this sweeping, intrusive Federal bill.\n\n  I also believe that the case for tort reform has been exaggerated. \nUnfortunately, the debate over this legislation has been driven more by \nanecdote and horror stories than objective facts. Indeed, the dearth of \nsolid, unbiased research led the Wall Street Journal to conclude last \nyear that ``Truth Is the First Casualty of the Tort-Reform Debate.''\n  A review of some data collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \na neutral arbiter on this topic, demonstrates that runaway jury \nverdicts are not as great of a problem as the tort reform advocates \nsuggest. The study showed that courts in the 75 largest counties in the \ncountry decided 762,000 civil cases in 1992. Punitive damages were \nawarded in only 364 of these cases--.04 percent. Only 360 of the \n762,000 cases involved product liability. Punitive damages were awarded \nin only three of those cases. And the total amount of punitive damages \nawarded was only $40,000.\n  The study also suggests that if we are looking to solve problems with \nthe application of punitive damages, perhaps we should be addressing \nother areas of the law. Of the cases in which the plaintiff won a jury \nverdict, punitive damages were awarded in 30 percent of all slander \ncases, 21 percent of all fraud cases, but only 2 percent of all product \nliability cases.\n  I do not deny that there have been abusive cases where excessive \nawards have been made for minor injuries. But to address this problem, \nwe need to do more to punish attorneys who bring frivolous cases or use \nthe force of the legal system to coerce companies to settle meritless \nclaims. We also need to encourage judges to intervene when juries run \namok. Instead of taking these steps, this bill places caps on damages \nand limits the ability of injured parties to collect judgments imposed \nagainst wrongdoers. In essence, it limits the ability of those with \nmeritorious claims to gain full compensation in order to rid the system \nof shameful cases that should have never been filed in the first place.\n  In my view, this is an unwise approach that will do damage to our \nprinciple of federalism. I will vote against this conference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to explain why I voted \nagainst this product liability conference report.\n  All of us in this room have heard horrific stories about people who \ngot hurt when they did stupid or silly things with a product and then \nrecovered tremendous amounts of money from innocent businesses. Those \nfew stories have gotten a lot of mileage. They have gotten us to a \nconference report that takes power from consumers and gives it to \ncorporations.\n  Mr. President, I am a mother who wants to be responsible for passing \nlaws that improve the chances for my children to live healthy, safe \nlives. I am glad that victims have used the current State-based product \nliability laws to force manufacturers to make safe toys, nonflammable \npajamas, and cars and trucks that don't explode. The current legal \nsystem forced companies to be responsible or face the possibility of \nsignificant financial loss.\n  I also want to be responsible for passing laws that provide the hard \nworking men and women of this country an opportunity to be fully \ncompensated for injuries that are a direct result of products they use \nin the workplace. This conference report makes it much harder for our \nworkers to recover damages from those responsible for their injuries. \nIt is designed to give advantage to corporations and disadvantage to \nour workers through its limits on joint liability for noneconomic \ndamages, on punitive damages, and on seller liability, as well as its \nbroadly drawn defenses to liability, such as the statute of repose.\n  In addition, I want to support legislation that allows our citizens \nto trust that the medical devices they are receiving are safe. So many \nwomen needlessly suffered when the maker of silicone gel breast \nimplants refused to heed initial warning signs that their product was \nflawed. Today, there is no dispute that there is a strong correlation \nbetween silicone breast implants and serious health disorders, \nincluding joint and muscle pain, tremors, and autoimmune diseases. And, \nunfortunately, not all of the victims of these implants are known. For \nthose who have not yet filed, this bill will block them from seeking \nredress from this grossly negligent company. That is wrong.\n  Finally, I want to be responsible for legislation that improves our \ncitizens' quality of life. This bill could severely limit lawsuits \ninvolving products that damage the environment, such as pesticides and \ntoxic chemicals. In particular, the provision addressing joint and\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\nseveral liability could make it nearly impossible for victims to \nreceive full and fair compensation for harm caused by a mixture of \ntoxic substances where a victim is unable to prove the percentage of \ndamage caused by each chemical. Especially now, when we see efforts to \nscale back Government's role in environmental protection, the civil \njustice system is an even more important mechanism for deterring \nenvironmental degradation.\n  I know that responsible businesses feel threatened by the current \nsystem. I believe we should seek to reform and improve our system. But \nthis approach is too sweeping. We need to take smaller steps and make \nmore incremental reforms.\n  Mr. President, I have voted against this conference report for all of \nthe above reasons. I cannot support a products liability law that \nshifts power from the States to the Federal Government and takes power \naway from our children, the elderly and working people and gives it to \nthe companies that produce harmful products.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am pleased to support the \nconference agreement on product liability litigation reform--reached \nafter tremendous efforts by my colleagues in both the House and Senate. \nThe Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nHatch], and the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] deserve a \nlot of credit for putting together a thoughtful, bi-partisan approach \nto solving the problems associated with products liability lawsuits. \nThis is a bill that President Clinton should sign.\n  I also must commend the House conferees, particularly the \ndistinguished chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hyde, for \ntheir willingness to reach a compromise on some of the more \ncontroversial provisions in their bill, in order that we could \nsuccessfully pass a conference report that still will have a positive \nimpact on our products liability litigation system. There are some, and \nI am among them, who would have liked to see a conference report which \nwent even further on some issues than the agreement we have before us. \nHowever, I realize that we would have had a difficult time passing a \nmore expansive and comprehensive legal reform bill. Clearly some reform \nis better than no reform at all. Our legal system needs it.\n  I have watched the products liability reform debate over the past \nseveral months with great interest. There was a time when many believed \nthat this type of legal reform would not be possible. No one, least of \nall me, underestimates the power of the trial lawyers to derail even \nthe most reasonable lawsuit reform efforts. Senator Dodd and I fought \nfor years to fix our Nation's securities class-action system, and late \nlast year the Congress overrode President Clinton's veto of the bill \nand enacted comprehensive securities litigation reform. I hope that the \nPresident will examine this bill closely, because if he does, the only \nconclusion he should reach is that this is a reasonable, commonsense \napproach to reform that is good for the country.\n  There can be no doubt that our current products liability system \nextracts tremendous costs from the business community and from \nconsumers. The great expense associated with products liability \nlawsuits drives up the cost of producing and selling goods, and these \ncosts are passed on to the American consumer. I have heard many tell me \nabout how half of the cost of a $200 football helmet is associated with \nproducts liability litigation, and how $8 out of the cost of a $12 \nvaccine goes to products liability costs. We can no longer afford to \nrequire our consumers to pay this tort tax.\n  Because of the high costs associated with products liability \nlitigation, American companies often find it difficult to obtain \nliability insurance. The insurance industry has estimated that the \ncurrent cost to business and consumers of the U.S. tort system is over \n$100 billion. Insurance costs in the United States are 15 to 20 times \ngreater than those of our competitors in Europe and Japan. Much of this \nmoney ends up in the pockets of lawyers, who exploit the system and \nreap huge fee awards while plaintiffs go under compensated. Meanwhile, \nbusinesses which create jobs and prosperity in America suffer.\n  For companies involved in the manufacture of certain products, like \nmachine tools, medical devices, and vaccines, this means that \nbeneficial products go undeveloped, or after they are developed, they \ndo not make it to the marketplace out of fear of generating a products \nliability lawsuit. This hampers our competitiveness abroad, and limits \nthe products available to consumers. Harvard Business School Prof. \nMichael Porter has written about how products liability affects \nAmerican competitiveness. He has written:\n\n       In the United States . . . product liability is so extreme \n     and uncertain as to retard innovation. The legal and \n     regulatory climate places firms in constant jeopardy of \n     costly, and, as importantly, lengthy product liability suits. \n     The existing approach goes beyond any reasonable need to \n     protect consumers, as other nations have demonstrated through \n     more pragmatic approaches.\n\n  In the case of manufacturers of vaccines and other medical devices, \nthe cost of our unreasonable and certainly un-pragmatic products \nliability litigation system often means that potentially life-saving \ninnovations never make it to the American public. Products liability \nadds $3,000 to the cost of a pacemaker, and $170 to the cost of a \nmotorized wheelchair. It also has caused the DuPont Co. to cease \nmanufacturing the polyester yarn used in heart surgery out of fears of \nproducts liability litigation. Five cents worth of yarn cost them $5 \nmillion to defend a case, and DuPont decided that they simply could not \nafford further litigation costs. Now, foreign companies manufacture the \nyarn, but will not sell it in the United States out of fear of also \nbeing sued. These are products which could save lives and improve the \nquality of living for all Americans.\n  In cases where a truly defective product has injured an individual, \nthe litigation process is too slow, too costly and too unpredictable. \nThis bill, because it creates a Federal system of products liability \nlaw, will return some certainty to a system that now often \nundercompensates those really injured by defective products and \novercompensates those with frivolous claims.\n  Those injured by defective products often must wait 4 or 5 years to \nreceive compensation. This leads some victims to settle more quickly in \norder to receive relief within a reasonable time. Companies often must \nexpend huge amounts of money in legal fees to settle or litigate these \nlong, complicated cases. These again are resources that could be better \nspent developing new products or improving the designs of existing \nones.\n  I believe that the most important reform in this conference report is \nthe way it treats punitive damages. As their name implies, punitive \ndamages are designed to punish companies and deter future wrongful \nconduct. They are assessed in these cases in addition to the actual \ndamages suffered by injured victims.\n  Unfortunately, these damages do not do much, except line the pockets \nof lawyers. They serve relatively little deterrent purpose and led \nformer Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell to describe them as inviting \n``punishment so arbitrary as to be virtually random.'' Justice Powell \nwisely has commented that because juries can impose virtually limitless \npunitive damages, they act as ``legislator and judge, without the \ntraining, experience, or guidance of either.'' Justice Powell is \nabsolutely correct, and I applaud the drafters of this bill for dealing \nwith the problems associated with these types of damages.\n  The Washington Post also agrees that punitive damages reform is \nnecessary. An editorial in support of the conference report printed \nlast week notes that ``there are no ground rules for judges and juries \nin this area'' and that ``the whole thing is like a lottery, which is \nterribly unfair.'' The editorial concludes that ``the compromise should \nbe accepted by both houses and signed by the President.''\n  Reform of punitive damages will return some common sense to the \nsystem. Huge punitive damage awards threaten to wipe out small \nbusinesses and charitable organizations and I applaud the conferees for \nproviding special protection for these important entities, which are \nparticularly vulnerable to legal extortion by trial lawyers.\n  By capping the amount of punitive damages available in product \nliability cases and raising the legal threshold for an award of \npunitive damages, the conference report will relieve some of\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\nthe pressure on even the most innocent defendant to settle or face an \naward which could potentially bankrupt the company. It however \nreasonably allows judges some flexibility to go above the cap in truly \negregious cases, where increased punitive damages might be warranted.\n  The conferees also have taken the wise step to reform joint \nliability, without limiting the ability of plaintiffs to recover their \neconomic damages. The new law will abolish joint liability for \nnoneconomic damages, like pain and suffering, but allows States to \nretain it for economic damages like hospital bills. This will reduce \nthe pressure on defendants who are only nominally responsible for the \ninjury to settle the case or risk huge liability out of proportion to \ntheir degree of fault, while ensuring that injured victims get \ncompensated for their out-of-pocket loss.\n\n  The compromise also limits liability in cases where the victim \naltered or misused the allegedly defective product in an unforeseeable \nway. It simply is unfair to hold manufacturers liable in cases where \nconsumers use products in ways for which they were not intended. It \nalso is unfair to hold defendants liable in cases where the plaintiff's \nuse of alcohol or drugs significantly contributed to their injury. I am \nhappy to see that the new law will provide an absolute defense in such \ncases.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier, I am no stranger to legal reform. \nMany of those who are responsible for this important and well-crafted \nlegislation were cosponsors of the securities reform bill Senator Dodd \nand I authored earlier this Congress. Our tort system is badly in need \nof reform, and the conference report on products liability before us is \na step in the right direction. I support it, and I hope that my \ncolleagues and the President will as well.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I voted for S. 565, the Senate \nproduct liability bill, when it was before the Senate last May, and I \nsupport this conference report, which is, in virtually all of its \nessential provisions, identical to that bill. I supported the bill last \nyear, and I continue to support it now, because I believe that Federal \nproduct liability reform makes sense for Americans, and because it \nmakes sense for America.\n  Lets be clear what product liability reform is and is not about. It \nis not about an explosion of litigation that our courts physically \ncannot handle. It is about the chilling effect that product liability \njudicial decisions in one State can have on businesses across the \nNation.\n  It is not about making it more difficult for Americans injured by \nproducts to get justice from those who injured them. It is about \nreducing the number of frivolous suits and unnecessary legal costs.\n  It is not about tilting the playing field in favor of business and \nagainst consumers or employees. It is about taking a step toward making \nthe playing field more level for consumers, employees and businesses \nall across this Nation.\n  And it is not about taking powers away from States in order to \ndisadvantage ordinary Americans. Rather, it is a narrow, carefully \ncrafted approach to reform based on the realities of commerce today.\n  The basic fact that underlies this bill is that commerce is not \nlocal, but national and international. Over 70 percent of what is \nmanufactured in Illinois is sold elsewhere, and Illinois is not unique \nin that regard. Because commerce is national, and indeed, increasingly \ninternational, the laws of any one State are simply not effective in \nestablishing product liability standards for manufacturers in that \nState. Our Nation's Governors have recognized that fact, which is why \nthe National Governor's Association has three times unanimously \napproved resolutions supporting Federal product liability reform.\n  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to \nregulate interstate commerce. Given the interstate and international \nnature of commerce, and the importance of having a healthy climate for \nmanufacturing here in the United States, reform is essential, both so \nwe can compete successfully in an ever-more competitive world \nmarketplace and so we can generate the kind of economic growth needed \nto offer every American the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.\n  Achieving that dream depends on being able to find a good job at good \nwages, jobs that make it possible for American families to purchase \ntheir own homes and to send their children to college, and that \nsuggests a healthy climate for manufacturing--which tends to produce \nthe kinds of jobs Americans want and need--is in our national interest.\n  The current fragmented product liability system offers less certainty \nthan a casino. That lack of certainty means that the current product \nliability system imposes costs far greater than the amounts awarded to \nsuccessful plaintiffs, or the costs involved in defending and pursuing \nproduct liability cases. It adds costs to products, even when a company \nhas never been sued, and unnecessary higher costs hurt consumers, and \nhurt job creation. And, while it is impossible to quantify, there is no \ndoubt that the current product liability system causes some companies \nnot to produce some products. That, too, means fewer good paying \nmanufacturing jobs.\n\n  I do not suggest that Americans who might be injured by products \nshould sacrifice their rights to redress for their injuries in order to \nhelp our economy generate new, good paying jobs--and this bill does not \nask that of any American. But we must all remember that Americans \naren't just consumers; they don't have just one interest at stake. \nInstead of dividing Americans from one another, therefore, we should be \nworking together for the kind of reform that is in all of our \ninterests.\n  By creating greater certainty, by reducing unnecessary cost, and by \naddressing the inadvertent chilling effect the current system has on \nnew product creation, product liability reform will help generate new \neconomic growth, and new jobs. And reform will add to the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. manufacturing, something that is essential in \nthis ever more competitive world economy.\n  Some continue to argue that we should leave this issue to the States \nto address. However, the fact is that, given today's economic \nrealities--and tomorrow's--product liability, no less than health care \nand other components of our social safety net, is a legitimate and \nnecessary subject for Federal action. And the fact is is that the right \nkind of product liability reform, like the right kind of health care \nreform, and the right kind of welfare reform, and expand opportunity, \nand help create a brighter future for Americans individually and for \nour Nation collectively.\n  While this bill is not perfect, I think that, in general, it is the \nright kind of reform. It will bring greater uniformity to product \nliability law. It will help cut out the unnecessary costs the current \nproduct liability system imposes on businesses, consumers, and \nemployees. And it tries very hard to appropriately balance the \ncompeting concerns involved.\n  I know that some Americans do not share the view that Federal product \nliability reform is needed, and that there are a number of concerns \nregarding specific provisions of the bill. I think it is worth noting, \nhowever, that the conference report now before us is, with very modest \nchanges, the bill this Senate sent to conference. I ask unanimous \nconsent, Mr. President, that a table comparing the original Senate bill \nand the conference report be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  I know the statute of repose has generated some controversy. I would \nsimply point out three things. First, the 15-year statute of repose \napplies to workplace goods only.\n  Second, no State with a statute of repose provides a more liberal \ntime period than the one in the conference report; and\n  Third, the bill permits plaintiffs in every State to file a complaint \nafter she or he discovers or should have discovered both the harm and \nits cause, a provision that is particularly important to plaintiffs who \nhave trouble identifying the cause of the injury they suffered. For \nexample, a person who developed a cancer many years after exposure to a \nchemical would be able to file suit anytime up to 2 years after the \nlink between the chemical, and the harm he or she suffered, was \nidentified.\n  The punitive damages provision has also been controversial. However, \nthis\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\nprovision is virtually identical to the bill as it passed the Senate \nlast year. And it is more proconsumer than the laws in about half of \nthe States.\n  Moreover, the bill does not put a hard cap on punitive damages. For \ncases involving all but the smallest of businesses, it allows punitive \ndamages to be imposed up to the greater of $250,000 or twice the \nplaintiff's economic and noneconomic damages, including pain and \nsuffering, and allows the judge in the case to increase the award by up \nto double those limits--in other words, to go up to four times the \nplaintiff's economic and noneconomic damages--if necessary ``to punish \nthe egregious conduct of the defendant.'' This approach was modeled on \na recommendation made by the American College of Trial Lawyers, and it \nwill permit huge punitive damages awards in cases where such awards are \njustified by the nature of the conduct and the severity of the harm \ninvolved, even when the harm is mostly noneconomic in nature.\n\n  As to the concerns regarding joint and several liability, I think it \nis worth pointing out that the conference report, like the original \nSenate-passed bill, only eliminates joint and several liability for \nnoneconomic damages. This formulation is already the law in California, \nand it provides reasonable protection both for plaintiffs and for \nbusinesses who have only a minor involvement in the harm suffered by \nthe plaintiff, but who can be held responsible for the entire amount of \ndamages if the other defendants in the case are not able to pay their \nshare of the amount awarded.\n  It is also worth noting that the conference report does not contain \nthe broad, unjustified preemption of State civil justice systems that \nwas in the House-passed bill, provisions that could of undermined the \ncivil rights of Americans, and which would have almost casually \noverturned our whole State justice system. And it does not contain the \nmedical malpractice provisions that were in the House bill, provisions \nthat did not and do not belong in a product liability bill.\n  Moreover, the conference report does not contain the so-called FDA \nexcuse that I strongly opposed in the last Congress. The bill that \nemerged from conference is the kind of narrow, carefully tailored \napproach that was needed, and the only approach that I could possibly \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I said in 1994 that the problems present in our \nproduct liability system are problems that this body must address. Last \nyear, when the product liability bill was before the Senate, I \nreiterated my view that reform is necessary, and I supported S. 565 as \na reasonable approach to achieving that necessary reform. The \nconference report before now before us does not contain the provisions \nfrom the House bill that I believe have no place in this legislation. \nAnd, as I said at the outset of my remarks, it is close to identical to \nthe bill I voted for last May. I therefore voted for cloture yesterday, \nand will vote in favor of sending this conference report to the \nPresident. I hope he will reconsider his position, and sign it, because \nenacting this bill into law is in the interest of every American.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude by congratulating Senators Gorton \nand Rockefeller for their leadership in bringing the bill to this \npoint. I particularly want to thank my colleague from West Virginia. He \nwent to great lengths to consult with me, and with other Senators, and \nto make all of us part of that conference, even though we technically \nwere not among the conferees. I greatly appreciate his commitment to \nthe kind of balanced, narrowly crafted reform that is so greatly needed \nand so long overdue. I am pleased to have this opportunity to vote with \nhim, and with the other supporters on a set of reforms that are based \non common sense, and that make sense for America.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, our laws play an important role in \nfostering a competitive economic environment by establishing ground \nrules for fair competition and by helping to reduce the costs of doing \nbusiness. But our laws play an even more critical role in protecting \nthe rights of individuals, workers, and consumers. Congress, therefore, \nhas a special responsibility to ensure that the laws we write are \nreasonable and fair.\n  The conference report on H.R. 956, the so-called Common Sense Product \nLiability Reform Act of l996, fails the ``reasonable and fair'' test.\n  The conference report, if enacted, will take away the rights U.S. \ncitizens enjoy today in seeking redress for harm caused by unsafe \nproducts while giving manufacturers no incentive to produce safer \nproducts. This conference report is not fair to the working men and \nwomen of this country. It is biased against low-income individuals, \nwomen, and the elderly and it is plain dangerous for consumers. The \nproducts liability conference report will overturn the laws of every \nState and, I fear, will do great harm.\n  Consider that every year thousands of workers are injured or killed \nas a direct result of defects in products they use in the workplace. \nFor many of them, the tort system is the only recourse for full redress \nof their injuries. Yet, this conference report will make it harder for \nworkers to hold fully accountable those who cause the injury. The \nlimits on joint liability for non-economic damages, on punitive \ndamages, on seller liability and the greatly expanded coverage under \nthe statute of repose are all one-sided. Together, these provisions \nclearly favor wealthy corporations at the expense of working Americans.\n  The 15-year statute of repose would affect more than one-half of the \nproducts claims filed against machine tool manufacturers. Under the \nconference report, workers injured by defective machinery 15 years \nafter first delivery would be prohibited from seeking to prove in court \nthat even a grossly negligent manufacturer was responsible for their \ninjury. On the other hand, the right of the business to pursue an \naction against the same manufacturer for commercial loss would be fully \npreserved.\n  The conference report would cap punitive damages at $250,000 or two \ntimes compensatory damages, whichever is greater, except in cases \ninvolving small businesses with fewer than 25 employees, where \npunitives would be capped at $250,000 or two times compensatories, \nwhichever is the lesser amount. Such limits clearly undermine the \ndeterrent value of punitive damages.\n  The threat of punitive damages has in part contributed to the recall, \ndiscontinuance, or change in the use of many dangerous and defective \nproducts, including the Ford Pinto, asbestos, the Dalkon shield, the \nSuzuki Samurai, heart valves, and silicone breast implants. Punitive \ndamages have also helped make products safer: the redesign of the Jeep \nCJ-5; adding guards to chainsaws; the replacement of lap-belts with \nrear-seat three-point safety belts in passenger cars; the use of roll \nbars on farm tractors; warnings on toxic household chemicals; the use \nof flame-retardant fabric in children's sleepwear; and the list goes on \nand on. The conference report will defang the threat inherent in \npunitive damages.\n  But perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this legislation is that \nFord Motor calculated that it was cheaper under the current tort system \nto settle rather than to try to protect the lives of every Pinto owner \nwith a recall. The manufacturers of silicone breast implants calculated \nit was cheaper under the current tort system to continue selling \nimplants that their own sales force reported had leakage problems \nrather than to alert the more than 1 million women in this country with \nimplants about the danger of the products. Playtex calculated it was \ncheaper to continue to market its super-absorbent tampon than to try to \nwarn women about the deadly effects of toxic shock syndrome. If Ford \nMotor, Dow, Playtex, and other major manufacturers failed to take \ncorrective action to make their products safer under the present tort \nsystem, there is no reason to expect this conference report will \nencourage them to act more responsibly.\n  Would anyone settle for $250,000 in exchange for losing a loved one \nto death by a product that the manufacturer knew was unsafe? If this \nconference report becomes law, no one would be able to get even \n$250,000 because there is not a lawyer in this country who would take \nthe case. No law firm could afford to go up against companies like Ford \nMotor or Dow or others with their host of attorneys and huge legal \nbudgets and an infinite ability to push motions and appeals to the\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\nlimit and slow down the process to their advantage. It just would not \nhappen.\n  Proponents of this legislation stress that the current tort system is \nbiased against them: they point to insurance rates that disable \nAmerican manufacturers by forcing them to pay 10 to 50 times more for \nproduct liability insurance than their foreign competitors; they claim \nthere is an ``explosion'' in products liability litigation, with \nuncontrollable punitive damages awards; and they argue that the present \nsystem of ``lottery'' liability, where liability differs from state to \nstate, does not enhance the safety of U.S. products. The proponents are \nwrong on each of these points.\n\n  Over the past decade, products liability insurance cost 26 cents per \n$100 of retail product sales, or about $26 on the price of a $10,000 \nautomobile. Two recent reports by the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners confirm there is no ``crisis'' in the cost of product \nliability insurance. In fact, the Association reported in January l995 \nthat earned premiums for product liability have steadily dropped from \nmore than $2.1 billion in l989 to $1.6 billion in l994--a drop of 26 \npercent. The Association pointed to shifts to self-insurance and \ncompetition in the industry as reasons for the decline, but did not \nmention tort reform as a factor. Moreover, the Association reported in \nOctober l995 that the premium volume for product liability insurance \npremiums has remained virtually flat from l986 through l994.\n  The so-called explosion in products cases is another myth. While \nconsumer products are responsible for some 39,000 deaths and 30 million \ninjuries each year, a l993 study by Boston's Suffolk University Law \nSchool and Northeastern University found there were only 355 awards in \nproducts suits from l965 through l990, and that half of these were \noverturned or reduced. Indeed, the National Center for State Courts \nreported that product liability cases accounted for .0036 percent of \nthe total civil case load in l992, and the Legal Times reported that \nproducts claims in Federal courts declined by 36 percent from l985 to \nl991. In my own state of Massachusetts, there were absolutely no \npunitive damages awarded in products cases; punitive damages are only \npermitted in wrongful death cases.\n  The conference report on H.R. 956 will not resolve the problem of 51 \ndifferent products liability laws in the United States. On the \ncontrary, it will only serve to further complicate the tort system and \ntilt it strongly in favor of manufacturers and against consumers. The \nconference report contains only one-way preemption.\n  The conference report places caps on punitive damages in products \ncases, yet allows the laws to stand in the 39 States where those laws \nprohibit punitive damage awards or where they place more restrictions \non victims' rights. On the other hand, the conference report does not \nrequire that these States award punitive damages.\n  The conference report preempts State law on misuse or alteration of a \nproduct only to the extent state law is inconsistent with the \nconference report, meaning that the 37 States that provide a complete \ndefense to liability in some cases of product misuse or alteration \nwould not be preempted.\n  The conference report prohibits lawsuits involving durable goods that \nare more than 15 years old, but specifically preserves State laws with \nshorter limitations.\n  The Products Liability Fairness Act, S. 565, will overturn the laws \nof every State that enable people who have been harmed by unsafe or \nfaulty products from obtaining full and fair recovery. It will prevent \ncitizens from holding wrongdoers accountable. It will preempt \nlegitimate claims that deserve to be heard. It will strip citizens of \ntheir rights and it should be rejected.\n  I cannot support legislation that would have placed limits on \npunitive damages for the family of the 5-year-old boy in New Bedford, \nMA, who died in a house fire after igniting a couch with matches. I \ncannot support legislation that would have limited damages for the \nfamily of the 8-month-old boy who suffered second and third degree \nburns on his arms, legs and back in a house fire that started when the \nbedding in his crib was ignited by a portable electric heater that had \nbeen placed within 6 inches of his crib to keep him warm.\n  I surely cannot support legislation that would have limited the \nliability of the big corporations in Woburn, MA, whose highly toxic \npollutants killed and injured children. The Woburn case, in which eight \nworking class families sued two of our Nation's biggest corporations \nbecause they suspected the companies had polluted the water supply with \nhighly toxic industrial solvents, took 9 years. The young attorney that \npleaded the case spent $1 million of his own money on it. The jury \nultimately found one of the companies negligent, and the scientific \nresearch done during the 9-year trial demonstrated the link between the \nindustrial solvents in the water supply and human disease. The company \nis now helping to cleanup the polluted aquifer. The attorney has said \nthat if this bill were law today, he would never have considered the \ncase.\n  Mr. President, the conference report on H.R. 956 will take away the \nright every American enjoys today through the jury box to force \naccountability for dangerous, careless or reckless behavior. In the \njury box, every American can bring about positive change. If we take \naway this fundamental right, we will have compromised our Nation's core \nvalues.\n  The conference report promotes the interests of business at the \nexpense of the rights of consumers. It will create a nightmarish new \nlegal thicket that should be avoided rather than embraced. After we \nhave argued all the complicated points of law, after we have poured \nover horror story after horror story, the issues boil down to one \nsimple point: this bill is not fair, it is not reasonable and it should \nbe rejected.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation and \nwant to commend the efforts of Senators Rockefeller and Gorton on their \nwork. This legislation has been needed for a long time and I am pleased \nthat we will be taking this positive step forward today.\n  I have been concerned for years about our current product liability \nsystem and I believe that meaningful reform is long overdue. I believe \nthat this bill will benefit both consumers and businesses. Under our \ncurrent system, manufacturers of products are subject to a patchwork of \nvarying State laws which contribute to unpredictable outcomes. In some \ncases plaintiffs receive less than they deserve and in others, \nplaintiffs receive too much. Because of the unpredictability, cases \nthat are substantially similar receive very different results.\n  The Congress is currently debating the proper role of the Federal \nGovernment across a broad range of issue areas. Many believe that \nfunctions now conducted at the Federal level should be moved to the \nStates. On this issue I believe that we need a more uniform system of \nproduct liability and therefore Federal standards are necessary.\n  I believe this legislation will improve the competitiveness of our \nindustries which means jobs. I also believe that the biomaterials \nprovisions will help insure that much needed medical devices will \nremain available to many Americans. Because of liability concerns many \nproducts are becoming unavailable. Examples include materials used in \nheart valves, artificial blood vessels, and other medical implants. In \nCincinnati, OH, Fusite, a part of Emerson Electric Co., has been in \nbusiness since 1943. They supply glass-to-metal sealed hermetic \nterminals. One terminal body is used by the makers of implantable \nbatteries in heart pacemakers. In 1995, because of the liability \nconcerns, Fusite determined it would no longer supply this product.\n  The current system is unfair to consumers. Much too much money is \nspent on litigation rather than compensation and the high cost of \nproduct liability insurance means higher costs for consumers.\n  Without doubt an injured party deserves fair compensation, however \nthe cost of litigation is substantial. More and more is spent on legal \nfees and less is spent on important areas such as research and \ndevelopment. In some cases manufacturers decide not to invest in or \ndevelop new products because of product liability concerns. Ultimately \nthis burden of product liability makes our companies less competitive \nin world markets than foreign companies.\n  I have been particularly concerned that as we reform our product \nliability\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\nlaws we do not affect the rights of individuals to bring suits when \nthey have been harmed. On the contrary, it is my intent to bring \nrationality to a system that has become more like a lottery. For me, \nlegal reform does not mean putting a padlock on the court house door.\n  There are several very important improvements that this legislation \nwill provide. A statute of repose of fifteen years is established. \nJoint liability is abolished for noneconomic damages in product \nliability cases. Defendants are liable only in direct proportion to \ntheir responsibility for harm. Therefore, fault will be the controlling \nfactor in the award of damages, not the size of a defendant's wallet.\n  Another important area is punitive damages. Although I am concerned \nabout the establishment of caps on punitive damages, I believe that the \njudge additur provision included in the bill will allow for appropriate \npunitive damages in egregious cases.\n  Mr. President, not every provision in this legislation is written the \nway I would have preferred, but I believe that it is significant reform \nand urge its passage.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to clarify an issue I \ndiscussed in a lengthy, and frankly, rather confusing colloquy with my \ncolleague from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n  Mr. Dorgan sought clarification of a provision on the Product \nLiability Conference Report dealing with the way in which this \nlegislation will apply to utilities. Although I had characterized a \nchange made in conference as technical, he asserted that the change was \nsubstantive.\n  The intent of the bill is to cover all products. This intent is \nexpressed in the comprehensive definition of a product found in section \n101(14) of the conference report, which defines products to include \n``any object, substance, mixture, or raw material in a gaseous, liquid, \nor solid state * * *'' This definition clearly encompasses electricity, \nwater delivered by a utility, natural gas, and steam. To simplify this \ndiscussion I will refer only to electricity.\n  Another goal of the legislation, however, is to leave in place state \ndeterminations of when electricity is a product. Most States treat the \ntransmission of electricity as a service. For this reason, the Senate \nbill excluded electricity from the definition of product. This \nexclusion, however, overlooked the fact that once electricity has \npassed through a customer's meter, many States consider it to be a \nproduct, and subject it to a strict liability standard.\n  Because of this oversight, the Senate provision created an unintended \nconflict between the two goals of this bill: First to cover all \nproducts, and second, to leave undisturbed the state determination of \nwhether or not electricity is a product. The desire to meet both these \ngoals is reflected on page 24, footnote 86, of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Report on the Senate bill. But to \nrepeat, the language of the Senate did not do what it needed; it \nexempted electricity, whether or not it was treated as a product by \nstate law and whether or not it was subject to a rule of strict \nliability.\n  In conference, the statutory language was made explicitly consistent \nwith those dual intentions. That is to say, the bill should respect \nstate choice as to whether or not a utility is a product, but the bill \nshould apply evenly to all products. Consequently, language was added \nto the conference report saying that electricity was excluded from the \ndefinition of product, unless it was subject under State law to strict \nliability, that is to say, is treated as a product.\n  Senator Dorgan is correct that the conference report does change the \nsubstance of this provision. I think it does so wisely and in order to \nmake the legislation clearly express our intent.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after extensive deliberation, on a very \nclose call, I have decided to vote against the conference report on \nproduct liability legislation.\n  This is a close question for me because the conference report \ncorrects my concern on punitive damages and there is a need to make \nAmerican business more competitive in world markets to provide economic \nexpansion and job opportunities.\n  In the final analysis, my judgment is that the disadvantages of the \nbill outweigh the advantages. For example, the 15-year statute of \nrepose would deny recovery to injured parties from products intended \nfor and used long after 15 years.\n  The changes in the law involving workmen's compensation make it more \ndifficult for plaintiffs to recover where a coworker or the employer is \nat fault. That provision also limits the employer's traditional \nsubrogation rights leading to the opposition of homebuilders, workmen's \ncompensation insurance carriers and other business interests because \nworkmen's compensation costs will escalate.\n  The conference report further limits the manufacturers' liability in \ncases where injuries result from a defective product where alcohol has \nbeen used. A defective seat belt is supposed to protect the car's \ndriver regardless of his/her condition.\n  This vote against the conference report is consistent with my vote \nyesterday for cloture. As I said in my statement on yesterday's vote, I \nbelieve the Senate's final determination on product liability \nlegislation should be decided by majority vote rather than the super \nmajority of 60 required for cloture.\n  A decision on whether to support cloture depends upon a variety of \nfactors such as whether there should be more debate to fully air the \nissue or whether a constitutional issue or some other fundamental issue \nis involved which warrants a super majority of 60.\n  On this bill on the merits, I believe it should be decided by the \ntraditional majority vote because it is such a close question without \nan underlying constitutional issue or some other fundamental matter. On \nthe merits of the bill, in my judgment the disadvantages outweigh the \nadvantages.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today is a day of victory and celebration \nfor America's manufacturers, consumers, and taxpayers. Congress has \nfinally succeeded in taking the first important step in overhauling our \nNation's badly broken product liability system.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend my colleagues, Senators Gorton \nand Rockefeller for their endless hours of hard work and commitment to \nenacting long-needed product liability reforms. This truly is a \nsignificant accomplishment.\n  Unfortunately, the President has already issued his press release \nstating that he will stop this important bill--dead in its tracks--with \nhis veto pen. Despite bipartisan support, he claims this bill fails to \n``fairly balance the interests of consumers with those of manufacturers \nand sellers.'' Mr. President, I disagree.\n  This bill is a good compromise; it's fair; and it does protect \nsellers, manufacturers and most importantly, consumers.\n  Mr. President, too many people today are filing lawsuits in the hopes \nthat they will hit the jackpot even if there is little merit to their \ncase. The lawyers get wealthy, but under our current system, that \nwealth comes at the expense of America's consumers.\n  Our society has become so accustomed to suing that a recent study \nshowed that 90 percent of all U.S. companies can expect to be named in \na product liability lawsuit. Furthermore, 89 percent of Americans \nbelieve that ``too many lawsuits are being filed in America today.''\n  Mr. President, the price tag of lawsuits is astronomical. In fact, \nsome experts have estimated that the total cost of all lawsuits filed \nin America exceeds $300 billion each year. And according to the Product \nLiability Coordinating Committee, the cost of product liability \nlawsuits, alone, ranges anywhere from $80 to $120 billion annually.\n  American consumers ultimately pay the price of frivolous lawsuits \nwhich are paralyzing our country's economic growth and ability to \ncreate new jobs. Instead, prices increase and jobs are eliminated when \nbusinesses close, downsize or decline new product introduction for fear \nof a frivolous lawsuit.\n  As a former small businessman, I understand how devastating the \nthreat of a potential lawsuit can be on any company. Our laws have \ncreated a hostile business climate that has compromised the competitive \nposition of many companies, forcing them to reduce salaries or lay off \nemployees to avoid going out of business.\n  Companies who are sued have two choices: endure a lengthy and costly \ntrial in the hopes of proving their innocence or settle out of court to \nsave\n\n[[Page S2584]]\n\ntrial costs. Small businesses don't have the time or resources to spend \ncountless days in a courtroom when they are struggling to make payroll \nand meet customer needs.\n  Everyone agrees that an injured person should have a day in court, \nand this legislation will not prevent legal recourse for justifiable \nclaims. However, it will put an end to the fishing expeditions that \ntrial attorneys use to extract huge, unwarranted settlements from \nbusinesses fearful of protracted litigation costs.\n  Businesses, taxpayers, and consumers can no longer bear this burden, \nmaking passage of this legislation critical. Americans understand that \nour current system is a litigation lottery which increases the costs \nconsumers pay when they purchase a product. It even forces companies to \nlay-off employees.\n  Far too often, the cost of meeting these outrageous judgments eats up \nresources that could have gone toward new jobs and better salaries. The \nPresident and the trial lawyers are kidding themselves if they believe \nthese costs are not passed on to you and me as consumers. \nAppropriately, this is called the tort tax.\n  Mr. President, most of my colleagues know that I am a strong opponent \nof tax increases of any kind. I believe the Product Liability \nConference Report will lessen the tort tax on America's consumers.\n  This legislation addresses many of the problems in our current \nsystem. It limits manufacturer liability when a product is misused or \naltered by the user; it caps punitive damages to twice the compensatory \ndamages or $250,000, whichever is greater; it allows judges the \nflexibility to impose higher damages in extreme cases; and, it \neliminates joint and several liability for certain damages, such as \npain and suffering, so defendants pay only for the damages they cause--\nnot those caused by others.\n  In addition to the overall benefits consumers will enjoy after \nenactment of this bill, Minnesota will see an additional benefit. The \nreality is our current system is stifling technological innovation, in \nparticular, the production of medical devices.\n  Mr. President, Minnesota is a world leader in the development of \nlifesaving medical technology and this industry is a vital part of \nMinnesota's growing economy.\n  In 1994, there were 568 registered medical device establishments in \nMinnesota. Furthermore, Minnesota ranks 2nd in the Nation with over \n16,000 people employed in medical device manufacturing.\n  More than 11 million Americans rely on implanted medical technologies \nto sustain or enhance the quality of their lives. Many of these \nproducts are manufactured in my State including artificial joints, \ncardiac defibrillators, drug infusion pumps and heart valves.\n  Unfortunately, many suppliers of the raw materials used to make \nmedical devices are restricting the use of their products in medical \nimplants for fear of exposing themselves to costly product liability \nlitigation.\n  Suppliers of raw materials play no role in the design or manufacture \nof the medical device and courts have consistently found them free from \nliability. Unfortunately, the costs of the lawsuit ``discovery'' \nprocess are surpassing the profits raw material suppliers will receive \nfrom selling their products to device manufacturers.\n  If biomaterials suppliers refuse to sell their raw materials to \nAmerica's medical device companies, device manufacturers are forced to \neither substitute another material, which many times is impossible, or \ndiscontinue production of a device which is fulfilling a vital need for \npatients.\n  A recent example was highlighted in the Wall Street Journal by a \nmother whose daughter suffers from hydrocephalus, or water on the \nbrain. The only medical therapy that treats this is a surgically \nimplanted device, called a shunt, made of silicone.\n  Fifty-thousand Americans depend on shunts to keep them alive, but \nbecause of recent lawsuits, companies who supply silicone for the \nproduction of devices like shunts are no longer willing to sell the raw \nmaterials. This situation is devastating to patients who desperately \nneed these lifesaving devices.\n  Essentially, this legislation's Biomaterials Access Assurance \nprovision would allow suppliers of the raw materials or biomaterials \nused to make medical devices, to obtain dismissal, without extensive \ndiscovery or other legal costs, in certain tort suits in which \nplaintiffs allege harm from a finished medical device.\n  This provision would allow raw materials suppliers to be dismissed \nfrom lawsuits if the generic raw material used in the medical device \nmet contract specifications, and if the biomaterials supplier cannot be \nclassified as either a manufacturer or seller of the medical device. \nMost importantly, this provision would not affect the ability of \nplaintiffs to sue manufacturers or sellers of medical devices.\n  As the chairman of the Senate's Medical Technology Caucus, I would \nlike to thank the Senator from Connecticut for all his hard work to \nensure that the Product Liability bill recognizes the urgency of \nproviding much-needed relief to suppliers of bio-materials who have no \ndirect role in the raw material's ultimate use as a ``biomaterial'' in \na medical device.\n  Mr. President, I would like to note that even President Clinton \nrecognizes this provision as ``a laudable attempt to ensure that \nsuppliers of biomaterials will provide sufficient quantities of their \nproducts'' to medical device manufacturers.\n  The bill before us today is the first step in the right direction, \nbut certainly not the last. While we have made great progress toward \nreforming our current system, I believe we should do more. We need to \nextend protections to America's consumers in civil liability cases \nwhich have devastated local girl scout troops, neighborhood little \nleagues and community recreational organizations.\n  Furthermore, Congress should pass medical malpractice reforms to \nensure that the doctor-patient relationship is protected from lawyers. \nDoctors complain that many times they are forced to order unnecessary \ntests just to protect themselves against frivolous lawsuits. This \npractice called ``defensive medicine'' costs our country over $15 \nbillion each year.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should adopt this first step and continue \nmoving forward to reform our overall liability system. Failing to enact \nthis legislation will result in even higher costs to customers, fewer \nproducts developed and fewer jobs as companies downsize to adjust to \nincreasingly high legal costs.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the positive impact this \nlegislation will have on countless businesses across our country. \nUltimately, it will benefit the employees whose jobs will be secured as \na result of enactment of this long overdue legislation, while at the \nsame time, we continue to protect consumers seeking judgements against \ncompanies who have manufactured faulty products.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nconference report on H.R. 956, the Common Sense Product Liability Legal \nReform Act of 1996. I intend to vote in favor of this legislation \nbecause I believe that modest legislation in this area is necessary.\n  The issue of product liability reform is one of those circumstances \nwhere I think there is some truth on both sides. Tort reform is by its \nvery nature controversial. The ability of citizens to seek redress \nthrough the courts for harm caused to them is a very important right we \nmust respect and protect. At the same time, it is a fact that our court \nsystem in the United States is deluged with a flood of lawsuits, many \nof which have no merit.\n  Unfortunately, the excesses of some force a reaction that affects \neveryone. I appreciate the sensitivity with which we in the Congress \nmust proceed in passing any Federal legislation that reforms tort laws. \nI realize that because of our court system and because of the activism \nof well meaning consumer advocates, our Nation does have safer cars, \ntoys, and other products. If it had not been for key cases that put the \nfire to the feet of corporations who would rather cut corners to \nenhance the bottom line than concern themselves with the safety of \nconsumers, I am convinced that there would be more exploding cars and \nmore dangerous toys that hurt children.\n  Deadly and dangerous products such as asbestos, flammable children's \npajamas, and exploding Ford Pintos were all removed from the market \nonly after action was taken in court to hold the\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\nmanufacturers of these products accountable. Because these cases \noccurred, our lives are safer as a result. There have been many cases \nwhere manufacturers were legitimately held liable for their negligent \nor egregious actions.\n  However, these cases do not tell the entire story about our tort \nsystem. Unfortunately, there are so many other cases that may have \nlittle merit that are filed, not with the goal to seek fair \ncompensation or change the behavior of a manufacture, but are filed \nwith a goal to get rich quick. The result is that many manufacturers \nand businesses are strangled in liability cases that defy common sense. \nThese cases don't help consumers.\n  It seems to me that Federal action is warranted in the area of \nproduct liability suits. But, I believe that any Federal action in this \narea must be modest and narrowly construed. Over the past few years, I \nhave been an active participant in the development of this legislation. \nIn the 103d Congress, I fought against a provision that would have \nprovided complete immunity to manufacturers of medical products and \naircraft manufacturers from all punitive damage awards. The FDA/FAA \ndefense provision, as it was called, took this reform effort way too \nfar in my judgment. That is why I fought to have the provision removed \nand if this provision existed in the legislation before the Senate \ntoday, I would be voting no.\n  Fortunatly, the bill sponsors saw fit to not include the FDA/FAA \ndefense provision in the conference report we are considering today. As \na result, we have a bill which I believe advances some modest reform \nwithout closing the door on consumers who legitimately need to look to \nthe courts for compensation.\n  I believe it is important to advance this modest tort reform \nlegislation. It is my hope that if this legislation becomes law, it \nwill result in more reasonableness in our tort system.\n  I am under no illusions that this legislation is going to create a \nperfect world in the courts. However, I hope this legislation will \ncreate a better world that restores some moderation to excessive \nlitigation, while not destroying the rights of consumers to seek \nredress for their grievances in the courts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank my friend and \ncolleague from Washington. I signed the conference report with regard \nto the product liability measure that is before us. I recommend that \nthe Senate accept this. I hope the President will not veto it, as he \nhas threatened.\n  I have been listening to the debate, and I have studied this issue \nfor a long, long time. Over 20 years ago, when I had the opportunity to \nserve my State as Governor, we worked on and we enacted a piece of \nlegislation that is related to this whole area. It was with regard to \nmalpractice in the health care field. There were concerns about that. I \nlistened to both sides at that time. I finally decided, in the best \ninterest of Nebraska, that malpractice piece of legislation should go \ninto effect to provide adequate and better health care, to keep \neveryone involved.\n  I must say, that was one of the early pieces of legislation with \nregard to placing caps on malpractice legislation, and I must say that \nit has been a resounding success in Nebraska.\n  I recognize and have heard the debate on both sides of the issue, \nand, as so often is the case, Mr. President, we do not pass perfect \nlegislation here, but ignoring the problem that we have today, that we \nhave had for all of these years--this is as near a place we can solve \nit with what I think is a reasonable piece of legislation, a piece of \nlegislation that where, if there is gross misconduct on the part of the \nmanufacturer or the inventor, there is some relief.\n  I think we accomplish very little by citing this case and citing that \ncase. If we continue with that kind of a proposition, we will simply \nconfuse the public at large, and maybe the House and Senate, that we \nshould do nothing. I think if there is one thing that is obvious, it is \nthat we have to do something. I think the ``something'' is this bill \nthat has been carefully crafted, that has been worked out in committee, \nthat has been worked out in the conference between the House and the \nSenate, and I believe if there was ever a true workable compromise, \nthis is a principal example.\n  So, I simply salute the people who have provided the leadership in \nthis over the years. I hope the bill will be resoundingly approved by \nthe Senate with our vote around noontime today. Maybe we can get on \nwith solving this problem. There is a problem. No one can deny that. I \nam sure many of my colleagues feel very strongly that this is a bad \npiece of legislation. It is not a perfect piece of legislation, but it \nis a piece of legislation that has been carefully crafted, compromised. \nI think it is the best we can do under the circumstances, and I believe \nwe should do it.\n  I intend to vote enthusiastically in support of this legislation. I \nthank the Chair and thank my friend from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington. The debate now is about over, and we are about to \nvote. We are about to vote on a bill which I think is profoundly \nimportant, not only in the symbolism of it but in the reality. You \ncannot have an engine in a car that is invented by 51 separate people \nwho do not communicate with each other and expect the engine to move \nthe car forward.\n  Similarly, you cannot protect and extend predictability and fairness \nand consumer protection--for example, as witness the statute of \nlimitations--to help people in this country get justice from injury, \nfrom defective products if the engine that they have to depend upon is \ninvented by 51 separate people who never talk to each other, and then \nsomebody turns the key on and who knows where the system goes, or where \nthe car goes. Probably nowhere.\n  We have a system that works particularly well for a few. We have, \nhowever, a system that works particularly poorly for the most. It is \nthe job, it seems to me, of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress to \ntry to improve the condition and the lot of our people in a fair and \nbalanced manner. One cannot reasonably come into this Chamber all the \ntime and say, ``I'm only going to do things which will help an injured \nperson but pay no attention to other aspects of their life,'' for \nexample, whether they are employed, whether they have a reasonable \nexpectation of having a job.\n  What we have tried to do in this product liability conference report \nis to make a fair, reasonable balance between the interests of \nconsumers and business. We have done that. We have had asserted \nconstantly against us that we have not, assertions which are made every \nyear we discuss these things, which are wrong.\n  So now we are prepared to do something, and I fully expect the Senate \nwill adopt this conference report. It is an important bill. I repeat \nthat I hope the President of the United States, who I think very much \nwants to sign a product liability reform bill--in fact, I am told very \ndirectly that he wants to sign a product liability bill. The question \nis what condition must it be in. I think we are presenting the \nPresident with a fair bill, one in which the Senate did not try to \nexpand beyond products, one in which the Senate rejected virtually all \nother suggestions in which the only basic change was the statute of \nrepose.\n  It is a very good bill. There is no other way to say it than that. I \nalso want to thank the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, for \nhis enormous role in all of this product liability debate, and his \nchief of staff, Bill Bonvillian, who is also an extraordinary person, \nwho has been unbelievably kind and attentive to my legislative \ndirector, Tamera Stanton, to whom I referred earlier, who is going \nthrough a difficult situation just now.\n  This is fair. This is the way America ought to work. The bill, I \nbelieve, will pass. I can only pray that the President will sign it. I \nthank the President and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. How much, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. I want to reserve time \nfor the distinguished minority leader, the Senator from South Dakota, \nwho just notified us he would like a little time here.\n  Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to reject this \nlegislation. The only thing that stands in the way of an act of \nCongress overturning 200 years of State law and placing severe \nrestrictions on the civil rights of American citizens is the vote on \nthis conference report.\n  Some try to simplify this issue as a debate between trial lawyers and \nmanufacturers. But this issue is larger than that. This matter goes to \nthe heart of our Nation's constitutional federalism. I am convinced \nthat to the extent Congress can selectively preempt State law, override \nState constitutions, overturn State legislative decisions, and dictate \nto State judges and juries the standards they must follow on matters \nthat have nothing to do with Federal constitutional rights, then States \nessentially have lost their sovereignty. Maintaining an independent \ncivil justice system is the essence of a free state. This freedom, \nhowever, would be seriously eroded by this bill.\n\n\n                  i. state sovereignty/dual federalism\n\n  The stated purpose of this bill is to erect barriers regarding the \nuse of the civil justice system for redress of injuries caused by \ndangerous products. However, I would remind my colleagues that, unlike \nthe judicial systems of other countries, the American judicial system \nis rooted in democratic principles of individual redress, the right to \na jury trial, and reliance on the people to resolve disputes. These \nwere principles established by the Founding Fathers when they adopted \nthe 7th and 10th amendments to the Constitution. Surely, issues such as \nwhether to limit access to courts, limit redress remedies, or penalize \ncitizens for merely bringing suits were considered by the Founding \nFathers, as well as the judges and State officials that have \nadministered our system of justice for over 200 years. But they decided \nagainst such measures, and opted instead to maintain a system that \nfeatures free access to the courts, common law, and giving the people \nthe ultimate authority to resolve conflicts.\n  The supporters of this bill, however, are seeking to overturn this \nlongstanding American history and judicial precedent. They would prefer \nto ram through this sweeping and unprecedented legislation.\n  I am, indeed, confounded that the Senate is even considering this \nlegislation. At the beginning of this Congress, Member after Member \ncame to the floor during consideration of S. 1, the unfunded mandates \nbill, to declare that this would be the Congress of States' rights, \nwhere Government would be returned to the people. The Jeffersonian \ndemocracy of government was revived. If we've heard it once, we've \nheard it a million times, that State and local governments know best \nhow to protect the health and safety of their citizens, and that they \ndo not need Congress telling them what to do. How many times did we \nhear that the one clear message sent by the voters in November 1994 was \nthat the people wanted to get the Federal Government off their backs \nand out of their pockets?\n  The 10th amendment, lost in the shuffle for many years, was given new \nlight. The majority leader himself, in his opening address to the new \nCongress, proclaimed:\n\n       . . . America has reconnected us with the hopes for a \n     nation made free by demanding a Government that is more \n     limited. Reigning in our government will be my mandate, and I \n     hope it will be the purpose and principal accomplishment of \n     the 104th Congress.\n       . . . We do not have all the answers in Washington, D.C. \n     Why should we tell Idaho, or the State of South Dakota, or \n     the State of Oregon, or any other State that we are going to \n     pass this Federal law and that we are going to require you to \n     do certain things . . . \n\n  The majority leader went on to say:\n\n       . . . Federalism is an idea that power should be kept close \n     to the people. It is an idea on which our nation was founded. \n     But there are some in Washington--perhaps fewer this year \n     than last--who believe that our states can't be trusted \n     with power. . . . If I have one goal for the 104th \n     Congress, it is this: That we will dust off the 10th \n     Amendment and restore it to its rightful place.\n\n  If we are going to respect the 10th amendment, Mr. President, then we \nmust be consistent.\n  But consistency is not something in which this Congress seems to be \ninterested. The same Congress that has championed States rights \nregarding welfare is now advancing the power of the Federal Government \nover State civil courts. It appears that some believe the States have \nall the answers when it comes to welfare and education, but for some \nreason are incapable of running their own courts.\n  To the extent any reforms are needed, the States already have \ninstituted such measures. Since 1986, over 40 States have enacted tort \nreform legislation. This includes my home State of South Carolina, \nwhich enacted a major tort reform measure in 1988. The States--through \ntheir work with members of the bar, the chamber of commerce, the \ninsurance industry, and consumer groups--have addressed concerns about \nthe tort system, and have crafted legislation they believe is in the \nbest interest of their citizens. The proponents of this bill, however, \nwould override the enormous and commendable efforts and time the States \nhave devoted to this issue, and force their own brand of reform on the \nStates.\n  Ironically, during the 1994 elections, when many of those who now so \nvehemently champion States rights were elected, the people of Arizona \nconsidered a State-wide tort reform referendum that consisted of many \nof the initiatives in this conference agreement. By a 2-to-1 vote, the \npeople of Arizona rejected the referendum. Now some Members would like \nto reward them by using their Federal power to force on the citizens of \nArizona the initiatives they soundly rejected at the ballot box.\n\n\n         II. Refutation of Claims Regarding Need of Legislation\n\n  The conference report contains a number of ``findings'' regarding the \nneed for this legislation. Most of the findings are repeats of the \nvarious claims that have been made over the last decade. Nevertheless, \nit is necessary again to set the record straight with the facts.\n  Finding No. 1 states:\n\n       Our nation is overly litigious, the civil justice system is \n     overcrowded, sluggish, and excessively costly and the costs \n     of lawsuits, both direct and indirect, are inflicting serious \n     and unnecessary injury on the national economy.\n\n  Rebuttal:\n  This is the old litigation explosion claim. However, there has never \nbeen any evidence of a litigation explosion as the following data \ndemonstrate:\n  A 1991 Rand study found that only 2 percent of Americans injured by \nproducts ever file a lawsuit.\n  A 1994 report by the National Center for State Courts found that \nproduct liability cases are less than 1 percent of all civil filings.\n  A 1995 study by the National Center for State Courts found that, of \nthe 2 percent of lawsuits that are filed, 90 percent are disposed of by \nnontrial, such as dismissals or settlements.\n  In June 1994, the New York Times featured a front page story on how \njuries are growing tougher on plaintiffs. Citing the latest research by \nJury Verdicts Research, Inc., the Times stated that plaintiffs' success \nrates in product liability cases have dropped from 59 to 41 percent \nbetween 1989 and 1994. A 1995 report by the National Center for State \nCourts shows that tort filings have declined 6 percent since 1991.\n  Profs. James Henderson, a supporter of State product liability \nreform, and Theodore Eisenberg of Cornell University released a study \nin 1992, which showed that product liability filings had declined by 44 \npercent by 1991. They concluded that by ``most measures, product \nliability has returned to where it was at the beginning of the \ndecade,'' beginning in the 1980's.\n\n\n                          business litigation\n\n  Where is the real litigation explosion? It is in the corporate board \nrooms. According to professor Marc Galanter of the University of \nWisconsin Law School, the real litigation explosion in recent years has \ninvolved businesses suing each other, not injured persons seeking \nredress of their rights. He found that business contract filings in \nFederal courts increased by 232 percent between 1960 and 1988, and\n\n[[Page S2587]]\n\nby 1988 comprised the largest category of civil cases in the Federal \ncourts.\n  In August 1995, the National Law Journal released the findings of its \nstudy of judicial emergencies in Federal courts. The study found that \n33 percent of the judicial emergencies involved business litigation.\n  Between 1989 and 1994, of the 83 largest civil damage awards \nnationwide, 73 percent involved business suits. Between 1987 and 1994, \njust 76 of the top business verdicts alone accounted for more than $10 \nbillion. They included: Litton Systems versus Honeywell, a patent \ninfringement dispute--$1.2 billion; Rubicon Petroleum versus Amoco, a \nbreach of contract dispute--$500 million, including $250 million in \npunitive damages; Amoco Chemical versus Certain Lloyds of London, a \nbreach of contract dispute--$425 million, including $341 million in \npunitive damages; Avia Development versus American General Reality \nInvestment, a breach of contract--$309 million, including $262 million \nin punitive damages. Of course, this does not include the greatest \nverdict of them all--the $10.5 billion awarded in 1985 in the Pennzoil \nversus Texaco case.\n  Notwithstanding the excessiveness of business suites, however, the \nbill specifically exempts business litigation from the legislation.\n\n\n                          ii. competitiveness\n\n  Finding No. 2 of the conference report states:\n\n       Excessive, unpredictable, and often arbitrary damage awards \n     and unfair allocations of liability have a direct and \n     undesirable effect on interstate commerce by increasing the \n     cost and decreasing the availability of goods and services.\n\n  Rebuttal:\n  To refute these unfounded claims about competitiveness, I simply cite \nthe comments of Mr. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers [NAM], that appeared in the Washington \nPost editorial section on Sunday, March 17, 1996. Mr. Jasinowski \nseverely decried those who have criticized American business \ncompetitiveness.\n  According to Mr. Jasinowski: the American industrial renaissance over \nthe last 4 years has restored the United States ``to the top spot among \nthe world's economies.'' While some are ``busy berating our capitalist \nsystem, the U.S. economy has become the envy of the industrialized \nworld.'' ``The American economy has quietly grown richer--gaining 8 \nmillion new jobs since 1992 and putting the unemployment rate at an \nhistorically low 5.5 percent.'' ``In the past 25 years''--during the \nmidst of the so-called product liability crisis--``U.S. employment has \nincreased 59 percent and we have created more than 5 times as many net \njobs as all the countries of Europe combined.''\n\n\n                    other studies on competitiveness\n\n  Mr. Jasinowski's editorial affirms other studies which have found no \nevidence relating product liability to U.S. competitiveness.\n  A 1987 Conference Board survey of risk managers of 232 corportions \nshows that product liability costs for most businesses are 1 percent or \nless of the final price of products, and have very little impact on \nlarger economic issues such as market share or jobs.\n\n  The Rand Corporation found that less than 1 percent of U.S. \nmanufacturers are ever named in a product liability lawsuit, and that \n``available evidence does not support the notion that product liability \nis crippling American business.''\n  In 1991, the GAO released a study of the effects of product liability \non competitiveness, and stated that it could find ``no acceptable \nmethodology for relating product liability to competitiveness.''\n\n\n                      findings on insurance costs\n\n  Finding No. 7 states:\n\n       The unpredictability of damage awards is inequitable to \n     both plaintiffs and defendants and has added considerably to \n     the high cost of liability insurance, making it difficult for \n     producers, consumers, volunteers, and nonprofit organizations \n     to protect themselves from liability with any degree of \n     confidence and at a reasonable cost.\n\n  Rebuttal:\n  The claim that there was an insurance crisis was one of the first \njustifications put forth by supporters of the legislation in the \n1980's. However, there is ample evidence that there never was, and is \nnot currently, a product liability insurance crisis.\n  A study released in March 1995 by Bob Hunter of the Consumer \nFederation of America, who was formerly the Texas Insurance \nCommissioner, shows that product liability insurance costs for U.S. \nbusinesses amount to no more than 26 cents for every $100 of total \ncosts.\n  In January 1995, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \nreported that between 1989 and 1993 product liability insurance \npremiums declined by 26 percent.\n  According to the Insurance Information Institute, insurance \ncompanies' surplus, assets minus liabilities, rose from $29 billion to \nover $230 billion between 1977 and 1995. Surplus is the money available \nafter all losses and bills have been paid. These figures show that, to \nthe extent there was an insurance downfall, it sure was not felt by the \ninsurance industry.\n  Additionally, according to the testimony of the American Insurance \nAssociation [AIA], the legislation will have no effect on insurance \nrates anyway.\n\n\n                               uniformity\n\n  Finding No. 10 states:\n\n       The rules of law governing product liability actions, \n     damage awards, and allocations of liability have evolved \n     inconsistently within and among the states, resulting in a \n     complex, contradictory, and uncertain regime that is \n     inequitable to both plaintiffs and defendants and unduly \n     burdens interstate commerce.\n\n  Rebuttal:\n  This finding is part of the proponents' claim regarding uniformity. \nHowever, contrary to the proponents' claims, the bill does not, and is \nnot intended to, create uniformity. State law is preempted in this bill \nonly to the extent it favors defendant corporations. For example, with \nrespect to punitive damages, the legislation would not disturb the law \nin the State of Washington since that State prohibits punitive damages, \nbut would preempt the law in South Carolina, which permits punitive \nawards.\n  The Chief Justices of the States have indicated that the legislation \nis likely to create considerable confusion, and lead to more \nlitigation, as a result of the varying interpretations and applications \nof its provisions by different State courts.\n  The bill imposes its own set of rules on State courts without \nimposing the same rules directly on the Federal courts. Because of the \nabsence of a Federal cause of action, Federal courts will hear cases \ninvolving the legislation only if there is diversity of citizenship or \nlocation of the parties.\n\n\n        CONFERENCE REPORT HURTS CONSUMERS MORE THAN SENATE BILL\n\n  Proponents continue to state that the conference report is not \nexpanded beyond the Senate amendment. However, the conference agreement \nextends well beyond the Senate amendment in undercutting the rights of \nvictims. The bill now limits victims' rights to be compensated for harm \ncaused by energy and utility related disasters, such as hazardous gas \nstorage facilities, and negligent entrustment cases, including the \nunlawful sale of dangerous products to minors. In addition, the statute \nof repose has been reduced from 20 to 15 years. Once restricted to \nworkplace products, this provision has also been expanded to cover any \nproduct that has an expected life span of more than 3 years. Further, \nproducts now covered by the legislation include used cars, elevators, \nchildren's toys, and medical devices made for handicapped citizens.\n  The bill has retained the abolition of joint liability for pain and \nsuffering damages. The restriction is applicable even if there is proof \nthat defendants worked together as a joint venture, or as parent and \nsubsidiary.\n  The bill has maintained discriminatory punitive damages caps. By \nbasing the cap on income and wealth, the bill permits higher punitive \nawards for individuals with the most economic advantages. In an effort \nto rectify the disparate treatment of high income and low income \nvictims, a provision was added on the Senate floor to permit judges to \nincrease punitive awards beyond the cap. Federal judges, and judges in \nmost State jurisdictions, however, are constitutionally prohibited from \nincreasing damages without the consent of the parties. Indeed, we find \nit hard to believe that any defendant would consent to higher punitive \nawards. The proponents stated the constitutional issue would be \nresolved in conference. The conference agreement, however, has actually \nenhanced the\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\npower of judges to increase damages, all but ensuring the provision \nwill be deemed unconstitutional. The end result will be that additur \nwill be removed, and the discriminatory cap will remain. Additionally, \nwe question why Congress would pass a law it recognizes as unfair, and \nthen shift the responsibility to judges to rectify the problem.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Simply put, Mr. President, there is no product liability crisis. \nIndeed, if there are problems that need to be examined in the tort \nsystem, they already are being addressed by the States, where this \nissue belongs.\n  This legislation is the epitome of congressional arrogance. It takes \naway from the States an area of the law that has been reserved to the \nStates for 200 years.\n  What will this bill do? It will make it more difficult for consumers \nto be compensated for their harm from products; it will shield from \nliability manufacturers which consciously manufacture defective \nproducts; it will take away from the States rules of law they have \ncarefully developed; and it will remove incentives for manufacturers to \nmake their products safe. These are some of the results of this bill, \nresults which are not in the best interests of our citizens.\n  I conclude by urging my colleagues to reject cloture on this \nconference report. Despite years of effort, no case has ever been made \nfor Federal product liability law. The proponents move from claim to \nclaim about the need for this bill, because they know that this is a \nsham. If there ever was special interest legislation, it is this bill. \nIt is special interest at the expense of the constitutional and civil \nliberties of the American people. I urge my colleagues not to be misled \nby the proponents' claims, and to vote against this conference report.\n  There are so many things to say in the limited time. But section \n106(b)(3)(C) refers to a general aviation statute of repose limitation \nperiod. It is for 18 years. That is the way the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington started talking about this bill yesterday. It was all \nabout Cessna and aviation and everything else like that.\n  All the provisions of the products bill apply to general aviation, so \nthere are no longer protections for people injured, of course, on the \nground or the air ambulance people, even though the 1994 law provided \nthose protections. But what I wonder about, if this general aviation \nprovision of 18 years has done such a remarkable revival of the \naviation industry, why are we limiting it? There we go.\n  No. The Senator from Nebraska says there is a real problem and \neverybody knows it. That is absolutely false. We know that the States \nhave taken care of this problem. Yes, there is a political problem, \nbecause Presidential politics has preempted everything up here in \nWashington.\n  I saw some article in one of the magazines about the campaign \nstarting. The campaign started early last year. In 100 days we were \ngoing to do this, get rid of everybody, 10 things in the Contract, we \nare going to pass them in 100 days, and whoopee. And we were off, and \neverything else of that kind--until reality set in.\n  But now there is the time of some embarrassment, since some of these \nthings have not been passed--and for very, very good reason. A good \nreason, of course, assuming the truth of everything that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut says, is that the State Legislature of Connecticut is \nready, willing, able, alert, and responsive. He was a majority leader \nof it. The State of Connecticut has taken care of these problems. We \nall take care of these problems in the several States.\n  But right to the point, this bill is a travesty, Mr. President. The \nPresiding Officer knows it. It separates people. It separates them \naccording to their economic worth. That is a dastardly thing to do. I \ncannot see people of good sense and reason voting for a thing of this \nkind and hoping the President will sign it. The President knows the \nfacts. He has reiterated them in the letter. He said, if it is so good \nand so fair, as they plead, then why does it not apply to business--the \nvery people who drew it up? This thing was drafted by business, of \nbusiness, for business, greedy business. That is what it has been for, \nand the proponents all know it.\n  I say that advisedly. I have gotten every business award you can \nfind. I am proud of them. I work closely with business. We have more \nbusiness coming to our State than all these other States that these \nSenators represent. I challenge them to compete with us on taking care \nof business. That has been my 40-year record of public service.\n  So I know when they step over the line. The fact of the matter is, \nthere is a small segment, Victor Schwartz and his crowd, stepping over \nthe line that has picked up the political fever of ``kill all the \nlawyers.'' It is the business of travesty that increases the legal \ncosts for those trying to really try their cases. They know that these \nare contingency fees.\n  So if you get a good verdict, and it is a punitive damage verdict, \nyou do OK. We put in the Record where punitive damages have disciplined \nthese businesses. Thank heavens it has because we are all safer on \naccount of it. That is why we get the recalls, because the \nmanufacturers are put on notice. The proponents know that is why we are \ngetting the recalls in our society. But now they have to go through a \nwhole new hearing. And they talk about simplicity and transaction \ncosts.\n  How can they claim simplicity with all the different proceedings they \nhave here now, trying to limit legal costs? They tell the utilities \nthey can forget about strict liability, they can forget about the \nhighest degree of care. The Senator from North Dakota and the Senator \nfrom Washington got into a very clear dialog about simple negligence. \nLet the boilers blow up, let the gas blow up, let it explode. The \nhighest degree of care now is no longer required under this bill.\n\n  Yes, we put in the Record about the drunk drivers. I reiterate, in \nthe letter of MADD in opposition, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, they \noppose this bill. They know and they read and they understand and they \nstand by their particular opposition.\n  It encourages the lack of care with that statute of repose on \nmanufacturers. Manufacturers here are exercising the highest degree of \ncare. They are not in these other lands. But now the proponents want to \ntalk about global competition. I have touched on that. They are \ncompeting with themselves. They want to take down the high degree of \ncare by overriding the strict liability. Punitive damages is another \nthing that has given us safe products in this land, safe places to \nwork, safe places to sleep, safe drugs and food, and everything else of \nthat kind.\n  More than anything else, Mr. President, it is just patently \nunconstitutional. Amendment VII:\n\n       In suits of common law, where the value in controversy \n     shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall \n     be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise \n     reexamined in any Court of the United States. . . .\n\n  This particular bill says reexamine it at the trial court level, but \nkeep it a secret. The judge is supposed to charge the jury under the \nlaw, stay out of the facts. But this bill says, by gosh, reexamine it \nin violation of amendment VII. Of course, it ignores amendment X that \nthe distinguished majority leader has run all over the entire United \nStates talking about, saying, ``I've got one thing here in my pocket, \nthe 10th amendment.''\n  These folks all come up here and act like they never heard of the \nStates from which they were sent. The States have acted on product \nliability over the 15 years that the Senator from Rhode Island \ncomplained about. They have acted very judiciously. It is not a \nproblem. It is a little political gimmick in the contract. It is a \nshame and disgrace that we have taken up the time of the National \nCongress on this matter that the States have taken care of.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. How many minutes do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 3 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina \nfor yielding. I will use whatever leader time I may require to finish \nmy statement.\n  Let me commend the Senator from South Carolina for the arguments he \nhas again made in his summary on this\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\ndebate. I applaud him for the leadership and the effort he has put \nforth. I very enthusiastically endorse his position. Let me also thank \nthe distinguished Senators from Washington and from West Virginia and \nfrom Connecticut that have, as well as they have, brought this bill \ncloser to a bill that is reasonable.\n  As the distinguished Senator from South Carolina said, Mr. President, \nit is ironic in the extreme that, in this era of devolution, in this \nera of States rights, in this era of empowering States with more \nopportunities to deal with issues at the local level, this Congress, of \nall Congresses, would now pass a bill that says the Federal Government \nknows better. It is especially ironic that this Congress would say the \nFederal Government knows better on an issue as profound as this, \naffecting victims in the worst set of circumstances.\n  I respect the Presiding Officer for his consistency in suggesting \nthat devolution and new Federalism, or whatever we call it, ought to be \nsustained, regardless of the issue, that we ought not pick issues \ndepending on the special interests, that we really have a \nresponsibility to be consistent.\n  Certainly in this case it would require, I believe, a second look. We \ncan do better than this. We can do better than what we are going to be \nvoting on this afternoon.\n  I am very troubled by a couple of provisions. One in particular \ntroubles me. Mr. President, to say that someone working on a defective \npiece of machinery is going to be protected if that machinery is \nfunctional for 15 years, but not for 16 years, to me is amazing. To ask \npeople on the work line, to ask people on the combine, to ask people in \nwhatever set of working circumstances they face, to accept the risk \nthat this equipment is going to hold out after that period is more than \nI can support. To ask American companies to live up to their \nobligation, to understand how important it is that people working on \nassembly lines or in a field have the protection and the certainty and \nthe opportunity to come to work knowing they will be able to come home \nwhole is not too much to ask. A 20-year statute of repose is not too \nmuch to ask.\n  Mr. President, the other issue has to do with component parts. We \nhave gone through some terrible situations in the last several years \ninvolving defective component parts. One example involves women who \nwere given breast implants that were defective, when it was well known \nthat a component of the breast implants posed severe health risks in \nthe body of a woman. Now to immunize from liability people who \nmanufacture defective component parts and to say we are going to, \nthrough statute, give them our blessing is wrong. It is wrong.\n  Mr. President, we can do better than this. We have to do better than \nthis. Those of us opposing this bill will continue to do so. This fight \nis not over. The President has said in no uncertain terms this bill \nwill be vetoed. I predict we will have more than enough votes to \nsustain a veto.\n  Again, this fight is not over. We can do better than this. We ought \nto do better than this. In working with the President, the Presiding \nOfficer and others, we will. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I \ncommend the Senator from Washington and the Senator from West Virginia \nfor bringing to the floor of the Senate a reasonable, moderate product \nliability bill which the President ought to sign.\n  The representations in this Chamber that we should do better and \ncould do better belie the current performance of this Chamber, which \nfor 15 years has sought to enact a bill like this, but never really \nbrought one forward that could be passed. This is a bill that can be \npassed.\n  There can be debate about whether or not there is a litigation \nexplosion in this country. Some can say we have too much litigation or \ntoo little. Let me give you a fact. The fact is that tort costs are 2.3 \npercent of the Gross Domestic Product in the United States, according \nto the Tillinghast study. That is 2\\1/2\\ times the world average. In \nshort, we have the most expensive tort liability system in the world. \nIt is time for us to change that. We must stop wasting money by \nexchanging it between the trial lawyers and punitive damage recipients \ninstead of using it to create the competitive and economic edge that \nwill allow us to be successful--to create jobs and build equipment, and \nto grow this economy. We need to revitalize the industrial base of the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  Uniform standards in product liability law would help return good \nproducts to the markets, reduce the price of consumer goods, and break \nthe legal shackles on American businesses to help them become more \ncompetitive internationally.\n  This bill will make products safer. Litigation, which we have had \nplenty of, stifles innovation that makes products safe. Overall product \nsafety in the United States improved steadily in the first half of this \ncentury, when a much more limited liability system was in effect. We \nneed to make sure that safety, not greed, is what is emphasized by our \nlaws in this area.\n  Let me make another point. We need to make this fundamentally clear: \nNo person will be denied the right to recover actual damages under this \nbill. Every cent of damages, even damages for pain and suffering \npreviously that has been available, is available under this bill. The \nbill has limits on punitive damages, but those are damages to punish. \nThose are not damages to make a person whole for what has happened to \nthem.\n  One last point that I raise, this bill was pared down from what it \nought to be and what it should be--in an effort to accommodate the \nPresident. We ought to really be extending some tort reform protection \nto our charities. This bill does not provide protection to churches, to \nvoluntary and charitable organizations, which means there will be no \nliability protection for volunteers in the Little League, the American \nRed Cross, the Salvation Army, the American Cancer Society, for people \nwho run soup kitchens. We need an explosion of people helping solve \nAmerica's endemic social pathologies. What do we have in the United \nStates instead? A tort system which threatens everyone who tries to \nhelp his neighbor with the potential of bankrupting liability.\n  Dick Aft, president of the United Way & Community Chest of \nCincinnati, put it this way, ``The litigious climate imposes a cost for \nall charities, costs that can be measured in resigning trustees, lost \nvolunteer hours and sky-high insurance premiums. These are tough times \nfor charities. The last thing we need is a legal system that adds to \nour burden.''\n  Mr. President, as long as our litigation system forces a would-be \nvolunteer to consider whether the risks of being sued outweigh the \nbenefits of contributing one's time and talent to charitable \norganizations efforts to solve society's problems will continue to be \nunnecessarily stymied.\n  In order to try to entice the President of the United States to go \nback to his previous position supporting federal product liability \nreform, the Senate has had to take the protections for non-profits out \nof this bill. Then the President still comes out and opposes the bill. \nAs a result, I do not know how to trust the President on anything he \nsays. He previously said he supports it. Now he says he does not.\n  Maybe we should distrust his latest representation that he will veto \nthis. We should pass this legislation and give the President a chance \nto flip-flop back to the right side of the agenda, and I do not mean \npolitical right, I mean right versus wrong as a matter of good \ngovernment policy. This bill is right, it provides a reasonable \nframework to do business in the United States. It will protect \nconsumers. I believe it should be enacted for the good of consumers and \nthe good of the country.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished managers of the bill. I \nstrongly support the bill and commend the managers of this bill.\n  Mr. President, this is a jobs bill. It throws a liferaft to small \nbusiness. Small business today is being buffeted in the turbulent seas \nof lawsuits, yet it affords adequate protection in litigation for those \nwho are wrongfully hurt.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Commonsense Product Liability \nand Legal Reform Act of 1996. I do so because I believe that this bill \nis strongly\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\nproconsumer. The opponents of this bill may claim to be defending the \nrights of the injured. Well, this bill not only defends their rights to \nbe fairly compensated for injuries caused by defective products, but \nalso defends the rights of the rest of us not to pay for the outrageous \nverdicts, settlements, and insurance payments that American businesses \npass on to consumers because of our broken legal system.\n  It is important to remember what exactly this bill does. There are a \nnumber of commonsense provisions which nobody besides the trial lawyers \ncould oppose. For example, no longer would companies be liable when the \ninjured party was drunk, on drugs, or otherwise responsible for their \nown injuries, or when the consumer had altered the product. It also \nwould provide protection to companies producing biomaterials for use in \nmedical implants: These sections are necessary to allow these companies \nto help save lives and to worry less about being sued for merely \nproviding raw materials which ended up in a heart valve or pacemaker.\n  Then there is the issue of punitive damages which have been the \nsubject of so much discussion. Again, it is important to remember what \npunitive damages are. Imagine a plaintiff injured by a defective \nproduct, say a car with faulty brakes which causes an accident. The \nplaintiff will be able to recover every last penny of lost income, \nmedical costs, and financial losses he can demonstrate. In addition, he \nwill be entitled to recover for pain and suffering as the jury sees fit \nand in relation to the injuries suffered. Then, on top of being \ncompletely compensated, he can ask for punitive damages which may have \nno relation to the amount he received for compensatory damages. \nSometimes punitive damages are granted, sometimes not: more often a \ncompany is forced to settle a case to avoid the possibility of a \noutrageous jury verdict. This is a pure lottery having nothing to do \nwith the injuries suffered by the plaintiff which mainly benefits the \nlawyer working on a contingent fee. It is a crazy way to dispense \njustice.\n\n  My State of Virginia has recognized this problem and placed a \nreasonable cap on punitive damages. But Virginians buy products \nproduced in other States and pay for the costs of this legal lottery \ncreated by the legal systems in other States. President Clinton says \nthat this bill usurps the power of the States. Commerce, however, is \nnationwide and where States are placing undue burdens on interstate \ncommerce, Congress is correct to step in and make reforms.\n  Now remember also that when President Clinton was Governor, he \nendorsed uniform legislation for punitive damages. Even the Washington \nPost has recognized that the President and the opponents of this bill \nare on the side of the trial attorneys, rather than American consumers \nand businesses.\n  I urge that the Senate move to consideration of this badly needed \nlegislation and that it be enacted as soon as possible.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, article 1, section 8 of the Constitution \nof the United States reads in part as follows: ``The Congress shall \nhave power to regulate commerce among the several States.'' The \npurposes of this bill, as outlined in this bill, read as follows:\n\n       Based upon the powers contained in Article 1, Section 8, \n     Clause 3 of the 14th amendment of the United States \n     Constitution, the purposes of this act are to promote the \n     free flow of goods and services, to lessen burdens on \n     interstate commerce, and to uphold the constitutionally \n     protected due process by, (1), establishing certain uniform \n     legal principles of product liability which provide a fair \n     balance among the interests of product users, manufacturers \n     and product sellers; (2), placing reasonable limits on \n     damages over and above the actual damages suffered by a \n     claimant; (3), ensuring the fair allocation of liability in \n     civil actions; (4), reducing the unacceptable cost and delays \n     of our civil justice system caused by excessive litigation \n     which harm both plaintiffs and defendants; (5), establishing \n     greater fairness, rationality, and predictability, in the \n     civil justice system.\n\n  That is precisely what this bill is designed to do, Mr. President. \nThat is precisely what this bill does.\n  I yield the remaining 2 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nlegislation. I want to pay tribute to both Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Gorton who have had such great courage, leading this \ncontroversial bill and bringing it here. This is perhaps one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation this Congress will consider \nbecause of the benefits it will have for small business.\n  Senator Gorton, who has appeared before the Supreme Court 14 times, \nis a legal expert. His expertise in explaining this bill, both in the \ncommittee and on the floor, have been very, very valuable. This bill \nwould not be here without Senator Slade Gorton. He has been able to \nexplain this bill, the technical parts of it.\n  Senator Rockefeller, in my opinion has shown great courage. I wanted \nto use my time to pay tribute to those two leaders who have fought so \nlong and hard through the committee.\n  I strongly support this legislation.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I simply would like to say after this \nextended debate, not only over the period of the last 2 days but over \nthe period of the last year, and for that matter several Congresses, \nthat it is wonderful to have at least this phase of it completed. This \nvery important element in the reform of our country's legal system \nwould not have been completed with this degree of success without the \nhelp of both many Members and a significant number of staff.\n  When one names names, one runs the risk of leaving out many people \nwho deserve credit, but particular credit from my perspective belongs \nto Lance Bultena of the Commerce Committee staff, and my own Jeanne \nBumpus and Trent Erickson. Together they have put in so many hours on \nthis subject that it cannot possibly be measured, and have done a \nwonderful job in educating and advising me.\n  For Senator Rockefeller, Jim Gottlieb, a magnificent and skilled \nattorney, and Ellen Doneski have provided similar services. All of my \ncosponsors I wish to thank. All those who voted with me, I wish to \nthank. Most particularly, however, is the Senator from West Virginia \n[Mr. Rockefeller]. We have come to be close personal friends during the \ncourse of the many years that we have worked together on this subject. \nHe is a wonderful, thoughtful, and hard-working individual. In this \nconnection, he is a courageous individual with the willingness to take \non a majority of his own party and his own President.\n  His devotion to the public interest is not exceeded by any Member of \nthis body. The ability to become such a close personal friend has been \nan important ancillary privilege of leading the debate on product \nliability.\n  With that, Mr. President, I am sure it is time to move on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 956.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

The Chair lays before the Senate, S. 1459, the \nPublic Rangelands Management Act, with 75 minutes equally divided on \nthe Bumpers amendment.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1459) to provide for uniform management of \n     livestock grazing on Federal land, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n\n       Domenici amendment No. 3555, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Bumpers modified amendment No. 3556 (to amendment No. \n     3555), to maintain the current formula used to calculate \n     grazing fees for small ranchers with 2,000 animal unit months \n     [AUM's] or less, with certain minimum fees, and establish a \n     separate grazing fee for large ranchers with more than 2000 \n     AUMs.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3556, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Bumpers is here. Might I inquire \nof Senator Bumpers, we do not need our entire 37 minutes. Is there any \nchance, in the interest of moving the Senate's business along, you \nmight get by with a little less of your time so that we could vote a \nlittle earlier?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am quite sure we will not use our all of our time, \neither. We will be happy to yield the balance of such time. I only know \nof two people on this side, Senator Jeffords and I, who will be \nspeaking.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you. Mr. President, on this side, might I say in \nearshot of staff and administrative assistants, that some Republican \nSenators have indicated they want to speak on this very amendment. \nSenator Campbell has indicated, the distinguished Senator from the \nState of Colorado; I think Senator Craig has indicated that he would \nlike to speak; and perhaps a couple of others. Let me put the word out, \nwe are trying very hard to move this bill along and use as little time \non the amendments as possible. If you could get hold of me, perhaps I \ncould set up a time, and perhaps we could agree at a certain time that \nSenator Campbell will speak for 8 or 9 minutes. If we can work to \narrange that, I will not have to be here anxiously wondering who is \ncoming because they will have a time set.\n\n  Mr. President, let me suggest that this amendment with reference to \ngrazing fees, if it were adopted and if it becomes law, would put out \nof business, in this Senator's opinion, hundreds and hundreds of small \nranches and ranching families that have been the backbone of this kind \nof activity for a long time. Let me yield myself 5 minutes and see if I \ncan make the case for that, and then I will yield back to Senator \nBumpers.\n  Mr. President, first of all, this amendment attempts to set up a two-\ntier fee system. That two-tier system that is established here, the \ndistinguished Senator indicates it is only going to have an impact on \nthe very large ranches. I want to get to that in a moment to try to \nmake sure that the Senate understands that all grazing permits do not \nhave the same tenure. Some are for 3 months, some are for 5 months \nduring the year. In a State like New Mexico, parts of Arizona, parts of \nCalifornia, and parts of a few of the other States that have year-long \ngrazing.\n  Some private property, small portion of State property, and Federal \nleases make up a ranching unit in a State like mine. We are called \nwater-based States. Essentially, the water and everything is on that \nunit. So you do not move the cattle off to public property for part of \nthe year. The livestock are there all the time.\n  As a consequence, when the distinguished Senator who had in mind that \nthis would be just for very, very large ranches, those numbers did not \ntake into consideration a ranch in New Mexico, Arizona, or California, \nthat had 12-month-a-year permits and was substantially--that is, a lot \nof the property--federally controlled. I will come back to that point \nwhen I get the actual numbers.\n  Having laid the foundation to establish this fact that it will apply \nto small ranches, not large ranches, that are on a 12-month basis and \nhave a lot of public domain, let me tell you what we try to do in the \nbill. We attempt to increase the grazing fee 37-percent. We intend it \ngo up to $1.85. This is a 37-percent increase. Now, Mr. President, in \naddition to a 37 percent increase, we are aware of the fact that you \ncannot have ranching units continue to operate, and have prices go \narbitrarily up in total disregard for the market, based upon what the \nState might charge for completely different land. Ours is based upon \nthe 3-year rolling average of the gross value of the commodity, which \ntakes into account such things,\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\nMr. President, as this year where cattle prices have come down 30 \npercent to 35 percent. It is obvious you should not be increasing fees. \nYou could not on private land. The market would not bear that. You \nshould not increase it arbitrarily under a formula when the gross value \nof the product is coming down.\n  I stress gross value. Senator Bumpers, in the mining reform debate, \nhas always wanted gross value. We use gross value.\n  In addition, we use it on figuring out the interest component, so we \nget a market movement, the 10-year average of the 6-month Treasury \nbills, so that we have a very good way to establish stability and let \nthe leases go up, but not go up in total disregard to the market.\n  Now, Mr. President, under the Bumpers proposal, the permits could be \nas much as $3 per animal unit per month up to $10 per month. I must say \nto the Senate, not even Secretary Babbitt, in his wildest dreams about \nwhat we should charge, had anything like $5, $6, $7, or $10, which some \nof the permits would be worth under the Bumpers proposal. And he had \n$4.60 once and came off that because everybody told him it was \nabsolutely ludicrous and the ranchers would go broke.\n  Incidentally, the Department of Interior and Secretary Babbitt never \nsupported, and to this day do not support, having two different fee \nschedules, depending upon the size of the ranch and the number of units \nand the number of cattle you graze, for a lot of reasons. It is \narbitrary. It was said it will not work, and obviously there are many \nother reasons.\n  I note that the distinguished Senator from Arkansas would suggest \nthat because States have a different fee schedule, we should follow \nthem. I want to make three or four points about that. First, Senators \nmust note that many of the State leases are exclusive leases. That \nmeans the only thing you can do on them is graze. From the very \nbeginning, the Federal leases are not exclusive. They must be used for \nmultiple purposes. That is a very different concept of what you can use \nit for. If you can only use it for that, to the exclusion of all the \nother uses, obviously, it would be worth more.\n  Likewise, many States have very few regulations, as compared to the \nFederal Government, making it more attractive for the rancher. Last but \nnot least, for the most part, the State lands are a very small portion \nof a unit of ranching. The Federal land is more often a very large part \nof that unit. And so, to be able to exist, you have to have stability \non that Federal side, and you have to have something that is reasonably \nconsistent with a formula that acts upon the price of the commodity, \nsuch as ours.\n  I will put in the Record that under the amendment which purports to \nsave small ranches, and charge large ranches a lot more--I will give \nyou just two numbers. If 95 percent of a unit is Federal land--and \nthere are a number of those--in the State of New Mexico, the maximum \nnumber of cows that you can have on this ranch to get into the lower-\ntier price is 176--not 500, not 1,000, but 176. The ranching unit could \nbe between 50 and 95 percent Federal land, and the number of head would \nbe between 334 and 176.\n  Mr. President, this just shows when you try to establish these \narbitrary formulas, you have to find out really everything that is \ninvolved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   PERCENTAGE OF NEW MEXICO RANCHES WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF RELIANCE ON  \n                    FEDERAL LAND FOR GRAZING CAPACITY                   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   0-5       5-50       50-95      >95  \n   Reliance on Federal land      percent    percent    percent   percent\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPercent of all ranches in New                                           \n Mexico.......................        49          21        26         5\nMax. number of cows for small                                           \n rancher exemption to apply...    >3,340   3,340-334   334-176   176-167\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdapted from Torell et al. (1992).                                      \n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment will not, as it purports \nto, have any positive effect on small ranchers staying in business in \nNew Mexico and in the other States of the Union. There is a lot more to \nsay, but distinguished Senators are here on our side. I have used 8 \nminutes, which means we have about 25 minutes left.\n  Senator Campbell, how much time would you like?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Wyoming needs 10 minutes. As soon as \nSenator Bumpers yields the floor--does he want to speak now? We can \nyield to Senator Bumpers for 8 or 10 minutes and come back and have \nthem use their time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is the Senator yielding the floor?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was trying to get an agreement so we would know who \nwas speaking on our side.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I do not have a schedule in mind. I do not have a \ncertain length of time that I am going to speak. I will yield myself \nsuch time as I will use.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On our side, when one of our Senators is able to get \nthe floor, we have agreed that Senator Campbell will speak for 10 \nminutes, and the Senator from Wyoming will speak for 10 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before I stepped on the floor a few \nminutes ago, something happened. I have a friend that came here from \nColorado. He ranches out there. He was teasing me, and he said, ``What \nis Congress' only Indian doing in here defending the cowboys?'' I have \nto tell you, Mr. President, I had a good laugh with him, but this is \nnot about cowboys and Indians. This is about real families. Some happen \nto be Indians, who are cowboys, by the way.\n  Anybody who knows the ranch lifestyle out West knows that ranchers \ngrew up with guns. They learn how to use them from childhood, and they \nget good with them. They use them for protection and for hunting. I \nguess the first thing they learn about guns is that you try to hit what \nyou aim at. I have to tell you, I admire my colleague from Arkansas \nand, certainly, Senator Jeffords, too, but they are not going to hit \nwhat they are aiming at.\n  As I understand both of their amendments, it is like hunting a wolf \nthat gets in your lambs or your calves with a shotgun. You may get the \nwolf, but with a scatter-gun approach, you get everything else, too.\n  I believe Senator Bumpers' amendment and Senator Jeffords', too, is \nreally aimed at corporate freeloaders. But by putting everybody in the \nsame category, it is certainly going to hit ranchers that are full-time \nranchers, with no other income except ranching. I think that is a very \nsad mistake. I think they should both be opposed. To put them in the \nsame category is simply not fair.\n  They are trying to define, as I understand both amendments, the \ndifference between real ranchers and nonranchers. But the approach they \nhave taken puts the large ranchers and the small ranchers in the same \ncategory as the nonranchers. And so when we hear the debate, they often \nuse Hewlett-Packard, Simplot, Anheuser-Busch, and many of the big \ncorporations who, somehow, in the past, have gotten some of the permits \nand, in fact, probably use them as tax writeoffs or some kind of a tax \nstructure in order to get tax breaks from the products they are \nproducing. But they are not what we call ``real ranchers.'' I do not \nthink anybody here from the West is trying to defend people who have \nused the ranching industry for a tax writeoff. What we are trying to \ndefend and protect are the real ranchers, the family ranchers.\n  There was some reference made to ranchers who have made it big. \nClearly, some ranchers have made some money. As Senator Gramm, our \nfriend from Texas, said, ``Welcome to America.'' What is wrong with \nthat if they made it by honest labor, made the ranch grow, and have \nweathered storms, drought, wolves, cats, and everything, and they \nmanaged to make a little more money and invest in something else or buy \nsome more land? What in the world is wrong with that in this country? \nYet, when they succeed, they are sort of put in the category of preying \non the American public and somehow taking advantage of the American \npublic because they have succeeded.\n  I think that also is not only unfair but it is wrong. This shotgun \napproach\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\nvery clearly of putting the ranchers in the same category as those \npeople who use ranching as a tax break is simply wrong to do.\n  Senator Bumpers said yesterday--I mentioned it last night --that we \nshould watch where the money goes. And I have to tell you, I live among \nfamily ranchers. I know where the money goes. It goes to Main Street by \nand large--to the hardware stores, to the movie theaters, to the used \ncar lots, to the school districts through property taxes, to the fire \ndistrict, and to every other special district you can imagine. Very \nlittle goes to recreational pursuits. If they have any money left \nusually it is put back into the herd, or into the land, or some way to \nimprove their own family lot. They do not, I know, take vacations to \nNice, France, or to Montserrat, or somewhere else like the corporate \npeople do that the Senator is aiming to get.\n  So I think both of these amendments are probably going to miss the \ntarget and get the wrong people.\n  We also dealt a little bit last night with the question about fair \nmarket value. And the accusation, of course, is that ranchers on public \nlands are not paying a fair market value because, if you compare it \nwith what the rancher is paying on private lands, it is much lower. \nThat is right. It is probably much lower.\n  We have a small ranch. And we sometimes let other ranchers rent some \nof our pasture. And I know there is a difference. But there is also a \ndifference in the amount of work they have to put up with on private \nland, whether it is rotating the fields, whether it is irrigation, or a \nlot of other things that come into play that make the difference.\n  To try to charge the person on public lands the same amount I frankly \njust think would simply run a lot of them out of business, and it \nsimply will not work. I often compare that question of fair market \nvalue with some of the other things that we have out West. I live near \nDurango, CO. Durango is near a world famous archaeological site called \nMesa Verde, a cliff dwelling that everybody in this country knows \nabout. It is run by the National Park Service. If you go to the cliff \ndwellings it costs you $3--as I recall from the last time I went--to go \nin, for an adult to get really a great historic cultural experience. \nYou can stay in there for half a day, or all day, for that $3.\n  Just down the road apiece in downtown Durango is another cultural and \nhistoric activity. It is in private ownership. It is the old train \ncalled ``The Durango to Silverton Train.'' It has been there 100 years. \nThat old train carries about 250,000 people every year, and you get a \nmarvelous western experience. But it costs you about $30 to go on that \ntrain. If you say that we are not getting fair market value from the \nthings that are being done on public land, maybe we ought to raise the \npark fee to $30 to compare it with the other experiences that people \nare getting a few miles away on the train. If you said that to the \npeople in this audience, or to the people watching the proceedings \ntoday, most of them would tell you that you are nuts. They simply will \nnot pay it.\n  Yesterday, I mentioned the zoo in Denver. It cost $6 when you go to \nthe zoo. You see wild animals. They are caged but they are basically \nwild, whether it is deer, or elk, or bear, or wolves. Yet, when you go \ninto the national forests you can often see those same animals for \nfree. Maybe we ought to charge everybody that goes in the forests $6 so \nwe get a fair market value for viewing those animals as they get when \nthey go to the zoo.\n  I could go on and on about the difference it would cost. Go cut a \nChristmas tree. You need a $5 permit from the Forest Service. But it \ncost $5 per foot if you go downtown. If you suggested to people that we \nare going to charge $5 a foot when they go into the forest to cut a \nChristmas tree, you would have a rebellion on your hands.\n  So I think the whole discussion of fair market value simply does not \nwash.\n  So I want to come in and restate my opinion on this. I think we ought \nto leave this bill alone. It has been worked on for virtually years. I \nhave been involved in it myself for over a decade. Senator Domenici has \ntaken a leadership role in bringing to the floor of the Senate what I \nthink is about as good a balance as we could put together.\n  I hope my colleagues will resist any attempt to change that and \noppose both the Bumpers amendment and the Jeffords amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  First, I want to point out that while this is commonly referred to as \na western issue, it is also a national issue. The 270 million acres of \nland that people control to graze cattle in the United States belong to \nthe taxpayers of America. The public land may be located in Wyoming. It \nmay also be located in Wyoming, Idaho, or Nevada. However, it is owned \nby the taxpayers. And 100 United States Senators have a solemn duty to \nprotect the taxpayers' interests.\n  Unhappily, these so-called ``western issues'' somehow or other fall \ninto the category of what my mother used to say as ``Everybody's \nbusiness is nobody's business.'' Unless you have a significant number \nof grazing permits in your State, you do not immerse yourself into \nthese kind of issues.\n  Why am I involved in it? No. 1, I sit on the committee from whence \nthe Domenici bill was reported out. No. 2, I am an unabashed \nenvironmentalist and I am concerned about the conditions of the \nrangeland. Third, and above all, I am totally committed to fairness.\n  Yesterday afternoon, speaking on this amendment, I pointed out that \nwhen I first discovered that the U.S. Government was selling its land \nfor $2.50 an acre for miners to mine gold and silver, I was utterly \nawestruck and did not believe it. I found out that it was indeed true. \nThat law is still on the books. The mining law was originally intended \nto encourage people to go west and help small mom- and pop-mining \noperations succeed.\n  As I delved into the mining law, I discovered that it ain't mom and \npop at all. Who is it? Who is mining the billions and billions and \nbillions of dollars worth of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium off \nof Federal lands? It ``ain't'' mom and pop. It is Bannister Resources, \nthe biggest gold company in the world, who bought the gold for $2.50 an \nacre. They are still doing it. It is Newmont Mining Co., one of the \nbiggest gold producers in the world. It is Crown Butte, and the list \ngoes on. It is not mom and pop. It is the biggest corporations--not in \nAmerica but in the world--who are mining not only gold but mining the \nU.S. Treasury which also happens to belong to the taxpayers of America.\n  So when I began studying the grazing issue I found that, No. 1, the \namount of money involved is infinitesimal. It is about $2 billion worth \nof gold that is being mined off Federal land every year, for which we \ndo not get a dime--$2 billion worth. All of the 22,000 grazing permits \nin this Nation only produce $25 million. I would be willing to forsake \nall of the grazing fees except for just the element of fairness. It is \nnot that much money. But it is not fair.\n  So what is my amendment about? I invite you to look at a chart.\n  We permit our public rangelands to people on the basis of what we \ncall an AUM. That is an ``animal unit month.'' Right now we receive \n$1.35 per AUM for every cow, or horse, or five sheep that graze on \nFederal lands under these permits. The fee was $1.85 in 1986. It is \n$1.35 now.\n  So who are these people that have the permits--these little mom and \npop ranchers you have been hearing about?\n  Here they are. Here are the 91 percent of the small ranchers my \ncolleagues on the other side say they want to protect. Count me in, Mr. \nPresident. I do, too. My amendment would cost less by the year 2005 \nthan the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico would cost, so do not \ntalk to me about who is being fair to small ranchers. These 91 percent \nof the permittees control only 40 percent of the animal unit months. \nThey are not hurt under my amendment. They should have no squawk at \nall. Do not shed any tears for them because of my amendment.\n  What else does my amendment do? Look at the right-hand side of that \nchart. Mr. President, 60 percent--60 percent--of the animal unit months \nare held by this 9 percent. Nine percent of the permittees own 60 \npercent of the AUM's. If you want to think of it in\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\npure terms of acreage, 2 percent of the permittees own 50 percent of \nthe 270 million acres.\n  Is that fair? You say yes. Let me add something else to the equation \nthen. Who is that 9 percent of the permittees? There they are. This is \njust a smattering, just a small list. Anheuser-Busch, the 80th biggest \ncorporation in America. In 1994, they were on Forbes list as the 80th. \nAnheuser-Busch has 4 permits controlling more than 8,000 AUM's. My \namendment only raises the fees on people who have more than 2,000 \nAUM's. Yes, my amendment would affect Anheuser-Busch. My amendment \nwould affect Newmont Mining Co,, the biggest gold company in this \ncountry. Newmont Mining Co. controls 12,000 AUM's. Small mom and pop \noperation. Poor little old rancher out there struggling to survive. \nBiggest gold company in the United States.\n  Who else? Hewlett-Packard. Maybe you have one of their computers in \nyour home. Poor little old rancher Hewlett-Packard, we have got to \nprotect them. Hewlett-Packard runs cattle on only 100,000 acres of \npublic rangelands. They run cattle on those public rangelands because \nthose lands adjoin their ranch.\n  What are we doing here? It is sickening. Here is a man--one Senator \nrose in the Chamber yesterday and said he is a wonderful man, a very \nengaging person, a good citizen. I do not know him. I am sure people \nwho know him like him a lot--an 85-year-old billionaire, not a small \nmom and pop rancher, a billionaire, J.R. Simplot, from the State of \nIdaho. What does he have? Well, he is not all that big. He only has \n50,000 AUM's. Mom and pop rancher?\n  Here is a Japanese company. They control 6,000 AUM's on 40,000 acres. \nYou look at those. The list goes on and on. I have another list here. I \nam not going to bore you with all of them. The biggest corporations of \nthe United States of America mining the U.S. Treasury, and who can \nblame them as long as they know this body is not going to do anything \nabout it.\n  A Senator who is no longer here, a Republican Senator, whom I admired \nvery much, when I first took on the mining issue I walked over to him, \nand I said, ``I need a Republican colleague to cosponsor this bill if \nwe are going to change the mining laws of this country.'' I explained \nto him how the Department of the Interior actually issued deeds to \npeople for $2.50 an acre that had billions of dollars worth of gold \nunder it. I said, ``All you have to do is put up 4 stakes for every \nacre you want to claim. If you find gold underneath, it is yours for \n$2.50 an acre. How about joining me in this crusade?'' He said, ``I'd \nlike to, but I think I will go to Nevada and start staking claims.'' At \nleast he was honest about it. He was being facetious, of course,\n  All we are saying in our amendment is that Anheuser-Busch and \nHewlett-Packard and people like that are going to have to pay an \naverage of what you would pay if you were renting State lands. The \nStates cannot afford to give away the public domain like we do. They do \nnot own the public domain. They own some land. The State of Arkansas \nowns some of its lands. Your respective States own some of the lands \nthere, too. If those little mom and pop operators go to the State of \nMontana or the State of Wyoming and say, ``I would like to lease some \nof this land for $1.35,'' they would laugh them out of the State \ncapital building.\n  The Senator from Colorado just left the floor. You want a permit in \nColorado? Not for $1.35 per AUM but $6.50. They are not stupid. Do you \nknow what else? There is a line of people waiting for a permit in \nColorado.\n  Then look at Wyoming. Go into Cheyenne and say, ``I would like a \npermit on some State lands to graze some cattle.'' No. 1, they would \nsay, ``We are sorry; we do not have any land at the moment, but if we \ndid it would cost you $3.50 an AUM,'' not $1.35 like ``Uncle Sucker'' \ngets. And in Montana, the home of my distinguished good friend across \nthe floor, $4.05.\n  Our amendment says to that 9 percent, mostly America's biggest \ncorporations, we would rather you leave the land and make it available \nto small people to make a living, but if you insist on keeping it, we \nwant you to at least pay the weighted average for permits that the \nState lets in the State where your land is located. Who can quarrel \nabout that?\n  Mr. President, I will close by just simply saying two things. You \nknow who my amendment affects? Ten percent, 10 percent of the \npermittees, and they are the biggies. Only one State, Nevada, would \nhave more than 10 percent of its permittees covered by my amendment. I \ndid not know until I looked this over.\n  For the interest of my colleagues who may or may not be in the \nChamber but who I hope are listening, here is how your State would be \naffected: Arizona, 10 percent; California, 8 percent; Colorado, 5 \npercent; Idaho, 7 percent; Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, 2 \npercent; Nevada, 39 percent; New Mexico, 10 percent; Oregon, \nWashington, 8 percent; Utah, 10 percent; Wyoming, 9 percent.\n  Is it any wonder people think campaign contributions play a role in \nwhat happens around here? There is no justification for allowing this \nto happen. Since 1981, the grazing fee for cattle grazing on private \nlands has gone from $7.88 to $11.20 per AUM. The fee on State lands has \nincreased from $3.22 to $5.58, and Federal grazing fees in real dollars \nhave gone from $2.31 to $1.61, to this year's $1.35.\n  I say to my colleagues, I would like to appeal not only to your sense \nof fairness but to your sense of compassion. At a time when 100 \nSenators committed to a balanced budget and we are cutting education, \nwe are cutting environmental funds and housing funds and school lunches \nand Medicaid and Medicare, and everything that is necessary to give \npeople at least a fighting chance at a piece of the action, a piece of \nthe rock, we allow things like this to go on. It is unconscionable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute, and I want to \nyield to my colleague from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I guess I am sorry the Senator has \nsuggested anyone who does not agree with him is a victim of \ncontributions. I think that is not a very appropriate remark.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, I want to apologize for that remark. I am \nsorry. There is a certain personal thing in that, and I regret it. I \nregret I said it. I am sorry.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, there are a couple of things I think are \nimportant here. One is the predication of this idea. This amendment is \nbased on the idea that there is a subsidy here.\n  Yesterday I reported on the Pepperdine University study, an unbiased \nstudy that indicates very clearly this is not a subsidy. If you come \nfrom this area, where we have 8 inches of rain instead of 40, you will \nfind that this is not a subsidy and Pepperdine University says that \nMontana ranchers--this was in Montana--who rely on Federal lands do not \nhave a competitive advantage over those who do not.\n  Second, it seems to me we enter here into a great deal of class \nwarfare which I think is unnecessary. Yesterday, the Rock Springs \nGrazing Association was mentioned as one of these corporate robbers. \nLet me tell you what the Rock Springs Grazing Association is. It was \nstarted in 1909 in southwestern Wyoming to stop overgrazing which was \ntaking place in the Red Desert, which, by the way, is the largest \ngrazing district in the whole BLM in this country. The association \nbreaks down roughly this way: 550,000 deeded acres are in here. This is \nwhat is called the checkerboard; 450,000 are leased from private and \n900,000 are Federal permits in the checkerboard. They are all \nintermixed. There is no fencing. You cannot use one from the other. \nThere are 11,000 there.\n  What is the association? It is 64 shareholders, 64 family ranchers, \nthat is who it is. It is not a corporation. It is 64 family ranchers \nthat use that.\n  So I think, really, when we take a look at this thing, as I said \nyesterday, this is a unique circumstance. It is very easy to come from \nsomewhere else and say, ``This is the way it is at home.'' Well, this \nis not home. This is a unique aspect where your State is 80 percent \nowned by the Federal Government. We do have some feeling about it. It \nis our economic future.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. Let us \njust talk about it from an environmental standpoint.\n  Basically, what the amendment of my friends from Arkansas and Vermont \ndoes, or the amendments do, is throws us right back into this old class \nwarfare again, the ``haves'' and the ``have-nots.'' Nobody is asking \nfor that kind of situation.\n  There is no doubt in my mind, my friend from Arkansas is a dedicated \nand a wild environmentalist. Every figure that we can give you is \nbacked up by facts, that there is more wildlife on public lands now \nthan ever in the history of this country. When you take off grazing \nmanagement--we cannot tell the antelope not to graze the same time the \ncattle do, or the deer, or the elk. They all have the same forage. They \nall get along on the same range. That is why we have more of them now.\n  But when the management of that resource goes away, do you know what \ngoes away? Water. And, folks, nothing living goes out there in that \ncountry without water. Strictly from an environmental standpoint, pull \nall the cattle off, get all the people out of there, and watch that \nrange turn into the way it was at the turn of the century, with nothing \non it--no life, no water. Wind erosion is rampant. That is what we get \ninto.\n\n  If these amendments prevail, the impact it has on cooperative--as my \nfriend from Wyoming said. These things sound big, but they are a bunch \nof little folks who throw together enough to run their cattle and their \nsheep. Rock Springs, WY is a perfect example.\n  Another thing, we have two cooperative agreements, in Fleece Creek \nand Wall Creek. This is where environmental groups, U.S. Fish and \nWildlife, Montana Fish and Wildlife, the Stock Growers, BLM, and the \nForest Service, all got together and made out a grazing pattern and \ndeveloped a plan, to where they can graze and where they cannot graze \non what part of the year.\n  Do you know what? It is working. It is working on the ground. It is \nworking because local groups got together and solved a problem, instead \nof going down this road of throwing everything back into the courts \nagain, into an adversarial environment in which we have to do business, \nbecause it cracks up communities both within and from without.\n  I know there are folks around here, in the sound of my voice, who say \nas soon as some outsider comes into our town and tries to make a \ndecision for us, what happens? Polarization.\n  Montana has three fees. There are different fees for different \nFederal lands, State lands--but, you know, there is a lot of difference \nin the lands, the carrying capacity, what they will produce, where they \nare, access. There is a multitude of factors that go into it before you \nset a rental. Private lands are pretty accessible. You have somebody \ngoing up those gravel roads every day. Some of these Federal lands you \ncannot even get to unless you are on horseback, and that is another \ncost that has to go into the grazing fees.\n  So there is the difference. If I take an acre out of Arkansas, maybe \nI want to give the same price for an acre in southeast Arkansas as I do \nfor an acre in northwest Arkansas. Are they the same? Will they produce \nthe same, just because it is designated a State land? I do not think \nso.\n  The same is true out where we live, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. So, from an environmental standpoint, this is an \nantienvironmental vote if you take everything into consideration, and I \nask for its defeat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Arkansas has \nyielded me time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields to the Senator from \nVermont?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield such time as he may wish to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is not the first time we have had \nthese issues raised. I have been here, now--this is my 8th year. I do \nnot know how many times we have had this issue raised.\n  I remember when I first raised these issues in the early 1990's, I \nlearned a lot about what the situation was in the West. In fact, I even \ntraveled out to Wyoming and met with ranchers and saw the land and \nexamined the situation. At that time there were assurances from those \nwho were out there saying, ``Yes, we know we have to raise the grazing \nfees. We know that they are too low. We know that it is not fair, \nrelative to those who graze on private lands and State lands.''\n  What has happened since that time? Have the rates gone up? Have they \nmade an effort to try to remove the inequities between these beef \nproducers and other beef producers who are grazing on State lands and \nprivate lands? No. The fee has gone down, whereas, the private land \nfees have gone up. The State land fees have gone up; the fees on the \nFederal lands have gone down.\n  I also just point out for those who wonder what happened between the \ntime I offered this amendment yesterday and now--I want to thank \nSenator Bumpers and Senator Domenici for incorporating my second-degree \namendment into the original Bumpers amendment--it is that yesterday I \nhad second-degreed the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. They \nagreed that my concept of trying to help the small farmers out was a \nvalid one and ought to be adopted. So that was done. So you have now \nthe Bumpers-Jeffords amendment.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Does the Senator recognize that under this bill the rate \ngoes up 40 percent, under the bill as Senator Domenici presents it?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That may be. But in the interim it has gone down, so \nyou have not gotten to ground zero yet.\n  Mr. THOMAS. This bill brings it up 40 percent.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. But 40 percent of what, though? That is the problem.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Higher than yours.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. But a lot lower than it should have been relative to \nwhat it has been, is my point. In fact, mine is low, if you consider \nthat my amendment is to help the small farmers out. So in the sense \nthat you want to help out the small farmer, as I do, then perhaps you \nwould want to vote for this amendment so that you can improve that \naspect of the amendment.\n  I do not have a problem with that, because that is not my problem. My \nproblem is with giving a huge subsidy, which would happen without my \namendment, to the corporate entities and the large owners that are \ngoing to get a huge benefit without any need or any rationale for it.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has gone through, and I went through \nyesterday, the people that are going to be benefited by this. \nYesterday, you heard on the floor a great deal about the merits and \ndetractions of the underlying bill. Whether or not we agree on the \nmerits of the bill, I think the majority of this body can agree on the \nmerits of this amendment, which is now included in the amendment you \nwill be voting on, that is, the Bumpers amendment.\n  My amendment is very simple. It protects 90 percent of the ranchers. \nSo, I do not understand why anyone can disagree with it. Small \nranchers, who embody the history of the West, are going to get a \nbenefit better than the underlying bill. But it also rectifies an \nongoing injustice relative to the large users of the AUM's.\n  For 9 percent of the ranchers, the large, wealthy corporate ranchers \nthat consume over 60 percent of the total AUM's--over 60 percent of the \ntotal AUM's--who forage on public land, this amendment will simply have \nthem pay the same price--the same price--that they would pay if it were \nState lands, that the rancher using the rangeland next to them are \ncurrently paying to the States. Now, how in the world can that be \ninequitable, wrong or inappropriate to say that those on Federal lands \nwho are huge corporate owners should not pay the same as they are \npaying on the State lands?\n\n  Organizations who have been calling for sound spending in the \nbalanced budget, such as the Cato Institute--that is a conservative \norganization--believe it is time to change the fee structure. I was \ntold several years ago,\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\n``Yeah, we're going to change the fee structure.'' The Cato Institute \nhas been promoting grazing fee reform for years, highlighting the need \nto adjust needs to reflect their true value so you would not have that \ninequity between those that are grazing on State lands and those that \nare grazing on private lands and the rest of the beef farmers of this \ncountry.\n  I spoke to this issue yesterday, as did my colleague from Arkansas, \nquite thoroughly, I might add. I want to reiterate that this amendment \nnot only makes good budget sense, but it makes good common sense. There \nis no reason why a large rancher on Federal land should be paying up to \nfive times less to use what is basically the same land that his \nneighbor is grazing just because he is sending his check to Washington \ninstead of to the State capital.\n  The point has been made that there are a lot of wild animals grazing \non this. There are a lot of wild animals grazing on the State lands and \na lot of wild animals grazing on the private lands. So there is no \ninequity to be rationalized out by giving a lower fee on the Federal \nlands.\n  But there are other benefits of this amendment I want to discuss \ntoday. Farmer protection, land stewardship, and local input.\n  First, as I mentioned, this bill protects the small rancher by \nkeeping the grazing fee he or she pays low. We are all aware of the \nplummeting beef prices and the economic hardships facing these \nranchers. I firmly believe that we have a responsibility for the \nsuccess of small ranchers. But I tell you, my dairy producers, they do \nnot get a higher milk price when the price of grain goes up. No way. \nBut they are trying to say now, when the price of the beef goes down, \nthey should allow the price of the rangeland to go down. That does not \nhappen to those on State lands or private lands.\n  Not only by keeping their fee low for the small farmers, but by \nraising additional revenue that we could return to the local \ngovernments--this money would go back to the local governments for \nrange improvements, most of it--by increasing the fee to the large \nranchers, additional revenue will come into the Range Betterment Fund, \na program that has helped countless ranchers.\n  Second, by addressing the large ranchers, this amendment will begin \nto reduce the significant proportion of the environmental degradation \ntaking place on the public lands. Studies have shown that it is the \nlarge ranchers who are causing ecological degradation of the public \nlands. So the ones we are giving the most benefit to are the ones that \nare causing the most damage.\n  Currently, the low Federal grazing fee encourages overstocking on \nFederal lands, which has been shown to be detrimental to the \nenvironment and the grazing lands. A comparison of the size of herds on \nFederal lands versus the average size on private and State lands shows \nthat Federal lands bear a much higher number of large ranching \noperations than the other lands. Why? Of course; it is cheaper.\n  Third, this amendment brings the Federal grazing program closer to \nthe local level. In the past years, on numerous issues, we have heard \nfrom State and local government that they want greater participation in \nthe decisionmaking. This amendment accommodates this request by saying \nthe fee will be at the State level. My amendment will make the system \nmore equitable and make it more responsive to local ranchers.\n\n  Yesterday, Senator Domenici discussed how one program cannot fit all \nranchers. But by leaving the fee schedule as it is in the Domenici \nbill, we are making one size fit all. This amendment will put more \nflexibility into the fee system. Large ranchers will be paying what \ntheir neighbors on State lands are paying, not what everyone else in \nthe West is paying. As land costs and transportation costs, fee costs \nand beef prices in the State change, all things will be taken into \nconsideration, and the State fee will change, and the Federal fee for \nlarge ranchers will also change.\n  Again, in summary, let me emphasize how this amendment not only makes \ngood balanced budget sense, but also good environmental and economic \nsense. Although this amendment is fairly simple in its concept, it \nbuilds upon many of the themes in Senator Domenici's bill. It protects \nthe small rancher and promotes good land stewardship, and it brings the \nFederal grazing program closer to the local level. It is time we face \nthis issue. We have been talking about it for years and years and years \nwith promises of review and promises of change and promises otherwise. \nWhat has happened? Nothing has happened. The fee is going down again.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in my comments here on the floor, I will \nsimply make two points: First, this has been described repeatedly as \nhaving something to do with balancing the budget. We are being told how \nmany millions--by implication, billions--of dollars of corporate \nwelfare are going to the huge ranchers because of the Domenici bill. I \nwould like to put that in context, Mr. President.\n  If the revenue projections of the Secretary's proposed raise in \ngrazing fees are met, which I do not believe they will be, we will \ngenerate in increased revenue less money than it took us to put the \nsubway in between the Capitol and the Hart Building. We are not talking \nabout enough money to make any difference whatsoever in terms of the \nbalanced budget circumstance. I repeat, Mr. President, it cost us more \nto renovate the subway cars running between the Capitol and the Hart \nBuilding than the administration will generate in increased fees if \ntheir projections are correct.\n  I do not believe their projections are correct for this very reason. \nThat is a tiny amount of money as far as the Federal Government is \nconcerned. The amount of increased grazing fees is an enormous amount \nof money for those families who are living, literally, on the edge \nright now. They will be unable to pay the increased amount called for \nby the Secretary, so they will go out of business. We will not only not \nget the increases the Secretary is projecting, we will not get any \nmoney at all.\n  I believe the Federal revenues will go down rather than up if the \nDomenici position is not maintained. I believe that we will see \nsignificant financial damage throughout all parts of the rural West. \nThat is my first point.\n  My second point, Mr. President, is illustrated with this photograph. \nSome of you may have seen the pictures that were in full-page ads in \nthe New York Times and the Washington Post and other national \npublications in which this part of the land was shown in a photograph. \nThe question was asked, whose public lands are they? The implication \nwas that we were getting degradation on the lands. I have heard that \nagain here--degradation on the lands.\n  Well, I call your attention to the lower photograph. Maybe it is \ndifficult to see across the Senate. It is very clear that the riparian \nareas in this part of rural Utah are substantially better off in the \nlower photograph, the more recent photograph, than they were in the \nfirst paragraph. What is the difference? The first photograph was taken \nbefore grazing was allowed in the area, before the cattle were allowed \nto get into the area, break up the hard crust of the land with their \nhooves, allow water to get below the ground surface, allow seeds that \nwere in the air to take root and fertilize the ground with their urine \nand defecation. We see here lush, lush growth in the riparian area. We \nsee a better environmental circumstance than we saw before the cattle \nwere there.\n  I wish every Member of this body could have been here last night when \nthe senior Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] had a series of \nphotographs showing 100 years' difference in the State of Wyoming. In \nevery case, the environment was substantially better 100 years later \nbecause cattle had been in it.\n  This is an environmental vote, Mr. President, and the proper \nenvironmental vote is to vote with Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership shown by my colleague, \nSenator Domenici in bringing this legislation to the floor. I am \npleased to join with many of my colleagues in support of this revised \nand significantly improved legislation.\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\n  Grazing of livestock on western Federal lands has been increasingly \nand unfairly referred to as a subsidized form of welfare. Yet, the \nwestern livestock industry is key to preserving the social, economic, \nand cultural base of rural communities in the West. This lifestyle \nhelped open the West to productive development and responsible \nstewardship. Grazing is a healthy way to sustain and utilize renewable \nresources.\n  We are all familiar with the administration's highly controversial \nregulations, and the significant impact on the way grazing on public \nlands are to be managed. I believe these regulations pose a serious \nthreat to the stability of the industry.\n  The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management and the \nAgriculture Departments U.S. Forest Service manage 268 million acres, \nor 37 percent of the 720 million acres of public and private rangelands \nin the West. The State of Utah is 69 percent controlled by the Federal \nGovernment. We have 22 million acres of BLM lands and an additional 8 \nmillion acres of Forest Service lands. Detractors of grazing speak of \ncontinued rangeland degradation, yet the professional range managers \nfor these agencies have admitted that Federal rangelands are in the \nbest condition they have been in this century. Great strides have been \nmade in improving the range lands through the use of partnerships and \npromotion of good stewardship. Furthermore, through shared stewardship \nwith the livestock industry and the general public, populations of \nwildlife are increasing and stabilizing, and water quality on Federal \nlands has improved significantly. I believe that S. 1459 will eliminate \nthe controversy caused by the administration's grazing regulations and \nhelp mitigate the firestorm they caused in the West.\n  I am as concerned about the public's right to be part of the planning \nand decisionmaking process as I am about the bureaucratic quagmire \ncaused by frivolous appeals and protests. Our legislation provides for \nfull public participation in the planning process, allows for protest \nby affected interests and encourages public involvement through the \nResource Advisory Committees and the NEPA process. The general public \nhas the opportunity to comment on actions and site specific NEPA \ndocuments, by attending scoping meetings, hearings, and by responding \nto requests for comments by the agencies.\n  Since the BLM and U.S. Forest Service offer service to the same list \nof customers, often from the same building. This legislation would cut \nbureaucratic redtape and simplify the management of livestock grazing \nby simply managing all Federal land grazing by the same rules, \nregardless of jurisdiction. This makes it convenient for the permittee \nand/or lessee and greatly reduces conflict while reducing the costs of \nFederal land management.\n  Grazing is only one of the many uses that occur on Federal lands. \nThis legislation supports and strengthens the concepts of multiple use \nmanagement, which is basic to the management strategies of both \nagencies. The privileges of all Americans to access and use these lands \nis protected. The investments made by the livestock operator in range \nimprovements, which have significantly helped wildlife, are protected. \nOur legislation seeks to eliminate the on-going clash over water \nbetween State and Federal levels by simply recognizing each State's \nright to allocate and manage water in their jurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation provides a vehicle for our \nprofessional Federal land managers to join with livestock men and women \nin managing our Federal rangelands. We can do this while protecting the \nrights and privileges of all Americans, enhancing wildlife and riparian \nvalues and maintaining the viability of the livestock industry in the \nWest. Grazing on Federal lands is economically and socially important \nin my State and in the West. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nlegislation in the hope that common sense can once again prevail in \nFederal land management decisions.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a summary printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Summary\n\n       State Land grazing fees can be higher because the states \n     are generally not shackled by the regulatory burden carried \n     by Federal Land management agencies.\n       In some western states, because of the checkerboard effect, \n     state lands are managed by federal land managers by default.\n\n                SIZE OF RANGELAND PERMITS, BLM NATIONALLY               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Number    Percent   Number of   Percent\n                                   of     of total     AUM's    of total\n                                 permits   permits  (millions)    AUM's \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n500 AUM's....................     1,900        10        6.2         46\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Very few of the ``large'' ranchers (over 2000 aums in \n     Bumpers amendment) are owned by major corporations such as \n     Turner Broadcasting or Prudential. However, many of the \n     family ranches in this category are incorporated for tax \n     purposes, thereby meeting the definition of ``corporate \n     ranches.''\n       The majority of these ranches (over 2000 aums) are family \n     owned corporations and most make 100% of their income from \n     federal land grazing.\n       Because their sole source of income is from federal lands \n     and tend to be heavy indebted, they are probably the most \n     susceptible to even moderate increases in fees.\n       These ranchers tend to be the best stewards of BLM lands \n     because they live on the land, not in Los Angeles.\n       These ranches tend to invest heavily in federal land \n     multiple use range improvements and generally have the lowest \n     management costs to the federal land managers.\n       Bottom line: If they fail, there could be significant \n     ecological changes on federal lands, major range improvements \n     will not occur and costs to the federal government could \n     increase due to the higher cost associated with management of \n     numerous small permits.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Montana a moment ago discussed a \nlarge grazing association, individual ranchers, and he said that they \nwould be considered somebody who had more than 2,000 AUM's.\n  Senator, our bill specifically--specifically--takes care of that. \nYour association in Montana would be judged according to the AUM's of \neach individual member, not the association.\n  No. 2, my good friend from Utah, and I have utmost respect for him, \nbegan his statement by saying that we talk about this amendment \nproducing millions and billions in balancing the budget. I have said \ntime and time again the amount of money in this would not wet a \nwhistle. If my amendment passed, it might accidentally produce up to \n$13 million a year.\n  But, Senator, I have also said the issue here is not money except in \nthe context of fairness. It is not fair for us to have a law on the \nbooks under the guise of helping small ranchers make a living out West, \nand allowing the biggest corporations in America to slurp up that land \nand deprive the very people you say you want to defend from grazing \npermits.\n  That is the ultimate fairness we are talking about. That is all that \nmy amendment does. My amendment affects less--repeat, less--than 10 \npercent of the 22,000 permittees in this country. Who are they? Need I \nrepeat it? The biggest corporations in America, slurping up the lands \nthat ought to be used by your small ranchers who need the land, who \ncould make a living on it.\n  Class warfare? Somebody used that term a moment ago. How foolish can \nyou get? We are not talking about class warfare. We are talking about a \nbasic, elemental fairness. Some day these issues are going to catch on \nwith the American public. Right now, the American public does not have \na clue about grazing fees.\n  I might say they are beginning to hone in on these mining claims. \nThat is getting to be a topic across the country. It has only taken 7 \nyears to raise the voters' awareness slightly on that issue. Not one \nsingle State except Nevada will suffer a raise in rates for more than \n10 percent of the permittees in that State. Montana and the Dakotas all \ncombined, only 2 percent of their permittees.\n  I hope that the Senators from Montana and from the Dakotas certainly \nwould vote for my amendment because they would never know it passed out \nthere.\n  Let me just say, Senator Jeffords and I may not prevail, but it will \nbe sort of like my fights with Betty Bumpers. Those I win are just not \nover. I plead with my colleagues to think very seriously about whether \nyou want to go home, and on those rare occasions when somebody says, \n``Senator, how did you vote on the grazing fee bill,'' you will have a \ngood answer. If\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nyou vote against this amendment, you are going to have some tall \nexplaining to do. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me tell the Senator from Arkansas how I am going \nto vote. I am going to vote against the Senator from Arkansas and his \namendment and the amendment that he has modified. In doing that, I will \nvote for fairness and equity and balance in the sale of a publicly held \nresource, the public grass of the public land States of this Nation.\n  What the Senator from Arkansas did not tell you is that he has never \nasked for a two-tiered rise in the sale of the trees of the Ozark's St. \nFrancis forest. The reason is because he thinks it is fair that the \nlargest timber companies in the world and the smallest man with a \nsawmill in his backyard ought to pay the same price for trees.\n  The only thing the Senator from Arkansas has done, and I agree with \nhim, is say the small mill operator ought to be given some advantage \nthrough small business set-asides. I think we have agreed with that \nover the years. But the tree he buys or that Boise Cascade buys is sold \non the market at the same price.\n  Now, when it comes to selling the grass of the public lands, that \ngrass should be sold in a fair way. Those who are buying it ought to be \nable to purchase it in a fair way. Should we ask that a blade of grass \nbought by a small rancher be less in value than one bought by a large \nrancher? No. I think when the Energy and Natural Resources Committee of \nthis Senate--who took it as their responsibility this year to revise \ngrazing law, grazing policy, and we did. I say to the Senator from \nArkansas, we heard you. We heard the American people that public land \ngrazing policy ought to be adjusted and changed.\n  We introduced a bill earlier this year. It was not as pleasing to \nsome as it ought to be. The Senator from New Mexico and I pulled that \nbill back, along with our colleague from Wyoming and other Western \nStates, reviewed it, and reached out to a variety of public interest \ngroups.\n  They made 27 different recommendations, and we pooled those \nrecommendations together. The legislation you have before you today \ndoes a variety of things, but one thing it does is it raises grazing \nfees. It puts in place a new formula. It brings about a fairness and \nequity that every permittee that is a rancher, large or small, who has \ngrazing on public lands, agrees with, and that is that the fees ought \nto go up. But what I do not believe in--and I do not think the Senator \nfrom Arkansas wants to do it--is to establish class warfare in the \nselling of public resources for the public good.\n  We do not say to rich people who go to the U.S. parks, ``Oh, I am \nsorry, you are a millionaire, so you have to pay $2 more to use the \ncampground.'' Maybe we should. Maybe the Senator from Arkansas ought to \npropose that. What about the backpacker that pays the fee to enter a \nwilderness area? Should they pay more if their portfolio says they are \na multimillion dollar person? I think not.\n  We in this country have always spoken to fairness, equity, and \nreasonable values. But what the Senator has offered is not fair, not \nequitable, and, in my opinion, it is class warfare. It makes great \nheadlines in the newspapers.\n  So if it is none of those things, what is it? Why is the Senator \nasking for this kind of dramatic change from the policy that the \ncommittee he serves on has crafted? I do not think it is anything to do \nabout money, and he has admitted that. Whether you charge the big \nmultimillion-dollar ranchers much, much more for the going market rate \nof grass than you would the smaller--the Senator from Utah said it \nwould not even pay for the subway the Senate purchased a year ago. And \nif it would not, then what is the issue? The issue is power and \ncontrol, to get a few more folks off the land so we can have a \ndifferent image or a different idea as to how the lands ought to be \nmanaged. That is what we are really talking about here.\n  I sincerely believe--coming from a public land State, where ranching \nis an important part of our economy--that it is good public policy to \nhave a sound grazing policy in our country that says that grass ought \nto be grazed in a reasonable fashion, that it is a resource of our \ncountry that ought to be utilized for the development and the growth of \nred protein, for the consumption of our country and for the health of \nour citizens. We have always held that value in this country. What we \nhave done over time is change the way the lands are managed, and that \nis fair. We should not be managing the grazing lands of the West the \nway they were managed in 1935, and we are not. The public is telling us \ntoday that they ought to be managed differently in 1996 than they were \nin 1995. Our legislation does that.\n  So we accept change. We should accept change. But I plead with the \nSenator from Arkansas to accept fairness and equity. Public resources, \nwhether it is the campground, whether it is the trail, whether it is \nthe log, minerals, or grass, what we are talking about here is that it \nshould be managed responsibly, and it should be marketed in a fair and \nequitable fashion.\n  We have never in this country engaged in class warfare, nor should we \nnow, whether it is the sale of public grass, the sale of the public \ntree, or the public resources. I plead with my colleagues in the Senate \nto vote down the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, raising the grazing fees under the \nBumpers amendment is fundamentally unfair to ranchers. This proposal \ndoes not fully consider the investments that ranchers already have made \nin building their lots.\n  In addition, the profit margins for many ranchers is small, and many \nranchers already have fallen into bankruptcy. Raising the fees as this \namendment proposes to do will make things even more difficult for \nranchers and may force more ranchers to exit the business during the \nnext few years.\n  Mr. President, a look at the increasing losses suffered by ranchers \npaints a bleak picture. In the business of ranching, analysts consider \nthe industry average for the ``estimated calf break-even'' prices in \ntracking trends.\n  In the industry, we refer to the ``calf break-even price'' to mean \nthe cost of supporting a cow to produce a calf for a year divided by \nthe weight of the calf. There are many costs associated with supporting \ncows, such as summer pasture, winter feed, breeding costs, health \ncosts, veterinary visits, and medications. Producers in the northern \nregions, including my home State of Colorado, have even higher winter \nfeed costs and have to pay more out-of-pocket expenses for the winter.\n  In the fall of 1993, the estimated industry average calf break-even \nprice was $81.95 per 100 weight. The average profit was $42 per head.\n  Since then, however, the industry average shows increasing losses.\n  In 1994, the break-even price was $80.78 per 100 weight, but there \nwas a $12 per head loss.\n  In 1995, the break-even price was $80.41 per 100 weight, but the \nlosses increased to an average of $59 per head.\n  For 1996, industry analysts already are predicting another year of \nlosses which will be even to or greater than the losses incurred in \n1995.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point \nin the Record a table which shows the industry average for the \n``estimated calf break-even'' prices and the average losses sustained \nby the producers. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed a second \ntable in the Record which reflects the average sale price and profit or \nloss per hundred weight.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                TABLE 1--COW/CALF PRODUCER PROFITABILITY                \n               [Industry average for costs versus returns]              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             Profit/loss\n                    Year                        Estimated    (per head) \n---------------------------------------------------\\1\\------------------\n1993........................................        $81.95       \\2\\ $42\n1994........................................         80.78        \\3\\ 12\n1995........................................         80.41        \\3\\ 59\n1996........................................

The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes, 25 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Jeffords, 2 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if you only listened to the facts right \nnow, you would come out with completely different conclusions than you \nwould from the positions people have been taking here. Let us remind \nourselves, as far as this class warfare argument, just yesterday all of \nmy friends voted in favor of the product liability bill, which has \nquite a different situation for small and big business. Why? Because \nsmall business obviously gets a greater hit, with a smaller amount of \nmoney. Well, the measure we are dealing with now will have a fee lower \nfor the small farmers, the small users. All your small farmers--the \nonly ones you are going to benefit, or the only ones my friends arguing \nso strongly against me are going to benefit, are the large corporate \nguys, the ones that do not need any help, the ones getting a benefit \nfar above what the present price is for State lands, which we would \ncharge them for private lands.\n  So why in the world do my colleagues, who want to give all their \nsmaller farmers a lower rate, want to vote against the amendment that \nwould do that, when it only charges the wealthy and huge corporate \nranchers the same as they pay on State lands? It does not make any \nsense at all. I do not understand it. It is just because we are so used \nto taking positions on one side or the other, and you cannot recognize \nwhen we are doing something to benefit you. It is purely to establish a \nsystem of equity and sense in the fee system.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote for the Bumpers-Jeffords amendment. \nI yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 3 minutes, 30 \nseconds. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho raised a question \nabout timber. I do not understand the relevance of it. We do set aside \ntimber for small business people. Even so, timber is sold on a \ncompetitive basis.\n  If you want to start leasing 270 million acres of public rangelands \nfor grazing on a competitive basis, I may or may not vote for that, but \nwe do not do that. Do you know how you get a permit? You have to own \nland. Hewlett-Packard may own 400 acres of land, which they have to do \nin order to be eligible for a permit. If they have a 400-acre ranch \nthat they own themselves, they can run cattle on 100,000 acres of \nFederal land.\n  I am telling you something else. You could not pry these permits from \npermittees with a wedge. They literally hand these permits down from \ngeneration to generation. Under the current regulations, the term of a \npermit is 12 years. The Senator from New Mexico, his bill originally \nconsidered 15 years--is it 15 or 12 now?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe it is 12.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Twelve years is a long time. You cannot compare timber \nsales, which are let competitively, to a permit which you give some \ncorporation like Anheuser-Busch or Hewlett-Packard, simply because they \nown a few hundred acres in their own right, give them 50,000 to 100,000 \nacres to raise cattle on for $1.35 a month per cow.\n  Everybody here knows what this is--corporate welfare, pure and \nsimple, just like the Market Promotion Program where we give McDonald's \nmoney to advertise the Big Mac in Moscow. That is more of the same. \nHere we are trying to make just a small dent and say that these big \ncorporations who own 60 percent of this 270 million acres pay at least \nwhat the State would charge you if you were renting lands from the \nState.\n  Why is it that the Government only receives $1.35, and that is way \nunder what any State in the Nation charges for the same thing? It is \npolitics. It is corporate welfare. And it is grossly unfair. I plead \nwith my colleagues to come in here and search their consciences about \nwhether this is right or wrong.\n  Should we allow this practice to continue? As I say, these things are \nso patently unfair. They never go away, Senators. They never go away. \nLet us address it now. If my amendment is not perfect, we will go to \nconference and make it perfect.\n  My fee is actually less than the fee of the Senator from New Mexico \nin the year 2005. We are not talking about what we are charging the \nsmall ranchers; we are talking about what Hewlett-Packard, Newmont \nMining, Anheuser-Busch, and the biggest corporations in America ought \nto pay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if I could get 1 additional minute. Does \nSenator Bumpers object?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Not at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to give two reasons why you \nshould vote against Senator Bumpers' amendment. First of all, let me \nsuggest that if this were an issue of politics, if this were an issue \nof how many people are ranchers and cowboys in the State of New Mexico \nversus those that are not, the politics would be to vote for the \nBumpers amendment and put all the small ranchers in New Mexico out of \nbusiness because there are not very many of them. This argument about \nthe big corporate users--I am not here trying to protect them. They \nwill protect themselves. I am here to protect the small guy.\n  Let me tell you, in Arizona, New Mexico, parts of California, and in \nother States, this amendment that is pending will say to ranchers with \n176 animal units who use it year long, ``You are a big rancher, and you \npay up to $10 in some States, and you are out of business.'' That is \nwhat this amendment will do. For another huge portion of them, 354 head \nwill qualify as being large under that amendment that we are debating. \nThey are not big ranchers. They will go broke under this formula.\n  And last, my second point, Senator Bingaman, who has been working on \nthis for a long time, has a bill, and what do you think his fee \nschedule is? His fee schedule is exactly the same as that in the \nDomenici bill. I think he has looked at it. He does not agree with \neverything that we are for, but he does agree that the fee schedule \nthat is being sought by Senator Bumpers is outrageously high for many, \nmany ranchers in the United States. And if you want them to quit, fold \nup their tents and go home, vote for the amendment that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas has before us.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be granted 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, Karl Hess, Jr., a senior fellow at the \nCato Institute--that is not exactly the citadel of liberalism down \nhere--says:\n\n       Domenici's bill is bad for ranchers, bad for public lands, \n     and bad for the American taxpayer. It will not improve \n     management of public lands and it will not be a fix for the \n     hard economic times now faced by ranchers. What it will do, \n     however, is deepen the fiscal crisis of the public land \n     grazing program by plunging it into an ever-deepening \n     deficit. If western ranchers insist on supporting this bill \n     and the additional costs associated with it, they should be \n     prepared to pay the price.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the Bumpers amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Mexico to lay\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\non the table the amendment, as modified, of the Senator from Arkansas. \nOn this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I also ask unanimous consent that Philip Kosmacki, who \nis a fellow in Senator Wellstone's office, be granted the privilege of \nthe floor for the remainder of the debate and voting on S. 1459.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman is to be recognized for \nan amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I say, from the Republican side, there are no \ntime limitations on this amendment. I do not believe we want to speak a \nlong time on it. There are a lot of Senators who would like to get some \nvotes behind them here today. I am going to do everything I can to \naccommodate, without jeopardizing Senator Bingaman and those who \nsupport him having their opportunities to speak on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3559 To Amendment No. 3555\n\n (Purpose: An amendment in the nature of a substitute to the Domenici \n substitute to S. 1459, the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1995)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] for himself, Mr. \n     Dorgan, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Daschle, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3559 to amendment No. 3555.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is a substitute amendment I am \noffering on behalf of myself, Senator Dorgan, Senator Reid, Senator \nBryan, and Senator Daschle. I know there will be at least three other \nSenators who wish to speak in favor of this substitute.\n  Mr. President, there are some basic differences between the bill as \nproposed, Senate bill 1459, and the substitute that I have just sent to \nthe desk and which we are going to vote on here at some point. Senate \nbill 1459 deals with BLM land and Forest Service land.\n  Let me just say generally what I believe it does in regard to each of \nthose. On BLM land, it repeals all the existing regulations the \nDepartment of the Interior has in place with regard to grazing on BLM \nland. It would also put in statutory form a significant amount of the \npolicy that has previously been handled by regulation in the Department \nof the Interior with regard to BLM land, grazing on BLM land.\n  Then it states that with regard to any subject that is not covered by \nthis new statute, Senate bill 1459, it would reinstate the old \nregulations which were developed during James Watts' administration in \nthe early 1980's and which have been in place since that time. So that \nis what it does on BLM land.\n  On Forest Service land, it changes the statutory law that the Forest \nService has operated under for grazing in our national forests for at \nleast 60 years. It changes it in a way that, in my view at least, \nencourages more use of the national forest for grazing rather than less \nuse of the national forest for grazing. That is the underlying bill, \nSenate bill 1459.\n  The substitute I and my colleagues have offered here has a very \ndifferent purpose. Its purpose is to identify the portions of the new \nBLM regulations that have raised legitimate concerns among people who \nare affected by them, and it proposes that we legislate new statutory \npolicy in those areas. The goal of the amendment is to ensure that the \npublic maintains adequate input into the process of policymaking on our \npublic lands, ensure that land managers have adequate authority to \nmaintain the health of our public lands and, of course, maintain the \nuse of our public lands for all of our citizens.\n  The substitute that I want to address here works to accomplish these \ngoals. I believe it will provide real stability for permittees and \nlessees as well. In some detail, I would like to describe, first, what \nthe substitute does and then some of the things that it clearly does \nnot do.\n  First of all, what the substitute does. I have a chart here, Mr. \nPresident, that tries to identify the key policy changes contained in \nthis substitute and the issues we have tried to address. As I said \nbefore, what we have tried to do is listen to the concerns of people \nwho are permittees and lessees, listen to the concerns of others who \nhave need to use the land or desire to use the public land, and put in \nstatute those things we believe need to be statutorily provided for \nbecause they are not adequately covered by existing regulations.\n  We otherwise leave in place the existing regulations on the BLM land, \nand, of course, we do not apply most of this bill--all but three \nprovisions of this bill do not apply to the Forest Service. We allow \nthe Forest Service to continue to administer the lands under the \nexisting law that they have in place.\n  The first thing we have changed is that we provided that ``interested \npublics,'' as described in the existing regulations of the Department \nof the Interior, are replaced by a definition of ``affected \ninterests.'' Now, what does this mean?\n  One of the complaints we heard from ranchers about these new \nDepartment of the Interior regulations was that those regulations \nexpanded the group of people who were entitled to be consulted or \nnotified about grazing decisions. The old regulations provided that, in \norder to be notified, you had to be a so-called affected interest, as \ndetermined by the Bureau of Land Management.\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\n  Under the new regulations, anyone who is part of the interested \npublic--that is the phrase that is used in the new regulations; the \n``interested public''--anyone who is part of the interested public has \na right to be notified.\n  In our view, this was a legitimate concern by ranchers. They did not \nbelieve that anybody who just had an interest should be given equal \nstanding to be notified. What we have done in this substitute is return \nto the old language in the old regulation instead of the broader \ndefinition of an ``interested public.'' We believe that that is an \nappropriate change in the law that responds to a legitimate concern \nthat was raised and brought to our attention.\n  The second item here is regarding NEPA, the National Environmental \nPolicy Act. A concern was raised, again by permittees and lessees, that \nthe application of NEPA had become so pervasive by the land management \nagencies that many of the actions and decisions which the permittees \nand, in fact, the agencies considered to be fairly routine and not \nposing any threat to the environment, they were being required to go \nthrough long procedures under NEPA, and it was slowing down the process \nof getting a response from the agencies.\n  Let me point out that this is not something you can blame on \nSecretary Babbitt. There is a lot of criticism of Secretary Babbitt \nfrom many corners here in this debate. But he cannot be blamed for \nthis. Neither can Dan Glickman, our Secretary of Agriculture. This \nrequirement that applies NEPA to all of these different activities \napplied before those two individuals ever came into office. It is not \nthe result of regulations that have been adopted; it is the result of \nthe law that we in the Congress passed.\n  The question is, how do we deal with the problem? Senate bill 1459 \ntries to deal with the problem of NEPA application to all of these \nroutine activities by essentially saying that NEPA only applies in the \npreparation of a land use plan and saying that, after that, any action \nor decision related to grazing is not covered by NEPA and therefore \nNEPA does not have to be complied with with regard to those other \nitems.\n  In our view, that exemption is too broad. We propose a much more \nlimited exception for NEPA. We say that renewal and transfer of grazing \npermits, and only the renewal and transfer of grazing permits or \nleases, can be done without complying with NEPA; that that can only \nhappen where it is determined by the Secretary that the renewal or \ntransfer will not involve significant changes in management practice or \nuse and that significant environmental damage is not occurring or \nimminent. But where he can determine there is no significant change in \nmanagement practice or use and no significant damage is imminent, then \nclearly he can go ahead and renew a lease or transfer a lease or a \npermit without complying with NEPA.\n\n  We have done one other thing, Mr. President, with regard to NEPA. \nThat is, we have included in the substitute a provision that directs \nboth the head of the BLM and the head of the Forest Service to prepare \na list of NEPA so-called categorical exclusions for nonsignificant \ngrazing activities. The effect of having categorical exclusions for \nnonsignificant grazing activities will be to expedite the process. This \nis not a new loophole or a change in NEPA; it is a clear congressional \ndirection that they should, under NEPA as it now exists, go ahead and \nuse these categorical exclusions.\n  In our view, this is a much more limited and targeted way to deal \nwith the problem of routine concerns that are not involving significant \ndamage to the environment. It addresses the specific problem. It does \nnot blow a major hole in the application of NEPA to everything that \nrelates to grazing except that at the land-use-plan level.\n  The next item I want to mention is that in our substitute we \nreinstate grazing advisory boards. Again, Mr. President, this is a \nchange in the existing regulations. The new regulations that were \nadopted this last year eliminated grazing advisory boards. They became, \nessentially, defunct. They had not been appointed, and the Secretary \ndid not reestablish those in the new regulations. We have done what I \nbelieve the underlying bill does, and that is to provide for the \nreestablishment of these grazing advisory boards.\n  In my view, it is appropriate to do so because they would provide a \nsignificant forum that ranchers, permittees, and lessees could use to \nhave input. Half of the membership is to be made up of permittees and \nlessees, and half to be made up of other local individuals chosen by \nthe Secretary.\n  Another change that we have adopted in this substitute, another \nprovision, is that we do adopt the grazing fee formula that is in S. \n1459, but we have put in a stabilizing provision. We have put in a \nminimum fee of $1.50 per animal unit month. This would involve some \nslight increase from $1.35, which is what the formula now results in, \nto $1.50 per month. Then the fee would go ahead and be whatever fee was \nhigher than that, if the new fee that Senator Domenici devised would \ncall for that.\n  Quite frankly, I do not know if that is the exact right level of the \nfee. I do not think that the main issue here is how much money can be \nobtained from people for use of this land. I think that is a very \nsecondary issue. The main issue here is what laws do we put in place to \npreserve the health of the rangeland.\n  The next provision deals with indirect control. The indirect control \nprovision is removed from the affiliate provisions. This is a fairly \narcane item. The concern here is that looking at renewals, permittees \nwere being held accountable for actions of people who were not under \ntheir control. That was the concern that was brought to us.\n  To the extent that problem exists, we have corrected it in our \nsubstitute. The new regulations that are in place can look at actions \nof persons under the indirect control of the permittee. Our substitute \nbill makes it clear that the BLM could only consider the actions of the \npermittee and persons under that permittee's direct control in deciding \nwhether or not to renew that lease or that permit. That is a very small \nitem that was called to our attention and seemed legitimate.\n  The next item is the surcharge exemption. In cases where subleasing \nis occurring, the new regulations provide an exemption from any \nsurcharge only for sons and daughters of the permittee or the lessee. \nWe heard the complaint from permittees and lessees that that was too \nnarrow a provision, that there should be an exemption from surcharges \nfor other immediate family members, as well. So we have put a provision \nin saying that the surcharge exemption should be expanded to include a \nspouse, a child, or a grandchild. Again, we have proposed a specific \nsolution to a specific concern that was drawn to our attention or \nbrought to our attention.\n  The next item on our list is for fallback standards and guidelines. \nThe substitute that we are proposing does not require any minimum \nnational standard or guideline. Instead, the Secretary, in consultation \nwith the resource advisory councils, the grazing advisory boards, \nappropriate State and local government and educational institutions, \nand after providing an opportunity for public participation, \nwill establish statewide or regional standards and guidelines. We \nbelieve that is more acceptable to many of the people involved. That \nseemed like a reasonable resolution of that problem from our \nperspective.\n\n  The final item I have is the resource advisory councils and the \ngrazing advisory boards are to be involved in developing criteria and \nstandards for conservation use and temporary nonuse. Our substitute \nexpressly provides for conservation use. That is a major difference \nbetween our bill and the underlying bill.\n  The resource advisory councils and grazing advisory boards should be \nconsulted when the Secretary develops criteria and standards. \nConservation use can be conducted if the agency approves the use, \nbecause it is necessary to promote rangeland resource protection, and \nthe use is consistent with the land use plan. A permittee under our \nproposal does not need to be engaged in the livestock business to \npractice conservation use.\n  When I spoke yesterday about the underlying bill and read the letter \nfrom the Nature Conservancy where they expressed their concern about \nthis in the underlying bill, the substitute makes it clear that they do \nnot need to pass a test, a threshold test, of being in the livestock \nbusiness in order to attain a permit and engage in conservation use.\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\n  Now, what we have done is to leave the decision to the land \nmanagement agency as to whether or not to permit or to allow a permit \nto be transferred to a person who wants to use it for a conservation \nuse. In my view, that discretion is appropriate. It is important this \nissue is resolved both for the permittees and the lessees who reside in \nour States.\n  The underlying bill authorizes coordinated resource management \nagreements which could be, presumably, used for conservation purposes. \nIt appears that under the underlying bill, a rancher could agree to \nenter into a conservation agreement with other groups, but those \ngroups--groups such as the Nature Conservancy--cannot by themselves \nhold a permit and enter into a conservation use. We try to correct that \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, this is a fairly good description or a fairly complete \ndescription of what is in our bill and a summary of the problems that \nwere brought to our attention as a result of the new regulations of the \nDepartment of the Interior. We did solicit concerns from permittees and \nlessees and others who had problems. With the exception of these \nprovisions, we do allow those regulations to remain in place.\n  We had several speeches on the floor yesterday about how both the \nDepartment of the Interior through BLM and the Department of \nAgriculture through the Forest Service were, in the view of some, \ntrying to run the ranchers off the land; they were trying to end this \nway of life that the cowboy has had historically in the West. I have \nheard those speeches, Mr. President. I have heard them now for several \nyears. I just need to say for all my colleagues to hear that I do not \nthink that reflects the reality that I see in my home State.\n\n  I do not dispute that there have been instances where one or both of \nthose agencies have overstepped, or where permittees and lessees have \nbeen unfairly treated, but I also do not dispute that there are some \nprovisions in the existing regulations of the Department of Interior \nthat should be changed. We have tried to change those in this proposed \nsubstitute.\n  I want all of my colleagues to know that what we are trying to do in \nthe substitute is to correct specific problems that have been pointed \nout to us. We are not trying to create new problems. It is a very \ndifficult balance that is required between those who graze on the land \nand those who want to use the land for other purposes. I believe the \nagencies themselves have been trying to find that balance, sometimes \nineffectively, but they have been trying to.\n  I believe Senate bill 1459 will bring imbalance to this relationship. \nFor that reason, I do not support it. I think our substitute is \npreferable. I will briefly recite the concerns I have with S. 1459 \nlater in the debate, Mr. President.\n  I see I have a colleague here from North Dakota anxious to speak. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Mexico, \n[Senator Bingaman]. I want to follow his statement with some \nobservations of my own about the substitute that he offers with myself \nand others today on this issue.\n  I view this issue not only from a national perspective, but also, \nespecially, from the perspective of western North Dakota. That is where \nI was raised, where I grew up. It includes the grasslands and badlands \nand a lot of wonderful territory. I have, when I was younger, ridden a \nhorse with my father through most of the badlands and much of western \nNorth Dakota. I have spent a lot of time on horseback, riding across \nthose wonderful tracts of land. I do not have any interest, in any way, \nin injuring the scenic value, in interrupting the multiple use, or in \npreventing the American public, who owns much of this land in western \nNorth Dakota, from having full access to and full use of the land.\n  But I also know from having been there, especially when I was younger \nwith my father, and since then as a public official, I have been there \nvisiting ranches and going to meetings with ranchers and others. I also \nknow there are a lot of people who live out in western North Dakota, \nwho make their living out on a family ranch, who invest a little money, \nmaybe raise some cattle, do not quite know what the price will be when \nthey get to the point where they are going to sell cattle. They have an \nenormous risk. They rent some land to graze on. They pay a grazing fee \nto the Federal Government and run some cattle on that land. Most of \nthem have an interest in treating that land well. They understand that \nstewardship. Most of them are environmentalists, in my judgment. Most \nof them care about wildlife and care about the shape that land is in.\n  I thought it would be interesting to read for my colleagues a letter \nfrom Merle Jost, from Grassy Butte, ND, because there is a lot of \nhyperbole about these issues. People stand up and wave their arms and \ntalk about the Bingaman substitute, the Domenici bill, or this or that, \nor the other approach will destroy wildlife, destroy hunting, destroy \nthe scenic beauty. I have heard all of these things. I have some \nfeelings about what we ought to do and ought not to do today. But I \nwant to say to you that on behalf of a lot of people out in my part of \nthe country, who are trying to make a living and do a good job and be \ngood stewards of the land, they also care about the same things that \nmany of us care about in here, that stand up and talk about wildlife. \nHere is a letter from Merle Jost:\n\n       As I write this letter, the deer are sneaking into the bird \n     feeder--guess I'll have to put out more sunflower seeds.\n       There goes another bunch--after the pheasant food--more of \n     that. There goes a flock of sharptales--to dine on my oat \n     bales.\n       The antelope are in the alfalfa field again. Oh, well, \n     spring coming; they will soon scatter. My neighbor to the \n     north is feeding 200 turkeys these days. He deserves a \n     medal-- turkeys are hell.\n       My neighbor to the east has 30 deer a night--eating ground \n     feed out of his augers.\n\n  I see a lot of press conferences screaming about ranchers wrecking \nthis and that or destroying this and that. He said, ``We support \nwildlife.'' He is right. Anybody that knows much about ranching could \nexist with the wildlife in western North Dakota. This is an issue for a \nlot of people, an issue for ranchers. It is an issue for people who \nalso want to use that public land for hiking, for hunting, for a whole \nrange of issues. That land will be, and ought to be, open to multiple \nuses.\n\n  We are here because, especially in my part of the country, ranchers \nwho are involved in the use of that land for grazing purposes--that is \none of the uses--have had some difficulty with respect to the \nmanagement of that land. Let me give you an example. One permittee, the \nMcKenzie County Grazing Association, has been denied a permit for a \ndozen years to construct a crossfence along a pipeline corridor in this \nallotment. He was going to construct it at his expense. A dozen years, \nno permit. The Forest Service agrees that the fence would improve the \nrange conditions. But only now, after pressure from the association, \nare they going through the scoping process.\n  Another permittee is unable to construct a water pipeline into a \ncrested wheat-grass area, which the Forest Service also agrees would \nresult in better range conditions. Why? Because, after 3\\1/2\\ years, \nthe Forest Service has not been able to do a biological survey. It is \nnot that somebody says it is not a good idea. It is a good idea and \nought to be done. But the landlord is not able to do the survey, does \nnot have the money, does not, apparently, have the will, or is not \ninterested in the speed to do a survey. So 3\\1/2\\ years later, \nsomething that probably ought to be done, and will be done at the \nexpense of the rancher on public lands, is not even started. Ranchers \nsay, ``Wait a second, why can we not get answers and have better \nstewardship on the part of the managers of this land?'' It is a \nreasonable request.\n  When those of us who evaluate these things look over these kinds of \ncomplaints--I have concluded that we ought to respond to them. There \nought to be a better management scheme and management system on these \npublic lands so that in those areas where we have grazing use, those \nwho are grazing these lands, if they need to have a water pipe come in, \nor have a water tank moved, or construct a fence someplace, you ought \nnot have to wait 18 months or 12 years for answers about that. That is \nwhat this is about. It is not about anything more than that.\n  I have seen editorials in the last couple of days that talk about \nthis is a land grab, and that this is giving public property to the \nranchers, this is turning the keys over to the ranchers, it is\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\ntrying to disrupt multiple use, and it means turning our back on \nwildlife. That is not the case.\n  Now, we have before us a couple of choices today. One is the \nBingaman-Dorgan substitute, which we now offer on the floor of the \nSenate. The other is the underlying Domenici bill. Let me say this \nabout the Domenici bill. It has changed some, and I think along the way \nit has been improved some. I think it could be and should be improved \nmore. But the fact is, it has moved. This has been a process over a \nseries of months where there have been a series of changes. The \nBingaman substitute, which we offer, I think, is a better solution. \nThey are, in fact, almost identical with respect to title II. The \nsubstantial differences in the substitute are in title I. Let me go \nthrough a couple of points with respect to the substitute and why I \nthink it is a better approach.\n  First of all, it is a better way to construct law. It is a shorter \npiece of legislation. The Domenici bill started with the proposition \nthey were going to--I said in the committee that the Domenici bill is \nreally a letter to Secretary Babbitt. There is a better way to write to \nhim than to write 95 pages of codifications of regulations. I do not \nthink you ought to codify regulations in law. I respect the fact that \nthere are some problems with the Babbitt regulations. What Senator \nBingaman and I are trying to do is determine, with the ranchers and \nothers, what are the problems, and then address the solutions to the \nproblem. That is the best way to legislate. That is what the substitute \ndoes.\n\n  We, I think, come to a better conclusion and a more appropriate \nconclusion on the issue of public participation. These are, and will \nbe, multiple-use lands. Hunters have a right to these lands; hikers \nhave a right to these lands; and a myriad of other users have a right \nto these properties, and that will remain the circumstances under the \nlegislation we have proposed. They will remain in a situation where \nthey will have access to these decisions, and they will be consulted as \naffected interests on the major decisions, and the significant \ndecisions about the use of these lands.\n  We also recognize that we are addressing some language in this \nlegislation to respond to real problems ranchers face. We do this, as \nSenator Bingaman said appropriately, in a manner designed to solve \nproblems, not create new problems. I think that our approach is an \napproach that addresses legitimately the problems that ranchers have \ndescribed to us--and they are real problems--but doing it in a way that \ndoes not cause additional problems and does not diminish the \nopportunities of other multiple users to use this property.\n\n  One of the issues that we were at odds about, which was never \nresolved in a whole series of negotiations we had, was the issue of \nconservation use. I firmly believe that conservation use ought to be \navailable. If an organization such as The Nature Conservancy wants to \nhave a permit on 500 acres in North Dakota for its own reasons and has \ndecided it does not want to graze cattle on that, I think that ought to \nbe allowed. It is explicitly prohibited in the underlying Domenici \nsubstitute. That is one of the areas we were simply never able to \nresolve.\n  Would I want there to be a circumstance where someone came in and \nsaid they were going to take all of that grassland in western North \nDakota and make it conservation use and graze nothing on it? No, I \nwould not want that. The fact is that too much of western North Dakota \nis already becoming a wilderness area without a designation because too \nmany people are leaving. We need more people coming to our part of the \ncountry. My home county, which is in western North Dakota, has lost 20 \npercent of its population in the last 15 years.\n  So, would I think it is appropriate for us to have a circumstance \nwhere an organization comes in and tries to buy it all up and says, \n``By the way, we bought it for the purpose of deciding not to graze \nit''? No; I would not support that. But do I, on the other hand, \nbelieve that we ought to expressly prohibit someone from taking a small \ntract of land for the purpose of trying to nurture some specific kind \nof wildlife and then say to them that they cannot get a permit and \ndecide not to graze that? I do not think that is appropriate either. We \nhave had circumstances, even in our State, where it has been to the \nbenefit of all of the surrounding ranchers that a conservation use on a \nsmall acreage has helped all of the other surrounding ranchers who are \ngrazing other acreage, with respect to wildlife production.\n  So I think the expressed prohibition in the Domenici bill is \ninadvisable.\n  In the substitute that Senator Bingaman and I have offered, in title \nII, we incorporate a portion of title I which deals with a conditional \nNEPA exemption for permit renewal and transfers. We think that makes \nsense. We think what you ought to do is invoke NEPA when you have \nsignificant actions. We think that when you have insignificant actions, \nsuch as a permit transfer renewal, which is not a significant action \nand which would not affect the condition or circumstances of that land, \nwe think that NEPA should not be traded.\n  So those are the kinds of things that we have included in this \nsubstitute. I have mentioned three of them. But there are about 10 that \nmake this substitute a much more advisable piece of legislation for \nthis Senate to enact.\n  I feel very strongly that the kinds of things we have done in this \nsubstitute are the kinds of initiatives that are designed to address \nthe problems that have been brought to us by ranchers, but to address \nthe problems in a way that does not cause other problems or does not \nrestrict in any unfair way others who want access to and have every \nright to have access to this property.\n  Let me conclude, without going through all of the details of the \nsubstitute because I think Senator Bingaman has done an excellent job \nof that, by ending where I began.\n\n  I would not come to the floor of the Senate supporting any initiative \nunder any condition if I felt it was an attempt by anybody to grab land \nfor one specific interest in western North Dakota. These lands are \nowned by the public. The public has a right for multiple use of these \nproperties. That right shall remain. But I also understand, having \ngrown up there, that this land has been populated for many, many years \nby a lot of families out there struggling to make a living raising \ncattle. One use of this land has been grazing, and the circumstances \nunder which this land has been managed have in some cases been \nacceptable but in other cases been deficient. Both of us, Senator \nBingaman and I, as well as Senator Domenici, are offering initiatives \ntoday to say we would like to address those problems. We address them \nin different ways. I think ours is preferable to Senator Domenici's. I \nsay that, at the end of the day, I hope the Senate will have spoken in \na way that says these are real problems, here is a solution that is \nappropriate and is a satisfactory solution that solves the problems \nwithout creating additional problems.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask Senator Bingaman if he has any idea of how \nmany more speakers he might have?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response, I know that Senator Daschle \nwanted to speak for a very short period, and I know that Senator Reid \nasked to be allowed to speak for up to 45 minutes. Senator Reid had a \nmeeting at 3, and he will get here as quickly as he can. We just sent \nword to see if Senator Daschle is able to speak now.\n  Those are the only two that I am aware of that want to speak. There \nmay be others.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did the Senator indicate that Senator Daschle would \nlike to speak now?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I indicated that we are trying to check to see when he \nwants to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We do not need very much time at this point.\n  Does the Senator from Idaho want to speak to the water issue? Could \nhe take a short amount of time in his succinct way to address this \nimportant issue?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator, Senator \nCraig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I will be succinct. But I do think that we have a \ngreat concern\n\n[[Page S2604]]\n\nabout Senator Bingaman's substitute and how he deals with water. It is \nvery clear in our legislation that the States have primacy in all water \nissues and that the Federal Government must comply with State water \nlaw. We know that Congress after Congress has affirmed this very \nposition. In the Democrat substitute that Senator Bingaman has offered, \nit declares that new water rights shall be acquired, perfected, \nmaintained, and administered in connection with all livestock grazing \nin accordance with State law.\n  The key word here is ``new'' water rights. The Democrat substitute \nmakes no provision against the extortion of water rights as a condition \nto grant a grazing permit or leased range improvements, cooperative \nagreements, or range improvement permits as provided in the Republican \nsubstitute, nor does the Democrat substitute require that the Secretary \nfollow State law with regard to water rights ownership and \nappropriation as provided in the Republican substitute. Both \nsubstitutes protect valid existing water rights, but the operative word \nhere is ``new.'' Let me repeat, ``new'' water rights.\n\n  What about all water rights? What about existing water rights? Does \nanyone seriously believe that this Secretary of the Interior, who I \nthink helped write this legislation, is not concerned about water and \ntrying to grab back as much water as he can off the lands where valid \nand existing water rights have already existed?\n  In the 1995 appropriation act, the Secretary of the Interior tried \ndirectly to assert Federal ownership and control over all water rights \non Federal lands. This time he plans to do it indirectly through this \nkind of legislation by talking about dealing only with new water rights \nand leaving it up to his solicitor to interpret the language of \nexcluding all existing water rights.\n  Mr. President, this is a concern that I hope, if my interpretation of \nit is wrong, the Senator from New Mexico, the junior Senator, will \ncorrect. We know where Secretary Babbitt is. He is very clear, and he \nhas even sidestepped NEPA and the ESA to stage a media event with his \nfriends and special interests in the Grand Canyon with an artificial \nflood event that could jeopardize important ruins, threaten endangered \nspecies, and jeopardize blue ribbon trout fisheries.\n  I say this in all sincerity. I hope that the junior Senator from New \nMexico could clarify for me because it is very important that we stay \nwithin State law on this water issue; that we stay with ``existing and \nnew water rights.'' I believe his legislation speaks only to ``new,'' \nand that must be clarified. I hope he can do that.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just respond to the questions \nbecause I think what has been raised is a classic red herring. In the \nWest, many more people have been killed for water than for infidelity \nto their spouse, and I think this is obviously a hot button issue. We \nhave provided as explicitly and as clearly as we can understand the \nEnglish language that valid existing water rights are protected. We say \non page 11, line 14, ``Valid Existing Water Rights.'' That is the title \nof the sentence, or the section. It says, ``Nothing in this title shall \nbe construed as affecting valid existing water rights.'' Period.\n  I do not know how to make it any clearer than that.\n  In the previous sentence, we say, ``No Federal reserved water \nrights.'' We say, ``Nothing in this title shall be construed as \ncreating an express or implied reservation of water rights in the \nUnited States.''\n  So we have covered the exact concern that the Senator from Idaho is \nraising.\n  In the previous sentence we say:\n\n       New water rights shall be acquired, perfected, maintained, \n     or administered in connection with livestock grazing on \n     public lands in accordance with State law.\n\n  That is appropriate. Clearly that is what we intended the law to be. \nAnd we have covered valid existing rights in section (c) of that same \nsection. I do not understand what the issue can be. If there is a more \nplain-English way to say that valid existing water rights are not \naffected than to say ``nothing in this title shall be construed as \naffecting valid existing water rights,'' I would like to hear it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator had said ``all'' water rights, I would \nagree with him. The Senator did not. His amendment explicitly singles \nout ``new'' water rights. It is very important that we have that \nunderstood for the record, and it is important, I think, if we are to \nprotect these State rights and individual rights, that language comply \nwith the bill of the senior Senator from New Mexico because it clearly \nsets out that whole issue.\n  Is there a reason for a singling out of ``new'' versus the \ninterpretation of, and excluding all existing rights?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, what I said before was that we have the \nsection, section 112, broken down into three subsections. The first \nsection deals with new water rights. The second section deals with \nFederal reserved water rights. The third section deals with existing \nwater rights. So we have covered all three. I do not understand what \nthe problem is. We have covered existing water rights in section (c). \nWe have covered new water rights in section (a). We have covered \nFederal reserved water rights in section (b). What is the problem?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is this Senator's opinion that by selectively singling \nout ``new'' water rights, you leave open to opinion by a very \nunfriendly solicitor and by a very unfriendly State water rights \nSecretary this issue. I think the question must be closed or you place \nthose water rights in jeopardy.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Obviously, differences of opinion are what makes for \nhorse races, Mr. President, and the Senator from Idaho can believe what \nhe will about what the language provides. I can tell him that my intent \nwas and our intent was in drafting this language to make it crystal \nclear that with regard to existing water rights, with regard to new \nwater rights, with regard to Federal reserved water rights, we were not \nchanging the law. And that is what we say.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think the Senator has answered my question.\n  The Senator has argued an interpreted point of view. We can stumble \naround on interpretations when it comes to western water. The Senator \nand I must be in agreement with exactly what is said or the Solicitor \nof the Department of the Interior will jump squarely into that hole.\n  Now, I believe the language of the senior Senator from New Mexico is \nmuch clearer. It says, ``No water rights on Federal lands shall be \nacquired, perfected, owned, controlled, maintained, administered or \ntransferred in connection with livestock grazing permits other than in \naccordance with State law concerning the use and appropriation of water \nwithin the State.''\n\n  The Senator and I both know that water is critical in the West and \nwater is especially critical as it relates to the grazing on these arid \npublic lands, and who controls that water oftentimes controls the \ngrazing. We already know the position of this Interior Department on \nwater. They want it. They want to control it. In 1995, the Secretary \nwent directly at us on that. We must not allow this to be interpreted. \nI hope that the Senator could agree with the language that appears on \npage 19, section 124 under ``Water Rights of the Underlying Bill, S. \n1459.''\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Again, Mr. President, I think the Senator from Idaho is \npointing out a problem that does not exist. I think we have made it \nvery clear that with regard to existing water rights, with regard to \nnew water rights, with regard to Federal reserved water rights, there \nis nothing in this bill and there is nothing intended in this bill that \nis to change the law with regard to it. That is exactly what we have \nsaid. That is exactly what we mean.\n  There is no hole for the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior \nto jump into. There is no ambiguity here that needs an interpretation. \nNobody in the committee raised this issue. The Senator chairs the \nappropriate subcommittee. This was not raised. This language has \nremained unchanged through the markup. Nobody has raised this concern \nuntil right now on the Senate floor. I do not think it is a valid \nconcern. That is my response.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n\n[[Page S2605]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will yield another minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Mexico has the \nfloor unless he yields.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator, Senator \nCraig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I only say to the junior Senator from New Mexico that his \nlanguage was not at issue because it was not the document that makes it \nto the floor of the Senate coming out of the committee for the one area \nof the committee of jurisdiction that I was responsible for.\n  All I say is I believe there is a difference. I believe there is an \nopportunity to interpret. I think it ought to be closed, and the way \nthat can be closed is for the Senator to accept the language in section \n124 of the language of the senior Senator from New Mexico. If the \nSenator will do that, I then have no argument.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Wait a minute. The Senator will have no argument with \nthat provision.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for the clarification--with that \nprovision.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I respond that if we could pick up the \nSenator's vote for our substitute, we clearly would be willing to \nconsider that. But I should say that our language is, in my mind, very \nclear and clearer than the language in the underlying bill. So I \nsuggest that the Senator accept our language rather than we accept his.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Returning to my time, when you speak of no water rights, \nthat is all. That is inclusive. And when we speak specifically of no \naction, no water rights unless they are in accordance with State law, \nyou have broken it out and allowed interpretation. I know this \nsolicitor and I know this Secretary of Interior, and I know westerners \ndo not trust them. And this is one Senator who does not trust them \neither. I do not want to give them a chance to play interpretive games \nwith western water.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator from Wyoming desire a couple of \nminutes?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Just a couple of minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, in general terms, it seems to me that what \nwe have been doing in Congress for a year, year-and-a-half and continue \nto do is to try to find a way to cut through some of the kinds of \nregulations, maintain the effort without all of the difficulties, and \none of the places--and I have worked very closely with it--is NEPA. I \nthink we have to remember that NEPA was designed and developed as a \nprocess for major Federal action, major Federal action. That is \nprecisely what we have done in the Domenici bill, is to hold that to \nmajor Federal action.\n  Now, the problem that has happened in the past, particularly with the \nForest Service--we did it this year; we had to go through with some \nlegislation--was that it was uncertain, it was uncertain, so the \nlawyers over at Justice and over at the Department of Agriculture said \nto the Department, said to the Forest Service, ``Look, you have to do \nit. It doesn't say to in the law, but it is uncertain, and the \nSecretary may decide or may not decide.'' And that is how we ended up \nwith all the NEPA things on grazing allotments. We have been through \nthat the whole year long.\n  This substitute continues with that kind of uncertainty, and it says \nyou do not have to do it if the Secretary does this, if the Secretary \ndoes that. We will end up right back as the subject of lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, that is precisely what we are trying to avoid, and the \nsubstitute puts us right back in that field where in the other one we \nhave tried to make it clear that the NEPA requirement is there, the \nNEPA process is there for land use planning, the NEPA process is not \nthere for those rather mundane, daily decisions that are made on \ngrazing allotments and the kinds of things that in no stretch would \nconstitute major Federal action.\n\n  That is where we are. So I just think that the whole point of this \nthing is to try to do away with that ambiguity. And the fact is that \nthis substitute puts it right back there.\n  I do not understand what the sponsor was talking about on surcharge. \nThere are two opportunities within the Domenici bill for subleasing. \nOne, of course, is in the case of death or illness. The other is with a \ncooperative agreement, which we have had. You have to have an agreement \nwith the agency to have subleasing. We want to continue with that. It \nis a very important part of grazing in our part of the country and our \nbill does that. This one does not talk about subleasing. It simply \ntalks about surcharges.\n  So I think that moves away from what we are seeking to do. It is a \nmatter of conservation use. There is an opportunity for conservation \nuse. I think, though, if you are going to have a land use plan which \nrequires grazing, which is part of the community, and part of what \nupholds these communities is grazing, then to say maybe you do not need \nto have any grazing, that you dissociate base land--we went through our \nmap yesterday. There is a very real relationship between base land and \nwinter feed, for wildlife or livestock, and these leases. The idea that \nyou can come in from Cincinnati and have a lease, here, with none of \nthe other portions that go with it, is not realistic. That does not \nreveal much understanding of the way these lands are interdependent.\n  So I think the Domenici bill, in these cases, deals both with \nconservation nonuse--it allows that, with an agreement with the \nagency--it allows for subleasing, and it deals with the surcharge. But \nmost important of all, it clarifies this area of NEPA process.\n  Mr. President, I feel very strongly that the substitute simply \nweakens this process that we have been through for so long a time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator desire some additional time? I will be \npleased to yield 5 more minutes, because we are waiting for Senator \nReid. He will not be here for some time, so we are going to use up some \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I know we are talking here about the whole \nquestion of our bills. I do want to talk about how important it is that \nwe have passage of this bill and I am pleased that, in the process of \nthe discussion, it has been demonstrated that there is not a great deal \nof difference here. We have already talked about the fact that these \nfees do not amount to a great deal, in terms of money. But we are \ntalking here, now, about trying to establish a long-term economy in our \nStates. We are talking about stability in the area of grazing. We are \ntalking about moving some of the decisions more close to the States and \nto the users.\n  Of course this is public land. I understand that. That is why we are \nso careful and so clear in the Domenici bill, to say this is multiple \nuse. There can be no question about that. This question of dominant use \nis simply not a valid observation.\n  But we do need to begin to involve more closely, people who are in \nthe area. For instance, Secretary Babbitt came out to the West all last \nyear and the year before. We had these series of meetings. He talked to \nall these folks and, yet, came back with his proposal last year that \nwas exactly the same as it was when it began.\n  We need to involve, for instance, land-grant colleges in the \ndevelopment of the policy that is involved here. We need to involve \nState departments of agriculture. And we are there to do that. We need \nto make it a situation where communities can depend upon this economy. \nIt is one that is very important.\n  I think, most of all, what is not understood generally, and I know \nwhy--because it is unique to the West--is that these lands are \ninterdependent. These are low-production lands, for the most part, \nthese BLM lands. They do depend on winter feed. They depend on deeded \nland for winter feed. They depend on deeded land for water. Sometime \nearlier this afternoon someone\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\nwas saying you could have 400 acres of base land and lease 100,000 \nanimal units. That is not the case. You cannot do that. You have to \nhave someplace to take care of this livestock in the wintertime.\n  So we are looking for some balance here. I think we have worked at \nthis, now, for more than a year. We have made considerable \naccommodations. Both the Senators from New Mexico have worked at this, \nand I salute both of them.\n  We have some basic difference. One of them, I think, is bureaucracy. \nI think we are seeking to reduce bureaucracy. Frankly, I think the \nsubstitute increases bureaucracy. We do not need to deal with that. We \nneed to deal with NEPA. It is there, clearly there. I am the chairman \nof the subcommittee that is taking a look at the NEPA process and we \nneed to find ways to reduce some of that bureaucracy.\n\n  I met with the new supervisor of the Black Hills Forest 2 weeks ago. \nThey are in the midst of a forest plan. He has documents higher than \nhis desk, the things they have done.\n  The people on the ground are beginning to understand that we need to \nreduce that NEPA process. Not do away with the purpose, not do away \nwith input, not reduce the opportunity for people to participate, but \nnot to have that process in the minutia of the management of a grazing \nunit.\n  We also need to do something with the forest. I think the Domenici \nbill treats it very well. It says ``substantially the same.'' Our folks \nfeel very strongly about that. There is no real reason to have two \nunique opportunities here. We have not told them to be exactly the \nsame. We said you should be substantially the same.\n  So, I think we have made a great deal of progress here. Frankly, \nother than the water thing, the department does not want this because \nthey like what they have. But I can tell you they have not moved very \nfast on the implementation of their regulations. If we do not make some \nchanges now, a year from now, if they are still there, Babbitt is still \nthere, you will see a real rush to change. I believe that very \nstrongly. Now is our opportunity to soften some of those kinds of \nthings that we think are difficult and troublesome.\n  We have this opportunity. So I really feel very strongly about the \nefforts that we have made. We have accommodated the other side to a \ngreat extent. And now we have a few areas in which we have different \nviews. I think the one we just talked about in water is a different \nview. I happen to have the idea that States rights are very important \nin water. We have part of that in the agriculture bill that is going on \nright now. The water, when you live in a State where much of the water \ncomes from snow pack, and much of it on the forest, then you have to \nhave some real strong State rights in water. We make some progress, we \nmake some progress in that.\n  I certainly encourage my colleagues to support this bill. I think we \ncan pass it here in a very short while. I hope we do not accept the \nsubstitute and go back into this maze of NEPA regulations that are not \nnecessary to have the proper outcome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say to my good friend from \nWyoming, I kind of got myself carried away for a bit, because all the \nprevious debate was under a time limit. But we are not under one now. \nSo, nobody has to ask for time. They just have to get the floor.\n  As a parliamentary inquiry, am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to speak for a few minutes and I want to say to \nanyone on the other side who arrives, who wants to speak, in the \ninterests of an early evening I will try to cut it short when anyone \narrives who wants to speak.\n  First, I would like to say that an awful lot has been said across \nthis land about the National Environmental Policy Act as it applies to \ngrazing leases. We have heard across this land those who side with the \nenvironmentalists, or those who are at least joined together in an \neffort to minimize the use of the public domain by the grazing \ncommunity--we have heard talk about the National Environmental Policy \nAct as it applies to grazing as if it were the Bible for environmental \nprotection. I mean that in both contexts of the Bible--specific and \nancient. Neither is true.\n  The Bureau of Land Management, the entire Bureau of Land Management, \ndoes not use National Environmental Policy Act statements to control, \nmanage, or evaluate the public domain.\n  Let me repeat. They do not use them. Frankly, I commend them. Just \nbecause there is a request for a National Environmental Policy Act \nimplementation, or a NEPA statement, does not mean that it is the best, \nthat it is even the prescribed, that it is even close to being the \nappropriate way to evaluate the environmental impact and the overall \nmanagement, or land use as it pertains to managing a permit. The reason \nis because nobody had in mind when they drew up NEPA that we would even \nconsider applying NEPA to a grazing permit and its renewal.\n  I say that because I have read the early history, and I cannot find \nanything in it that refers to such. Mr. President, do you know what it \nsays? It says, if there is a major Federal action, then NEPA applies.\n  I cannot believe that with thousands upon thousands of grazing \npermits that anyone really believed that every time one of those was \ngoing to be renewed that it was a major Federal action. Again, the \nBureau of Land Management does not use them. Frankly, the reason was \nprecisely stated on the record at a hearing. No. 1, they are not very \ngood for this kind of evaluation. No. 2, they are very, very expensive, \nanywhere from $50,000 to $1 million. And No. 3, they are very, very \ntime consuming, anywhere from a quick turnaround of 6 months to a year \nand a half.\n  Frankly, accolades to the Bureau of Land Management for saying that \ndoes not even apply to grazing permits on the public domain lands.\n  How many times has it been written across this land by those who \noppose the Domenici bill that you are taking away environmental \nprotection because you are abolishing and abandoning NEPA? Let me \nrepeat, NEPA does not apply today to the issuance of Bureau of Land \nManagement grazing permits, and I have just told you why, because there \nis nothing magical about it being the only evaluating tool around to \ndetermine whether a 50,000-acre grazing permit in a State which might \nhave 20 million acres or 30 million acres--there is nobody saying that \nis a major Federal action.\n  Let us move over to the other part of the public lands, the Forest \nService. The best that can be said about NEPA and the Forest Service is \nthat there has been a gradual movement in this administration in the \nlast 3 years to use NEPA on public lands of the Forest Service where \ngrazing is involved. It was used sparingly for the very reasons I just \nstated. But there are those who want no grazing on the public domain. \nThey have had mottos to speak of how long cattle can be on the public \ndomain. ``Cattle free in '93'' was a cry not too many years ago. I am \nglad they have not won yet, but we have been moving in that direction.\n  That kind of entity will begin filing lawsuits against the Forest \nService, and sure enough, we will get some court someplace that will \ninterpret this to mean NEPA applies to even the renewal of a grazing \npermit, and then they will come and tell us that is the law.\n  The law is what Congress says is the law. We are asking Congress in \nthis bill to make sure the Bureau of Land Management's policy remains \nintact. We are also asking that with reference to the Forest Service \nand the Bureau of Land Management that there be one major use for NEPA, \nand it is big and it is important, and it is appropriate in its full \nimplementation.\n  NEPA will be applied to the Forest Service and the BLM when the land \nuse plan is developed for a national forest that is being reviewed for \nall of the various competing uses. A full environmental impact \nstatement will be obtained; all the citizens will be involved. As the \nplan is put together, there will be rights to go to court, to litigate. \nBut we contend in this bill, contrary to what my friend, Senator \nBingaman, provides, we provide that beyond that, you use other tools to \nevaluate, not\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\nNEPA. I do not think that is antienvironment.\n  Senator Bingaman chooses to say there may be other cases. It is left \nup to the discretion of the Secretary. Frankly, I do not want to do \nthat. This whole problem is before the Senate because of this Secretary \nof the Interior. That is why we are here, because Secretary Bruce \nBabbitt declared a war on the ranchers and decided that he would go all \none way. How am I going to sit here with the understanding that he \nmight be around for a while and give him the authority to determine \nwhen we are going to use environmental impact statements on the public \ndomain when we have a bill right here before us? This is the place to \ndecide it. We determine the law. I do not believe we should open that \napproach to the thousands of permits on the public domain. It is not \nthe right tool.\n\n  Because I am standing here saying that does not mean for one second \nthat I am for degrading the public domain. I am saying that a NEPA \nstatement can be used for long delays, for reasons never intended by \nthe act and, in particular, by those who would like to see ranching off \nthe public domain. I do not want to sit here and hide under a tent and \nsay that does not exist, because it does.\n  But I want to make one more point, one more time. The environmental \nimpact statement approach to assessment is not currently being used on \nthe BLM land day by day for issuances or renewals, and it is being used \nsparingly by the Forest Service. If there ever was a time when we had \nan opportunity to take a look at this, it is right now. Let us see how \nwe really ought to apply it and how it ought to be done.\n  Frankly, I am so tired of having people interpret the bill that I \nhave written and write reports and use this famous word ``may.'' ``It \nmay have an impact.'' They do not tell you it will. That last report by \nthe Congressional Research Service, if you read it, they have about six \nor eight mays--m-a-y. They do not say it will, they say it may.\n  I would like to say, as I read my friend and colleague's bill, I can \nfind a lot of ``mays'' that I am sure he did not intend. But if I sent \nit over to the Congressional Research Service and said, ``You look at \nit my way,'' they will say, ``Maybe it does the following and maybe it \ndoes the following.''\n  For instance, in our bill, we unequivocally state that nothing in \nthis legislation shall change the rights, privileges and all the other \nthings that you talk about for hunting and fishing. We put it in \nbecause we kept getting bombarded that we were trying to take away \nfishing rights and hunting rights. I might say that provision is not in \nthe bill you produced, the bill before the Senate. It may be that since \nthat provision is not in there, there may be a serious negative effect \nagainst trout fishing and hunting under the Bingaman substitute.\n  I hope everybody is listening carefully to what I am saying, because \nthat is the way the underlying bill we have before us has been treated \nmore times than not. I can go through and cite a number of others. The \nsubstitute before us does not iterate or reiterate that multiple use is \nthe order of the day, if I understand from the staff who have read it. \nIt does not say that.\n  Senator Bingaman would say, I am sure, it does not have to be in \nthere. I would say, like some of those who have reported on the \nDomenici-Craig bill, ``Well, since it isn't in there, it may be \nintended to have a negative impact on multiple use.''\n  I am not suggesting Senator Bingaman intended that. But neither do I \nbelieve others ought to insinuate that our bill does that when they \nhave some difference of opinion, or when they approach the \ninterpretation from a position that I do not have.\n  I do not intend to go through Senator Bingaman's bill in detail. But \nI want to say one more time--and perhaps a better way than yesterday; \nand it is good that the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island is in \nthe Chamber because I have talked to him about this issue for a number \nof times--let me say to the U.S. Senate, sometimes we come to the floor \nand talk politics and sometimes we exaggerate our position and \nsometimes we state or understate, depending upon how the debate \nproceeds, but this Senator, from the State of New Mexico, one of the \nmost beautiful States in America, this Senator who has seen more \nwilderness created in New Mexico under bills that I have introduced \nthan any in history, I do not intend to spoil the public domain nor to \nturn it over to one of the myriad of multiple users.\n  If I thought for a minute that the bill I have before the U.S. Senate \nwas calculated to make the public domain worse or to degrade it, or to \ntake away the power of the Forest Service managers and the BLM \nmanagers, I would tell everybody to vote against it today. I am not \nhere for that reason. I am here simply because I am convinced that \nmultiple use can be made to work. It is the law of the land. I think it \nshould continue to be. But I do not believe ranching can continue under \nthe regulations established by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt.\n  I believe if those stay in effect there will be no more ranching. For \nthose who would say, wait a minute, Senator, it has been in effect for \n6 months, well they are written such that none of the impact will occur \nfor a long time. If the Secretary has time to implement them, he will \nnot implement them until after the election. I do not say that very \noften. But I believe that from the very soul of myself that this \nSecretary made a mistake when he adopted the so-called ``Babbitt \nRangeland Reform '94 regulations.'' If I were a poet I would phrase \nsomething about that.\n  Anyway, we are going to do away with Secretary Bruce Babbitt's set of \nregulations and substitute some that we think will manage the range \nproperly, and do three very important things--stabilize the public \ndomain from the standpoint of the ranching community so that they are \nnot on a constant roller coaster depending upon the administration, \ndepending upon the regulator, depending upon who gets them into court \nunder some lawsuit.\n  We will try to stabilize it at a level and we will see, once and for \nall, can ranching as a way of life exist in the public domain in \nAmerica? This may be a debate about whether you want to have any more \ncowboys out in the West that are true, or whether you want them all to \ncome from Hollywood. This may be the debate. There will be plenty of it \nin Hollywood because it is a fantastic culture. The lifestyle is \ntremendous.\n  I did not come from that lifestyle. I did not know anything about it \nwhen I became a Senator. In fact, I was from a place where you could be \ncity folk in the State of New Mexico; that was Albuquerque. Anywhere \nelse, because the towns are all smaller, I probably would have been \nsomewhat associated with ranching. I was not, but I have been since \nthen.\n  I believe we ought to stabilize that environment without jeopardizing \nthe other multiple users. I think there is a chance of doing that. The \nonly thing that stands in the way is a vote here in the Senate and a \npen in the hand of the President of the United States. He will have the \nlast shot when we get this bill through here. I hope we can get this \naccomplished.\n  My third point is, that for those who insist that the ranching \ncommunity are abusers of the public domain, that the community is not a \nconservation community, for those who insist that they are the ones who \nwill ruin the range and the other people will preserve the range, that \nthey are the ones against wild animals and habitat, let me suggest they \nare the best conservationists around. Let me suggest, but for their \nactions, habitat would disappear in many areas of America. Not just a \nlittle bit, but in a manifold manner it would start disappearing.\n  Those who live and work on the land provide the water, they provide \nthe management, and yes, a few riparian areas have been overgrazed \nbecause of the water being short in other areas, but most ranchers take \nas good a care of the resources as they possibly can. So I am here \nbecause I have confidence that this system will work, but I do not have \none bit of confidence that multiple use will be preserved with \nequanimity and fairness for all to use if we leave the Babbitt \nregulations in place. It is just that simple.\n\n  I commend my friend, Senator Bingaman, my cohort from New Mexico, \nbecause to some extent he agrees. He does not come before the Senate \nsaying we want to leave every one of Secretary Bruce Babbitt's \nregulations in place. He has selectively decided\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\nsome of them must go. I believe our bill is fairer for the ranching \ncommunity and is more apt to add stability to the range and protect the \nother users.\n  So this may be the last word I have on this. I would not have spoken \nthis long if there were Members on the other side ready to speak. I see \nSenator Bryan is here. I yield the floor, and I thank the Senate for \nlistening.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New Mexico, for yielding the floor.\n  Mr. President, most of those who are privileged to represent the West \non both sides of the political divide recognize that we need to enact \nresponsible grazing legislation that balances the concerns of the \nlivestock industry with the concerns of the conservation community. It \nis in seeking that illusive goal of balance that we find ourselves \noperating from a slightly different approach.\n  In my view, notwithstanding the best efforts of the distinguished \nsenior Senator from New Mexico, his bill fails to achieve that balance \nand, in my view, would seriously threaten the multiple-use concept \nwhich has governed public land policy for decades. It is for that \nreason that I rise this afternoon to support the substitute amendment \noffered by the distinguished junior Senator from New Mexico, which I \nbelieve represents a preferred course of action. The Bingaman \nsubstitute is a thoughtful, balanced approach to correct what is wrong \nwith the current grazing regulations.\n  Let me just also note for the Record, Mr. President, that each summer \non the occasion of our recess I spend most of that recess traveling \nthroughout rural Nevada. Today Nevada, paradoxically, is the fastest \ngrowing State in the country, although 87 percent of the total land \narea is under Federal jurisdiction. It is also one of the most urban \nstates in the country, with most of the population located in the \nmetropolitan Las Vegas area, which today exceeds 1 million people, and \nin northern Nevada in the so-called Truckee Meadows, embracing Reno-\nSparks. One might logically say it extends to Carson City and Douglas \nCounty, that they are as well in a metropolitan area.\n  Although rural Nevada represents a small part of the population, I \nhave been concerned, since the time I first assumed statewide office in \n1979 as attorney general, with the concerns of those good people who \nchoose, as our colleague and friend, Senator Domenici, points out, a \nlifestyle which has been part of the heritage of the West and part of \nthe heritage of our State.\n  Their concerns are legitimate. They are good people. They work hard. \nThey want to protect a livelihood and a lifestyle which is terribly \nimportant to them. It is for that reason, Mr. President, for the last 6 \nmonths I have been a participant in a bipartisan group of western \nSenators and their staffs in an effort to reach a consensus on grazing \nlegislation.\n  Notwithstanding the hours of effort made on both sides of the \npolitical aisle, it is my view the negotiations failed because of the \napproach insisted upon by the distinguished senior Senator from New \nMexico, that is, his insistence on using S. 1459, his bill, as a \nbaseline for discussions. Because of that methodology or that approach, \nwhich sought to codify a series of old grazing regulations, \nsuperimposing a new series of regulations and statutory provisions as \nwell, it became very difficult to modify his bill, and ultimately we \nfailed to achieve a consensus in working out an issue which we all \nshare a legitimate interest in resolving.\n  I would note that some improvements were made to the Domenici bill, \nas a result of our discussions. But I have never been of the view that \nCongress should micromanage grazing policy to the extent that is \nprovided for in the Domenici bill. For example, the bill limits public \nparticipation in grazing decisions by listing seven arbitrary instances \nin which an ``affected interest''--those are words of art--occur and \nindividuals are entitled to be notified of a proposed grazing \ndecision. It denies the public the opportunity to protest a grazing \ndecision; it exempts on-the-ground grazing management decisions from \nthe National Environment Policy Act; and finally, it does not target \nspecific, troublesome regulations for repeal, rather, it contains a \nblanket repeal of all the current BLM grazing regulations.\n\n  What we are presenting here today in the Domenici bill in many \nrespects takes a step back from the policies originally established \nduring the Reagan administration under the tenure of Interior Secretary \nJames Watt. To put that in some context, the former Secretary has been \naccused of many things, but he has never been accused of being an \nenvironmentalist. I believe we ought to make the necessary changes to \nthe so-called rangeland reform proposals that have been offered under \nSecretary Babbitt.\n  Efforts to limit the public's right to be involved in grazing \ndecisions will not, in my opinion, bring stability to the ranching \nindustry, nor will it improve rangeland conditions. It will only lead \nto continued turmoil and lawsuits that are a drain on the resources of \nboth the ranching community and the Federal Government.\n  By way of contrast, the substitute amendment offered by Senator \nBingaman, which I am pleased to cosponsor, reflects a balanced approach \nthat, in my opinion, addresses the legitimate concerns of the ranching \nindustry. I repeat, again, I believe that there are many such \nlegitimate concerns.\n  It also addresses the equally valid concern and interests of the \nconservation community. It does not arbitrarily repeal the current \ngrazing regulations and replace them with an inflexible statutory \nscheme which, in my view, S. 1459 would create.\n  For example, in response to concerns raised by Nevada ranchers and \nothers, the Bingaman substitute waives the application of NEPA for \npermit renewals and transfers unless significant changes are made. It \ncontains expedited NEPA provisions where grazing activities would not \nhave a significant effect on the environment. I believe those are \npositive and instructive changes that meet some of the concerns raised \nby the Nevada ranchers. It also reinstates the grazing advisory boards \nand expands the surcharge exemption to include spouses and \ngrandchildren, or children which Nevada ranchers have raised.\n  On the other hand, however, in response to concerns expressed by \nconservation groups, those who enjoy the public land for outdoor \nrecreational use, whether hunting, fishing or hiking, these \norganizations, as well, have legitimate interests. I believe the \nBingaman substitute protects public involvement in grazing decisions \nand requires that other public land values, as important as grazing is, \nit is not the only important public land value that needs to be \nprotected, but wildlife is given equal consideration in the \ndecisionmaking process in the goal of achieving a balance, recognizing \nthat we want to be fair to Nevada ranchers, we want to make sure they \nare able to continue to use the public lands as they have for \ngenerations and to provide for themselves and their families.\n  We also need to recognize that the West has changed. The demand made \nupon public lands for outdoor recreational uses have grown \nexponentially over the years, as Nevada in my own lifetime has gone \nfrom a State whose population the year I started school in Las Vegas in \n1942 had slightly more than 100,000. We used to say, somewhat tongue-\nin-cheek but true, that every person, every man, woman, and child in \nNevada, could be comfortably seated in the Los Angeles coliseum in \n1942. Today, it is the fastest growing State in the Nation. Our \npopulation, small by contrast with some of our larger States, is 1.6 \nmillion. So the uses of public land, where we strike that balance, is \nvery important to this Senator in making sure that public recreational \nvalues are considered in the decisionmaking process, as well as grazing \ninterests.\n  In addition, the substitute offered by Senator Bingaman specifically \nauthorizes conservation use so that non- ranching entities can hold a \npermit and rest an allotment if the practice is not deemed inconsistent \nwith the land use. Conservation use, as a management practice, is \nparticularly important to us in southern Nevada. It is an integral part \nof the Clark County's Habitat Conservation Plan, a plan devised in \nresponse to the concerns advanced by\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\nmany about the federally listed endangered species, the desert \ntortoise. Without that habitat conservation plan, a moratorium might \nvery well have gone into effect with potentially catastrophic economic \nimpacts for those of us who make southern Nevada our home. That habitat \nconservation plan was a compromise achieved as a result of the ability \nto use conservation use as a management practice.\n\n  Another important provision of the Bingaman substitute concerns the \nuse of the portion of grazing fees that are returned to the States and \ndispensed to local grazing boards. The substitute provides that these \nfunds may only be used for on-the-ground range improvements and for the \nsupport of local public schools in the counties in which the fees were \ngenerated. Currently, those fees are subject, in my opinion, to an \nabuse, an unconscionable abuse, in that these moneys are currently \nbeing used to finance lobbying activities and litigation.\n  Nye County, NV, has used more than $40,000 of these funds to finance \na legal battle against the BLM, where they have asserted a claim of \nownership over all of BLM publicly administered land in Nye County. \nThis is indefensible. I acknowledge that my friends and neighbors in \nNye County have every right to avail themselves of the Federal court \nsystem to make these claims, but they do not, in my view, have the \nright to rely on federal grazing fees returned to local grazing boards \nto fight these causes. Those ought to be confined to on-the-ground \nimprovements for public schools in the county in which the fees are \ngenerated.\n  The Bingaman substitute, in my view, strikes an appropriate balance \nby reinstating the grazing boards but prohibiting this outrageous \nbehavior and improper use of these funds.\n  As I began, I mentioned over the year I have had a chance to visit \nextensively with Nevada's ranchers and to hear their legitimate \nconcerns about the new grazing regulations, concerns that I feel should \nbe, but are not, addressed by the legislation before us today. The \nranchers I have met with are honest, hard-working people who asked \nCongress, in essence, to set ground rules for grazing on public lands \nthat will bring a sense of stability to the ranching community. If \nstability is of paramount concern to the ranching community, it is my \nview that S. 1459 is not the answer.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me conclude by reminding my colleagues \nthat the administration has promised to veto S. 1459 as it is currently \nwritten. Our only hope, if we are interested in achieving that \nstability and balance to which I have addressed myself earlier this \nafternoon, is to enact a balanced piece of legislation which the \nadministration can sign into law.\n  For those reasons, I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in \nthe Bingaman substitute so this issue can be put to rest and a sense of \nstability can be brought to our friends and neighbors in the ranching \ncommunities. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair. My statement will not be very long, but \nI just wanted to make a couple of comments. We just completed debate on \nthe salvage timber, and the package offered by Senator Bingaman is, at \nbest, described as yet another example of a mindset that prevails here \nin Washington, DC.\n  Yesterday, I stated in this body that in order to answer that \nquestion, we, this generation--this generation--if we are to hand over \nto the next generation, our children and our grandchildren, a better \nEarth than we were handed, a world that will sustain them and their \ndaily needs for food and fiber, we have to approach the way the Federal \nGovernment writes rules and regulates them.\n  In the salvage logging debate, there were examples of actions taken \nby local authorities to protect the integrity of the law and the intent \nof the law. It has, in my State, brought some peace to the woods. There \nare examples of how land managers went the extra mile involving the \nlocal groups in the decisionmaking process of salvage. The involvement \nwas loggers, environmental groups, local government, and land managers \nthemselves. We should really congratulate the region I director of the \nU.S. Forest Service, because he used that process to determine a timber \nsale and used the same guidelines that we have always used, adhering to \ncurrent environmental law. As dedicated as he is to the forest, he used \nall of those, and the result was that local folks signed off on the \nsalvage sale.\n\n  Forest health is the goal, and it was then. Salvage is part of that \ngoal. It is a dual goal. Loggers have gone back to work, mills are \nturning out wood products again for Americans--all Americans--and we \nare having and using forest resources that have been tied up in the \ncourts for a long time.\n  Decisions that are made on the ground work best. Yet, this substitute \ncalls for decisions to be made thousands of miles away from the \nresource that is now being used by all Americans, we all benefit.\n  At this point, I want to associate myself with the words of my friend \nfrom Iowa last night, Senator Grassley, in his brief statement made on \nthis floor. There are times in this country when we who are involved in \nagriculture get a little bit timid about what we do, telling the people \nwhat we do. Well, I am here to tell you it is about time, and this \ncountry better wake up and realize what the production of food and \nfiber does for this Nation. Yes, we like to call ourselves \nagriculturalists, proclaiming the importance of it. I think we get \ntimid because we go under the false assumption that everybody \nunderstands and knows the importance of agriculture and knows that we \nproduce the largest segment of the GDP in this country, over 20 \npercent. Yet, that GDP has produced a raw product by less than 2 \npercent of the population. It is also the largest export this country \nhas. In other words, we feed the world.\n  Now, why do we so distrust the direction in which the present \nSecretary of the Interior is taking us? Can I cite one example? Wolf \nreintroduction into Yellowstone Park. Hearings all over the West. We \ndid not hear a lot of support for that. Yet, it has caused some \npolarization of groups that actually share the same goal in my State--\nshare the same goal of a better world and, yes, the environment. But \nthe actions of the Federal Government and the arrogance of this \nparticular occurrence have damaged the relationship within and without \nthe communities in Montana. Not only is it expensive, spending your tax \ndollars, but if you contrast that, exactly the same thing is happening \nin Glacier National Park. But that is a natural migration of wolves \nfrom Canada. That does not seem to get any headlines in the newspaper. \nIn that area of Montana, there is hardly any contact between man and \nwolf because, basically, both have learned the hard reality of the \nrules of survival. One never hears of that occurrence. Yet, we have \nwolves up there in Glacier Park and in the Bob Marshall. But one hears \nof the artificial introduction of that animal into that Yellowstone \nPark, which, in my opinion, is doomed to fail.\n  There are different fee rates. In my opinion, there is one main \nproblem of this debate. We are trying to find the answer to a very, \nvery difficult question. I say this: We are trying to recommend a \npolicy of ``one size fits all,'' when there are differences in the \nlands, the topography, thus, the production capability of the lands. \nThose differences are huge.\n  I guess that is why I so strongly recommend that we allow all the \nmajor decisions to be made on the ground locally, to involve local \npeople. There is no way that we, in Montana, run and manage our range \nthe same way as they do in New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, or anywhere \nelse. There are different soils, different growing seasons, different \nweather conditions, different patterns, all dictating managing our \nrange differently. It is just like privately owned land. All Federal \nlands and locales are not alike. The management scheme has to be \ndifferent to attain the same result. Anyone who has ever had anything \nto do with land understands that. I understand that. I was raised on a \nsmall farm of 160 acres, with two rocks and one section of dirt in \nnorthwest Missouri. Every acre was not the same on that little 160 \nacres either. But you knew how to handle them. You farmed each one sort \nof differently in order to get the desired results.\n  That is hard to explain to folks who have not had a personal \nrelationship\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\nwith the land or a real understanding of it. Most times, they do not \ncare about the knowledge, or the common sense, or even less caring and \nrespect for the thousands of families who have the sense, knowledge, \nhistory, and responsibility to manage this land that sustains them, and \nthe rest of America, as well.\n  Let us not go backwards. Let us make those decisions on the ground. \nThe Bingaman substitute takes us backward. Let us force people to sit \ndown and talk, but let us base our decisions on the right decisions and \non what has to happen on rangeland. Take the management. If hunters are \nworried about access, in the Domenici bill there is express language \ndealing with access. If you are worried about wildlife, we have already \ngiven you the figures that we have more wildlife today than ever in the \nhistory of this country. Water quality, that, too. Once you take the \nmanagement of the land away--and this could well do it because there \nare folks who do not have a real good understanding--then we are in \nreal trouble in the communities that derive a living from this \nresource. It is resource management.\n  So what I suggest and what I tell my colleagues is to defeat the \nBingaman substitute and let us pass the Domenici bill, because there \nhave been so many hours and so much work that has gone into this bill, \nworking with the administration and with everybody concerned. No, \neverybody will not get everything they want. But everybody is going to \nwant what they get. Let us put people into the equation whenever we \nstart talking about resource management on public lands because real \npeople are involved and will be impacted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bingaman \nsubstitute. In August of 1994, as a member of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, when we were attempting to work out \ndifferences with the House, we had adopted in that conference a measure \nthat was debated long on this Senate floor. In fact, the debate went on \nfor several weeks. Four or five cloture votes were held on that matter. \nI believe we got 57 votes on several occasions, but we were never able \nto reach that magic figure of 60 to terminate debate and go forward \nwith a revision of the grazing law. Had we done so, Mr. President, we \nwould not be here today debating whether or not the Babbitt regulations \nwere good or bad. We would have been working under a series of rules \nthat would bind one administration to another. Ranchers would have had \nsome defined rules in law to work under. They would have been able to \nobtain loans on their property, and there would be peace and quiet in \n``Ranchland U.S.A.'' The problem is, however, Mr. President, that there \nwere those who felt it was better not to adopt that.\n\n  Following the unsuccessful effort to invoke cloture, even though the \nmajority of this body and the other body approved the compromise, \nSecretary of Interior Babbitt issued a series of regulations that are \nnow in effect. The proposed compromise that was debated so long and \nhard here in my opinion was better than the Babbitt regulations, much \nmore defined, not nearly as complicated, direct to the point, and would \nhave allowed the ranchers of western America to be able to determine \nhow they should run their properties. There were many months that went \nby before the regulations were promulgated. They were phased in. The \nranchers even today really do not know for sure what the impact of \nthose regulations are going to be. They are all in effect. They \ncertainly are not as disastrous as prophesied by a number of people.\n  I say this: I think what has gone on this past year has been \nconstructive. It has been educational, I think. I extend my \nappreciation to the western Senators, particularly Senator Craig Thomas \nand Senator John Kyl. Those two Republicans and this Senator were \nappointed by the western Senators to try to come up with a compromise. \nWe were making great headway when the House ducked grazing reform and \nreconciliation, and had the work terminated that we had done. But even \nthat was not a failure because the work that I did with the Senator \nfrom Wyoming and the Senator from Arizona was helpful in the next wave \nof negotiations that we had. Senator Domenici's first bill that was \noffered had around 65 pages in it. After indicating to him that the \nbill was too complex, too broad, he came out with another draft about \nhalf that size. That is what we have been working from.\n  We have made progress. There are matters in this Domenici bill that \nare ones that I asked to be put in that bill. I appreciate that. \nProgress has been made. That is one reason that the debate today is not \nas acrimonious as it was in August 1994. The debate is constrained. It \nis deliberative and constructive. I have listened to almost all of the \ndebate that has taken place, and I think it is something that the \nSenate should feel good about.\n  But I reiterate that we would have been better off, there would have \nbeen finality, if we had adopted the compromise of August 1994 that \ncame out of Interior appropriations.\n  We are now faced with reality. We have been told by the \nadministration that if the Domenici bill is adopted it will be vetoed. \nI think it is quite clear that, if it is vetoed, the veto will be \nsustained. That is one reason I feel so strongly about the alternative, \nthe substitute, that has been put together by a group of western \nDemocratic Senators. I believe that we could prevail upon the President \nnot to veto that bill.\n  I understand the importance of livestock grazing in the western part \nof the United States. The small town that I was raised in southern \nNevada had both mining and ranching. I worked as a boy and as a young \nman for those permittees of grazing in the southern part of the State \naround Searchlight. I did all kinds of things for them. Most of it was \nmanual labor. But I understand--having gone out and taken water to \ncattle, taken feed to the cattle, cleaned out wells, generally helped \nthose ranchers maintain their ranch on this very arid land--how \nimportant it is.\n  Most all ranchers, Mr. President, are hard working, good citizens--\nreally the epitome of what is good about our country. They have great \nrespect for the land. They consider it their land. I have no problem \nwith that. But, Mr. President, we have talked today about western \nranchers in a flattering way. And I repeat that the vast majority of \nthose in the ranching community are good citizens. There are some who \nare not. There are the so-called proverbial rotten apples that spoil \nthe barrel. What did they do? There are all kinds of things that these \nfew rotten apples do. One is they deny access to public land. Others do \nnot have a concern for the continued health of the land.\n\n  Mr. President, in 1986 we debated in this body the Forest Service \nWilderness bill for the State of Nevada. There had been 25-plus years \nsince the Wilderness Act was passed. And Nevada basically had not done \ntheir work. I worked on that for a long time. Even though I started in \nthe House of Representatives before I came here, after Senator Bryan \narrived in the Senate we were finally able to get it passed preserving \nin Nevada beautiful land.\n  Nevada is the most mountainous State in the Union. Most people think \nit is arid with no greenery on it. That is not true. We have great \nmountain meadows and streams. We have animal life, antelope, and \nmountain sheep. We even have mountain goats in Nevada, and beaver, and \neagles. It is beautiful country. After the wilderness bill was passed \nsome ranchers in Nevada blocked off their land. As an excuse for not \nallowing hunters onto public lands they said it was because of \nwilderness. It is simply not true.\n  We have, for example, in northern Nevada a public land rancher who \nhas blocked access to public lands on a road that was public in the \nmid-1800's to the mid-1980's. This same individual has harassed hunters \non public land that come near his land. Also, this individual rides his \nhorse onto public lands in an effort to disrupt hunting. Not \ncoincidentally this same individual operates a guide service, and has a \nfinancial incentive to disrupt public hunting. He wants it to be \nprivate hunting. It is only one rotten apple. But it is enough to spoil \nthe barrel.\n  Another example that has been brought to my attention is a grazing \npermittee in northern Nevada who, armed with a rifle, harassed hunters \non public lands.\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\n  Mr. President, we need to ensure that the legitimate users of the \npublic lands are not prohibited from hunting on these public lands, nor \nprohibited from using these public lands, nor even discouraged from \nusing these public lands.\n  We need legislation that will provide land managers with the \nflexibility to protect the environment with multiple use without \nplacing an administrative burden or undue restriction on hunters.\n  Mr. President, as my colleague from the State of Nevada indicated, \nwhen he started high school there were less than 100,000 people in the \nState of Nevada. We are now approaching 2 million--not large by the \nstandards of the State of Pennsylvania, the State represented by the \nChair. But it is a big State in our mind, and we have tens of \nthousands, now in the hundreds of thousands of hunters throughout the \nState of Nevada. It used to be, when my colleague and I were young men \ngrowing up in Nevada, that rangelands were used basically by no one \nother than cattlemen, but it is not that way anymore. There is \ncompetition for those lands: off-road vehicle users, all-terrain \nvehicle users, snowmobilers, backpackers, cross-country skiers, and \nfamily outings to go on picnics. There is lots of competition for those \npublic lands in addition to the hunters and fishers and the ranchers.\n\n  We need to make sure that those people who ranch on public lands \ntreat them the way they should treat the lands. They are not the lands \nof the individual rancher. They are public lands and should be treated \naccordingly.\n  As I have indicated, in the past, ranchers have had the public lands \nto themselves. The West is different today with many competing uses for \nthese public lands. We cannot go backward. Today, in Nevada, we have \nhad a tremendous increase, as I have indicated, in the number of \nhunters and other people who want to use the land. Because of these \ncompeting interests, it is essential we get a bill that provides for a \nbalanced approach to multiple use. The Domenici proposal does not \nadequately provide for this.\n  Now, Mr. President, as I complimented my friend from Wyoming, my \nfriend from Arizona, I also compliment the senior Senator from New \nMexico. He has come some ways in this bill, and I appreciate that very \nmuch. I also compliment the junior Senator from New Mexico who I think \nwith this alternate proposal has done a good job in really framing the \nissues before this body.\n  As I have indicated, a balanced approach to multiple use is not \nadequately contained in this bill. It elevates a single use of the \npublic lands above other multiple uses, and it reduces the agency \nability to protect the rangeland environment and limits citizen \ninvolvement in public lands management.\n  It is not my goal to prohibit livestock on public lands, although \nthat is how some opponents of the Domenici bill were characterized \nyesterday. I think that I have had as much experience as most western \nSenators, more than others, in grazing land, ranch land generally. It \nis not my ultimate goal to prohibit livestock grazing. I think we \nshould maintain it. I think grazing livestock, if done right, makes \nland healthier. It makes it better. But it has to be done right. And we \nhave to allow the land managers to make sure that those few rotten \napples that are going to spoil the barrel are taken from the barrel, \nthey have the ability to take the rotten apple out of the barrel.\n  That is all we are asking in this alternative, this substitute. The \nsubstitute represents a compromise designed to provide a balance \nbetween providing stability to the livestock industry and the need for \nthe BLM and Forest Service to have the flexibility necessary to \nresponsibly manage Federal grazing lands and ensure multiple uses of \nthe public lands.\n  My concerns with this bill of my friend, the senior Senator from New \nMexico, I will talk about. The alternative prohibits use of the State's \nshare of grazing fees for litigation, ensuring that the money is used \nto benefit the land or community, that is, making improvements in the \nland, riparian improvements, other improvements on the land. Currently, \nin Nevada, the State's share of Federal grazing fees is being used to \nsue the Federal or State government like the Nye County case, the so-\ncalled Sagebrush Rebellion II case. I have to tell you, frankly, Mr. \nPresident, everyone knew in the beginning that case was a loser. You \nwould not have to graduate from Harvard Law School; I do not think you \nwould have to graduate from Harvard elementary school to understand \nthat that effort was doomed to failure.\n  In spite of that and the demagoguery that went forward based upon it, \nthey used these moneys which were intended to be spent on the land in \nNevada, improving water holes, fixing streams, building a road maybe--\nthat is not what they used it for. They used in Nevada almost $300,000 \nof Federal moneys for legal counsel, foundation, associations, lawyers \ngenerally. This money was wasted, a total waste.\n\n  The bill that has been propounded by the senior Senator from New \nMexico makes a provision for that. It does a good job. It is not as \ngood as the substitute, but it is fine. It says those moneys can still \nbe used for lawyers for administrative hearings. I do not think they \nshould be able to use them even for that, and we have plugged that hole \nin the substitute.\n  The money that comes from these grazing fees that is returned to the \nStates, Mr. President, I want used to improve the land, not to be spent \non litigation or lobbying activities.\n  As I have indicated, the Domenici bill restricts the use of the \nState's share of the grazing fees, but it provides a number of \nloopholes. It may allow States to continue to use Federal moneys for \nlobbying and administrative appeals. We need these moneys used to \nimprove the land.\n  The Domenici bill excludes grazing activities, management actions and \ndecisions from NEPA.\n  The substitute that I am cosponsoring represents a compromise between \nsportsmen and ranchers. The renewal or transfer of permits is not \nsubject to NEPA unless it will involve significant changes in \nmanagement practices or significant environmental damage is occurring \nor is imminent.\n  This is not good enough. For example, when a rancher's permit comes \nup for renewal, if he or she has been a good steward of the land and \nhas maintained the health of the land, that renewal will not be subject \nto NEPA nor should it be. If, however, as a result of an ongoing \ndrought caused by nature or bad management practices of the rancher \nenvironmental damage has occurred or is occurring, renewal would be \nsubject to a NEPA review.\n  That does not sound unreasonable. It also provides a mechanism to \nexclude grazing actions such as moving a fence or moving a stock tank \nfrom NEPA. That is what the alternative does, that is what the \nsubstitute does, when the activity is determined to have a significant \nimpact on the environment. That is the way it should be.\n  The Domenici bill does not provide for public participation up front \nin the decisionmaking process. What this is going to cause is a lot \nmore litigation because you cannot stop people from filing lawsuits, \nand that is what they will do early on. So what we need is to continue \nsome semblance of administrative proceedings on these decisions that \nhave been made. This will avoid litigation.\n  Yesterday, in the debate, it was stated that the Domenici bill does \nnot take away rights from fishermen and hunters. I respectfully submit \nthat perhaps the Domenici bill might not limit sportsmen's right to \naccess. It does, however limit their access to the process. Sportsmen \nand other users of the public lands are precluded from involvement in \nthe development of grazing decisions. They should be involved, because, \nMr. President, they have rights to that public land. It does not \ninvolve the public up front in the decisionmaking process, and it \nshould.\n\n  The substitute that I am cosponsoring allows persons defined as \n``affected interests'' to be consulted on significant grazing actions \nand decisions taken by the Secretary. No formal, complicated process is \nmandated. What it does, though, is strike a reasonable balance between \nthe Secretary's regulations, which would include involvement by the \n``interested public,'' and the Domenici bill, which provides for \nparticipation only after a draft decision has been made.\n  In the Domenici bill, only permittees and lessees are able to protest \nproposed management decisions. This is wrong.\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\n All other citizens could be excluded from taking an active role in a \nprotest and appeal process. This restricts the ability to resolve \nconflicts early and, I believe, cheaply. So, in our substitute, \naffected interests are allowed to protest proposed decisions, allowing \nthese conflicts to be resolved earlier and more informally, without \nlitigation.\n  I also say that there are some who think, if you just eliminate this \naffected interest ability to challenge some of these administrative \ndecisions, they are not going to challenge them. They will do it, but \nthey will do it in the courts.\n  The Domenici bill limits the managers' ability to tailor and develop \nterms and conditions to protect winter forage for elk and deer, nesting \nhabitat of game birds, water resources for wildlife, and water quality, \nand healthy riparian interests. Only allotments under an allotment \nmanagement plan can have terms and conditions attached. But this will \nnot work, because only 20 percent of the permits are currently under an \nallotment management plan.\n  So, under their proposal, 80 percent of the permits simply would not \nbe under terms and conditions. And it would limit the manager's ability \nto do anything about tailoring and developing terms and conditions to \nprotect the things that I have already outlined.\n  Allotment management plans look to the lands in a specific area and \nprescribe the livestock grazing practices necessary to meet multiple \nusers' objectives. They can be costly and time consuming to complete. \nSo we cannot decree that 100 percent of them be done. But, to the \ncontrary, we cannot take away the managers' ability to put reasonable \nconditions on the land. The substitute balances the need for the BLM to \nhave adequate authority to properly manage the public lands to ensure \ntheir long-term health with the need for ranchers to have some \nstability in terms and conditions of the grazing permit that we have \ntalked about.\n  The proposed substitute ensures that ranchers will not be subject to \narbitrary changes in the terms and conditions of a grazing permit. I \nthink that should make the ranchers feel secure. One of the things we \ntalked about when we had this long debate in August of 1994 was the \nfact that we needed to give the ranching community stability. We needed \nto give the ranching community certainty, so they could go forward and \nborrow money, make improvements. Here it is, almost 2 years later, and \nthings are more uncertain than they have ever been. I respectfully \nsubmit, my friends who so badly want to get the Domenici bill passed, \nfor what? The President is going to veto this bill. No matter what \nhappens when we get it out of the House, the President said he is going \nto veto it.\n  I think we would do much better if we came with a bill that would be \napproved, that will be voted for by a majority of the Democratic \nSenators from the western part of the United States, and I am sure we \ncould have some influence on the President to sign the bill.\n  Mr. President, the Domenici bill impedes permittees from employing \nproven restoration techniques, such as conservation use, by threatening \npermit loss if they do not make grazing use under the terms and \nconditions of a grazing permit.\n  What this means is that if someone wants to purchase a grazing \npermit, they cannot do it unless they want to ranch on it, unless they \nwant to graze on it. It was stated last night that the minority chose \nto make nonuse of public lands a dominant use. This simply is not true. \nI recognize what the benefits of conservation nonuse can provide to the \nenvironment, and I believe it should be an option available to \npermittees.\n  In Southern Nevada, because of an endangered species problem, an \nanimal called the desert tortoise, construction basically was brought \nto a grinding halt in the Las Vegas area.\n  Mr. President, we were able to work out our problems very quickly. \nOne of the ways we were able to work out our problems under the terms \nof the Endangered Species Act was we had a conservation nonuse program. \nClark County, NV, where Las Vegas is located, along with the Nature \nConservancy, holds allotments in conservation nonuse for the benefit of \nthis endangered species and allowed us to get back to work in building \nthe most rapidly growing city and State in the United States.\n  Under our substitute, conservation use may be approved for periods up \nto 10 years if consistent with the land use plan. This is important. I \nwill also suggest I do not know what my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle are worried about, or I should say my friend the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, because under the present rules and \nregulations in the law, there is not a big line forming for people to \nsign up for conservation nonuse. It is used infrequently, but when it \nis used, it is important.\n  I repeat, there is not a long line of institutions or people saying, \n``I want a conservation nonuse permit.'' It does not happen very often, \nbut when it does, it is important.\n  If the Domenici bill were approved, it, in effect, would deny \ncitizens of this country the ability to hold a grazing permit. I think \nthat is wrong. In our substitute, permittees do not have to be in the \nlivestock business to hold a permit.\n  Another problem I have with the bill of my friend from New Mexico is \nit requires managers--that is, someone from BLM or Forest Service--to \nprovide 48 hours of advance notice to the rancher that they are going \nto take a look at the land. It inhibits the ability to manage the land. \nIt also limits the flexibility of the manager to do complete \nmonitoring. Mr. President, who are they trying to protect? They are \ntrying to protect one of the bad apples. That is the only type of \nindividual who would be concerned about someone coming on their land to \nsee if they were grazing too many cattle in a riparian area or whatever \nelse they were doing to degrade the environment.\n  So the substitute I am cosponsoring with others does not require \nadvance notification for monitoring or inspection.\n  Also yesterday, it was stated that proponents of the Domenici bill \nwere not here to defend the chief executive office's tycoons who bought \nsome of this land out West. I acknowledge that. I think that is \nprobably true. The subleasing provisions, though, of the Domenici bill \nlimits the ability of the Forest Service and BLM to manage subleasing.\n  What do I mean by this? What I mean by this is if someone named Tom \nJones has a grazing permit, under our provision, if he wanted to \nsublease this to his children or grandchildren, he could do it. But if \nhe wanted to sublease it to Bob Jones from the State of Arizona or the \nState of New Mexico or someplace else, he would not be able to do it. \nThe permit should run to the permittee and should not give them the \nright to start leasing Federal land and making money on it. That, in \neffect, is what they have been doing. It should be stopped. We should \nnot allow subleasing unless it is to family members.\n\n  I would also suggest, Mr. President, that the Domenici legislation \nrequires excessive amounts of costly time for monitoring rangeland \nstudies and other delays before management actions that protect the \nenvironment can be implemented. That is not the right way to go. \nAgencies do not have the money nor the manpower to monitor all \nallotments. Our substitute allows agencies to rely on both monitoring \ndata--and that means things they have actually seen--monitoring data, \ninformation they have collected, and also objective data that they have \nseen in making their decisions.\n  The Domenici bill excludes groups such as Ducks Unlimited, Trout \nUnlimited, and other hunting and fishing groups and State agencies from \nentering into cooperative agreements for the development of a permanent \nrange improvement or development of a rangeland.\n  Mr. President, 5,000 cooperative agreements for range improvements \nare currently issued to nonpermittees. And 503 of these are in Nevada \nalone, representing about 15 percent of all range improvement permits \nand cooperative agreements in the State. The Domenici bill would \ndramatically limit agencies to leverage funds for range improvements. \nThat is something we should not allow to happen.\n  The substitute that I am cosponsoring allows nonpermittees to enter \ninto cooperative agreements.\n  Mr. President, in short, the Domenici substitute is certainly better \nthan the\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\nfirst draft we got of the bill. I say here that I appreciate the work \nthat has been done by all western Senators. I am especially grateful to \nthe staffs of all western Senators who have spent hours and days and \nweeks trying to come up with this. And there has been a spirit of \ncooperation. I wish we could have arrived at a bipartisan bill. We \ncould not. But the issues have been narrowed significantly as a result \nof our sitting down and spending this endless time together.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, what I believe that the substitute \noffers is balance. It provides balance between multiple uses and \nensuring that no one use is put on a higher plane than any other.\n  The bill by my friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, does not \nprovide this balance. It elevates a single use of the public lands, \ngrazing, above other multiple uses. That is not right. This is not what \npublic lands are all about.\n  I extend my appreciation to the junior Senator from New Mexico for \nhis tireless efforts in coming up with what I think is a veto-proof \nbill, one that we should all join in supporting, get it out of the \nHouse, get it signed and allow Nevada ranchers and other western \nranchers to get about their business.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the last 2 days we have discussed the \nmerits and shortcomings of the Public Rangelands Management Act. It is \napparent that this is a complicated debate, riddled with hyperbole and \nmisunderstanding.\n  Let no one misunderstand, however, the context within which this \ndebate has been conducted. There exists today throughout the West a \npalpable sense of economic anxiety that has its roots in the issuance \nof new grazing regulations by the Department of the Interior 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago; regulations that fueled fear among ranchers that they face a \ncampaign by the Government to permanently remove them from Federal \nlands.\n  This apprehension about Government insensitivity to the economic \nrealities of ranching is tangible in my State of South Dakota and \nwidespread throughout the West. Moreover, it has been aggravated by a \nprolonged period of extremely low cattle prices coupled with record \nhigh feed costs.\n  There is no doubt in my mind, Mr. President, that ranchers' \nfrustration with current Federal grazing policy is justified. Their \ngrievances are both procedural and substantive.\n  It was apparent that the regulations issued by the Interior \nDepartment in 1993 were conceived and issued in a manner that \ndiscounted the views of ranchers who earn their livelihood from public \nland.\n  Those rules clearly reflect the dominant views and interests of other \nusers, including environmentalists, conservationists, sportsmen and \nother recreationists. While these groups all have legitimate interests \nin the quality of Federal land management, the new rules simply do not \nstrike a fair balance among competing uses.\n  Like the first law of thermodynamics, every political action has a \npolitical reaction. The political reaction in the West to the new \ngrazing rules was one of outrage and protest. Many in the ranching \ncommunity understandably began to demonize these regulations. The \nlegislation we are considering today was conceived in reaction to those \nrules.\n  But unlike the laws of physics, in politics the appropriate reaction \nis not always an equal and opposite reaction. Often a political \nreaction does not solve problems, but rather only recasts them.\n  That is the case with S. 1459. And that is why I will oppose the \nbill, and why I have worked with many of my Western States Democratic \ncolleagues to develop an alternative to it.\n  The Bingaman substitute solves many problems for ranchers without \nharming the interests of other users of Federal lands. For grasslands \nranchers in South Dakota and elsewhere, it would create a separate \nmanagement regime apart from the National Forest System--a system that \nis ill-suited to dealing with the unique requirements of Federal \nrangeland.\n  Moreover, the Bingaman substitute overrides the language in the \ncurrent regulations with respect to the United States Government \nperfecting all the water rights on Federal land. It places NEPA \nanalysis in its proper perspective, ensuring that agency resources are \nspent evaluating the impacts of decisions that truly will effect the \nenvironment. And, it establishes a realistic fee formula with which \nranchers can live.\n  In other words, the Bingaman substitute addresses the legitimate \nconcerns of ranchers in the West. It represents a better way of \naddressing prevailing concerns about Federal grazing policy.\n  I do not question the commitment or motives of my colleagues who \ndeveloped the committee bill. They have attempted to redress a serious \nmatter through a serious effort. But their product moves Federal policy \ntoo far back in the opposite direction to the detriment of other public \npolicy goals.\n  S. 1459 strikes me as an overreaction to a very real threat to \nAmerican ranchers. It will not bring us closer to a reasonable and \nbalanced compromise. It will simply shift the equilibrium. If this bill \nis enacted, I suspect it will not be long before we are back here on \nthe Senate floor debating the same issue from the opposite perspective.\n  Mr. President, while we need grazing reform, S. 1459 shifts the \nbalance past the sensible middle ground we should be seeking. Let me \nelaborate.\n  To begin with, S. 1459 curtails public input beyond what I consider \nto be reasonable or necessary by restricting the ability of the public \nto be involved in the development of grazing proposals and to challenge \nspecific decisions.\n  What does this mean for users of Federal lands: campers, hikers, and \nscientists to name a few?\n  It means that those who may know and use the land will have their \nopportunity for input into the decisionmaking process restricted, \ndespite the fact that they may be able to offer very credible and \nuseful advice. It means that recreational users will no longer be able \nto challenge a decision they feel precludes them from having access to \nlands they have a right to use.\n  In contrast, Senator Bingaman's alternative retains the rights of \nranchers and other interested parties to protest management decisions--\na provision that exists in current law.\n  This is a very important point. The opportunity for public comment, \nprotest, and appeal has become one of the most contentious elements in \nthe grazing policy debate.\n  The history of public involvement by various interest groups has not \nalways been constructive. Appeals and protests have not always been \nused to offer useful advice or to ensure that decisions are faithful to \nthe letter and spirit of the law. On occasion, they have been used to \ndelay and derail reasonable decisions, sometimes on the basis of flimsy \nor irrelevant evidence or argument.\n  Despite this acknowledgment, I am voting today to protect the \npublic's right to comment on decisions that affect the public's lands. \nThe course that some propose--to curtail comment process--is one that I \ndo not feel can be justified by the historical evidence. Only through \nthe unfettered competition of ideas will we be able to ensure \ndevelopment of the very best policies. No process of government should \nbe sheltered by legal artifice from the force of a compelling argument. \nThe management of our public lands demands no less a standard.\n  I am also concerned that S. 1459 creates an unworkable system for \nholding title to range improvements. The Bingaman alternative retains \nthe title to permanent range improvements in the name of the United \nStates, while the committee bill would share the title between the \nUnited States and the ranchers. Under the substitute, ranchers are \ncompensated for their expenses if they give up the permit or the land \nuse changes and they can no longer graze the land.\n  Further, S. 1459 restricts the ability of those outside the livestock \nbusiness to obtain permits for conservation purposes. No longer would a \nNature Conservancy be able to obtain permits and rest the land in \nconservation use. It simply is not fair to prohibit nonlivestock \nentities from obtaining permits to use Federal lands.\n  The Bingaman alternative amendment allows anyone meeting basic \nrequirements to obtain permits and rest\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\nthe land in conservation use. The Nature Conservancy does this with 24 \npermits now and the Republican bill would curtail this ability.\n  In addition, S. 1459 significantly restricts the flexibility of the \nland managers to ensure adequate flows of water on Federal lands. If \nthis proposal is enacted, the Federal Government will no longer be able \nto protect fish and wildlife populations on Federal lands. Under the \nsubstitute, no such punitive restrictions would be imposed.\n  Taken together, and particularly when read in the context of the \nobjectives of the bill, these provisions persuade me that S. 1459 goes \ntoo far in one direction and fails to strike a reasonable balance among \nthe multiple uses of public lands. It is not a solution to favor one \ngroup of users of the public lands over another. To manage this \nresource in a fair and equitable manner, a careful balance must be \nstruck that responsibly addresses the legitimate concerns of all the \npublic land users.\n  Passage of S. 1459 will not end the debate over grazing in the west. \nIn its current form, this legislation will be vetoed, and that veto \nwill be sustained. Under that scenario, we will not have accomplished \nanything except to have provided more grist for the political mill.\n  The Bingaman substitute will not please everyone.\n  Environmentalists may feel that in some respects it is too generous \nto the ranching community, while ranchers may feel that it does not \nadequately insulate them from appeals, protests, red tape and the whims \nof the Federal Government.\n  I believe it strikes a fair balance.\n  The Bingaman substitute will protect the public's right to \nparticipate in grazing management decisions. It will ensure that \nFederal land managers have the authority and flexibility to guarantee \nsound stewardship of the land and protection of fish and wildlife \npopulations. It will allow conservation organizations the opportunity \nto obtain permits and rest the land.\n  In short, Senator Bingaman offers a sound, fair, and moderate \namendment that will establish security for western ranchers, while \ngenuinely protecting the interests of other users of the land. And, I \nbelieve, it can be signed into law.\n  I sincerely want to resolve this issue--for the permittees and \nlessees who reside in our States; for the communities that rely on the \nlivestock industry; for the users of the public land; and for the \nAmerican public in general. The uncertainty surrounding the management \nof the public lands must be clarified.\n  I believe the Bingaman approach will allow us to achieve our common \ngoal--healthy public rangelands. I urge my colleagues to support the \nBingaman substitute.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, ever since Department of the Interior \nSecretary, Bruce Babbitt, proposed Rangeland Reform '94, I have worked \nwith other western Senators to pass meaningful legislation addressing \nthe concerns raised in Secretary Babbitt's proposal. The bill before \nthe Senate is the result of those efforts.\n  While we were able to postpone implementation of Secretary Babbitt's \nmisguided reforms for some time, Rangeland Reform '94 is now operative. \nIt became effective August 21, 1995. Ranchers are expecting and should \nget relief from those regulations. We must pass S. 1459.\n  Ranchers in South Dakota have told me one thing: Rangeland Reform '94 \nmust be changed. Many of those reforms could have a detrimental impact \non ranching operations in South Dakota. The Secretary's reforms are \nshortsighted, weigh in too heavy on the side of environmental \nextremists and could drive many hard-working ranchers off the land.\n  Hardest hit would be our young farmers and ranchers. Many have just \nstarted ranching on their own. These young farmers and ranchers are our \nfuture. They are agriculture's future. Yet they are the ones that could \nbe most hurt if Rangeland Reform '94 is allowed to stand. I have heard \nfrom a number of ranchers who are more concerned with Rangeland Reform \n'94 than they are with low cattle prices. Now that is quite a \nstatement. It clearly shows why this bill must be passed.\n  The legislation before us today represents nearly 2 years of hard \nwork by many Senators and a vast number of individuals of different \ninterest and professions who are most affected by Federal rangeland \npolicies. I also want to commend the Senate staff who worked to develop \nour reforms into legislation. They worked late into the night and on \nweekends.\n  I do want to note that the bill has been significantly modified since \nit was first introduced last year. Every effort was made to reach a \nbipartisan consensus. Over the last 6 months Western States Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle worked hard to reach a compromise that \ncould ultimately be passed.\n  S. 1459 has bipartisan support and strong support throughout the \ncountry. I ask unanimous consent that a letter describing this support \nbe printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, many South Dakota organizations support \nthis bill. First of all it is strongly supported by South Dakota \nranchers. It is also supported by the South Dakota Public Lands \nCouncil, the South Dakota Farm Bureau, the South Dakota Sheep Growers \nAssociation, and the South Dakota Stock Growers, to name a few.\n  Let me outline specifically what this bill would do. Under S. 1459:\n  Ranchers who depend on the use of public lands would be able to \ncontinue operating in an economically viable manner.\n  Multiple-use management objectives would be achieved.\n  The rights of sportsmen, like hunters and fishers, would be protected \nand their use of Federal lands would not be restricted.\n  Water rights for livestock management grazing would be in accordance \nwith State laws.\n  Local input from virtually every key interest into the management of \npublic lands would be assured.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep in mind the fundamental goal of the \nlegislation to remove a clearly objectionable rangeland policy.\n  If left alone, Rangeland Reform '94 will have a detrimental effect on \nranching operations in South Dakota. Many of these reforms are short-\nsighted, take away local input and control, and could drive many \nranchers off the land.\n\n  It is clear that extreme environmental groups support Rangeland \nReform '94 and are waging a baseless scare campaign on S. 1459.\n  Supporters of Rangeland Reform '94 are spreading the laughable charge \nthat this bill would hurt wildlife and restrict hunting on Federal \nlands.\n  I say this is laughable because it simply is not true. All one has to \ndo is read the bill which specifically states:\n\n       Nothing [in this title] shall be construed as limiting or \n     precluding hunting or fishing activities on national \n     Grasslands in accordance with applicable Federal and State \n     laws, nor shall appropriate recreational activities be \n     limited or precluded.\n\n  I originally had two important improvements to S. 1459. One was \nincluded in the bill and the second I intend to offer as an amendment. \nSouth Dakotans made it abundantly clear of the need for local and \npublic input. I worked with Senator Domenici on an amendment to require \nconsultation with State, local, and other interests in land-use \npolicies and land-conservation programs for the national grasslands.\n  All users of Federal lands should have a voice in land-use policies. \nThis added input will provide needed suggestions on better grazing \npractices that will protect the land and enhance wildlife management.\n  After discussing this with Senator Domenici, my amendment was \nincluded in S. 1459 as reported. I thank Senator Domenici and Senator \nCraig for working with me on this proposal.\n  The second improvement is designed to address concerns expressed by \nsportsmen. South Dakota is probably the best hunting and fishing State \nin the Nation. I know there may be others who may disagree, but I will \ngladly promote South Dakota as a sportsmen's haven.\n  Sportsmen have expressed concerns that S. 1459 could limit use of \nFederal lands for hunting, fishing, and other recreational purposes. My \namendment would reinforce Federal policy to protect the interests of \nsportsmen who\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\nhunt and fish and use our public rangelands for sport. My amendment \nwould preserve the rights of hunters, fishermen, and other sport \nenthusiasts to use Federal lands.\n  I hope this amendment can be accepted and made part of the bill.\n  Mr. President, the Congress needs to pass S. 1459. The bill would \naddress the problems with Rangeland Reform '94, provide needed \nstability to farmers and ranchers, and help preserve the social, \neconomic, and cultural base of rural communities in the western States. \nCurrent use of Federal lands could be greatly restricted in future \nyears without S. 1459. I urge its adoption.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   March 14, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pressler: The undersigned organizations \n     represent the diverse interests of millions of citizens who \n     currently participate in the multiple use of America's public \n     lands. On their behalf, we strongly urge you to support S. \n     1459, the Public Rangelands Management Act. This bill is the \n     result of innumerable hours of bipartisan negotiations. It \n     fosters balanced multiple use management of our public lands, \n     resource protection and public participation. We have the \n     following reasons for asking your support for this \n     legislation:\n       The bill maintains widespread public participation in the \n     management of federal lands. For the cost of a postcard, any \n     individual or organization may qualify as an ``affected \n     interest'' under the bill simply by writing to the Secretary \n     to express concern for the management of grazing on a \n     specific federal grazing allotment. They will then receive \n     notice of and an opportunity for comment and consultation on \n     proposed decisions made by the Secretary of the Interior \n     affecting that particular federal parcel. Public \n     participation extends down to the level of designation of \n     allotment boundaries, development of allotment management \n     plans, increasing or decreasing the use of the land by \n     permittees, issuance and modification of permits and reports \n     evaluating monitoring data applicable to a permit.\n       The legislation maintains the ``multiple use'' of public \n     lands. There are those in the environmental community who \n     would have you believe this bill somehow establishes ranching \n     as a dominant use. You need not accept the word of these \n     environmentalists or our word; the legislation speaks for \n     itself. The bill states simply and clearly that ``multiple \n     use as set forth in current law has been, and continues to \n     be, a guiding principle in the management of public lands and \n     national forests.'' Section 102 states that nothing shall \n     affect valid existing rights, reservations, agreements or \n     authorizations. The bill specifically states that nothing in \n     the bill shall be construed as limiting or precluding hunting \n     or fishing activities on federal lands in accordance with \n     applicable federal and state laws, nor shall appropriate \n     recreational activities be limited or precluded. The canard \n     raised by these environmentalists that this bill would \n     somehow lock in current livestock usage levels is simply \n     wrong (see Section 101(a)).\n       The issue of NEPA compliance is important. The National \n     Environmental Policy Act was well intended for the protection \n     of the environment with regard to major federal actions. \n     Unfortunately, over the decades since its passage, NEPA has \n     been used by obstructionists as a tool to put a stranglehold \n     on any use of federal lands. The statutorily required major \n     federal action has devolved to the digging of a single post \n     hole on federal lands. Everyone familiar with current agency \n     interpretations of NEPA realizes the system is badly broken. \n     The reality is that agency officials are not getting out on \n     the land and monitoring multiple use; they are desk bound by \n     NEPA paper shuffling and the fear of litigation. The NEPA \n     provisions in the bill will protect the environment, restore \n     the original intent of NEPA and free up federal land managers \n     to do their job, all while saving the public money.\n       The Public Rangelands Management Act is a major cost saver \n     for the federal government. The Congressional Budget Office \n     has scored the new grazing fee formula contained in the bill \n     and determined that enactment would decrease direct federal \n     spending by about $21 million over the 1996 to 2000 period. \n     CBO estimates that offsetting receipts would increase by \n     about $28 million over the same period. The western livestock \n     industry supports this new formula at a time when cattle \n     prices are at a 13 year low. Ranchers are stepping up to the \n     plate and expressing a willingness to pay more during the \n     hard times.\n       If enacted, S. 1459, the Public Rangelands Management Act \n     will be the first major revision of federal lands grazing \n     activities since the 1934 Taylor Grazing Act. The time has \n     come to restore common sense to the management of the federal \n     lands and to allow ranchers utilizing those lands to continue \n     the production of food and fiber. Support responsible land \n     management, prudent resource conservation and continued \n     multiple use of national lands. Please support S. 1459.\n           Sincerely,\n         Agricultural Retailers Association; American Chianina \n           Association; American Farm Bureau Federation; American \n           Forest and Paper Association; American Gelbvieh \n           Association; American Horse Council; American \n           International Charolais Association; American National \n           Cattle Women; American Sheep Industry Association; \n           Arizona Cattle Feeders' Association; Arizona Cattle \n           Growers Association; Arizona Farm Bureau Federation; \n           Arizona State Cowbelles; Arizona Wool Producers \n           Association; Association of National Grasslands; Black \n           Hills Regional Multiple Use Coalition; California \n           Cattlemen's Association; California Farm Bureau \n           Federation; California Public Lands Council; California \n           Wool Growers Association; Cochise Grand Cattle Growers; \n           Colorado Cattlemen's Association; Colorado Cattle \n           Feeders Association; Colorado Farm Bureau; Colorado \n           Public Lands Council; Colorado Woolgrowers Association; \n           Dixie Escalante Rural Electric Association; Empire \n           Sheep Producers, NY; Florida Cattlemen's Association; \n           Gem State Hunters Association; Idaho Cattlemen's \n           Association; Idaho Dairymen's Association; Idaho Farm \n           Bureau Federation; Idaho Food Producers Association; \n           Idaho Hunters' Association; Idaho Mint Growers \n           Association; Idaho State Grange; Idaho Wool Growers \n           Association; Independent Petroleum Association of \n           America; Indiana Sheep Breeders Association; Iowa State \n           Grange; Kansas Sheep Association; Michigan Cattlemen's \n           Association; Michigan State Grange; Mississippi \n           Cattlemen's Association; Montana Association of Grazing \n           Districts; Montana Farm Bureau Federation; Montana \n           Public Lands Council; Montana Stockgrowers Association; \n           Montana Wool Growers Association; National Association \n           of Counties; National Association of State Departments \n           of Agriculture; National Cattlemen's Beef Association; \n           National Grange; National Lumber and Building Material \n           Dealers Association; National Mining Association; \n           Nebraska Cattlemen; Nevada Cattlemen's Association; \n           Nevada Farm Bureau Federation; New Mexico Farm and \n           Livestock Bureau; North Dakota Lamb & Wool Producers; \n           North Dakota Stockmen's Association; Oregon Cattlemen's \n           Association; Oregon Farm Bureau Federation; Oregon \n           Sheep Growers Association; Ozona Wool & Mohair; Public \n           Lands Council; Regional Council of Rural Counties, \n           California; Rocky Mountain Oil & Gas Association; \n           Roswell Wool, New Mexico; South Dakota Public Lands \n           Council; South Dakota Sheep Growers Association; South \n           Dakota Stockgrowers; Southern Timber Purchaser's \n           Council; Tennessee Cattlemen's Association; Texas Sheep \n           & Goat Raisers Association; Texas & Southwestern Cattle \n           Raisers Association; Utah Cattlemen's Association; Utah \n           Farm Bureau Federation; Utah Wool Growers Association; \n           Utah Wool Marketing; Washington Cattlemen's \n           Association; Washington Farm Bureau; Washington State \n           Grange; Wilderness Unlimited, California; Wyoming Farm \n           Bureau Federation; Wyoming Stock Growers Association; \n           Wyoming Wool Growers Association.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1459, the \nPublic Rangeland Management Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nbill. And, I congratulate Senator Domenici and others who have worked \nso hard to balance the many interests involved in this legislation.\n  Livestock grazing has always played a major role in our western \nlifestyle, providing a number of important economic, social, and \ncultural benefits to all Americans. Utah's rangelands are a renewable \nresource that can be used and reused without sharing the land. In fact, \ngrazing has become a natural part of the ecological system. A 1990 \nreport from the Bureau of Land Management states that ``Public \nrangelands are in a better condition than at any time in this \ncentury.'' [``State of Public Rangelands 1990'', U.S. Bureau of Land \nManagement, emphasis supplied] This is true because livestock grazers, \narmed with the latest available knowledge, have become wise users of \nthe resources available to them.\n  There have been instances in the past of overgrazing to the detriment \nof the land and the local ecology; today these cases are the exception. \nNow we hold those who abuse our lands responsible for their actions.\n  Mr. President, let me state clearly that the Public Rangeland \nManagement Act provides no relief or protection to bad actors on our \nrangelands. Instead, it reinforces all environmental laws as they \nrelate to grazing on public lands. This is as it should be.\n  But, Mr. President, I am extremely concerned for the plight of \nlivestock producers in Utah and throughout the United States. I am not \naware of any cattle producers in Utah who are making a profit. There \nare a number of factors contributing to this devastating\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\ntrend. But when I ask them what we can do to help, they unanimously \nplead for stability--stability in the fees they are charged and \nstability in the laws and regulations they must obey.\n  In Utah most of the livestock producers are small family-owned cattle \nand sheep operations. An increasing number of these families who have \npaid for grazing permits on public land, will be unable to afford to \nuse the. They will simply be unable to survive under the difficult \nregulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior known as \nRangeland reform 94. Even the possibility that these regulations will \nbe implemented has been sufficient cause for many lenders to hold back \ntheir money rather than provide necessary loans to ranchers. Lenders \nknow the business, and they know that Secretary Babbitt's proposal is \nbad for the industry. Without the necessary credit these families have \nlittle hope for survival.\n\n  Mr. President, it breaks my heart to watch as families, who have been \nin the livestock business for generations--in some cases since before \nUtah became a State--are forced to pull up their stakes and fold up the \nfamily business. These families have withstood terrible winters, \ndevastating droughts, the depression, and other economic downturns. But \nfaced with an all powerful, antipathetic Federal Government, their \nability to endure is coming to an end.\n  Considering the serious situation of our livestock industry, one \nmight wonder how far S. 1459 goes to provide for their relief.\n  Some fear that S. 1459 exempts grazers from some environmental laws. \nThere is absolutely no ground for this fear. The language in this bill \ncould not more clearly reinforce all environmental laws, and it does \nnothing to impede future changes or additions to current environmental \nlaw.\n  Some who oppose the bill believe it would restrict the use of \npermitted lands from sportsmen and recreationists. They are dead wrong. \nSenator Domenici went so far as to add an amendment to this bill \nstating plainly that multiple use of permitted land would not be \ninhibited in any way. Mr. President, those who continue to criticize \nthe bill for this reason must oppose the idea of grazing on public \nlands altogether, because it is clear that this concern has been \naddressed.\n  Mr. President, even with the difficulty faced by families in the \nlivestock industry, there are still those who argue that we do not \nraise grazing fees high enough. The truth is that this bill raises \ngrazing fees by 30 to 40 percent from current law, generating millions \nmore revenue for the Treasury than in the past.\n  These critics point to the higher fees that are charged for forage on \nprivate lands. But, there can be little comparison made between grazing \non private land and grazing on public land. On one hand, the private \nlandowner must provide all the livestock management services as well as \ncontinual forage. Of course private owners charge more, they provide \nall the necessary services for grazers and must maintain them. On \npublic lands, it is the grazers who are required to install and \nmaintain stock water ponds, fences, and other improvements at their own \nexpense.\n\n  Before he was named as Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt said \nthat ``multiple use has run its course.''--Public Lands Reform Vital, \nDenver Post, Mar. 9, 1990. This view is certainly disheartening to use \nin the West, and I, for one, regret that Secretary Babbitt has set in \nmotion a number of challenges to multiple use. The Rangeland Reform `94 \nplan is amount the most difficult.\n  Besides putting grazing fees at a level that is sure to run a host of \nranchers off of public lands, Secretary Babbitt's Rangeland Reform '94 \nproposal would lay down a long list of new standards and regulations \nthat address all public grazing in a one-shoe-fits-all approach. This \napproach just does not make sense. Every grazing district throughout \nthe country has its own set of challenges and resources that must be \ndealt with to ensure sustainable use of the that area.\n  S. 1459, the Public Rangeland Management Act, would set into law a \nframework for managing our lands according to each district's specific \nneeds. And I might add that it would do so while keeping all current \nenvironmental protections in full force and effect. This bill would \nalso set into law a fee formula that, although much higher than current \nlaw, would provide stability for families in the livestock business and \ntheir creditors. Fees should not be set by political appointees who \ncome and go, and who bring with them differing philosophies of public \nland management.\n  Again, I commend Senator Domenici, Senator Murkowski, and all my \ncolleagues who have worked to develop this compromise legislation. This \nbill is long overdue. When this process began the need for these \nreforms was great. Since then, that need has taken on great urgency. We \nmust pass this bill without delay.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It is my understanding that the grazing bill S. 1459, \nthe Public Rangelands Management Act does not affect the issue of \ngrazing on national parks and national wildlife refuges.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Idaho is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The reason I ask that question is that on many \nnational wildlife refuges, including at least two in my own State, \ngrazing is a traditional use of refuge lands originating in some cases \nbefore the land was acquired by the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have grazing rights been continued on those refuges?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It has taken a lot of effort to get the \nadministration to admit that grazing rights on the refuges were \nretained by the previous landowners when the land was transferred to \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service. As things stand right now, there may be \nroom for some optimism that grazing will continue both as a retained \nright, and as a wildlife management technique.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his observation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I support Senator Domenici's Public \nRangelands Management Act. I had hoped to support a substitute or a \nseries of amendments to address the concerns I expressed in the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee meetings. However, we are faced with an \namendment that fails to address my concerns and a substitute that goes \nbeyond the changes that I believe we called for in the Domenici bill.\n  I am concerned with two aspects of S. 1459--public participation and \nflexible management. We could have done a better job in these two \nareas.\n  Affected interests should be consulted and allowed to protest and \nappeal decisions;\n  Site-specific NEPA analysis should be allowed when it is determined \nto be useful; and\n  A permittee or lessee should not have to be engaged in the livestock \nbusiness and own base property in order to practice conservation use.\n  The substitute makes an attempt to address these two areas, but fails \nin other respects:\n  It continues to advocate two distinct range management programs, one \nfor the Forest Service and one for the Bureau of Land Management;\n  It fails to adequately address the water rights issue; and\n  It does not adequately credit permittees for their rangeland \ninvestments.\n  I oppose the amendment offered by Senators Bumpers and Jeffords for \nthe following reasons:\n  It would create two classes of rangeland users without improving \nnatural resource management;\n  It would become an administrative nightmare for the regulatory \nagencies; and\n  It is bad policy for Government to ``reward'' small operators or \n``penalize'' large operators. The goal is to charge a fair fee to all.\n  I therefore will support Senator Domenici's bill. I see it as a \nreasonable, if flawed, attempt to bring closure to this longstanding \nissue.\n  The long and often contentious rangeland management debate reflects \nthe profound ties that we as a Nation feel for our public lands. These \nties are more than economic or sentimental. They are true bonds we hold \nto our Nation's past and its future.\n  The decades of debate have not been wasted. They have produced \ninformation that is leading to new management strategies and \ncooperation where\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\npreviously rancor prevailed. We now have an inspiring number of \ncoalitions of ranchers, conservation groups, and State and Federal \nagencies working together voluntarily to improve rangelands.\n  In Southeastern Oregon's Trout Creek, for example, permittees are \nworking together with Oregon Trout (a private conservation \norganization) and State and Federal agencies to improve riparian areas \nand resolve conflicts between big game and livestock. Their efforts \nhave been very successful in improving range conditions on private, \nState, and Federal lands.\n  The Malapai Border Project in my esteemed colleagues' State of New \nMexico offers another example of cooperative management. Here, \npermittees, the Nature Conservancy, and State and Federal officials \nhave come together voluntarily to solve regional ecosystem problems. \nThrough their efforts, we hope to stop the encroachment of brush into \ngrasslands.\n  These and other examples should encourage us all. The condition of \nour grasslands is improving and should continue to do so if we work \ntogether.\n  It is interesting to observe the evolution of grazing fee proposals. \nFor years grazing fees provided the hot button for all sides of the \nargument. Ranchers let us know loud and clear that their fees were high \nenough. Today, by-and-large, they support the legislation before us, \nwhich would increase the fees. This change of heart reflects a better \nunderstanding of the issues and a desire to respond to others' \nconcerns.\n  We need to capitalize on this spirit and ensure that it grows. It is \ntoo easy to focus on remaining differences and go away convinced that \nthey are too great to resolve. If we do this, we will inspire the \ncooperation necessary to resolve the remaining differerences.\n  It is my hope that my Senate colleagues will work in conference, in \ncooperation with the House and the administration, to make the \nadjustments necessary to address my continuing concerns.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the final analysis is clear. \nRangelands need grazing in order to be healthy. Given that \nunderstanding, do we work with the stewards now on the land to improve \nrange health, and find the right balance of grazing? Or do we focus \ninstead on regulations that will have the end result of driving many of \nthose stewards off the range?\n  The second alternative is unacceptable to me, and should be to all of \nus here. But under the regulations now in place, that is the direction \nwe are headed. Innovative managers, like conservation award winner Bud \nPurdy from Picabo, ID, are seeing their children leave a generations-\nold tradition because of the uncertainty of depending on Federal lands. \nAnd this all despite his nationally recognized conservation projects.\n  We should be encouraging, not discouraging, private enterprise and \nindividual initiative. We should be looking out for the best interests \nof the public in the long term. Creating vast empty wastelands is not \nin the best interest of the American public, and it is the \nresponsibility of this body to set policy that will plot the course to \nprotect environmental health and economic stability for rural \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Chairman, as you might have guessed, this debate is a source of \ngreat frustration for me. The focus of this Congress, and supposedly of \nthe administration, is to reduce and simplify government, to serve the \npublic better by decreasing overhead cost, reducing needless oversight \nand review, and improving cooperation with the private sector. But the \nregulations which the administration implemented last August fly in the \nface of those goals.\n  We have to ask ourselves what our priorities are. Ranching is a \nprimary industry across the West. Do we want to tap into the resources \nthat industry has to offer, to encourage conservation and cooperation, \nto foster stewardship and local management? Or do we want to \nmicromanage the top down, effectively pulling the rug out from under \nfragile rural economies?\n  Mr. President, there are efforts underway as we speak to support \nrural America. The President is supporting an aggressive rural \ndevelopment program that is being included in the farm bill. But does \nit make sense to undertake a significant rural development program on \nthe one hand while implementing regulations that will stifle \ndevelopment on the other?\n  Mr. President, I believe the answer is clear, and further, that \nSenator Domenici's bill is the better path to achieving those goals. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There are no other Senators on our side desiring to \nspeak on this matter. I will speak maybe 3 to 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let us talk a minute about public input into \ndecisionmaking. Senate bill 1459, as introduced, has been criticized \nfor its provisions regarding public involvement in management decisions \nregarding grazing activities on the Federal land.\n  In fact, Mr. President, under the Domenici substitute amendment, \npublic involvement has been expanded. For the first time the public \nwill be given an opportunity to comment on reports by the Secretary of \nthe Interior, and Secretary of Agriculture, summarizing range-\nmonitoring data. The only area where the role of the public has been \nsomewhat diminished is in the area of protests. Let me talk about that \na minute.\n  Under the Domenici substitute, protests cannot be filed by so-called \naffected interests on very limited types of decisions, such as proposed \ndecisions on applications for grazing permits or leases or relating to \nterms and conditions of grazing permits or leases or range improvement \npermits. Other types of protests are allowed, as are appeals of final \ndecisions under the Domenici substitute.\n  The reason for limiting protests, Mr. President, is very simple: We \nhave found that we need to reduce the potential for filing vexatious \nand frivolous objections by individuals not even remotely affected by \nproposed decisions on specific grazing allotments. We want the \nGovernment to work better, not worse. We want decisions to be \nimplemented without being protested, then appealed and delayed, and \nthen delayed some more.\n  Mr. President, the substitute defines an affected interest to include \nindividuals and organizations that have expressed in writing to the \nSecretary concern for the management of livestock grazing on specific \nallotments for the purpose of receiving notice and an opportunity for \ncomment and informal consultation on proposed decisions of the \nSecretary affecting allotments.\n  As a result of being affected interests, an individual or \norganization, can receive notice of and the opportunity to comment on \nsummary reports of resource conditions as well as proposaled and final \ndecisions. They can also appeal final decisions, assuming they have \nstanding to appeal.\n  If an individual, organization is an affected interest, notice of a \nproposed decision will allow a reasonable opportunity for comment and \ninformal consultation regarding the proposed decision within 30 days, \nfor designation or modification of allotment boundaries, development, \nrevision or termination of allotment management plans, increase or \ndecrease of permitted use, issuance, renewal of transfer of grazing \npermits, modification of terms and conditions, reports, evaluating \nmonitoring data and the issuance of temporary nonrenewable permits.\n  In addition to all of the above, Mr. President, public participation \noccurs in the following areas under this substitute: First, resource \nadvisory councils; second, grazing advisory councils; third, all the \nFLPMA processes, development of land use plans and amendments thereto.\n  The NEPA process, where it is used in land use planning, it is used \nto its absolute maximum. It is also applicable in the development of \nstandards and guidelines.\n  It is not accurate, nor is it fair, to argue that 1459 or the \nsubstitute amendment to it significantly diminishes public \nparticipation in management decisions affecting grazing allotments. The \nintent of our legislation is to ensure fair and frequent public \nparticipation by interested individuals, but to curb frivolous and \nvexatious attempts by outsiders to micromanage --not macromanage, but \nmicromanage--grazing on the public domain from a distance of 2,000 \nmiles away.\n  In short, our bill attempts to keep those who would file with a 32-\ncent\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\nstamp, from Boston, on a postcard, from spawning administrative and \njudicial litigation. That brings livestock grazing and economic \nactivity in the West to a halt. This happens with more frequency than \nyou might imagine. We think we have the right amount, which is a very \nsignificant amount of public participation, in the right type of \ndecision points.\n  In some areas, our bill goes further than the Bingaman substitute; in \nothers, it does not go as far. But I believe public participation is \nmaintained in a very broad way and is very significant in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have a number of responses in writing that I have \nwritten out with reference to other contentions that have been made \nhere on the floor. I do not think, in the interest of time, that I will \ngo through each and every one of them. But there are some significant \ndifferences in conservation partnerships that are allowed, cooperative \npartnerships, than have been stated here on the floor.\n  The only thing that concerns us and that is epitomized in our bill, \nis after the land use plan is put together, we do not permit those who \nwould like to get rid of grazing to come in and pick the very best land \nand say, ``We'd like to take all the cattle off. We have enough money \nto pay for it. We would like to turn it into nothing more than a \nnongrazing area.''\n  We think there are other, better ways to improve conservation \nmeasures without doing that to the public domain. I might indicate that \neven in States which have a very, very broad-based approach to \nconservation uses, instead of just pure grazing, this idea of going and \npicking leases, picking the best of leases and taking them out of \ngrazing and putting them into an exclusive conservation use, has been \ndenied at the State level, not only in New Mexico but in other States.\n  Mr. President, another criticism of S. 1459 is that it provides for \ncooperative range improvement agreements with permittees and lessees \nonly. Had Senator Bingaman read the Domenici substitute amendment, he \nwould have known that his criticism of S. 1459 is utterly baseless. \nSection 105(b) directs the Secretary, where appropriate, to authorize \nand encourage coordinated resource management practices. Such practices \nshall be for the purposes of promoting good stewardship and \nconservation of multiple use rangeland resources. And, such practices \ncan be authorized under a cooperative agreement with a permittee or \nlessee, or an organized group of permittees or lessees.\n  Language was specifically added at the urging of some conservation \ngroups to provide that such cooperative agreements could include other \nindividuals, organizations, or Federal land users irrespective of the \nmandatory qualifications required to obtain a grazing permit required \nby S. 1459 or any other act. This was done so that non-permittee or \nnon-lessee conservation groups could voluntarily make improvements on \nthe public rangelands.\n  So, Mr. President, contrary to what Senator Bingaman claims, a \ncooperative agreement is not limited to just permittees and lessees. \nAnyone can enter into a cooperative agreement with a permittee or a \nlessee and voluntarily make range improvements on grazing allotments.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that Senator Bingaman isn't suggesting that we \nshould discourage or prohibit this type of voluntary rangeland \nstewardship, because one of the groups that urged us to change section \n105 voluntarily makes $3 million in range improvements each year, based \non funds raised at dinners and benefits. If Senator Bingaman wants to \nmake it the policy of the United States that we should not allow this \ntype of voluntarism, I think our colleagues should be skeptical about \nsupporting his substitute.\n  Next, Mr. President, it has been said that S. 1459 denies the right \nof affected interests to protest grazing decisions on public land and \nnational forests by providing that only an applicant, permittee, or \nlessee may protest a proposed decision. Again, Senator Bingaman should \nread the Domenici substitute more carefully. Either that, or he must be \nconfused about what the Domenici substitute actually does. Section \n151(b) of the Domenici substitute requires the authorized officer to \nsend copies of a proposed decision to ``affected interests.''\n  Section 155(b) requires the Secretary to notify ``affected \ninterests'' of seven different kinds of proposed decisions: first, the \ndesignation or modification of allotment boundaries; second, the \ndevelopment, revision, or termination of allotment management plans; \nthird, the increase or decrease of permitted use; fourth, the issuance, \nrenewal, or transfer of grazing permits or leases; fifth, the \nmodification of terms and conditions of permits or leases; sixth, \nreports evaluating monitoring data for a permit or lease; and seventh, \nthe issuance of temporary nonrenewable use permits.\n  Section 151(c)(3) states that any notice of a proposed decision to an \naffected interest must state that ``any protest to the proposed \ndecision must be filed not later than 30 days after service.''\n  The only limitation on protests is found in section 152, which \nstates, ``an applicant, permittee, or lessee may protest a proposed \ndecision under section 151 in writing to the authorized officer within \n30 days after service of the proposed decision.''\n  If there is a limitation on the filing of protests by affected \ninterests, Mr. President, the Domenici substitute does not allow \naffected interests to file protests on very limited types of decisions, \nsuch as proposed decisions on an application for a grazing permit or \nlease, or relating to a term or condition of a grazing permit or lease \nor a range improvement permit. Each of these types of issues, Mr. \nPresident, involve the contract-like relationship between the permittee \nor lessee and the United States. In our view, these are the type of \ndecisions that do not warrant armchair quarterbacking and second-\nguessing by those who want to micromanage livestock grazing on the \npublic lands.\n\n  Other types of protests are allowed--as I have already more than \nadequately explained--as are appeals of final decisions, under the \nDomenici substitute.\n  On this one, Mr. President, Senator Bingaman is wrong again. So is \nthe Congressional Research Service attorney who analyzed the bill for \nSenator Bingaman.\n  Next, Mr. President, Senator Bingaman claims that under S. 1459 only \nranchers would qualify to appeal a final decision affecting the public \nlands. This is false. Persons who are aggrieved by a final decision of \nan authorized officer can appeal such a decision, so long as the \nagency's standing requirements can be met. The same would be true for a \njudicial appeal of a final agency action.\n  The reference to the Administrative Procedure Act simply clarifies \nthat a person must actually be aggrieved--actually injured--as set \nforth in the APA and case law interpreting it. This does not mean that \nsomeone whose interest might be affected, or who might suffer some \nunknown injury at some point in the future can sue.\n  Mr. President, what we are trying to do here is to eliminate \nfrivolous and vexatious administrative and judicial appeals by those \nwho are not actually adversely affected by a land manager's decision, \nbut who oppose grazing on public lands or have some particular ax to \ngrind.\n  Senator Bingaman seems to think that being an ``affected interest'' \nshould automatically confer rights to bring administrative or judicial \nappeals of final decisions. He cites the language in section 154 that \nstates ``being an affected interest as described in section 104(3) \nshall not in and of itself confer standing to appeal a final decision \nupon any individual or organization.''\n  Mr. President, under the administrative case law of the Interior \nBoard of Land Appeals, a clear distinction has been made as to the \nappeal rights of ``affected interests'' as opposed to those ``whose \ninterests may be adversely affected.'' The IBLA has ruled in several \ncases, Mr. President, that being ``deemed'' to be an ``affected \ninterest'' does not automatically confer upon a person a right to \nappeal. The Interior Department's regulations state that only a person \n``whose interest is adversely affected by a final decision may appeal \nto an administrative law judge.'' (Donald K. Majors, 123 IBLA 142, 146 \n(1992)).\n  Mr. President, the Domenici substitute is consistent with the \nInterior Department's regulations.\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\n  Senator Bingaman also claims that S. 1459 exempts on-the-ground \nmanagement from NEPA. NEPA has been eliminated in site-specific \nsituations. He cites a CRS analysis that states that elimination of \nsite-specific analysis is a significant change in current law and \nprocedures. In place of NEPA, S. 1459 proposes a review of resource \nconditions.\n  The Domenici substitute states that grazing permit or lease issuance, \nrenewal, or transfer are not ``major federal actions'' significantly \naffecting the environment under NEPA. This will spare the Government \nthe time and expense--1\\1/2\\ years per EIS at a cost of about $1 \nmillion per EIS--of doing full-blown EIS' on the more than 20,000 \ngrazing permits and leases on BLM and Forest Service lands.\n  Also, the Republican substitute places NEPA consideration of grazing \nactivities at the appropriate place: at the land use or forest plan \nlevel. The Republican substitute does not trivialize the NEPA process \nby requiring an EIS for simple decisions such as where to locate a \nwatering tank or whether a fence should be built.\n  What Senator Bingaman and the CRS analysis ignores is that the \nmeasure of whether NEPA analysis is done on ``site specific \nmanagement'' is whether ``site specific management''--and it is not \nclear what Senator Bingaman means by this term--constitutes a major \nFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the environment \nwithin the meaning of NEPA. The Bureau of Land Management does not now \nperform NEPA analysis on grazing permit renewals, so this is not a \nsignificant change from current procedures.\n\n  Current law does not require NEPA analysis on ``site specific \nmanagement.'' Current law requires NEPA analysis of major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the environment. For Senator Bingaman \nto say that S. 1459 eliminates NEPA analysis of site specific \nmanagement is a gross mischaracterization of the process and of what \nNEPA requires. And, as I already mentioned, decisions on the location \nof a stock watering tank or construction of a fence cannot possibly be \nconsidered ``major Federal actions.''\n  Finally, Mr. President, Senator Bingaman is trying to dupe everyone \ninto believing that the Domenici substitute eliminates NEPA analysis of \ngrazing activities, and places instead a simple review of resource \nconditions. The facts about what the Domenici substitute does are \nthese: first, NEPA analysis would be required at the BLM land use \nplan--also known as the resource management plan--level and at the \nForest plan level. NEPA is not eliminated. Let me repeat--NEPA is not \neliminated.\n  Mr. President, let me just say that the Bingaman substitute would not \nrequire the completion of any analysis under NEPA on renewals and \ntransfers unless the Secretary determines that the renewal or transfer \nwould involve significant changes in management practices or use, or \nthat significant environmental damage is occurring or is imminent. \nNowhere does the Bingaman substitute specify what ``significant'' is.\n  Second, Mr. President, the Domenici substitute would require \nmonitoring of resource condition at an interval of no less than every 6 \nyears. This is not required now. Neither BLM or the Forest Service \nconduct monitoring with any regularity, if at all.\n  Third, notwithstanding Senator Bingaman's complaints that monitoring \ndata consists of very specific measures of vegetative attributes, or \nthat, in many cases, it is not available, the Domenici substitute will \nensure--for the first time--that adequate monitoring data are available \nto BLM and the Forest Service. Why is this so important? Because--for \nthe first time--monitoring can help guide the agencies in determining \nwhether grazing activities or land management practices should be \nchanged to protect the public rangelands. The substitute of Senator \nBingaman would do no such thing.\n  So, Mr. President, how in the world can Senator Bingaman criticize \nthe Domenici substitute?\n  Last, Mr. President, Senator Bingaman claims that, under S. 1459, the \npublic is not given a say in range improvements.\n  While no specific provision is made in the Domenici substitute for a \npublic say in range improvements--just as the Bingaman substitute does \nnot specifically give the public a role in range improvements--an \nopportunity for such input would be welcomed through input from the \nresource advisory councils and grazing advisory councils.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just summarize my response on a \nfew of these areas, and then I think we will have concluded the debate \nas far as I am aware on this substitute amendment.\n  I wanted to talk briefly about three issues. First, the NEPA issue \nthat was raised by several of my colleagues, and the difference between \nour bill and the underlying Senate bill 1459 on NEPA application; \nsecond, the opportunity to protest, which Senator Domenici was just \nreferring to; then the question that was raised earlier in the debate \nabout why our own substitute did not have a specific provision \nreserving the right of people to hunt and fish or otherwise use the \npublic lands.\n  First on NEPA, let me state my understanding of NEPA. The statement I \nthink was made earlier by my colleague that NEPA today is not applied \nor used in the management of the BLM lands. My understanding is very \ndifferent, Mr. President. My understanding is the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act sets up a procedure which applies to all of \nthe Federal land management agencies and essentially says that when you \ntake an action or make a decision, you need to determine by virtue of \nthe National Environmental Policy Act whether there is an impact, a \nmajor Federal impact on the environment.\n  You can do it one of three ways. If you are fairly confident that \nthere is no impact on the environment to speak of, and it is clear that \nwhat you are doing is consistent with decisions you have otherwise \nmade, you can make an administrative determination, and that is in \ncompliance with NEPA, but you are complying with NEPA, as I understand \nit, by making an administrative determination that nothing more is \nrequired. If you think possibly a more serious impact on the \nenvironment might be involved you can, instead, make an environmental \nassessment, and only once you have made an environmental assessment and \ndetermined that there will be a significant impact on the environment \nare you required to do a full-blown environmental impact statement.\n  Now, whether you do an administrative determination or whether you do \nan environmental assessment or whether you do the full-blown \nenvironmental impact statement, the BLM in this case is complying with \nNEPA, so the notion that the BLM is not in compliance with NEPA in the \nway they presently operate and the way they have historically operated \nis just wrong. In fact, when you look at the CEQ regulations--not the \nnew regulations that Secretary Babbitt promulgated--in the CEQ \nregulations, it is made very clear that based on regulation 1501.4, \nbased on the environment assessment, the agency will make its \ndetermination on whether to prepare an environmental impact statement.\n  My understanding is that the BLM did comply with that. In most cases \nthey determine that they should do an environmental assessment before \nrenewing leases. We are trying to address that in our substitute, as I \nhave explained here, and I think everybody concedes we are saying that \nNEPA should not apply when you are just renewing a lease, when you are \njust renewing a permit, unless there is some evidence that there is a \nchange in the management or some evidence that there is danger to the \nland involved or to the environment. That is the first point on NEPA.\n\n  On the opportunity to protest, under our bill, under this proposed \nsubstitute we are offering, the department will determine whether or \nnot a particular group or person is an affected interest. Not everybody \nwho writes in or contacts the department is necessarily an affected \ninterest. If a third-grade class in Hartford, CT, wants to write and \nthey say they are an affected interest on the land in a ranch in New \nMexico, it is very doubtful that any Secretary would determine that \nthey were an affected interest under the language of\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\nour substitute. We have made it clear that the Secretary is given \ndiscretion as to look at whether or not a group is, in fact, affected.\n  If they are affected, we provide they have an opportunity to protest. \nNow, the CRS report, which I know some are critical of, let me state I \nthink they make a very good point here. They say a protest is similar \nto a predecisional appeal that gives the public an opportunity to \nobject to a proposal, gives the agency an opportunity to change or \nmodify its course before committing itself to a final course of action.\n  That is all we are saying. We are not saying that someone should have \nlegal rights as such, except to state their position and do so at a \nstage in the process before a final decision is made. That is not \npermitted under the underlying bill. It is permitted in our substitute. \nI think, clearly, it should be permitted.\n  Again, it should be permitted for those who are determined to be \naffected interests--not for the so-called interested public, which is \nwhat the current Department of Interior regulations refer to. We have \ncorrected that. We agree that is an overly broad category, the \ninterested public. So we have said in the case of an affected interest, \nif you are determined to be an affected interest you should have a \nright to protest before they finalize the decision.\n  The other area I wanted to particularly point out, I know my \ncolleague had said that someone could raise an objection to our bill on \nthe grounds that we did not specify that hunting and grazing are, in \nfact, permitted. Well, we did not. I point out that the reason we did \nnot is that in our bill we made it very clear that our legislation is \nnot an amendment to all of the different statutes that are being \namended in the underlying legislation. The underlying legislation, by \nits very language, section 102, page 5, says,\n\n       The Act applies to the Taylor Grazing Act, Federal Land \n     Policy Management Act, Public Range Improvement Act, Organic \n     Administration Act of 1897, the Multiple Use Sustained Yield \n     Act of 1960, the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resource \n     Planning Act, the National Forest Management Act.\n\n  Since they are saying that all of those acts are modified or changed \nto the extent necessary by this, they then have to come back later in \nthat same section 102, and say nothing in this title shall limit or \npreclude the Federal language from being used for hunting, fishing, \nrecreation, watershed management, et cetera.\n  We did not have that same proviso in there because we are not \naffecting those acts. Nothing in our bill affects those earlier acts. \nWe are proposing very limited statutes which have the effect of \ncorrecting regulatory provisions that we had concerns about. That is a \nbasic reason why we did not repeat that same provision that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico has in his earlier bill.\n  I gather he wants to speak in response to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just wanted to say, Senator, and ask you if you would \nturn to the section called Applications of the Act on page 5. It says, \n``This act applies to,'' and then it says, ``(1), the management of \ngrazing on Federal land by the Secretary of Interior under * * *'' So \nit is the management of grazing as affected by these acts.\n  All I said about your failure to include the provision was that \nsomebody, if they wanted to treat your bill like they have treated my \nbill, would say, why does it not have in that language that says it in \nno way would affect, and all I said was somebody might write--since \nthat is not there, maybe it affects them in some adverse way.\n  I do not believe with that language which says ``grazing on Federal \nland,'' that we are changing these acts. It is the management of \ngrazing on Federal land.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond that there are a great \nmany groups and individuals around the country very concerned about \npreserving hunting and fishing rights. To my knowledge, none of them \nhave raised concerns about whether our legislation impinges upon those \nor our proposed substitute impinges upon those rights, or fails to \nadequately protect those rights. I think those concerns have been \nraised about the underlying bill. Senate bill 1459, not about our \nsubstitute. So I think this is a problem which is not real, in my view.\n\n  Mr. President, I will conclude my comments by just going back to the \nbasic point that I think needs to be understood by our colleagues. In \nputting together our substitute, which we are getting ready to vote on, \nwe sent a letter to my colleague, Senator Domenici, in September of \nlast year. It was signed by myself, Senators Dorgan, Daschle, Bryan, \nand Reid, all five of us, who have spoken here on this issue. We sent a \nletter saying that, in our view, the only way we should go forward and \ndevelop legislation that would do what needs to be done here is to \nidentify the problems that exist in the new grazing regulations and \nthen legislate corrections to those, legislate solutions to those, \ncorrect the specific problems that have been pointed out. Do not go \nbeyond that and create new problems.\n  I believe that we have done that in the substitute. We have tried to \nstrike a balance between those who graze the land, the authority of \nthose who graze the land, and the authority of those who want to use \nthe land for other purposes. I believe that balance is very important \nto maintain. I fear that the underlying bill gives us an imbalance, \nwhich we will be back here trying to correct in future years, if the \nunderlying bill were to become law. With that, I believe we have \nconcluded debate on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before I move to table the Bingaman \namendment, I want to say to Senator Bingaman, and other Senators who \nhave worked with him on that side of the aisle, obviously, even with \nreference to the Domenici amendment, your work has not been in vain \nbecause we changed it rather dramatically in response to various \nmeetings we held with Senator Bingaman, and the other Senators he \nmentioned. A number of changes have been made since he suggested them, \nand the major one was made because of a suggestion Senator Bingaman \nmade--that we not provide by statute to wipe out all of the regulations \nand say these are the regulations. We left many of the old regulations \nin place, which he recommended we do. I thought that was a major \nchange. That it reduced the bill by two-thirds in length, if nothing \nelse, should be good. Many of us think we ought to have fewer words \nrather than more. In many areas we have complimented their efforts.\n  We believe that the Domenici amendment will create the balance, and \nthat it will create more of a certainty for the ranching community to \ncontinue to exist. At the same time, it will protect all the other \ninterests.\n  With that, Mr. President, I move to table the Bingaman amendment, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BURNS). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment is designed to address a \nconcern expressed by sportsmen in South Dakota. South Dakota is \nprobably the best hunting and fishing State in the Nation. I know there \nmay be others who may disagree, but I will gladly promote South Dakota \nas a sportsman's haven.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could we have order. And the Chair will \nwithhold comment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this amendment reinforces Federal policy \nto protect the interests of sportsmen who hunt and fish and use our \npublic rangelands for sport.

I will yield.\n  Mr. FORD. The longer the Senator talks, the less chance this \namendment has of passing.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out all after the resolving clause and insert in \n     lieu thereof the following:\n     ``That it is the sense of the Congress--\n       ``(1) to deplore the missile tests and military exercises \n     that the People's Republic of China is conducting from March \n     8 through March 25, 1996, and view such tests and exercises \n     as potentially serious threats to the peace, security, and \n     stability of Taiwan and not in the spirit of the three United \n     States-China Joint Communiques;\n       ``(2) to urge the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to cease its bellicose actions directed at Taiwan and \n     enter instead into meaningful dialogue with the Government of \n     Taiwan at the highest levels, such as through the Straits \n     Exchange Foundation in Taiwan and the Association for \n     Relations Across the Taiwan Strait in Beijing, with an eye \n     towards decreasing tensions and resolving the issue of the \n     future of Taiwan;\n       ``(3) that the President should, consistent with section \n     3(c) of the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 (22 U.S.C. 3302(c)), \n     immediately consult with Congress on an appropriate United \n     States response to the tests and exercises should the tests \n     or exercises pose an actual threat to the peace, security, \n     and stability of Taiwan;\n       ``(4) that the President should, consistent with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act of 1979 (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), reexamine the \n     nature and quantity of defense articles and services that may \n     be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-\n     defense capability in light of the heightened military \n     threat;

Mr. President, under the order I believe we are to vote. \nI ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes--1 minute for the Senator from \nAlaska, 1 minute for the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate will vote on this timely issue \nregarding the current situation in the Taiwan Strait. I am referring, \nof course, to the military action by the People's Liberation Army to \nintimidate the people of Taiwan on the eve of the first Democratic, \ndirect election of their President.\n  The executive branch has criticized, correctly, the military \nexercises. The administration has backed up its words by sending a \nnaval presence to monitor the exercises in the Taiwan Strait. The House \nhas passed its own resolution. It is time for the U.S. Senate to also \ngo on record deploring the military threat of the People's Republic of \nChina, and recommitting the United States to the terms and conditions \nof the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  Senator Thomas, the majority leader, Senator Helms, and I, along with \nour staffs, have been in close consultation with the administration and \nwith our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to address their \nconcerns, and am pleased that we have crafted a compromise that will \nhave broad bipartisan support. I think it is important for the leaders \nof the People's Republic of China to understand that America is united \nin maintaining the historical commitments we have made to Taiwan.\n  The Taiwan Relations Act clearly states that peace and stability in \nthe Western Pacific are in the political, security, and economic \ninterests of the United States, and makes clear that U.S. policy is to \nresist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would \njeopardize the security, or the social or economic interests of the \nUnited States.\n  The amendment we have offered makes five important points. First, the \namendment directs the President to consult with the Congress, as \nrequired by the Taiwan Relations Act, when it is determined that there \nis a threat to the security or the social or economic system of the \npeople of Taiwan.\n  I do not believe this threshold has been met, both because the \nPeople's Republic of China ended the missile tests as scheduled on \nMarch 15 and one of its naval exercises on March 20 and because the \nPeople's Republic of China has indicated that it does not plan to \nattack Taiwan. We will have to wait and see if their actions match \ntheir words.\n  Second, the amendment directs the President and Congress, as required \nby the Taiwan Relations Act, to reexamine the nature and quantity of \ndefense articles and services that may be necessary to enable Taiwan to \nmaintain a sufficient self-defense capability in light of the \nheightened threat. The purpose of this commitment, of course, is to \ndeter China from considering any type of attack.\n\n  I am pleased that United States officials and officials from the \nRepublic of China met this week to discuss additional sales of \nnecessary defensive weapons. I hope the approved list is sufficient to \nmaintain their self-defensive capability. I wonder, for example, \nwhether the Patriot system that is scheduled for delivery in late 1997 \nis timely or adequate given the recent missile tests?\n  Third, the amendment deplores the missile tests and other military \nexercises that have the potential to disrupt air and shipping routes. \nThe missile tests resulted in four unarmed warheads falling in waters \nnear Taiwan's northern and southern ports. The naval exercises using \nlive ammunition encroach upon international shipping lanes. These \nactions call into question the commitment of the People's Republic of \nChina to the peaceful resolution of the future of Taiwan.\n  Fourth, the amendment calls on the People's Republic of China to \ncease its threats, and instead enter into a constructive dialog with \nthe Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan, perhaps through \ntheir informal organizations, the Straits Exchange Foundation in Taiwan \nand the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits in Beijing. \nIn the past, these two organizations have dealt with many other issues \nbetween the two countries, from fishing to highjackers, and have helped \nfuel the enormous investment in mainland China by Taiwanese investors, \nestimated at some $20 billion.\n  Finally, the amendment notes that the Government of the Republic of \nChina should remain committed to the peaceful resolution of its future \nrelations with the People's Republic of China by mutual decision, \nconsistent with government policy.\n  Mr. President. I do not believe that China is on the verge of \nattacking Taiwan. I also do not believe that China's scare tactics will \nhave their intended affect on Taiwan. When the roar of the military \ntests have subsided, and the last vote is counted in Taiwan, I hope the \ntwo sides will pursue a course of constructive dialog. Until the time, \nthe United States must maintain its vigilance and monitor events in the \nTaiwan Strait.\n  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I want to comment on one issue that \nis related to the debate surrounding this resolution, an that is \nCongress' role in the visit of President Lee Teng-hui to his alma \nmater. There are some who have blamed that visit, and Congress' role in \nbringing about that visit, for the current crisis. Mr. President, that \nis simply not the case. I would refer my friends to a recent op-ed in \nthe New York Times by Christopher Sigur that points out that it was not \nthat visit, but the prospect of democracy in Taiwan, that has so upset \nthe leaders in Beijing.\n  As Mr. Sigur notes, until recently, both China and Taiwan had \nimplicitly recognized the island's de facto independence and dealt with \nit peacefully.\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\n They negotiated Taiwan's participation in numerous international \ninstitutions, from the Asian Development Bank and the Asia Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation forum to the Olympics by sidestepping the \nindependence question.\n  But as Taiwan moved closer to a full fledged democracy with the \nDecember parliamentary elections and the March Presidential elections, \nBeijing's leaders saw the island moving toward a less predictable \nfuture, because, of course, in a democracy, there will be many \ndifferent voices that the leadership must accommodate.\n  All of this came at a time when Beijing is preparing to take over \nHong Kong and thus test Chairman Deng's ``One Country, Two Systems'' \nproposition. In addition, the leadership in Beijing is still in \ntransition as Chairman Deng fades from the scene.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would argue that our own administration \ncontributed to hardening the Peoples Republic of China's reaction to a \nprivate visit by Lee Teng-hui by not issuing the visa initially and \nassuring Beijing that this private visit did not constitute a departure \nfrom the ``One China'' policy. Instead, Secretary of State Christopher \ntold President Jiang Zemin that such a visit would not occur, and \ntherefore caused the President to lose face when the decision was \nreversed.\n  The United States was right to allow President Lee to return to his \nalma mater. The United States is right to continue to sell defensive \nweapons to Taiwan. And the United States is right to go on record \ndeploring the recent missile tests and military exercises. Although \nthese actions are condemned by the People's Republic of China they are \nconsistent with United States policy under the four joint communiques \nwith the Peoples Republic of China and the Taiwan Relations Act, the \nlaw of the land.\n  Mr. President, China must understand that missile diplomacy does not \nwork. This amendment sends that message, and I ask my colleagues for \ntheir support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times \narticle, as well as a recent op-ed I authored in the Wall Street \nJournal entitled ``What We Owe Taiwan'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Why Taiwan Scares China\n\n                       (By Christopher J. Sigur)\n\n       In the debate over China's military exercises in the Taiwan \n     Strait, few have discussed a fundamental reason for its \n     actions: Taiwan's emerging democracy. China's main concern is \n     not any movement toward independence but rather the effects \n     of Taiwanese democracy on the island's foreign policy.\n       Until recently, both China and Taiwan had implicitly \n     recognized the island's de facto independence and dealt with \n     it peacefully. They negotiated Taiwan's participation in \n     numerous international institutions, from the International \n     Monetary Fund to the Olympics, by sidestepping the \n     independence question. China tolerated Taiwan's efforts to \n     open embassies abroad. But the military exercises in the \n     strait show that this implicit understanding is in tatters.\n       What has changed? With its first-ever direct presidential \n     elections on Saturday, Taiwan will become a full-fledged \n     democracy.\n       President Lee Teng-hui's controversial visit to Cornell \n     University last summer was a symptom of Taiwanese democracy. \n     To stay in power in a democracy, of course, one must respond \n     to the opposition's views. The opposition in Taiwan does not \n     want reunification with the mainland and has increasingly \n     demanded international recognition of the island. Hence, \n     President Lee's campaign to rejoin the United Nations, his \n     trips to Asia, Latin America and Europe (which have been \n     termed ``vacation diplomacy'') and the push to have Congress \n     grant him a United States visa.\n       It is naive to think that if only Mr. Lee had chosen not to \n     go to Cornell, if only he had not offered the United Nations \n     a $1 billion gift in an apparent attempt to gain a seat, \n     China would not be acting so belligerently.\n       Beijing's leaders recognize that Mr. Lee's actions are \n     prodded by democracy and it horrifies them. China's state \n     newspapers often refer to Taiwan's ``demands for independence \n     in the guise of democratization,'' clearly linking one with \n     the other.\n       What the People's Republic sees across the strait is a \n     China whose people are ready to choose their own leaders, \n     with all the demands that makes on a political system: \n     regularly scheduled elections, a free press and political \n     parties that must take their opponents' ideas seriously, \n     because you never know who will be in power tomorrow. Beijing \n     is not prepared to accept this model in Taiwan or on the \n     mainland.\n       Thus, even if Mr. Lee renounced Taiwan's United Nations \n     bid, canceled all his overseas trips and closed his country's \n     few embassies, both he and Beijing would recognize that the \n     moves are meaningless. Democracy institutionalizes \n     uncertainty, and neither Beijing nor Taiwan could predict how \n     the voters would react. China may not have liked seeing \n     Taiwan under the firm grip of the Nationalists for the last \n     four decades, but at least they were predictable.\n       The United States must recognize that it has a fundamental \n     interest in promoting Chinese democracy, and in protecting \n     its sole example in Taiwan. Thus, we must warn China in no \n     uncertain terms that we will not sit idly by if Taiwanese \n     democracy is threatened, encouraged our allies to make \n     similar declarations and continue to back up our words with a \n     show of American naval power.\n       Democracy's uncertainties will only increase the threats to \n     the security and economic stability of the entire region. The \n     United States is vital to any long-term solution. The Chinese \n     on both sides of the strait are unlikely to reach a solution \n     unless Washington keeps them talking.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           What We Owe Taiwan\n\n                          (By Frank Murkowski)\n\n       President Nixon must be spinning in his grave.\n       When he first opened relations with Beijing some 20 years \n     ago, Nixon believed that Asia could not progress if China \n     remained isolated. His actions promised to help that country \n     enter into a new and constructive relationship with the rest \n     of the modern world. But Beijing's recent self-defeating \n     actions can only turn back the pages of history and cripple \n     China's economic progress.\n       Beijing's decision to start missile tests near Taiwan--and \n     it is to be hoped nothing worse--effectively imposes a \n     miniblockade of Taiwan's two major ports prior to Taiwan's \n     first free presidential elections on March 23. The tests, \n     while probably intended to affect the election, have \n     ramifications beyond the Taiwan Strait.\n       For that reason, Sen. Craig Thomas (R., Wyo.) and I have \n     introduced in the Senate a resolution recommitting us to the \n     Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which clearly states that \n     America believes that peace and stability in the area are in \n     the ``political, security and economic interests of the \n     United States.''\n       The Taiwan Relations Act, which is the law of the land, \n     commits the U.S. to ``resist any resort to force or other \n     forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the \n     social or economic system, of the people of Taiwan.''\n       We must remind Beijing that the decision of the U.S. to \n     establish diplomatic relations with China was ``based upon \n     the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined \n     be peaceful means.''\n       Some China-watchers are inclined to rationalize Beijing's \n     behavior. Apologists have blamed China's belligerence on the \n     firm stands taken by Congress. But today it is clear that \n     China, not Congress, is to blame for the current state of \n     U.S.-China relations. Time and again, before and after the \n     1989 Tiananmen Square attack on student protesters, China's \n     rulers have shown themselves to be almost oblivious to the \n     fact that a larger world--one that is sensitive to human \n     rights concerns, capable of helping improve China's quality \n     of life, and with a firm belief in religious and political \n     freedom--exists beyond the borders of the People's Republic \n     of China.\n       President Jiang Zemin and his lieutenants must understand \n     that this is why the U.S. finds China's missile diplomacy \n     unacceptable. We support the peaceful settlement of \n     differences between China and Taiwan, and cannot idly watch a \n     peaceful, democratic ally be threatened--and certainly not \n     attacked militarily.\n       We must, furthermore, continue selling Taiwan defense \n     weapons to help counter any thoughts China might have of \n     using military force against the island. Along with these \n     weapons, we must let the leaders in Beijing know that threats \n     are useless as tools of foreign policy and are the rusted \n     relics of diplomacy from a bygone and dangerous era.\n       China's leaders must know that economic gains will \n     evaporate if continued military threats (or worse) create \n     havoc in East Asia. Beijing's officials must understand they \n     cannot conduct business as usual with the world if missiles \n     start falling. They also need to know that fear of war is \n     every bit as chilling to investment as the real thing.\n       Congress should congratulate the people of Taiwan for their \n     continued steps toward democracy. Congress should also state \n     its support for the people of Taiwan to become involved in \n     international organizations. Taiwan has emerged as a force \n     for democracy and stability in Asia, and its people should be \n     represented. The U.S. must continue at the same time to \n     encourage a true dialogue between Beijing and Taipei that \n     will lead to understanding and conciliation, rather than \n     threats and confrontation.\n       With this latest round of threats against Taiwan--and the \n     U.S.--it is time to step back and gather forces to support \n     reason and dialogue, rather than the rumblings of hostility \n     and war.\n       President Nixon was correct in seeing the vast potential \n     importance of China as a world economic power. But more than \n     20 years later, the world still waits for Beijing to abandon \n     its totalitarian ways and to behave consistently as a \n     civilized nation.\n\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and commend the Senator from Wyoming \nfor his effort in this regard.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, when the matter originally came up, I \nstrongly opposed the resolution because it seemed to be a shift of \nground away from the Shanghai Communique which has been the basis for \nalmost a quarter of a century of our relationship to China.\n  Mr. President, we are deeply grateful, Senator Nunn, Senator \nFeinstein, and I, and others, who had serious objection to the \nresolution in its original form.\n  With Senator Thomas, Senator Murkowski, and others, we are now \nworking this out in a balanced way that makes clear that this Nation \ncontinues to adhere to the one-China policy, as enunciated in the \nShanghai Communique and the communiques since that time under five \nAmerican presidents. I believe it is not a perfect resolution, but it \nis a balanced resolution. On that basis, I can vote for it. I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question in on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3562) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the current tension in the Taiwan Strait \ncreates a very dangerous situation. While I do not believe that China \nintends to invade Taiwan, there is always the risk that accident or \nmiscalculation could lead to conflict. China's actions have been \nprecipitated by its perception that Taiwan is unilaterally seeking \nindependence. While I regret that it is necessary, I applaud the \ndecision by President Clinton to send two carrier battle groups to the \nregion.\n  I would have preferred that no legislation or concurrent resolutions \nbe passed by Congress in the current tense situation but I am opposed \nto the resolution passed by the other body and believe that it is \nnecessary for the Senate to go on record on this important matter.\n  Mr. President, the concurrent resolution we are considering this \nafternoon is reasoned and responsible and is designed to make a \nconstructive contribution to the situation. It is important because it \nrecognizes that the one China policy that is based upon the three \nUnited States-China joint communiques has been and is being adhered to \nby the United States. It is important because it deplores the People's \nRepublic of China's recent military actions and urges China to cease \nits action and to enter into a meaningful dialogue with Taiwan. It is \nimportant because it reminds everyone of the provisions of the Taiwan's \nRelations Act. And finally it is important because it states that the \nGovernment of Taiwan should remain committed to the peaceful resolution \nof its future relations with China by mutual decision.\n  Mr. President, as I noted in my floor speech on United States-China \nrelations last month, the framework of the three communiques and the \nTaiwan Relations Act has served both sides of the Taiwan Strait as well \nas the United States well for almost 16 years. That framework made \npossible the relaxation of tensions in the Strait; has encouraged \nTaiwan to abolish martial law and become a prosperous democracy; made \navailable to the Chinese on the mainland that talent and capital of the \npeople on Taiwan; it played a major role in China's drive for \nmodernization; and it produced a sense of security for China, for \nTaiwan, and the region. The thrust of this concurrent resolution is to \nremind both sides of the Taiwan Strait of these facts and to encourage \nthem to maintain that framework--both its letter and its spirit.\n  Mr. President, I would like to repeat what I said at the end of last \nmonth's floor speech because it continues to sum up my thinking on this \nsubject and is, I believe, totally consistent with this concurrent \nresolution.\n\n       Americans feel close to the people of Taiwan and are proud \n     of their accomplishments. The people of Taiwan have made \n     enormous strides economically and politically. They are an \n     example to much of the developing world.\n       It is important for the United States, as a friend, to be \n     clear with the Taiwanese that they must not misjudge China on \n     the question of Taiwan independence.\n       It is important that the people of Taiwan understand that a \n     unilateral declaration of Taiwan's independence would be \n     inconsistent with United States foreign policy as set forth \n     and followed by President Nixon, President Ford, President \n     Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, and President \n     Clinton.\n       It is also important for the Chinese to understand that the \n     United States values its friendship and relationship with the \n     people on Taiwan. It is crucial that the Chinese understand \n     that if China uses force to resolve the Taiwan issue, the \n     United States will not stand idly by but will surely respond.\n       For our part, the U.S. should make it very clear that we \n     will oppose either side's attempt to change the status quo \n     either by the use of force by Beijing or by unilateral \n     declaration of independence by Taiwan. The United States \n     position should be clear that we are prepared to live with \n     any outcome negotiated in good faith between China and \n     Taiwan. The future of Taiwan must be settled by mutual \n     agreement between the parties, not by the unilateral actions \n     of either. For that to happen, Taipei must stop its political \n     provocations and Beijing must stop its military provocations.\n       The people of China and the people of Taiwan should resume \n     a high-level dialogue to foster clear understandings and \n     increased cooperation. Enormous progress has been made in \n     economic cooperation and people-to-people contacts and visits \n     on both sides of the Strait. While economic development and \n     people-to-people cooperation are emphasized, political \n     questions are complicated and emotional and their resolution \n     will require a long-term effort. This will involve a trait \n     for which the Chinese people are famous--patience.\n\n  Mr. President, I support this concurrent resolution.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I strongly support the resolution \ncurrently before the Senate reiterating this Nation's support for the \npeople of Taiwan. I rise to speak about the recent escalation in \nmilitary operations by the People's Republic of China--Mainland China--\nin the Taiwan Strait which is intended to intimidate the Republic of \nChina--Taiwan. Mainland China announced on March 5, 1996, that it would \ntest fire surface-to-surface missiles off the coast of Taiwan from \nMarch 8 through 15. China has made good on its threat and began missile \nfiring and conducting amphibious live ammunition exercises on the \nsouthern tip of the Taiwan Strait on March 12. China plans to continue \nthese exercises through March 24. The missile tests have forced the \nrerouting of commercial flights out of the Chiang kai-shek \nInternational Airport and have also impacted the shipping operations of \nthe southern seaport of Kaohsioung. It has become painfully obvious \nthat China's sole purpose in conducting these exercises is to attempt \nto demoralize the people and destabilize the government of Taiwan.\n  I am deeply concerned, as are other Members of Congress, with the \nrise in military activities in the Taiwan Strait meant to influence the \nfirst-ever Taiwanese presidential election on March 23, 1996. The \nimportance of this election cannot be understated. It is the first \nelection of president by popular vote in the 5,000-year history of \nChina. The actions taken by mainland China have further hindered United \nStates-China relations already convulsed by China's human rights \nviolations, its failure to adequately deter the pirating of United \nStates products in violation of copyright laws and suspected \nexportation and proliferation of nuclear equipment and technologies.\n  The primary reason for the renewed China-Taiwan tension is an ongoing \npower struggle within the Chinese government. The hardliners are using \nthe Taiwan issue to exploit and capitalize on a vacuum in leadership \ncaused by the continued failing health of Deng Xiaoping. These same \nhardliners will do whatever necessary to boost their own stock while \nsimultaneously devaluing the stock of rivals.\n  The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act proclaims American support for the \npeaceful reunification of Taiwan and the mainland, and commits the \nUnited States to help Taiwan defend itself in case of Chinese \naggression. The recent activity by the Clinton administration which \nincludes the deployment of the carrier battle group U.S.S. Independence \nto the region to be joined later in the month by the U.S.S. Nimitz and \nits support ships, although a step in the right direction, does not \nclearly define our commitment to democracy in the region. The \npossibility of miscalculation leading to war cannot be ruled out as the \nBeijing government has refused to renounce the use of force against \nTaiwan.\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\n  With a population of more than 21 million people, Taiwan has much to \ncontribute to the world. Its robust and vibrant economy ranks among the \n20 largest in the world. Taiwan has one of the largest foreign exchange \nreserves of any nation with assets of approximately $100 billion. \nTaiwan has improved its record on human rights and routinely holds free \nand fair elections in a multiparty system. Taiwan has over the years \ndemonstrated its continued support for humanitarian efforts through its \ncontributions and response to international disasters, environmental \ndestruction and famine relief operations. Additionally, Taiwan is a \nmember of the Asian Development Bank and Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation group.\n  In the face of psychological intimidation and outward aggression, the \nTaiwanese people stand firm in their commitment to full democracy. As \nstated by President Lee and Premier Lien, the Taiwanese presidential \nelection will be held as scheduled. The Taipei government has \nrepeatedly and adamantly expressed its pursuit of national \nreunification and strong opposition to Taiwan independence. Taiwan \nwould like nothing more than to strengthen the cross-Taiwan Strait \nrelation and further the security and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific \nregion.\n  It must be made clear and in very specific terms that China's actions \nendanger the peace and security in the region and therefore merit \ncondemnation by all peace-loving countries of the world. I am sure I \nspeak for a number of my colleagues when I urge the Administration to \nmake a more definitive commitment to Taiwan's sovereignty. I ask that \nthe President take every measure necessary to ensure that the pursuit \nof democracy and democratic practices are not fettered by Chinese \nintimidation and aggression.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the Senate \namendment to H. Con. Res. 148, a resolution which expresses strong \nHouse opposition to the Chinese military exercises in the Taiwan \nStrait. The Senate amendment contains the language of S. Con. Res. 43, \nwhich I have cosponsored.\n  The Senate amendment, drafted by the chairman of the East Asia and \nPacific Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Thomas, \nand cosponsored by Senators Dole, Helms, Murkowski, myself and others, \nis similar to the House resolution yet sends an equally strong message \nto China that the United States views the missile tests as a threat to \nTaiwan, contrary to the spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act as well as \nthe three United States-China Joint Communiques.\n  Mr. President, we are all painfully aware of the sensitivity \nportrayed by China to any effort by Taiwan to cultivate relationships \nwith other nations. These actions have been wrongfully perceived to be \nefforts to pursue independence. The Taiwanese Government denies the \nallegations.\n  I am disappointed that China has gone to this extreme to counter what \nit believes is a growing interest in independence among the Taiwanese \npeople. Even though the Democratic Progressive Party, which supports \nindependence, has picked up a few seats in the Taiwan Parliament, it \nappears to be far from a threat in the presidential election of March \n23. The major party, the National Party, has supported future \nunification.\n  While the administration has recently sent elements of the United \nStates 7th Fleet to provide support for Taiwan, these Chinese exercises \nhave been conducted for over 8 months. There has been a very weak \nresponse by the administration until this time. I feel compelled to ask \nthe question of why these exercises occurred in the first place. Why \nhave we let our relationship with China deteriorate to the point where \nmilitary exercises that threaten Taiwan, where sales of nuclear \nmaterials continue, and where many other disputes and differences have \nworsened with China.\n  It should be an important United States foreign policy objective to \nset our relationship with China back on track. The administration must \nplace this as a very high priority before the situation worsens. \nConstant, high-level communication with Chinese leaders may have \nenabled us to avoid these harmful disputes.\n  We must work toward ensuring that, after the March 23 election, both \nChina and Taiwan begin a high-level dialog to decrease tensions and to \nresolve the issue of the future of Taiwan. This must be done in a \npeaceful manner, consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and the Three \nCommuniques.\n  The harm done by the military exercises will not make this an easy \ntask.\n  I urge support for the Senate amendment to the House resolution.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the People's Republic of China has \nconducted a series of missile tests in the last few weeks in a clear \nattempt to intimidate the people of Taiwan as they prepare for the \nfirst direct democratic election of President. These military exercises \nare not in the spirit of the three United States China Joint \nCommuniques and serve as a threat to the peace, security, and stability \nof Taiwan.\n  I join my other colleagues who have cosponsored H. Con. Res. 148 in \ncondemning the recent actions of the Chinese Government. This action \nseverely tests the assumption that was set when we normalized relations \nwith the People's Republic of China in 1979. We did so on the \nexpectation that the future of Taiwan would be settled solely by \npeaceful means. We codified this commitment and understanding in the \nTaiwan Relations Act. In this legislation, we state clearly that \nAmerica believes that peace and stability in the area are in the \npolitical, security and economy interests of the United States. This \nAct also commits the United States to reset any resort to force or \nother coercion that would jeopardize the security of Taiwan's people.\n  I urge the Chinese Government to honor the intent of the Joint \nCommuniques and the Taiwan Relations Act by seeking a peaceful solution \nto this situation through dialog with Taiwan, and by ceasing their \nmilitary actions.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment \nto the resolution, H. Con. Res. 168, condemning the missile tests and \nmilitary exercises being conducted by the Peoples Republic of China \nnear Taiwan.\n  Last week I suggested that China's missile tests and military \nexercises have been dangerous and provocative. Unfortunately, tensions \nbetween China and Taiwan have not subsided. In fact, with Taiwan's \nfirst democratic Presidential election just around the corner, China's \nrhetoric continues loud and unabated.\n  The Clinton administration has gone to great lengths to warn China \nabout the potential consequences of its actions and to underscore \nUnited States policy that the future of Taiwan must be resolved by \npeaceful means. I am pleased the Senate has joined in sending a strong \nsignal to China.\n  With one clear voice, the Senate is now on record deploring the \nmissile tests China has been conducting near Taiwan and recognizing \nthat such tests are a potentially serious threat to peace and stability \nin the region. As I mentioned last week, China's missile tests and \nmilitary exercises are dangerous in and of themselves, and they \nincrease the chances of an accident that could cause tensions to spiral \nout of control.\n  It is important to emphasize that this resolution also supports the \ncommitment of the United States, China, and Taiwan to resolve the \nfuture of Taiwan through peaceful means. United States policy clearly \nstipulates that the future of Taiwan should be determined peacefully. \nTaiwan has made similar overtures. China must also begin conducting \nitself in a way that reaffirms its commitment to that goal.\n  China can do just that by ceasing its attempts to intimidate the \npeople of Taiwan and influence their upcoming Presidential election. \nThis resolution urges China to cease missile tests and military \nexercises and enter into ``meaningful dialog'' with Taiwan. I \ncompletely agree, and it seems to me that Beijing should begin to \ncommunicate with Taiwan in a nonthreatening and peaceful way rather \nthan carrying out reckless missile tests and military exercises.\n  I hope the resolution adopted by the Senate today will encourage \nChina to resolve its differences with Taiwan peacefully.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, this resolution is a thoughtful, appropriate \nresponse to recent developments in the Taiwan Strait. With this \nresolution, the Senate deplores the People's Republic of China's recent \nmissile tests\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\nand military exercises in the Taiwan Strait as an unwarranted and \ndangerous attempt to intimidate Taiwan as it prepares to hold direct \npresidential elections this Saturday. It calls on China to return to \nnegotiations at the highest levels between the two governments, \nnegotiations which have successfully resolved a number of issues in the \npast. The resolution also reiterates our long-standing policy that \nmaintaining peace and stability in the region is in the interest of the \nUnited States and that we expect Taiwan's future to be resolved \npeacefully and in a way that satisfies the Chinese on both sides of the \nTaiwan Strait.\n  As a sponsor of this resolution, I urge all parties involved to move \naway from provocative measures and to find new ways to de-escalate \ntensions. It is incumbent upon all parties to avoid taking steps which \ncould lead unexpectedly, through mistake or miscalculation, to a \nconflict that no one wants. Now is the time for calmer voices to \nprevail and I hope that all governments will listen for them.\n  I think this is a thoughtful and appropriate response, worked in a \nbipartisan way. It is a resolution we can support with pride.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question on agreeing to House Concurrent \nResolution 148, as amended. The yeas and nays are ordered.

I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed as in morning \nbusiness for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join Senator \nSmith, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee of the \nEnvironment and Public Works which deals with Superfund. Let me take a \nmoment to describe our progress and plans for Superfund reform.\n  The Superfund Program is our most troubled environmental statute. No \none could disagree that the Congress should enact Superfund reform this \nyear. No one is happy with the status quo--not industry, not \nenvironmentalists, not insurers, not State and local governments, not \neven the EPA and other Federal agencies.\n  Superfund reform is No. 1 priority of my committee in 1996.\n  Senator Smith introduced S. 1285, the Accelerated Cleanup and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act, last September 29. This reform package \nrepresents a remarkable improvement over the status quo, and it is \ndeserving of widespread support. I am a cosponsor.\n  Since introduction, Senator Smith and I have met with the minority \nmembers of the subcommittee and administration for countless hours to \nexplain the bill, make technical changes, and clarify its intent where \nneeded. We have solicited the views of interested outsiders. As a \nresult of these discussions, we have incorporated numerous changes, \nlarge and small, into the bill.\n  These negotiations, which are still continuing, have been productive, \nand I hope and expect that they will lead to a bill that garners \nwidespread bipartisan support in the Senate, a bill that satisfies the \nPresident's often-stated desire to fix this program, a bill that he can \nand should sign.\n  At this point in our process, as our negotiations move into some of \nthe more difficult issues, Senator Smith and I agreed that it is \nimportant to give members of this body, as well as those outside \nparties interested in Superfund reform, an opportunity to look at, and \ncomment upon, the results of our negotiations to date. The document, a \nstaff draft that will be printed in today's Congressional Record, \nrepresents a snapshot of the current status of our negotiations. In a \nfew moments, Senator Smith will offer more detailed comments on this \nnew draft of the Superfund bill.\n  All sides in our negotiations have justifiably reserved final \njudgment until negotiations are complete and important constituencies \nhave had the chance to analyze and comment on the final product.\n  As we move forward, we want to provide opportunities to receive \nformal comments on the bill. In the next few days we will schedule \nhearings on the bill to occur as soon as possible after the Easter \nrecess. We hope that we can reach substantive agreement on a bipartisan \nbill by that time, or else use the hearings to further explore the \nremaining areas of difference. We plan to move on to a markup and \nprepare the bill for floor action as soon as we can this spring.\n\n  I want to express my appreciation the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Baucus, and the Superfund Subcommittee, Senator \nLautenberg, for their contributions to the process. I also want to \nthank the administration for their efforts in these negotiations.\n  Most of all I would like to thank Senator Smith for the many hours he \nand his staff have devoted to keeping Superfund reform on-track and \nmoving forward. This is no easy task. Superfund is a complex and \ncontroversial program, and progress is always difficult in the best of \ncircumstances, not to mention in a Presidential election year. We have \na very good chance to enact Superfund reform this year, and if we do, a \ngreat deal of the credit should go to Senator Smith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/21/senate-section/article/S2622-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2627-S2628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUPERFUND LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, for working with me to enact a \ncomprehensive Superfund reform measure. As Senator Chafee oulined, on \nSeptember 29, 1995, I introduced S. 1285, the Accelerated Cleanup and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act. This legislation, which was cosponsored \nby Senator Chaffee and nine other members, was an effort to provide \ncomprehensive reform of this troubled program.\n  I would like to thank Senator Chafee, the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee for his strong support in this effort. Over \nthe last year, he and I have worked cooperatively to reform this \nprogram, and it is because of his assistance that I believe that this \nlegislation can be passed this year.\n  As Senator Chafee has mentioned, he and I are here today to continue \nthe process toward making sure that reasonable Superfund reform \nlegislation will reach the floor this Spring. To achieve this goal, our \nrespective staffs have spent more than 150 hours with Democrats on the \nSenate Environment Committee as well as representatives of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Justice Department, and the White \nHouse working toward achieving a bipartisan consensus toward \nreauthorizing the Superfund Program.\n  In a few moments, I will ask to be entered into the Record a copy of \na staff discussion draft outlining changes that Senator Chafee and I \nare willing to\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\nmake to achieve bipartisan consensus on this issue. As Senator Chafee \nstated, this is a snapshot of where we currently are in negotiations.\n  Let me be clear: this draft includes changes that I found to be \nconstructive and reasonable--without compromising the underlying \nprinciples necessary for real Superfund reform. I remain committed to \npassing a strong bill that reduces litigation and accelerates clean up. \nAs Senator Chafee indicated, the committee intends to hold a hearing \nthe week we return from the Easter recess. At that point in time, \ninterested parties will have the opportunity to testify on a final \nproduct that will be used for markup. Additional agreements and \ndisagreements will be worked out in the normal committee process \nthrough amendment.\n  Before I describe some of the details of this proposal, I would like \nto say a few words what this draft is and what it is not. During the \nlast few months our staffs have met with hundreds of individuals who \nare interested in the future of this program, and who have provided us \nwith specific comments about S. 1285. We have carefully weighted these \ncomments, and this staff discussion draft, in part, is intended to \nrespond to some of those concerns.\n  This draft is also intended to address some of the concerns that have \nbeen raised by Governors, the Clinton administration, Senate Democrats, \nas well as other interested parties. While this language represents a \ngood faith effort address some of these concerns, these changes have \nnot been agreed to by any other parties, and we are continuing to \nnegotiate and address concerns that have been raised. Indeed, there are \nareas of this bill, including federal facilities issues, amendments to \nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and natural resource \ndamages, that we have not yet had the opportunity to fully address in \nthese negotiations.\n  Nonetheless, as Senator Chafee has pointed out, we wanted to provide \na window into our ongoing negotiations, and allow interested parties to \nhave the opportunity to comment on these proposed changes. And again, \nit is important for me to stress that a final product will be \nforthcoming. Where we are in agreement, we will agree. Where we are in \ndisagreement, we will agree to disagree, and move on with the process.\n\n  One area I do want to spend some time on this evening is the issue of \nliability reform. As many of my colleagues may know, when we released \nour initial liability reform proposal in September, there were some \nmembers on our side of the aisle who felt that we had limited our \nhorizons too much when we proposed a 50 percent tax credit for pre-1980 \ndisposal activities. Although I was convinced, and continue to believe \nthat our proposal had a great deal of merit, we have nonetheless \ndecided to modify this section to address these concerns.\n  The liability proposal in the staff discussion draft, I believe, will \nprovide significant liability reform, and will vastly diminish the \nscope and nature of ongoing litigation. In particular, our proposal \nwould have the effect of eliminating liability for parties at \nmultiparty disposal sites--those sites where there was an off-site \ngenerator or transporter--for disposal activities that occurred prior \nto December 11, 1980. These sites involve some of the most contentious \nand expensive litigation in the Superfund Program and have only helped \nto slow down the pace of cleanups.\n  This litigation has not helped to address this important \nenvironmental problem, but instead, has hindered the ability to protect \nhuman health and the environment in the shortest time possible. By \nproviding orphan share contribution for these costs, I believe that we \nwill not only significantly reduce the contentious nature of this \nlitigation, but our reforms will allow these sites to be cleaned up \nfaster.\n  Our liability proposal provides that deminimis parties, such as small \nmom and pop businesses, will be eliminated from the liability net if \nthey were responsible for disposing of less than 1 percent of the \nvolume of materials at a site prior to December 11, 1980, or if they \ndisposed less than 200 pounds or 110 gallons of materials at an NPL \nsite. This change will significantly reduce the number of parties at \nthese sites who are needlessly dragged into the quagmire of litigation. \nOur legislation will not only eliminate their liability, but it will \nalso provide for an up-front determination that they are not subject to \nthis damaging and costly litigation process.\n  In addition, this staff discussion draft also provides a 10 percent \ncap on the total amount of liability for those municipalities whose \npotential liability resulted only from generating or transporting \nmunicipal solid waste or sewage sludge. This change, combined with the \norphan share contribution for pre-1980 disposal at multiparty sites, \nwill provide significant relief for cities and towns caught in the \nSuperfund liability net.\n  I would be remiss if I did not discuss changes that we have proposed \nto make in the remedy selection portion of S. 1285. In the legislation \nwe introduced in September, we proposed eliminating the requirements \nunder current law that mandate the use of applicable, relevant, and \nappropriate State and Federal environmental cleanup laws. Both Senator \nChafee and I received a significant number of comments from States \nabout this provision. After a good deal of reflection, we decided to \nprovide that applicable State and Federal cleanup laws can be applied \nto these hazardous waste cleanups.\n  There are a number of other issues that have been raised about the \nremedy selection portion of this legislation, including provisions \nrelated to groundwater cleanup, that we have not modified at this time. \nHowever, I do want to note that these issues are under discussion, and \nthis draft does not represent our final proposal on this section.\n  Mr. President, Senator Chafee and I are here on the floor today to \ndeclare that Superfund reform is alive and well. As Senator Chafee has \nmentioned, he and I are here today to continue the process towards \nmaking sure that significant Superfund reform legislation will reach \nthe floor this Spring. While our colleagues have not heard much from us \nrecently, this does not mean we have not been working hard--we have. \nThis is not to say that we still don't have a ways to go--we do.\n  I believe that the discussions we have been involved in over the last \nfew weeks have been fruitful and have been conducted in good faith. Our \ncolleagues, the President, and all parties involved in this program \nhave frequently stated that they want comprehensive Superfund reform. \nFrankly, given its inadequacies, we simply can not afford to push \nSuperfund reform off for another year. If our colleagues, including \nthose on both sides of the aisle--as well as those in the White House--\ncan keep the rhetoric down, we believe that we can pass a comprehensive \nSuperfund reauthorization bill this year that will ensure faster, safer \nand cheaper cleanups.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/21/senate-section/article/S2627-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2628-S2630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE TAIWAN RESOLUTION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nWyoming, Senator Thomas, for his leadership on the issue of the \nresolution which was just passed by a vote of 97 to 0 in this body. I \nthank him for his cooperative approach to finding a text that all \nparties could agree on. I also express my thanks and admiration to the \nSenator from Louisiana, Senator Johnston, and the Senator from Georgia, \nSenator Nunn, for their understanding of this issue and their efforts \nto craft a responsible resolution.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Murkowski, Helms, Simon, and \nPell, and the distinguished majority leader, and their staffs, for \nworking with all of us in a cooperative spirit on this resolution.\n  Mr. President, in the last 2 weeks we have watched as China has \ntested four missiles in close proximity to Taiwan, and the People's \nLiberation Army has conducted live-ammunition military exercises in the \nTaiwan Strait.\n  These tests and exercises are, obviously, aimed at showing in a \nmilitant fashion China's depth of feeling about the Taiwan issue and, \nmany believe, to influence the Taiwanese election which will take place \nin a 2 short days.\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\n  It is unfortunate, I believe, that China has chosen to express its \ndispleasure through the use of military threats. It is wrong, and the \nUnited States is right to deplore it. The United States has for over 24 \nyears adhered to a One China policy that is based, in part, on the \nunderstanding that China will not seek to resolve its differences with \nTaiwan through other than peaceful means.\n  Our One China policy, of course, is also based on an understanding \nthat Taiwan will not make any efforts to resolve its differences with \nChina unilaterally or through any effort or move toward independence.\n  Clearly, a number of Taiwan's actions over the past several months--\nincluding President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States, \nTaiwanese military exercises concurrent with that visit, and an ongoing \ncampaign for a seat at the United Nations--have called into question \nwhether Taiwan is sincere in its statements that it opposes \nindependence.\n  This resolution, then, sends two messages. It says to the Chinese \nthat their use of military threats against Taiwan is unacceptable and \nrepresents a potential threat to United States interests in the western \nPacific. President Clinton has deployed the USS Independence and the \nUSS Nimitz to the region to monitor events. China must understand that \nthe use of force against Taiwan would have grave consequences.\n  In addition, the resolution says to Taiwan that it must avoid \nprovocative actions that cast doubt on its commitment not to pursue \nindependence and, instead, to work for eventual peaceful reunification. \nTaiwan's security is important to the United States, but the United \nStates will not sanction actions by Taiwan that raise tensions \nunnecessarily.\n  The One China policy is the essential element of the United States-\nChina-Taiwan relationship. This policy has been the acknowledged \nframework that has served all three parties well for some two decades: \nThe United States and China have been able to conduct normal relations \nbefitting two great powers; China has entered into a period of dynamic \neconomic growth; the United States and Taiwan have developed extensive \neconomic and cultural ties; Taiwan has become the single largest \ninvestor in China, with over $20 billion in investments on the \nmainland; and, Taiwan has prospered and moved toward a democracy of \nwhich its people can be rightfully proud.\n  With all of these benefits flowing from the One China policy, and the \nfact that in a poll a week ago in Taiwan only 8 percent of the people \nfavored independence and the overwhelming majority preferred the status \nquo, no one should take any precipitous action which would threaten to \nundermine the One China policy. In the aftermath of the Taiwan \nelection, all three parties must move to restore balance to this \nrelationship by reaffirming the One China policy.\n  China's concern, as relayed to me from its highest leadership, has \nbeen that Taiwan will not say that it endorses a One China policy and \nspeaks with two tongues.\n  Mr. President, I would like to introduce into the Record a directive \nfrom Premier Lien Chan, the number two official of the Republic of \nChina. His directive was made in writing on March 5. It was made public \nby Patrick Tyler, the Beijing reporter for the New York Times. I called \nthe Taiwan office and received a copy of it. It is on two pages.\n  The part that I would like to quote is as follows:\n\n       I reiterate that the Republic of China government is \n     adamant in its pursuit of national reunification and strong \n     opposition to Taiwan independence.\n\n  When I called the Chinese Ambassador and made clear that this had \nbeen presented in writing, he made the point that it is presented in \nEnglish but that it has appeared nowhere in Taiwan in Chinese.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the directive printed in the Record, \nif I may, at this point in my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  A Directive From Premier Lien Chan, The Executive Yuan, Republic of \n                          China, March 5, 1996\n\n       It is the responsibility of the government of the Republic \n     of China to preserve peace and stability in and around the \n     Taiwan Straits in order to ensure public welfare and the \n     security of the nation. Since July 1995, the Chinese \n     communists have conducted several military exercises. Thanks \n     to the unity of our people and proper measures taken by our \n     government, the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Yatsu area has \n     remained stable.\n       Early this morning, the mainland authorities announced \n     plans to launch missiles in waters to the northwest and \n     southwest of Taiwan between March 8 and March 15, 1996. This \n     action clearly is aimed at influencing the ROC's ninth \n     presidential and vice presidential election, destroying the \n     peace in the Taiwan Straits, and endangering regional peace \n     and stability. On behalf of the ROC government, I wish to \n     express the strongest protest, and call upon the mainland \n     authorities to cancel this provocation. We will hold Peking \n     responsible for any unfortunate consequences which arise from \n     this action.\n       Facing this situation, the Executive Yuan has directed the \n     concerned agencies to make the following preparation:\n       (1) The ROC armed forces have been directed by the \n     government to maintain a state of alert, and are prepared to \n     meet all possible actions of the Peking regime. They will \n     continue to monitor military activity on the mainland closely \n     provide instant reports, and take all necessary measures \n     immediately, as the need arises.\n       (2) We have already adopted necessary measures to ensure \n     the safety of our fishermen and normal air and sea \n     transportation in the vicinity.\n       (3) We will continue to maintain law and order, stabilize \n     the financial sector, and maintain normal economic \n     activities.\n       (4) The ROC's ninth presidential and vice presidential \n     election, a historic event to be held on March 23rd, shall be \n     carried out as planned.\n       I reiterate that the ROC government is adamant in its \n     pursuit of national reunification and strong opposition to \n     Taiwan independence. This election is being carried out in \n     accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China, \n     and is in line with the will of the ROC people, and with \n     world trends.\n       The outcome of this election will not affect our position \n     on cross-Straits relations; nor will it alter our \n     government's steadfast pursuit of national reunification.\n       It has also been, and still is, the long-standing policy of \n     the ROC government to strengthen cross-Straits exchange and \n     negotiation while promoting positive interaction. The \n     difference in political systems and ways of life across the \n     Taiwan Straits is the main obstacle to reunification. \n     However, this is not an issue that can be resolved by \n     military means. An atmosphere that is conducive to \n     reunification can be created only by relying on patience, \n     promoting understanding through step-by-step exchange, \n     dissolving hostility, and pursuing a way of life that is most \n     beneficial to the Chinese on both sides of the Straits. \n     Popular will has indicated time and again that it is the \n     common aspiration of the people on both sides to see the end \n     of cross-Straits enmity and promote mutual benefits and \n     prosperity on the basis of peace.\n       The government of the Republic of China has already decided \n     that, in the future, it will foster consensus on a concrete \n     and feasible proposal that will make a historic contribution \n     to the development of cross-Straits peace and to the security \n     and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. The mainland \n     authorities should not unilaterally distort our position and \n     repeatedly take actions that damage the bonds between the \n     people on either side of the Taiwan Straits. This only \n     hampers cross-Straits exchanges and progress toward \n     reunification.\n       I hope that the entire body of ROC citizens will remain \n     calm and rational during this period, and continue to trust \n     and support their government. The government will take \n     appropriate and effective measures, and handle the situation \n     with caution and in a manner that ensures full protection to \n     the welfare of the people.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think it is very important that this \ndirective, which clearly states that it is the policy of the Taiwanese \ngovernment to pursue national reunification and strongly oppose \nindependence, be known by the world.\n  Now there will be a window of opportunity following Saturday's \nelection for resumption of the Cross-Straits Initiative that was \nderailed last summer after Lee Teng-hui's visit. This dialogue, \nconducted by China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan \nStraits and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, offers a unique \nopportunity to begin to meet and discuss the major issues concerning \nreunification.\n  China has for some time offered Taiwan direct air service. As you \nknow, today the plane leaves Taiwan, it appears to land at Macao, it \nchanges its flight number, and it goes on to China. This is not \nnecessary. China is prepared to once again offer, as its Vice Foreign \nMinister told 10 U.S. Senators who were present at a meeting last week, \ndirect sea service and direct postal service.\n  I ardently urge both parties to sit down at the table and begin to \ndiscuss issues around which there is a common\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\ninterest. One has to be a One China policy. The second has to be \npeaceful reunification. The third has to be steps taken to achieve both \nof the foregoing.\n  I think the peace, security, and stability of Asia, and perhaps the \nworld, are at stake in these discussions.\n  I earnestly and sincerely implore the parties, both the People's \nRepublic of China and the Republic of China, to sit down at the table, \nto end these military exercises, and to resolve a peaceful \nreunification for the future.\n  I thank the Chair for your indulgence.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/21/senate-section/article/S2628-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2630-S2641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE NOMINATION OF COMDR. ROBERT STUMPF\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to address the issue \nconcerning the procedures used by the Senate Armed Services Committee \nin evaluating nominations and, in particular, the nomination of Cmdr. \nRobert E. Stumpf.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has received considerable public \ncriticism since the Secretary of the Navy removed Commander Stumpf from \nthe promotion list.\n  The committee, and some of its members, have been the subject of \nnumerous articles in the media relating to both substantive and \nprocedural issues concerning this matter. Much of the material that has \nappeared in the media reports has been inaccurate and incomplete. Some \nof the material has been written by Commander Stumpf's lawyer. Others \nquote either Commander Stumpf, his attorney, or both.\n  To this point, members of the Armed Services Committee have not \nresponded publicly on the substance of the information provided to the \ncommittee by the Navy, nor on the deliberations conducted within the \nexecutive session. This is in accordance with established committee \nrules and procedures, including procedures designed to protect the \nprivacy and reputation of nominees, with appropriate regard for the \nrights of Commander Stumpf.\n  Last Thursday, Senator Thurmond, as the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, on behalf of the committee, placed a statement in \nthe Record which began by reciting the chronology of events concerning \nthe nomination of Commander Stumpf. I do not think there is any doubt \nor debate about the sequence of events. But I want to review those \nevents for the Record.\n  On March 11, 1994, the President submitted various nominations for \npromotion in the Navy to the grade of captain (O-6), including a list \ncontaining the nomination of Commander Stumpf. On the same date, the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense, in the letter required by the committee \non all Navy and Marine Corps nominees, advised the committee that none \nof the officers had been identified as potentially implicated on \nmatters related to Tailhook. After careful review, the list was \nreported favorably to the Senate on May 19, 1994, and all nominations \non the list were confirmed by the Senate on May 24, 1994.\n  Subsequent to the Senate's confirmation of this promotion list, but \nprior to the appointment by the President of Commander Stumpf to the \ngrade of captain, the committee was advised by the Department of \nDefense that the March 11, 1994, letter had been in error because the \nNavy had failed to inform the Office of the Secretary of Defense that \nCommander Stumpf had been identified as potentially implicated in \nTailhook.\n  As a result, on June 30, 1994, the Armed Services Committee requested \nthat the Navy withhold action on the promotion of Commander Stumpf \nuntil the committee had an opportunity to review the information that \nhad not been made available to the Senate during its confirmation \nproceedings. It was entirely appropriate that the committee request the \nwithholding of Commander Stumpf's promotion once it had been notified \nof the Navy's failure to report the potential implication of Commander \nStumpf in Tailhook-related activities.\n  It is also worth noting that the Armed Services Committee has no \ncapacity to investigate nominations on its own. The committee must rely \nsolely on the information provided by the Department of Defense, which, \nin this case, was incomplete.\n  On April 4, 1995, the Navy provided the committee with the report of \ninvestigation and related information concerning Commander Stumpf. And \nI would note this is not all the information related to Commander \nStumpf for his case. The committee is still receiving documents \nrelating to that particular case. And subsequently, the Navy provided \nadditional information in response to requests from the committee. And \nthose requests are ongoing.\n  On October 25, 1995, the committee met in closed session, consistent \nwith its longstanding practice, to consider a number of nominations and \nto further consider the matter involving Commander Stumpf. After due \nconsideration, the committee directed the chairman and ranking member \nto advise the Secretary of the Navy that, and I quote:\n\n       Had the information regarding Commander Stumpf's activities \n     surrounding Tailhook '91 been available to the committee, as \n     required, at the time of the nomination, the committee would \n     not have recommended that the Senate confirm his nomination \n     to the grade of captain.\n\n  The committee also directed that the letter advise the Secretary \nthat, and again I quote from the letter:\n\n       The committee recognizes that, in light of the Senate \n     having earlier given its advice and consent to Commander \n     Stumpf's nomination, the decision to promote him rests solely \n     with the executive branch.\n\n  A draft letter was prepared, reviewed by the Senate legal counsel, \nmade available for review by all members of the committee, and was \ntransmitted to the Secretary on November 13, 1995. On December 22, \n1995, the Secretary of the Navy removed Commander Stumpf's name from \nthe promotion list.\n  The committee met next on March 12, 1996, to review the committee's \nprocedures for considering Navy and Marine Corps nominations in the \naftermath of Tailhook. At that meeting, the committee again reviewed \nthe proceedings concerning Commander Stumpf.\n  I do not think many people outside the committee fully understand the \ncommittee's procedures in handling controversial nominations. Just to \nmake it clear, when the committee is notified by the Department of \nDefense that there is potentially adverse information concerning a \nnominee, that nomination moves to a separate, more deliberate track \nthan those nominations about which there is no adverse information. The \ncommittee staff is required to research the information provided by the \nDepartment of Defense and to brief the members in an executive or \nclosed session. Attendance at these executive sessions is limited to \nMembers of the Senate and committee counsel. These restrictions are \ndesigned to minimize the number of people who may learn of information \nwhich may be very personal, sometimes inflammatory, and may involve \nallegations which have been found to not be substantiated.\n  Following a procedure developed late in the 103d Congress, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Personnel Subcommittee are charged \nwith reviewing those cases prior to an executive session. In the case \nof Commander Stumpf, the committee followed those procedures precisely.\n  The committee met in executive session on October 25, 1995, to \ndiscuss a series of nominations, as I indicated. Seven Tailhook-related \nnominations were considered that day. For the record, those members \npresent voted to favorably recommend two of the seven and to return \nfive of the nominations to the executive branch at the end of the first \nsession. The one remaining Tailhook-related individual discussed during \nthat meeting was Commander Stumpf.\n  On December 22, 1995, as I earlier indicated, Secretary Dalton \nremoved Commander Stumpf from the promotion list. Following that action \nby the Secretary of the Navy, a number of public articles, some written \nby Commander Stumpf's defense team, questioned the committee's \nintegrity, its processes and its judgment. These allegations have been \ncharacterized by misinformation, distortions of the record, and \nmisstatement of the facts.\n  Numerous articles and sources have questioned the committee's \nprocedures related to Tailhook nominations, alleging that the prospect \nof confirmation of service members nominated for promotion but involved \nin Tailhook are ``slim.''\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\n  The records of the committee show that the committee has received 23 \nnominations of service members potentially implicated in Tailhook. Only \neight of those have been rejected by the committee. To put this in \nperspective, the committee has confirmed 43,270 Navy and Marine Corps \nofficers since 1992.\n  A published article says that ``one member of the committee now \nmaintains that there were reasons other than Tailgate for rejecting \nCommander Stumpf.'' There have been other allegations that the \ncommittee had information other than that provided by the Navy. An \narticle in the March 1996 edition of the Armed Forces Journal says that \nCommander Stumpf and Mr. Gittins, Commander Stumpf's attorney, believe \nthere were anonymous phone calls to the committee. These allegations \nimply that the committee based its conclusions concerning Commander \nStumpf on information which was unknown to Commander Stumpf and the \nNavy.\n  While it is true that on occasion the committee does receive \ninformation from outside sources, since the committee does not have the \ncapacity to independently investigate, committee procedures are to \nrefer such information to the Department of Defense. In Commander \nStumpf's case, there was no outside information provided to the \ncommittee. The committee did not consider any material other than that \nprovided by the Navy when it determined that, as the November 13, 1995 \nletter to Secretary Dalton states, ``Had the information regarding \nCommander Stumpf's activities surrounding Tailhook `91 been available \nto the committee as required at the time of the nomination, the \ncommittee would not have recommended that the Senate confirm his \nnomination to the grade of captain.''\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, misrepresentations and misstatement of \nthe facts related to the committee deliberations on this matter have \nput the Armed Services Committee at a severe disadvantage. Our policy \nhas been to protect the confidentiality of the nominee, and we are \nlimited in our ability to respond.\n  Certainly in this case, the nominee, Commander Stumpf, does not share \nour concern. In fact, a Wall Street Journal article dated March 12, \n1996, stated that Commander Stumpf and his attorneys have indicated \nthat the committee should feel free to tell the entire world whatever \nit is that Senators think they know about him. It is noteworthy, Mr. \nPresident, that Commander Stumpf, in a letter to the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee dated March 13, 1996, requested that he be \npermitted to testify before the committee but in a closed hearing, not \nopen to the public or the media.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important that our Senate colleagues \nbe advised that the committee, in reviewing nominations for promotion, \ncarefully examines each individual case and, among other criteria, \nbelieves the standard set forth in title X of the United States Code \npertaining to the responsibilities of a commander entitled \n``Requirement for exemplary conduct'' are applicable, and I quote from \ntitle X:\n\n       All commanding officers and others in authority in the \n     naval service are required to show in themselves a good \n     example of virtue, honor, patriotism, and subordination; to \n     be vigilant in inspecting the conduct of all persons who are \n     placed under their command; to guard against and suppress all \n     dissolute and immoral practices, and to correct, according to \n     the laws and regulations of the Navy, all persons who are \n     guilty of them; and to take all necessary and proper \n     measures, under the laws, regulations, and customs of the \n     naval service to promote and safeguard the morale, the \n     physical well-being, and the general welfare of the officers \n     and enlisted persons under their command or charge.\n\n  This standard, Mr. President, is repeated verbatim in article 1131 of \nthe U.S. Navy Regulations issued in 1990. There are similar provisions \nin title X which pertain to the other services, as well as other \nprovisions relating to members of the armed services.\n\n  The committee does not take lightly these statutory and regulatory \nstandards. Nor do they take lightly their constitutional \nresponsibilities to provide their advice and consent on military \nnominations.\n  A number of articles that have been written have referred to Senator \nNunn's involvement in the committee's deliberations and decisions. \nWhile Senator Nunn has exercised his due diligence in this case, as he \ndoes with every other matter before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I would like to state for the record that as chairman of the \nsubcommittee on personnel of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \ntake responsibility for the procedures used by the subcommittee staff \nto review military nominations and I fully stand by those procedures \nused by the staff in carefully reviewing the nominations presented to \nthe committee by the executive branch, including the procedures used to \nevaluate the nomination of Commander Stumpf.\n  I have reviewed that material in depth. I have personally and \ncarefully evaluated the file on Commander Stumpf. I have discussed the \nmatter at length with the staff and I have concluded that, based \nexclusively--exclusively on the facts presented to the committee by the \nDepartment of Defense with with due regard for the statutory and \nregulatory standards governing the conduct of military commanders and \nofficers, as well as long-established military precedents, that I could \nnot recommend approval of Commander Stumpf's nomination to the \ncommittee.\n  Each member of the committee is, of course, free to accept or reject \nany recommendation, and I certainly respect those who have come to a \ndifferent conclusion in this matter. Each member is free to separately \nevaluate all of the material available to the committee on this \nnomination or any nomination. Each member is, of course, free to debate \nthe case for or against either Commander Stumpf's nomination or any \nother nomination. In the final analysis, of course, each member is free \nto vote yea or nay on any particular case.\n  I am disappointed that so many in the media followed the well-\nintentioned but misinformed lead of those who do not know the facts of \nthe case and the committee's deliberations. The Armed Services \nCommittee is an important part of the institution of the Senate. \nEveryone in this body is hurt when the Senate Armed Services Committee \nis vilified and members cannot respond because of loyalty to rules and \nprocedures put in place to protect the confidentiality of the matters \nbefore it and the nominees before its consideration.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to a time when respect for the privacy \nof an individual and respect for such a great institution as the U.S. \nNavy is not overridden by the desire of a journalist or an attorney or \nany others to take advantage of a situation to forward their own \nagenda.\n  The Secretary of the Navy has removed Commander Stumpf from the \npromotion list. The committee no longer has any nomination before it \npertaining to Commander Stumpf. The committee has no legal authority to \ntake any further action concerning the promotion of Commander Stumpf at \nthis time.\n  As in every case in which a military nominee has been removed from a \npromotion list, the only process by which Commander Stumpf can be \nrenominated for promotion is to be selected by another promotion board \nand be nominated by the President again, or, alternately, directly \nnominated by the President under his authority, granted by article 2 of \nthe Constitution.\n  As I have stated before, the decision of the committee after due \ndeliberation was that, had the information regarding Commander Stumpf's \nactivities surrounding Tailhook '91 been available to the committee as \nrequired at the time of the nomination, the committee would not have \nrecommended that the Senate confirm his nomination to the grade of \ncaptain. That was the committee's determination then. That is the \ncommittee's determination now. Nothing that has transpired since has \naltered the committee's decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the leaders of the \nSubcommittee on Personnel of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nCoats and Senator Byrd, in addressing the review of the military \nnominations in the aftermath of Tailhook, including the nomination of \nCommander Robert Stumpf, U.S. Navy. Senator Coats has\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\naddressed this matter with extreme accuracy in an absolutely factual \npresentation, for which I applaud him, in making that presentation.\n  The review of military nominations, particularly those involving \nadverse information, is a responsibility taken very seriously by the \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee, as the Chair well knows, being \na member of that committee. This is a responsibility that the \nConstitution assigns to the Senate and the Senate has assigned to the \nCommittee on Armed Services, as its, in effect, agent, to make \nrecommendations to the full Senate. Within the committee, the \nresponsibility of making recommendation on military nominations rests \nwith the leadership of the Subcommittee on Personnel.\n  Senator Coats and Senator Byrd, as chairman and ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Personnel, have fulfilled this responsibility with \nskill, dignity, and absolute fairness. They have provided the committee \nwith serious, sober, and balanced recommendations on military \nnominations.\n  When the committee considered the promotion of Commander Stumpf on \nOctober 25, 1995, I listened, as other members did, with care to the \npresentation made by Senator Coats on behalf of himself and Senator \nByrd. I found his assessment to be persuasive and I voted in favor of \nthe recommendation of Senator Coats and Senator Byrd, that Commander \nStumpf not be promoted.\n  The subject of Commander Stumpf's promotion has been the subject of \nsome attention in the Department of the Navy, among those who follow \nNaval aviation, and in the news media. I am pleased to join Senator \nCoats, Senator Byrd, and others, in placing this matter in the proper \nperspective.\n  On March 13, 1996, the Armed Services Committee issued a statement \nconcerning the committee's consideration of the promotion of Commander \nStumpf, U.S. Navy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that statement be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On March 11, 1994, the President submitted various \n     nominations for promotion in the Navy to the grade of Captain \n     (0-6), including a list containing the nomination of \n     Commander Stumpf. On the same date, the Assistant Secretary \n     of Defense, in the letter required by the committee on all \n     Navy and Marines Corps nominees, advised the committee that \n     none of the officers had been identified as potentially \n     implicated on matters related to Tailhook. The list was \n     reported favorably to the Senate on May 19, 1994, and all \n     nominations on the list were confirmed by the Senate on May \n     24, 1994.\n       Subsequent to the Senate's confirmation of the list, but \n     prior to the appointment by the President of Commander Stumpf \n     to the grade of Captain, the committee was advised by the \n     Department of Defense that the March 11, 1994 letter had been \n     in error because the Navy had failed to inform the Office of \n     the Secretary of Defense that Commander Stumpf had been \n     identified as potentially implicated in Tailhook. On June 30, \n     1994, the committee requested that the Navy withhold action \n     on the promotion until the committee had an opportunity to \n     review the information that had not been made available to \n     the Senate during the confirmation proceedings.\n       On April 4, 1995, the Navy provided the Committee with the \n     report of the investigation and related information \n     concerning Commander Stumpf, and subsequently provided \n     additional information in response to requests from the \n     committee. On October 25, 1995, the committee met in closed \n     session--consistent with longstanding practice--to consider a \n     number of nominations and to consider the matter involving \n     Commander Stumpf. The committee directed the Chairman and \n     Ranking Member to advise the Secretary of the Navy that ``had \n     the information regarding Commander Stumpf's activities \n     surrounding Tailhook '91 been available to the committee, as \n     required, at the time of the nomination, the committee would \n     not have recommended that the Senate confirm his nomination \n     to the grade of Captain.'' The committee also directed that \n     the letter advise the Secretary that: ``The committee \n     recognizes that, in light of the Senate having earlier given \n     its advice and consent to Commander Stumpf's nomination, the \n     decision to promote him rests solely with the Executive \n     Branch.'' A draft letter was prepared, made available for \n     review by all members of the committee, and was transmitted \n     to the Secretary on November 13, 1995. On December 22, 1995, \n     the Secretary of the Navy removed Commander Stumpf's name \n     from the promotion list.\n       The committee met on March 12, 1996, to review the \n     committee's procedures for considering Navy and Marine Corps \n     nominations in the aftermath of Tailhook. At that meeting, \n     the committee reviewed the proceedings concerning Commander \n     Stumpf.\n       The committee, in considering the promotion of Commander \n     Stumpf, acted in good faith and in accordance with \n     established rules and procedures, including procedures \n     designed to protect the privacy and reputation of nominees, \n     with appropriate regard for the rights of Commander Stumpf. \n     The Chief of Naval Operations has testified that he believes \n     such confidentiality should be maintained. The committee made \n     its November 13, 1995 recommendation based upon information \n     that was made available by the Navy.\n       At the present time, no nomination concerning Commander \n     Stumpf is pending before the committee, and the Secretary of \n     the Navy has removed his name from the promotion list. The \n     committee has been advised by the Navy's General Counsel that \n     this administrative action taken by the Secretary of the Navy \n     is final and that the Secretary cannot act unilaterally to \n     promote Commander Stumpf.\n       The committee notes that much of the material that has \n     appeared in the media about the substantive and procedural \n     issues concerning this matter, is inaccurate and incomplete.\n       As with any nominee whose name has been removed from a \n     promotion list, Commander Stumpf remains eligible for further \n     nomination by the President. If he is nominated again for \n     promotion to Captain, the committee will give the nomination \n     the same careful consideration it would give any nominee.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe that statement has already been \nalluded to by my friend from Indiana. Commander Stumpf had a \ndistinguished military record, including decorated combat service. That \nrecord was considered strongly by the committee in the review of his \npromotion.\n  The Navy also provided the committee with information, subsequent to \nhis confirmation by the Senate, which raised issues about Commander \nStumpf's qualifications for promotion to a higher grade.\n  As with almost any nomination involving such information, factual \ninformation, reasonable people can disagree on whether the information \nconsidered by the committee disqualified Commander Stumpf for \npromotion. I respect my colleagues, and others, who come to a different \nconclusion than I.\n  The significance of the committee's statement that has just been \nprinted in the Record is that both those who support Commander Stumpf's \npromotion and those who do not support his promotion have agreed that \nthe Armed Services Committee, quoting the committee, ``* * * acted in \ngood faith and in accordance with established rules and procedures, \nincluding procedures designed to protect the privacy and reputation of \nnominees, with appropriate regard for the rights of Commander Stumpf.'' \nThat was a unanimous statement of the Armed Services Committee.\n  In addition, all the members of the committee agreed, ``Much of the \nmaterial that appeared in the media about the substance and procedural \nissues surrounding this matter is inaccurate and incomplete.'' That, \ntoo, was a unanimous opinion of the Armed Services Committee, including \nboth those who favored the Stumpf nomination and those who did not.\n  The inaccurate stories, unfortunately, continue. The March 15 \nWashington Times asserts, for example, that there was, ``* * *. an \neffort to rescind the committee's November 1995 letter,'' recommending \nthat Commander Stumpf not be promoted. That statement in the Washington \nTimes is misleading. I was there for the whole meeting. No such motion \nwas made or voted on. No such motion was ever made or voted on in the \ncommittee.\n\n\nprocedures of the senate armed services committee for the consideration \n                             of nominations\n\n  Mr. President, before addressing issues that have been raised about \nthe Committee's consideration of CDR Stumpf, I would like to summarize \nthe Committee's procedures for handling Navy and Marine Corps \nnominations in the aftermath of Tailhook.\n  The Department of Defense provides the committee with a letter on all \nflag and general officer nominees in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nMarine Corps advising the Committee of any potentially adverse \ninformation since the individual's last confirmation.\n  In 1992, when the committee learned of the serious flaws in the \nNavy's Tailhook investigations, we established a similar requirement \nfor Navy and Marine Corps nominees of all grades--a procedure that was \nsupported by all members of the committee. The\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\nthen-chairman and ranking minority member of the Manpower Subcommittee, \nSenator Glenn and Senator McCain, were instrumental in establishing \nthat process. Had we not done so, it is doubtful we could have moved \nany Navy/Marine Corps nominations through the Senate in view of the \nserious concern in the Senate about the inability of the Navy to \ninvestigate itself and identify those who were involved in misconduct \nor leadership deficiencies.\n  In August 1993, the Department of Defense proposed that the Tailhook \nprocedure be modified in view of the completion of the additional \ninvestigations, and the Committee concurred. Under the modified \nprocedure, DOD notifies the Committee as to whether any nominee was \nidentified as potentially implicated by the Department of Defense \nInspector General or by the Department of the Navy. With respect to any \nindividual so identified, DOD advises us of the status of any \nadministrative or disciplinary action. In April 1995, Senator Thurmond, \nas Chairman, specifically rejected a request from the Department of the \nNavy to change these procedures, noting that decision would have to be \nmade by the Committee.\n  It is the longstanding policy of the committee--under both Republican \nand Democratic chairmen--that when we consider adverse information \nabout a nominee--whether related to Tailhook or any other matter--we do \nso in closed session. Senate Rule 26.5(b)(3) authorizes a closed \nhearing when the matters to be discussed ``will tend to charge an \nindividual with crime or misconduct, to disgrace or injure the \nprofessional standing of an individual, or otherwise to expose an \nindividual to public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly \nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual.''\n  The committee's practice of conducting nomination proceedings \ninvolving adverse information in closed session is based upon concern \nfor the interests of the military officers whose nominations are \npending before the committee. In the overwhelming majority of cases, \nthe adverse information provided to the committee involves minor \ninfractions which have been addressed internally by DOD and which the \ncommittee determines to be not disqualifying.\n  In view of the fact that adverse information about an officer \nconsidered by the committee is determined to be not disqualifying in \nmost cases, few if any officers would want this information to be \nconsidered in a public session. In the relatively few cases where the \nCommittee does not take favorable action, neither the Service nor the \nofficer normally seeks to publicize the adverse information. When the \ncommittee publicly discusses the basis for rejecting a nomination, it \nnormally is in the context of a report on systemic problems.\n\n\n              consideration of the promotion of cdr stumpf\n\n  The committee's traditional procedures for reviewing nominations in \nclosed session, as well as the procedures for considering Navy and \nMarine Corps nominations in the aftermath of Tailhook, were in place \nwhen the committee considered the promotion of Commander Stumpf. As I \nnoted earlier, the members of the committee who supported his promotion \nas well as those who opposed the promotion have agreed the committee \nfollowed the appropriate procedures in addressing this matter, and the \nletter so indicates. That opinion, apparently, is not shared by \nCommander Stumpf's attorney, Mr. Charles Gittins.\n  Although the committee took no steps to publicize its October 25, \n1995 decision to recommend that Commander Stumpf not be promoted, nor \ndid the committee release any of the information that led the committee \nto recommend against his promotion, Commander Stumpf's attorney has \nmade repeated public comments about the committee's consideration of \nCommander Stumpf's promotion.\n  In the December 19, 1995, Washington Times, Commander Stumpf's \nattorney, Mr. Gittins, was quoted as accusing the committee of \noperating on the basis of ``rumor and innuendo.''\n  A CBS Evening News interview on January 8, 1996, quoted Commander \nStumpf's attorney as stating his client was removed from the promotion \nlist as a result of ``blackmail.''\n  In the January 31, 1996, Washington Times, Commander Stumpf's \nattorney was quoted as stating that the decision was a result of \n``political pressure and threats to Navy programs.''\n  In a February 2 op-ed piece in the Washington Times entitled ``Get \nthe Senate Out of the Navy,'' Commander Stumpf's attorney asserted that \nhis client was not promoted as a result of ``political pressure'' and \nthat the Armed Services Committee was acting ``for political \nadvantage.''\n  He concluded: ``Senator McCarthy may be gone, but McCarthyism lives \non in the Senate.''\n  These statements have spawned a host of editorials, columns and \nletters which have painted a picture of this matter which, as noted in \nthe statement issued by the committee on March 13--with unanimous \ncommittee approval--``is inaccurate and incomplete.''\n  For the last 3 months, Commander Stumpf's counsel and advocates have \nargued his case in the public arena, citing only those portions of the \nmaterial favorable to his cause. Material that would have given a \ncomplete picture of the basis for the committee's recommendation has \nnot been released, was not released by Commander Stumpf, was not \nreleased by his attorney, and has not been released by the committee, \nbecause the committee has been restrained by a self-imposed gag order. \nWhy have we not responded? Because we play by the rules, and we do not \nrelease materials from our nomination files without a vote by the \ncommittee.\n  It is interesting to note that those of us who have been under \nattack--and I appreciate very much the statement of the Senator from \nIndiana--those who have been under attack have not leaked anything in \nself-defense or in any other way. Nothing has been leaked on the \ncommittee's side of the issue. So it is an interesting kind of \ncommittee restraint here.\n  Indeed, the committee has shown remarkable restraint. As Members of \nthe Senate know, I believe we should conduct most--not all--most \nnomination proceedings involving adverse information in a closed \nsession. I discussed this matter at length in a speech I delivered on \nthis floor on October 16, 1991, in the aftermath of the proceedings on \nthe nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas, which was in the Judiciary \nCommittee, not our committee.\n  I also believe, however, that when a nominee chooses to place his or \nher version of the facts in the public arena and challenges the motives \nand the good faith of the committee--indeed, statements like \nMcCarthyism, and so forth--the committee must find an appropriate way \nto respond.\n  Although the committee provided a general response on March 13, the \ncommittee decided at that time to not release specific information \nabout Commander Stumpf. There is no nomination now pending before the \ncommittee. The committee deferred to the views of the Chief of Naval \nOperations, Admiral Boorda, who testified in a public hearing on March \n12 when I asked him a question, that they did not favor public \ndissemination of nomination information in this case. That is the view \nof the Chief of Naval Operations.\n  While I do not concur in that view because of the unique \ncircumstances of this matter being handled, in effect, in a public \nrelations matter in the public arena, since it results in a one-sided \npublic presentation of information, I understand and respect those who \nbelieve we should not release any information when this matter is no \nlonger pending before the committee. I deferred to that view in \ncommittee, because it was, obviously, the view of the majority.\n  The committee has agreed, however, that it is appropriate for \nSenators to identify the areas in which the statements in the media are \ninaccurate and incomplete.\n\n\n    Consideration of Commander Stumpf's Nomination in Closed Session\n\n  Commander Stumpf's attorney, in the December 19, 1995, Washington \nTimes, is quoted as criticizing action of the Armed Services Committee \nbecause the committee has ``operated behind closed doors'' when \nconsidering his client's case.\n  As I noted earlier, the committee considers adverse information in \nclosed session. We do that all the time. That\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nis our normal operating procedure, and that is done in order to protect \nthe reputation of nominees, a process that is strongly supported by the \nU.S. military. As far as I know, all branches of the military support \nthat procedure, as well as the civilian leadership of the Department of \nDefense.\n  Prior to the committee's October 25, 1995, decision to recommend \nCommander Stumpf not be promoted, the committee received no letter from \nhis attorney requesting that we proceed on this nomination in open \nsession. We received no such letter, no such information, no such \nrequest, according to all the information I have received, checking \nwith both majority staff and minority staff.\n  Commander Stumpf's attorney apparently made a tactical decision not \nto request an appearance or an open session. Having made that decision, \nhow can he now fault the committee for reviewing the promotion in \nclosed session in accordance with longstanding committee procedure, \nwhich we do on all nominations that have adverse information of a \npersonal nature.\n  It is not clear Commander Stumpf's attorney wants this matter to be \nconsidered in public. The March 12 Wall Street Journal reported, \n``Commander Stumpf and his attorney say that the committee should feel \nfree to tell the whole world whatever it is the Senators think they \nknow about him.''\n  That was a story for public consumption. That was a PR story. Yet, on \nMarch 13, 1996, as the committee was completing our review of Tailhook \nmatters, the committee received a letter from Commander Stumpf faxed \nfrom his attorney's law firm, I am told, in which he asked to meet with \nthe committee ``in closed session.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Commander \nStumpf, as well as Chairman Thurmond's response, be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I note that the letter I just referred to \nfrom Commander Stumpf faxed to us on March 13, 1996, was dated February \n13, even though it was faxed to us on March 13. I have to assume that \nwas a typographical error, unless there is another explanation. I am \ninformed by the majority staff that the committee did not receive such \na request until March 13 and certainly did not receive that prior to \nour review of Commander Stumpf's promotion in 1995.\n\n  Mr. President, just in case anyone does not understand what it means \nto hold a closed session, let me make it clear. It is a proceeding in \nwhich the public is excluded. The press is excluded. Virtually all \nstaff are excluded. The hearing record is not published. Under the \nSenate rules, Senators are specifically prohibited from disclosing \ninformation received in a closed session. When we hold a closed \nsession, the committee is not free to tell the whole world what \ntranspired before the committee.\n  In light of Admiral Boorda's request that the information regarding \nCommander Stumpf not be released to the public, and in view of \nCommander Stumpf's request to proceed in closed session, the committee \ndecided during its deliberations last week to not release materials \nfrom the nomination files. While I personally believe the materials \nshould have been released in light of the decision by Commander \nStumpf's attorney to selectively release information to the public, I \nrespected the views of others--and still do--who felt the material \nshould not be released at that time.\n  Having decided on March 13 not to release the material in deference \nto the Navy and Commander Stumpf's privacy interests, the committee now \nfinds itself subjected to yet another misleading story as a result of a \nstatement in the press attributed to Commander Stumpf's attorney.\n  A March 19, 1996, AP wire story states that he ``has no objection'' \nif the committee releases its material on Commander Stumpf. According \nto the story, Commander Stumpf's attorney said, ``I've told them they \ncan release anything they want.''\n  Mr. President, I have received no such communication from Commander \nStumpf's attorney. I have been informed again by majority staff that \nSenator Thurmond, the chairman of the committee, has received no such \ncommunication. I assume Senator Coats and Senator Byrd have received no \nsuch communication, and they are indicating that is accurate.\n  I have no idea with whom the attorney, Mr. Gittins, is communicating, \nbut it is not the Senate Armed Services Committee. Mr. President, if \nthese press accounts accurately quote Commander Stumpf's lawyer--and I \nalways allow that the press reports could be inaccurate--it would \nappear that the rules of the Senate and the committee designed to \nprotect the privacy of nominees are being manipulated to imply a \nwillingness to support and release information when, in fact, no such \nwillingness has been communicated to the committee nor, as far as I \nknow, to the Navy. I do not know what has been communicated to the \nNavy, but I certainly have not had any indication that Commander \nStumpf's attorney has said to the Navy, ``Please release the \ninformation,'' or, ``You have our permission to release all the \ninformation.''\n  First, counsel is quoted as criticizing the committee for having \nclosed sessions; then the press reports that the officer whose privacy \nis being protected by the committee wants everything made public. Then \nthe Chief of Naval Operations, who supports the promotion and said so \nin the committee, says the material should not be made public. \nSubsequently, the officer requests a closed session. After the \ncommittee issues a statement reaffirming its commitment to the \nofficer's privacy interests, his counsel is quoted as saying he told \nthe committee again, ``They can release anything they want,'' even \nthough no such communication had been received by the committee.\n  If Commander Stumpf's attorney wants all the information related to \nhis client released to the press, he should clearly communicate his \nviews to the committee and the Navy. I suggest a letter would be the \nnormal way to communicate. The Navy has full authority to release all \ndocuments related to Commander Stumpf, including the investigation into \nmatters relating to Tailhook, the recommendations of the chain of \ncommand, and the final action taken on that investigation by the Navy. \nAll of that can be released, and then the Senate can decide whether the \ncommittee was correct or not. The news media can then make their \njudgment accordingly.\n\n\n                       procedural considerations\n\n  In the December 19, 1995, Washington Times, Commander Stumpf's \nattorney is quoted as stating the committee denied his client the \nopportunity ``to face his accusers, cross-examine them and test the so-\ncalled evidence that the committee had collected.''\n  The March 1996 Armed Forces Journal International reported that \n``Stumpf and Gittins asked to speak to the Senators on the committee, \noffered to testify, and attempted to discover what new evidence the \ncommittee had uncovered. All requests were refused.''\n  Mr. President, I am informed again by majority staff that the \ncommittee received no letter from Commander Stumpf's counsel, prior to \nthe committee action on October 25, 1995, requesting his client be \nallowed to testify before the committee, nor did counsel for Commander \nStumpf submit a request to discover additional information.\n  The materials provided by the Navy make it clear that CDR Stumpf was \nwell aware that the matter of his promotion was pending before the \nCommittee. On June 30, 1995, he received the statutorily required \nnotice from the Navy that his promotion was being delayed, and he was \nspecifically notified that his involvement in Tailhook was under review \nby the Armed Services Committee.\n  The majority staff has advised me that the committee received one \nletter from CDR Stumpf's counsel, dated August 2, 1995, prior to \ncompletion of our review on October 25, 1995. That letter provided \ncounsel's view of CDR Stumpf's military record and the proceedings \ninvolving his client in the aftermath of Tailhook. The only specific \nrequest of Chairman Thurmond set forth in the letter was to ``end the \ndelay in the SASC review.'' CDR Stumpf's attorney noted that he was \navailable for discussions, but did not make any specific request \nregarding testimony by his client or discovery of evidence:\n\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\n\n       Should you or your staff have any questions, please do not \n     hesitate to call. Further, I would be pleased to review with \n     you or a member of your staff the facts as they were \n     established at the Court of Inquiry.\n\n  From the Committee's perspective, this did not constitute a request \nthat his client be permitted to testify at a Committee hearing, nor did \nit constitute a request for further information about the materials \nunder review by the Committee.\n  CDR Stumpf's counsel apparently chose to proceed without submitting a \nspecific request for a hearing, without submitting a specific request \nthat his client be permitted to testify, and without submitting a \nspecific request for further details about information available to the \nCommittee. If discussions with individual members or staff raised any \nquestions about the Committee's willingness to entertain such requests, \nhe had the opportunity to provide an unambiguous request in writing. He \ndid not do so. Whether his tactical decisions at the time were in the \nbest interests of his client is not a matter for the Committee to \njudge.\n  Each one of those matters, if clearly communicated to the Committee, \nwould have been given appropriate consideration. It is well known that \nnomination proceedings are not criminal trials. They are not formal \nevidentiary proceedings. They are designed to assess the fitness of a \nnominee for higher office. If counsel for a nominee believes that the \ninformality of a nomination proceeding is inappropriate in his client's \ncase, then it is his responsibility to bring his concerns to the \nattention of the Committee. If he does not do so, it is puzzling for \nhim to now claim that his client was denied rights that he did not \nrequest when the matter was pending before the Committee.\n\n\n              reliance on information provided by the navy\n\n  Commander Stumpf's attorney is quoted in the December 19, 1995, \nWashington Times as stating that the committee's decision to recommend \nthat he not be promoted was based on ``rumor and innuendo and anonymous \nphone calls.''\n  As the Senator from Indiana said very clearly, that is flat wrong. \nThe committee's recommendation was based on the records of the fact-\nfinding board that reviewed Commander Stumpf's activities relating to \nTailhook--the Navy fact-finding board--as well as other documents \nofficially transmitted to the committee by the Navy.\n  I am informed by the Navy that Commander Stumpf had full opportunity \nat the fact-finding board to testify, to present evidence, and to \ncross-examine witnesses.\n  Mr. President, that is the record that we have been primarily \nfocusing on. The Navy has advised the committee that it has provided \nall of these materials to Commander Stumpf, so he knows what these \nmaterials are. The committee did not rely on rumors. The committee did \nnot rely on innuendo. The committee certainly did not rely on anonymous \nphone calls.\n  An ``Op-ed'' piece by CDR Stump's attorney in the February 2, 1996 \nWashington Times states that the Senate relies on ``largely false and \ndiscredited allegations of misconduct collected by the Pentagon \ninspector general . . . to make their decisions on Navy promotion \nnominations.'' That is an inaccurate and incomplete description of the \nCommittee's procedures for reviewing Navy and Marine Corps nominations \nin the aftermath of Tailhook. After the Navy turned the Tailhook matter \nover to the DoD Inspector General, the IG conducted an investigation. \nThe results of the investigation were returned by the IG to the Navy \nfor further proceedings, including administrative or disciplinary \nproceedings where appropriate. DoD/IG materials do not provide the \nprimary source of information used by the Committee. In virtually all \ncases, including the case of CDR Stumpf, the Committee has relied \nprimarily on material from the proceedings conducted by the Navy after \nthe DoD/IG investigation, as well as related documents provided by the \nNavy.\n  It is noteworthy, however, that in at least one well known, contested \nnomination, many Senators placed significant reliance on information \ndeveloped by the DoD Inspector General, rather than in a Navy \nproceeding. That was the nomination of Admiral Kelso to retire in \ngrade, in which the military judge in a Tailhook court-martial, Captain \nWilliam T. Vest, Jr., opined that Admiral Kelso observed misconduct at \nTailhook, whereas the DoD Inspector General, who reviewed the judge's \nopinion in light of the IG's investigations, concluded that Admiral \nKelso did not observe the misconduct. As one who fought hard on the \nSenate floor for ADM Kelso's confirmation, I do not believe that Navy \nand Marine Corps nominees would want the Committee to preclude \nconsideration of such material from the DoD/IG.\n  Commander Stumpf's attorney, in a February 2, 1996, op-ed article, \nattempted to analogize his client's case to that of Adm. Joseph \nPrueher. According to Commander Stumpf's attorney in this February 2, \n1996, op-ed piece in the Washington Times, ``Just last Friday, the \nSenate failed to vote to confirm Adm. Joseph Prueher as Commander, U.S. \nPacific Command. The reason? A few Senators, bowing to feminist \npressure, decided to revisit, for the third time, Admiral Prueher's \nhandling of a sexual harassment case while superintendent of the U.S. \nNaval Academy.''\n  Mr. President, I am sure that the Navy, as well as Admiral Prueher, \nwere just as surprised as I was to learn on February 2 from Commander \nStumpf's attorney that Admiral Prueher's confirmation had not gone \nthrough. The Senate received Admiral Prueher's nomination on Wednesday, \nJanuary 10; the Armed Services Committee reported him out of committee \non Friday, January 26; and the Senate unanimously confirmed him on \nTuesday, January 30, 2 days before the op-ed piece appeared in the \nWashington Times. The date of the admiral's confirmation, January 30, \nwas the first day the Senate was in session after the nomination was \nreported out of committee. That is prompt action by any standard.\n  Moreover, the date of Admiral Prueher's confirmation by the Senate, \nJanuary 30, was 2 days before Commander Stumpf's attorney wrote in the \nWashington Times that the Senate was ``bowing to feminist pressure.''\n  In the same article, Commander Stumpf's attorney stated: ``The Senate \nnow fancies itself as a super selection board, reviewing de novo \nexecutive branch promotion decisions for political advantage.'' That \nopinion has been echoed by others, such as the statement in the March \n1996 Armed Forces Journal International that ``Cmdr. Stumpf is being \nsacrificed on the altar of political correctness''.\n  As I noted earlier in my statement, Senator Coats and Senator Byrd, \nas leaders of the Personnel Subcommittee, have the unenviable task of \ntaking the lead in reviewing nominations involving adverse information. \nI have been chairman of the Manpower Subcommittee. That is the first \nsubcommittee I headed after I became a member of the committee. I know \nhow hard that job is. It is one of the most important jobs, one of the \nmost difficult jobs. I think we owe both Senator Coats and Senator Byrd \na great deal of gratitude for the work they do. They have given the \ncommittee a serious, sober recommendation in each case based on the \nmerits.\n\n  I do not believe that anyone can seriously argue that they or the \ncommittee have gained any political advantage by taking on this \nresponsibility. If there is any political advantage attached to it, \nthen someone is going to have to explain it to me. After being in the \nSenate for 24 years, I cannot think of anything that has less political \nadvantage to it than this tough, hard, but absolutely essential job.\n  This is not something that the Senate grabbed. This is something that \nthe Constitution of the United States gives to the Senate, a \nresponsibility. We are doing our constitutional duty. If anyone does \nnot think the Senate ought to be involved--``get the Senate out of the \nNavy''--then they ought to change the Constitution of the United \nStates. This is our duty. It is our duty. As long as I am on the \ncommittee, I, for one, will continue to exercise that duty.\n  Mr. President, the committee has a keen appreciation for the values \nthat differentiate military service from civilian society, the \nrequirements of good order and discipline in the armed forces, and the \nstandards of responsibility and accountability applicable to military \ncommanders--including\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\ntheir responsibility and accountability for the morale and welfare of \ntheir troops.\n  The committee also has a clear understanding that a promotion is not \na reward for past service; it is a judgment on the fitness of an \nofficer for higher levels of command and responsibility.\n  Mr. President, it has been the traditional practice of the Committee \non Armed Services to look primarily to the statutes, regulation, and \ntime-honored customs of military service in assessing adverse \ninformation on a nominee.\n  One of those standards is the affirmative obligation of commanding \nofficers, under section 5947 of title 10, United States Code, to \ndemonstrate ``a good example of virtue, * * * to be vigilant in \ninspecting the conduct of all persons who are placed under their \ncommand; to guard against and suppress all dissolute and immoral \npractices; * * * and to take all necessary and proper measures, under \nthe laws, regulations, and customs of the naval service, to promote and \nsafeguard the morale, the physical well-being, and general welfare of \nthe officers * * * under their command or charge.''\n  Article 0802.1 of the Navy regulations makes it clear that commanding \nofficers operate under a higher standard of responsibility, and that \nthey are not relieved of that responsibility simply because they are \nnot present during misconduct or a mishap:\n\n       The responsibility of the commanding officer for his or her \n     command is absolute, except when, and to the extent to which, \n     he or she has been relieved therefrom by competent authority \n     or as provided in these regulations. The authority of the \n     commanding officer is commensurate with his or her \n     responsibility. While the commanding officer may, at his or \n     her discretion, and when not contrary to regulations, \n     delegate authority to subordinates for the execution of \n     details, such delegation of authority shall in no way relieve \n     the commanding officer of continued responsibility for the \n     safety, well-being and efficiency of the entire command.\n\n  Article 0802.4 of the Navy Regulations places a special \nresponsibility on commanding officers with respect to their conduct and \nthe conduct of their subordinates:\n\n       The commanding officer and his or her subordinates shall \n     exercise leadership through personal example, moral \n     responsibility and judicious attention to the welfare of \n     persons under their control or supervision. Such leadership \n     shall be exercised in order to achieve a positive, dominant \n     influence on the performance of persons in the Department of \n     the Navy.\n\n  Mr. President, these are not post-Tailhook standards. These are not \n``politically correct'' rules of the nineties foisted on the Navy by \n``feminist pressure.'' Those standards were in effect at the time of \nTailhook and reflect bedrock principles of good order and discipline.\n  The committee also looks to the standards in section 654(a) of title \n10, United States Code, which states:\n\n       (8) Military life is fundamentally different from civilian \n     life in that--\n       (A) the extraordinarily responsibilities of the armed \n     forces, the unique conditions of military service, and the \n     critical role of unit cohesion, require that the military \n     community, while subject to civilian control, exist as a \n     specialized society; and\n       (B) the military society is characterized by its own laws, \n     rules, customs, and traditions, including numerous \n     restrictions on personal behavior, that would not be \n     acceptable in civilian society.\n       (9) The standards of conduct for members of the armed \n     forces regulate a member's life for 24 hours each day \n     commencing upon entry on active duty and not ending until \n     that person is discharged or otherwise separated from the \n     armed forces.\n       (10) Those standards of conduct, including the Uniform Code \n     of Military Justice, apply to a member of the armed forces at \n     all times that the member has a military status, whether the \n     member is on base or off base, and whether the member is on \n     duty or off duty.\n\n  Those findings reflect some of the most fundamental, enduring values \nof military service.\n  Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee has reviewed Navy and \nMarine Corps nominations in the aftermath of Tailhook, including CDR \nStump's promotion, in the context of these well-known military \nstandards. In light of these standards, it would have been \nirresponsible for the Committee to ignore adverse information related \nto a nominee's conduct or leadership at Tailhook 91, set forth in \ninformation provided to the Committee by the Department of Defense--\nparticularly in view of the military significance of that event.\n  Tailhook 1991 was designed and promoted to showcase the aviation \ncomponents of the Department of the Navy. The Navy actively encouraged \nmembers to attend to enhance their professional military development.\n  The Navy provided significant financial, logistical, and personnel \nsupport--including featured presentations by the Secretary of the Navy, \nthe Chief of Naval Operations, the Assistant Chief of Staff (Air \nWarfare), and numerous other Navy and Marine Corps officers and \ncivilian officials. Many military personnel traveled under government \norders, which paid for their transportation, food, and lodging. Over \n1,700 were transported at government expense,\n  Tailhook 1991 was a showcase event where all officers, particularly \nthose in command, were under an obligation to ensure that their \nconduct, and that of their subordinates would represent the very best \nin the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. The failure of some to \ndemonstrate appropriate standards of conduct and leadership is an \nappropriate consideration in assessing an officer's fitness for \npromotion.\n  Mr. President, I also reject any suggestion that the committee acted \nout of political motivation or as a result of outside pressures.\n  Mr. President, I personally talked to every Secretary of the Navy \nsince Tailhook came up and every Chief of Naval Operations since \nTailhook came up. I have cautioned them against overreacting. I have \ncautioned them against denial of due process for individuals accused of \ninappropriate behavior. I have cautioned them against unlawful command \ninfluence. I have done that personally. I have felt it was my \nresponsibility to counsel the Navy not to overreact and to give to \ntheir own members the kind of due process that they deserve.\n  During my tenure as chairman I assured every civilian and military \nleader of the Department of Defense and the Department of the Navy \ninvolved in nominations that the committee would carefully consider \neach nomination on the merits, and that they should not hesitate to \nrecommend promotion in any case where the Navy deemed it appropriate.\n  The committee has ensured that when the Navy recommends promotion in \na case involving a Tailhook certification, we are provided with the \nNavy's official information, not rumor, innuendo, or anonymous \ninformation.\n  When the committee has received information from the Navy bearing on \nan individual's conduct or leadership at Tailhook, we have considered \nit carefully and judiciously on a case-by-case basis.\n  Let us look at the facts. Since Tailhook, the committee has approved \n36,839 Navy nominations, 6,431 Marine nominations, a total of 43,270 \nnominations in the Navy and Marine Corps since Tailhook. During that \nperiod, how many have we not recommended because of Tailhook matters? A \ntotal of 8; 8, a total of 8. You would not think that from some of the \nhysteria going on in some of the news coverage, particularly editorials \nthat I have seen.\n  Let me repeat, the committee has approved 43,270 Navy and Marine \nCorps nominations and turned down only 8 since Tailhook came up. During \nthe same period, 15 officers who were the subject of administrative \naction by the Navy as a result of Tailhook have been confirmed by the \nSenate. These figures clearly demonstrate that the committee has \nreviewed each of these nominations involving a Tailhook certification \non the merits.\n  While reasonable people could come to different conclusions on those \nwho were recommended, as well as those who were disapproved, the fact \nis, we have not indiscriminately rejected anyone who had been \ninvestigated in connection with Tailhook. I have personally taken the \nfloor of the Senate to try to get nominations through and have \nsucceeded virtually in every case, with the help of the committee and \nthe good judgment of the Senate, that were bitterly opposed here on the \nfloor relating the Tailhook.\n  I think people ought to have a little knowledge of history. I do not \nexpect people to understand everything that has been done, but there \nought to be some slight knowledge and acknowledgement of the history of \nhow we handled this whole matter of Tailhook.\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\n  Someone ought to recall also the Secretary of the Navy decided that \nthe Navy botched this investigation so badly that he himself, back in \n1992, in a previous administration, removed the Navy from the \ninvestigative responsibilities because it had been so badly botched.\n  It is also important to contrast the Senate's action with the results \nof action taken within the executive branch. As a result of the actions \ntaken by the Navy and Marine Corps, 39 officers have had their careers \nadversely affected. Twelve officers were rejected by promotion boards, \nanother 12 who were selected by a board subsequently were removed from \na promotion list within the executive branch, and another 15 officers \nresigned or retired before being considered for promotion after \nreceiving adverse administrative action by the Navy. In other words, \nthe number of officers whose careers have been adversely affected by \nthe Navy outnumbers the officers returned by the Senate by a ratio of \nmore than 4 to 1.\n  Mr. President, this Committee has a strong record of support for \nmilitary nominations, even in the face of considerable criticism. We \nhave been willing to take the political heat. We did it in the case of \nAdmiral Kelso. We did it in the case of Admiral Mauz. We did it in the \ncase of Admiral Prueher. We have done it in the case of 15 nominees who \nwere confirmed even though administrative action had been taken against \nthem as a result of Tailhook. There was no political advantage in our \naction, but we did it because it was the right thing to do.\n\n\n               oversight, leadership, and responsibility\n\n  Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee has a vital oversight \nrole over the Armed Forces, including matters involving nomination and \npromotions. The Navy failed to provide the Armed Services Committee \nwith the information required to assess Commander Stumpf's fitness for \npromotion prior to the Senate's vote on his nomination. It was \nincumbent on this committee to conduct a review of that promotion when \ninformation was belatedly turned over to the committee.\n  I am informed by majority staff that, prior to the Committee's \nOctober 25, 1995, decision to recommend that Commander Stumpf not be \npromoted, his attorney did not raise a legal objection to the propriety \nof the committee's review. Although the obvious outcome of any such \nreview would be a communication to the Secretary of the Navy regarding \nthe merits of Commander Stumpf's promotion, counsel did not raise a \nlegal objection to any communication from the committee to the \nSecretary. Counsel for Commander Stumpf was well aware of the \ncommittee's review of his client's promotion, as reflected in his \nAugust 2, 1995, letter to Senator Thurmond discussing the review and \nthe action taken by the Secretary of the Navy to delay Commander \nStumpf's promotion. The letter vigorously supported the merits of his \nclient's promotion and requested that the committee complete its \nreview. The letter, however, did not state any legal objection to the \ncommittee's review, the action of Secretary Dalton in delaying the \npromotion, or to any communication from the committee to the Secretary \non the merits of the promotion.\n  As I noted earlier, the committee's letter of November 13, 1995, \nspecifically advised the Secretary of the Navy that:\n\n       The committee recognizes that, in light of the Senate \n     having given its advice and consent to Commander Stumpf's \n     nomination, the decision to promote him or not to promote him \n     rests solely within the executive branch.\n\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. We made it very clear that ``the \ndecision to promote him or not to promote him rests solely within the \nexecutive branch.'' Mr. President, those were not idle words. We fully \nrecognized that the Secretary of the Navy--acting under a delegation of \nauthority from the President--has unfettered discretion under section \n629 of title 10, United States Code, to remove or not remove the name \nof an officer from a selection board list.\n  On December 22, 1995, Secretary Dalton directed that Commander \nStumpf's name be removed from the promotion list.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make my own position clear.\n  These are tough decisions. I do not quarrel with anyone who comes to \na different conclusion. They involve subjective judgment. Different \npeople draw the line between right and wrong in different places. Based \nupon the information available at the time, we made our decision. I \nmade my judgment about right and wrong, and I made my judgment about \nthe question of leadership. That judgment was based on the \nrecommendation, the very thoughtful recommendation, of Senator Coats \nand Senator Byrd.\n\n  Others may have a different definition of right and wrong. Others may \nhave a different definition of leadership. They have every right to \ntheir perspective. All of us have some obligation to strive for \nconsistency in drawing the line, consistency between officers who may \nhave been involved in similar circumstances. To draw one line for \nofficers in the Navy and another line for officers in the Marine Corps \nrelating to the same event, to me, is totally unacceptable.\n  The promotion process must ensure that all officers meet the high \nstandards of conduct and leadership that demonstrate potential for \nleadership at a higher grade. This is appropriate not just for the \nNavy, but for the Army, Air Force, and for the Marine Corps. Does the \nNavy now want to set a standard for leadership lower than the Marines? \nDoes the Navy want to set a standard of leadership lower than the Army? \nDoes the Navy want to set a standard of leadership lower than the \nUnited States Air Force? That is a question that the Navy leadership \nhas to answer.\n  Mr. President, if the Navy's withholding of information prior to the \nSenate's confirmation of Commander Stumpf was the result of \nadministrative error, then the Navy's administrative process needs \nreview and overhaul. These administrative errors deprived Secretary \nPerry, the Secretary of Defense, of the information he needed to make \nhis recommendations to the U.S. Senate and to the President. These \nadministrative errors deprived the Armed Services Committee of the \ninformation that we needed to make a recommendation to the Senate. \nThese administrative errors deprived the Senate of the information it \nneeded prior to deciding whether Commander Stumpf should have been \nconfirmed.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I make the following points: First, my \nreview of the material provided to the committee by the Navy, including \nthe record of the conduct, review, and disposition of the proceedings \nof the factfinding board confirms my assessment that Senator Coats' \nrecommendation to the committee was sound, and that the committee's \nOctober 25, 1995, recommendation that Commander Stumpf not be promoted \nwas appropriate.\n  Second, it was appropriate to the committee to communicate its \nrecommendation to the Secretary of the Navy, particularly in light of \nthe Navy's failure to provide the committee with the information it had \npledged to provide prior to the committee's recommendation to the \nSenate that Commander Stumpf be confirmed.\n  Third, it was appropriate for the committee to remind Secretary \nDalton that he had unfettered direct discretion to promote or not \npromote Commander Stumpf, which we did in the letter. If Secretary \nDalton believed in December that Commander Stumpf's promotion was \nwarranted, he could have promoted him at that time. The letter made \nthat absolutely clear.\n  Fourth, the executive branch has an obligation to conduct a thorough \nreview of adverse information with respect to all nominations, \nincluding but not limited to Tailhook. In terms of the issues of \nconduct and leadership bearing on the individual's fitness for \npromotion, the question in Commander Stumpf's case, for example, was \nnot whether he was guilty of a crime, but whether he met the standards \nof leadership that would qualify him for a promotion to a higher grade.\n  Fifth, the executive branch must strive for consistency in its \napproach to military nominations, and consistency is essential for \nfairness. Although each proposed nomination must be judged on its own \nmerits and its own facts, it is critical that careful attention be paid \nto issues of consistent treatment, particularly when adverse \ninformation is related to a single event such as Tailhook. The Navy \nleadership\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\nhas effectively forced 39 officers to retire or resign or has removed \ntheir names from promotion lists for Tailhook-related matters. The \ncommittee has a very difficult time justifying favorable action on \nother nominees whose conduct or leadership deficiencies appear to be \nworse than those who were not nominated or who were forced to retire or \nresign by the United States Navy.\n\n  Sixth, the Navy should determine whether Commander Stumpf's attorney \nis serious about the public release of information concerning his \nclient. If so, the Navy should not be selective in the release of \ninformation. The Navy should make available a complete record of \nproceedings concerning Commander Stumpf in the aftermath of Tailhook, \nincluding the full record of proceedings, review, recommendations, and \naction on the fact-finding board. If they do, there will be no mystery \nanymore and everybody can make their own considered judgment.\n  Seventh, after learning that the Navy had failed to provide the \ncommittee with information about Commander Stumpf, prior to the \ncommittee's action on his nomination, the committee requested the Navy \nto provide ``a complete description of the conduct, review and \ndisposition of the allegations concerning Commander Stumpf''. The Navy \nprovided information to the committee in response to this request. \nSubsequent to the committee's October 25, 1995, meeting on Commander \nStumpf's nomination, the Navy has provided the committee with \nadditional information, including information on the review and \ndisposition of the allegations concerning Commander Stumpf, which we \nasked for to begin with. The Navy needs to explain why, after failing \nto provide the commitee with timely information prior to the \nconfirmation of Commander Stumpf by the Senate, the Navy subsequently \ndid not provide the committee with complete information on the review \nand disposition of the allegations.\n  Finally, Mr. President, and what I number as eighth, section 629 of \ntitle 10, United States Code, provides that ``An officer whose name is \nremoved from a list continues to be eligible for consideration of \npromotion''. As noted in the statement issued by the committee on March \n13 with respect to Commander Stumpf, quoting from the letter, ``If he \nis nominated again for promotion to captain, the committee will give \nthe nomination the same careful consideration it would give to any \nnominee''.\n  I certainly concur in that. For my part, I would carefully consider \nany information that might be presented by Commander Stumpf or on his \nbehalf. I would consider the full record of information provided by the \nexecutive branch, and I would certainly take into consideration the \nviews of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee on both sides of \nthis issue, before reaching a final conclusion on the merits of such a \nnomination, should it be submitted to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I close by saying I do not believe that the committee \nheld Commander Stumpf responsible for the Navy's administrative errors. \nIf Commander Stumpf is nominated in the future, I would separate these \nmatters, and I would view the Navy's administrative errors as separate \nand apart from Commander Stumpf's nomination.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 Robert E. Stumpf,\n\n\n                                           2616 Boush Quarter,\n\n                            Virginia Beach, VA, February 13, 1996.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thurmond: As it appears that the Committee \n     continues to have lingering concerns about my promotion and \n     my attendance at the Tailhook 1991 Symposium, it may be \n     beneficial to the Committee to hear from me personally. \n     Accordingly, I respectfully request to meet with the \n     Committee in closed session at the earliest opportunity to \n     address Committee questions or concerns.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Robert E. Stumpf,\n     Commander, USN.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 1996.\n     Commander Robert E. Stumpf,\n     2616 Boush Quarter, Virginia Beach, VA.\n       Dear Commander Stumpf: This is in response to your letter \n     dated February 13, 1996. It was first received by Committee \n     via telefax on March 13, 1996.\n       I understand your request to appear before the Committee in \n     closed session. However, at present there is no nomination \n     before the Committee concerning you. Should a nomination \n     concerning you be presented to the Committee in the future, \n     your request will be given appropriate consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Strom Thurmond,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the \nremarks by both Mr. Coats, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, and \nby Mr. Nunn, the distinguished Senator from Georgia.\n  First of all, with reference to the work that has been done on this \nparticular subcommittee, I want to pay tribute to the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Coats. As far as I am concerned, between the two of us, he \nhas done by far the major part of the work. He has shouldered the \nworkload and he has done it professionally and with great skill and \nexceedingly well. I admire his courage for taking the position that he \nis taking on this particular issue here this evening.\n  Mr. President, with reference to the Senator from Georgia, I came to \nthe Senate 38 years ago, at which time there was a very distinguished \nGeorgian by the name of Richard Brevard Russell, who was chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Armed Services. I became a member of that \ncommittee 2 years after I had become a Member of the Senate, and I \nserved with Senator Russell on that committee.\n  In these 38 years, Mr. President, I have seen some great chairmen of \nthat committee, chairmen from both parties. But in my considered \njudgment--and I realize that I have my own flaws and I am capable of \nerring in my judgment--the two greatest chairmen of the Armed Services \nCommittee in my 38 years here have been those two distinguished \nSenators from the State of Georgia. Senator Richard Russell was someone \nwhom I adopted as my mentor. He never knew that, but in my own heart I \nadmired him so greatly that I tried to follow in his footsteps and \nstudy the rules and precedents of the Senate. It was my resolution \nwhich, when adopted by the Rules Committee of the Senate and by the \nSenate, brought about the naming of what was then the Old Senate Office \nBuilding, the Richard Brevard Russell Building. That is how much I \nadmired Senator Russell.\n  I admire this distinguished Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, who \nwill be retiring from the Senate at the end of this year, no less, \ninsofar as his skill is concerned and handling of the work of the \ncommittee. I have marveled at the organization of the committee and the \norganization, work, and dedication of the Senator from Georgia. I have \noften said to others that Senator Nunn is probably the finest chairman \nof the committee that we have had in the Senate.\n  Now, Napoleon once had a general staff officer in his army by the \nname of Michel Ney. Well, Marshal Ney was cut off from the rest of the \narmy of Napoleon, and he had to fight his way through thousands of \nCossacks, which he did. He came to the River Niemen and he crossed it. \nIn so doing, he lost all of his guns, but he finally was reunited with \nthe other units of Napoleon's army. When Napoleon heard that Ney had \nescaped and had returned, he was overjoyed. He said to some of the \nother officers, ``I have 400 million francs in the cellars of the \nTuileries, and I would gladly give them all for the ransom of my good \ncompanion in arms.'' That was the old palace in Paris, which later \nburned down. ``I have 400 million francs in the cellars of the \nTuileries, and I would gladly give them all for the ransom of my good \ncompanion in arms.'' That is how much Napoleon prized this officer, \nGeneral Ney.\n  Well, I feel that way about Senator Nunn, and I am proud to be \nassociated with him and with the distinguished Senator from Indiana in \ntheir remarks here today. I will be very brief.\n  I wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia, the ranking member of the Committee on Armed \nServices, on the matter of the promotion of Commander Robert Stumpf, \nU.S. Navy.\n  It is very clear to me that the committee has acted with great \nresponsibility in the handling of the so-called Tailhook 1991 events, \nand attempted to\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\nprotect the rights of the individuals involved while working closely \nwith the Navy and the Department of Defense to get to the bottom of the \nevents that did occur. It is vitally important that the Navy be \nconsistent and forthright in its consideration of the individual cases \nthat still are pending, and take every step to insure that the lessons \nlearned from the scandal can be absorbed and remedies can be \nimplemented.\n\n  In the light of these considerations, it is disappointing to see the \nkind of recent attacks that have been leveled at the Armed Services \nCommittee by the media, and by Commander Stumpf's attorney.\n  I believe that Commander Stumpf's nomination was clearly prejudiced \nby the incredible administrative ineptness that accompanied his \nnomination. According to the well-established procedures that had been \nput into place by the committee, in cooperation with the Navy, adverse \ninformation that was associated with Tailhook should have been \nforwarded to the committee when this nomination for promotion to \ncaptain was first provided to the committee. It is extremely \nunfortunate that only after the fact, that is, after the nomination was \napproved by the Senate, did the committee learn of the results of a \nboard of inquiry into Commander Stumpf's participation at Tailhook.\n  The issue that is at the heart of this matter, Mr. President, is the \nquestion of consistency of standards by which we hold commanding \nofficers in the Navy accountable for their actions. Senator Nunn has \nitemized in detail the standards that exist in the law and in Navy \nregulations, and they are engraved on the long honorable traditions of \nthe Navy. Commander Stumpf, like all commanding officers, bears a heavy \nresponsibility not only for his own actions, but also for the actions \nof the officers and men under his command. That is what this \nunfortunate affair is really all about.\n  It was William Wordsworth who said, ``No matter how lofty you are in \nyour department, the responsibility for what the lowliest assistant is \ndoing is yours.''\n  Frederick the Great of Prussia said, that, ``The quality of the \ntroops depends directly on that of the officers: a good colonel; a good \nbattalion.''\n  That is why the committee acted properly in holding up those \nstandards as a mirror by which to judge the qualifications of \ncommanding officers for further promotion, given what happened in the \nhospitality suites of the Las Vegas Tailhook convention hotel. It is \nnot a pretty picture, and the record in the case of Commander Stumpf is \ncomplete enough, in my judgment, to call his nomination into serious \nquestion. Given the visibility of Commander Stumpf, and his \nprofessional achievements as an airman in combat in Desert Storm, and \nas a role model as the flight leader of the Blue Angels Navy \nDemonstration Team, what we do here in terms of his promotion is all \nthe more important. It is the job of the committee to reconcile this \nmatter and make a considered judgment based on standards, not on \npersonalities.\n\n  Additionally, while Senators may well differ in their judgment as to \nthe seriousness of the charges brought against Commander Stumpf \nregarding his performance as a commanding officer during the Tailhook \nconvention, the failure of the Navy to provide the committee with all \npertinent information readily available to the Navy, makes the \nsituation far worse for his nomination. We have the appearance of a \ncoverup of vital information bearing on his nomination. How could such \nan administrative error have, in good faith, occurred? Clearly the \ninformation was pertinent to his nomination, in that the committee did \ninform the Secretary of the Navy that it would not have agreed to \nCommander Stumpf's promotion, had it been provided the information at \nthe time when the Stumpf nomination was pending before the committee.\n\n  I think it is important to look further into this vital omission--and \nI have not spoken with the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee about \nthis--but it would be my hope that consideration might be given to \nhaving the DOD inspector general investigate the matter. If there is a \nflaw in the way in which, after all this time and furor over Tailhook, \nthe paper trail is provided to the Committee, then it should be \ncorrected. If there was an intention on the part of one or another \nelement of the Navy bureaucracy that thought it was doing Commander \nStumpf a favor by not providing the committee with this information, \nthen it should be known that a great disservice was done to Commander \nStumpf and to the Navy by the omission.\n  Mr. President, as the Senator from Georgia has pointed out, Commander \nStumpf has engaged an attorney who seems to think that his client has \nsomething to gain by attacking the procedures and integrity of the \nArmed Services Committee. The usage of the terms ``McCarthyism,'' \n``blackmail,'' and operating on the basis of ``rumor'' in describing \nthe committee's actions in the matter are ludicrous, and further \nprejudice his client's case. Commander Stumpf, in my opinion, would be \nfar better off with no attorney than with the advice he is currently \ngetting.\n  The committee has decided to keep the record of the nomination \nconfidential, but if further action is warranted, such as a \nresubmission by the Navy of the nomination, then I think the record \nshould be open for all to see. Lay it all out. It should be opened \nentirely.\n  Additionally, Commander Stumpf has asked for a hearing by the \ncommittee, and I think that request should be granted if his nomination \nis resubmitted by the Navy. But the hearing and the record should be \nout in the open. Let the sunshine in.\n  Commander Stumpf's lawyer has openly attacked the committee, there is \na campaign underway to impugn the procedures of the committee. The \ncommittee has little choice but to open the record. All the facts \nshould be on the table. Senators can judge for themselves whether the \nNavy's own standard of conduct for commanding officers was breached \nsubstantially enough for the nomination to be rejected.\n  Mr. President, fame is a vapor; popularity, an accident; riches take \nwings; those who cheer today may curse tomorrow; only one thing \nendures--character. And it is the character of the Navy here that is at \nstake.\n  I would not want to send my grandsons into an organization that I \nthought would destroy character. I would expect the organization to be \none that would build character. And it is the character of the Navy \nthat we are concerned about.\n  Mr. President, I thank again Senator Nunn, and I thank Senator Coats \nfor the fine work that they have done. And I regret that they have been \nmade to suffer as a result of their efforts to do the right thing by \nall concerned.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first I would like to be associated with the remarks \nin this regard by the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, my friend \nand colleague from Indiana, and with the statement that was made by my \nlongtime friend and seatmate, Senator Nunn from Georgia, and, last but \nnot least, the excellent summation just given to the U.S. Senate by a \nMember of this body who we all cherish and recognize for his sound \nleadership and common sense over the years.\n  Mr. President, I do not take any pleasure at all in making the \nremarks that I am about to make. It would have been much easier to just \nskip it and not say anything. But I am very much moved by the unfair \nattacks on the Armed Services Committee on which the four Members now \nin the Senate have served for a long, long time. For myself, this will \nbe my 18th year. And I come to the floor to give my views as briefly as \nI can. I have no written statement, but I am speaking from my heart on \nthis matter that I think is being glossed over.\n  Mr. President, I have not been happy with the majority on the \ncommittee, both Democrats and Republicans, for what I feel has been a \nfolding like an accordian into the spotlight of pressure by the press \nthat has been brought on this particular issue.\n  I take no pleasure in this, Mr. President, because as a veteran of \nWorld War II--and 2 years of that overseas--I was taken over there by \nthe U.S. Navy, and they brought me back. I have a\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\nvery soft spot in my heart for the Navy of the United States of \nAmerica. There is no better navy anywhere--nor do I suggest there ever \nhas been--than the men and women that make up the U.S. Navy today. And \nI am proud of all of them. But I wish to raise some questions and cite \nsome examples tonight on what I feel are some holes, if you will, in \nsome places--not a lot--but in some places in the top leadership of \nthis Navy that have been spotted and brought out into the light with \nseveral events of the last few years.\n\n  Talking about the Navy, I am not going to go into my record with \nvotes and the leadership positions that I have taken for the Navy in a \nwhole series of areas. I guess the only serious difference I ever had \nwith regard to some of the initiatives of the U.S. Navy was over the \nreincarnation of the battleships, which I said was nonsense at the \ntime. It was a multimillion-dollar fiasco. We brought four battleships \nback into commission when we obviously did not need them. But, under \nthe leadership of the Navy, the Congress of the United States was \nconvinced otherwise. We are still paying for that costly mistake. But \ndo we not all make mistakes? I think I was right on that, but I believe \nthat event was the only time in my 18 years of service in the Armed \nServices Committee that I had serious disagreement with the U.S. Navy.\n  I emphasize again that I do not condemn the Navy as a whole. But I am \nhere to support the outstanding efforts by Senator Coats, Senator Nunn, \nSenator Byrd, and others who have taken on the dragon in this case--the \ndragon being certain key parts of leadership of the U.S. Navy. That is \nnot easy to do, but it is something that has to be done.\n  I cite, for example, that--while I think Tailhook, we can all agree, \nwas not one of the finer moments of the great history of the U.S. \nNavy--it may be that it has been overshadowed, and I join with Senator \nNunn in his comments. I have heard him say it. Let us not overreact to \nthings of this nature. But we have to act. That is part of our \nresponsibility in the Armed Services Committee.\n  I stood on this floor to give an example of how in Tailhook and \neverybody within 100 miles of Las Vegas during that weekend, that \nriotous weekend, I might say, of ``fun loving fun,'' I guess, by \nprimarily some of the officers of this man's Navy--and sometimes boys \nwill be boys--leadership people should not be boys, and that is my \nconcern and that is my major problem without condemning any of them or \nall of them.\n  I have not been one of those who sanctimoniously says it was such a \nterrible thing that we have to do something about it. I stood at that \ndesk in the Chamber and provided the leadership for the Armed Services \nCommittee with a lot of serious debate with regard to not retiring a \nvery famous, very capable, top leadership man in the U.S. Navy, an \nadmiral who happened to be at Tailhook but was not involved in any of \nthese things. And I stood there and took the advice of Sam Nunn and \nothers of saying let us keep this in perspective. So we retired that \noutstanding admiral and did not take away his top-grade retirement as \nsome in this body wished to do. So I simply give that as an example \nthat this Senator is not consumed by Tailhook, but I am concerned about \nTailhook.\n  I emphasize once again that we have a great Navy, but some in the \nleadership of that great organization have let that organization down \nin recent years. Let me cite one or two examples. I do not know whether \nthey have been talked about by my friends and colleagues before or not. \nThere certainly has been, though, a most unfortunate series, \nunfortunate series, Mr. President, of serious and distressing \nshortcomings in part of the U.S. Navy in the last few years.\n  Without going into any detail, I would simply cite the problems of \ncheating and scandal and sex at the Naval Academy in Annapolis that we \nfinally seem to be getting turned around, but there was too much of it. \nI would simply say that one of the most distressing things that I ever \nsaw practiced by certain select leadership, not everybody, was the \ncoverup of the blowup of the Iowa battleship, one of those four that I \nreferenced earlier that I thought should never have been brought back \nin any event.\n  Just so you will remember, my colleagues in the Senate, that was the \ncase where after a high-level naval investigation of the blowup on the \nbattleship Iowa that caused 130 some deaths. The Navy leadership, part \nof it, came forth with a program that it was the responsibility of two \nhomosexuals. Well, it turned out later when some of us wanted proof, \nthat the two homosexuals were not involved at all; it was a typical \ncase of the old-boy network working very effectively in part of the \ncoverup. They were not successful, but they almost were.\n\n  I would simply like to mention in that regard also the glossy \ncoverup, or not so glossy coverup, that the U.S. Navy, some of its \nleaders, did after Tailhook was exposed in the press. We would not have \nhad the difficulty that we are in today with Commander Stumpf nor would \nhe have his difficulties at least to this extent were it not for the \nfact that key leadership in the U.S. Navy again fouled up by not \nfollowing a very simple procedure that was well-known to all of the \nleadership of the U.S. Navy when Commander Stumpf's nomination came up, \nand I am sure that Senator Coats and Senator Nunn went into that in \ngreat detail.\n  Then there was another serious situation with regard to the spy \nscandal of a marine in Moscow in our Embassy. That was a tough blow.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that all of these attacks that have been \nmade on the integrity of the Armed Services Committee in the press are \nnonsense. And for rules and reasons, those of us who are knowledgeable \nof the full extent of this situation for the protection of the innocent \nand not to inflame the story are not privileged to talk about it in \ndetail. One editorial that I read said that was McCarthyism, keeping \nthe secret to ourselves like Joe McCarthy did. Well, those of us who \nhave had the top secrets of the United States of America with us and \nlive with us all the time we have been in the Senate know our \nresponsibility and know how to live up to the commitments that we make \nwhile editorial writers are not so constrained.\n  I thought one of the most disgusting articles that I read on this was \nby the Detroit News. I do not know anything about the Detroit News \nexcept that they printed an editorial on Friday, March 15, 1996: \n``Commander Stumpf Gets Blacklisted.'' They then go on to launch an \nall-out attack on Senator Carl Levin, who most of us on both sides of \nthe aisle recognize as one of the most decent, most fair, sound men in \nthe Senate. But the Detroit News was very critical. Let me quote from \nthat:\n\n       Senator Levin and his aides refused to discuss Commander \n     Stumpf's case or the workings of the Armed Services \n     Committee, or anything else for that matter. Citing his \n     allegiance to striking unions, he refuses to talk to the News \n     but his committee colleagues lack so handy an excuse.\n\n  Carl Levin is one of my best friends in the Senate. I came here with \nhim. And for the Detroit News to attack that fine U.S. Senator in the \nmanner they did is unconscionable. And many other members of the press \nincluding our own Navy Times, of course. The Navy Times in an editorial \nof March 11, 1996, says ``Commander Stumpf is a Marked Man:''\n\n       The Senate can strike a blow for naval aviation safety \n     right now by dropping the Tailhook ``acid test'' now used to \n     block some aviator promotions.\n\n  And at the bottom of the editorial, the last paragraph:\n\n       But Tailhook was nearly 5 years ago. It's time for the sore \n     to heal. It's time to abandon that list and help the men and \n     women of naval aviation get back to the basics of safe \n     flying.\n\n  Five years is not very long. I also cite, for the record, an \nexcellent statement in this regard made by a nonmember of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Grassley of Iowa, printed in the \nCongressional Record of March 13, 1996, on S. 1999.\n  Senator Grassley goes on to say that he feels that the flagging of \nofficers who were promoted, who were investigated, should be and should \ncontinue to be brought to the attention of the Armed Services \nCommittee. And I agree.\n  That does not mean, as Senator Coats and Senator Nunn and Senator \nByrd have pointed out, that we blacklist these people at all. That is \nnot the way we work. I simply say that the\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nmajor reason that Commander Stumpf has had some trouble was, once \nagain, the top leadership of the U.S. Navy failed to do the routine \nthing when they submitted Stumpf to the Armed Services Committee for us \nto discharge our responsibilities that we have sworn to uphold. They \njust forgot.\n  It was a legitimate error. I do not believe it was intentional, but \nit was another error, another shortcoming of some of the leadership of \nthe U.S. Navy.\n  I simply say that the Armed Services Committee, nor any of its \nmembers, are at fault. Yet, our integrity is being questioned because \nof what we collectively did and thought was our duty.\n  Let me close, if I might, by giving my own personal view, without \ndetailing any of the information at my disposal that, for good reasons, \nI am sworn to protect. I know most or all of the details, some of them \nsordid, about Tailhook. I happen to feel that Commander Stumpf may be \nbeing overly criticized for some things. It is true, in the opinion of \nthis Senator, that he was not in that room at a time when an act was \ntaking place that I think would have probably guaranteed that he not be \nrecommended for promotion. He got out in time. But he did not do \nanything about anything that he saw going on.\n  But I simply say and emphasize once again that I am not one of those \nwho feel that Commander Stumpf should be blacklisted, should be \neliminated for consideration--and I emphasize consideration--by the \nArmed Services Committee in carrying out its responsibilities. My view \nis that circumstances following the unfortunate foul-up by the top \nechelon in the U.S. Navy in not giving us the information is the main \nreason for the problem.\n  But what happened after that? And this is something that I feel very \nstrongly about. After that happened, we began to see articles \nappearing, although none of the authors came to see me. The old boy \nnetwork took over for a top gun.\n  Let me emphasize that again. The old boy network took over for a top \ngun and dedicated themselves to seeing, as quickly as possible, that \nthe promotion was granted.\n  I think--and I am very much upset with Commander Stumpf--that he did \nnot take the first logical step that he could, should, and had the \nright to take, by appealing to a board that looks after these things, \ncalled the correction board. No, he bypassed that, because the other \ntop guns and their supporters went to work by lobbying.\n  So it seems to me that if and when I have a responsibility to \ndischarge, as one member, my duties as one member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I would not, having known what I know, interfere with \nStumpf's promotion on the basis of Tailhook. Some other Members may not \nsee it that way. But I am very much concerned about an individual that \nwe look to, and certainly is one of the finest performing officers that \nwe have today in the U.S. Navy, there is no question about that, but \nthere are other things that we look for when we go through the \npromotion scheme. In all likelihood, Commander Stumpf, if and when he \nis promoted --as I think he will be, eventually, to captain; he is very \nlikely to become an admiral someday. There are lots of things beside \nyour ability to fly and your courage in battle that play into the \npromotion role.\n  As much as anything else, I simply say that as far as this Senator is \nconcerned, the hiring of a lawyer without going through the proper \nprocedures is a step in the wrong direction and emphasizes what I am \nmost concerned about in this particular matter, and that is that the \nNavy, unto themselves, with the machoism that they show time and time \nagain, decided they were going to get the Armed Services Committee, \nregardless of our faithfulness, regardless of what we have done, \nregardless of what we will do as members of that committee in the \nfuture.\n  And the crowning blow, although I recognize that he has a right to do \nit, was a Washington Post news story of March 19 that I will submit for \nthe Record. The headline is ``Tailhook Figure Files Suit Over Navy \nPromotion.'' Going to the courts, hiring a lawyer to get what he wants \nand is probably entitled to, it seems to me was not the wise way to \nproceed.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. Some will disagree with me, probably, about Commander \nStumpf. But the main reason for my appearing on the floor tonight was \nto try to set the record straight as to the legitimate role that the \nArmed Services Committee has played in this matter. We played the role \nright by the book.\n\n  I happen to feel, when Commander Stumpf comes before us again, he may \nbe approved. He might get my support. But I will be asking some \nquestions about why the lawsuit, why the full-court press by some of \nhis friends, trying to discredit, by their actions, the legitimate \nsteps and actions and decisions made by the Armed Services Committee?\n  Mr. President, I think we have not heard the last of this matter. I \nthink it is just another bungled handling of a situation by certain top \nleadership in the U.S. Navy, and I will simply say to Commander Stumpf \nthat had the information been furnished to us when it was not about \nwhat happened, or that he was even at that Tailgate party 5 years ago, \nI would have voted to send Stumpf on through after I took a look and \nhad a thorough briefing on what the allegations against him were. I do \nnot think they were that serious.\n  But the U.S. Navy is the one that caused Commander Stumpf his \nproblem. His friends are in the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Tailhook Figure Files Suit Over Navy Promotion\n\n       A former commander of the Blue Angels squadron, who was \n     cleared of wrongdoing in the Tailhook scandal, has accused \n     Navy Secretary John H. Dalton of improperly blocking his \n     promotion to captain.\n       In a suit filed Friday in federal court in Alexandria, \n     Cmdr. Robert E. Stumpf said Dalton bowed to political \n     pressure from Capitol Hill. Stumpf, stationed at Oceana Naval \n     Air Station in Virginia Beach, asked that he be given his \n     promotion as of July 1995.\n       Stumpf's was one of the most high-profile cases resulting \n     from the 1991 Tailhook convention of Navy aviators, in which \n     dozens of women and female officers complained of sexual \n     harassment. A three-officer panel found that Stumpf left a \n     Las Vegas hotel suite before a stripper performed oral sex on \n     an officer.\n       The suit said Congress approved Stumpf's promotion after \n     Dalton inadvertently failed to notify Capitol Hill of \n     Stumpf's Tailhook connection. Dalton, pressured by the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee, withdrew Stumpf from a promotion \n     list in December.\n       The suit said federal law allows a promotion approved by \n     Congress to be canceled only if an officer ``is mentally, \n     physically, morally or professionally unqualified.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/21/senate-section/article/S2630-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COATS.

This exciting period \nculminated last week with three teams from across South Dakota winning \nState championships in their respective divisions.\n  There is a tremendous amount of pride that each community in South \nDakota feels for its high school sports teams. Having grown up in one \nof those communities, I know that each time a high school team is \nsuccessful, its community glows with the same accomplishment. \nCommunities like these are still proud of their young people's \nabilities, their hard work, and their determination to work together \nand achieve a common goal, both on and off the court.\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\n  Today, I would like to congratulate all of the teams who participated \nin this year's tournaments. In particular, I would like to commend the \nhigh schools of Warner, Douglas, and Mitchell for having earned their \nrespective State boys' basketball championship titles in 1996. Clearly, \nthese schools exemplify the commitment to excellence and teamwork that \nall South Dakota high schools share with their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/21/senate-section/article/S2641-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HOW MUCH FOREIGN OIL BEING CONSUMED BY UNITED STATES?

After being ruled by the Ottoman Turks for four centuries, the \npeople of Greece were able to restore democracy for the Nation where \ndemocracy was first born in the ancient world.\n  The people of Greece have made extraordinary contributions to all \nnations of the world, and no country has benefited more from these \ncontributions than the United States. It has been said that except for \nthe blind forces of nature, nothing moves in this world which is not \nGreek in origin. Our Founding Fathers modeled our own system of \ndemocratic government on the basic principles of democracy of ancient \nGreece, and over 3-million Greek-Americans today continue to make \nvaluable contributions to all aspects of American life. This \nresolution, in commemorating Greek Independence Day, also commemorates \nthe close and enduring ties between our two nations.

A bill to prohibit persons convicted of a crime involving \ndomestic violence from owning or possessing firearms, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          FIREARMS LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that would prohibit individuals who have been convicted of \na crime involving domestic violence from owning or possessing firearms.\n  Under current Federal law, Mr. President, it is illegal for people \nconvicted of felonies to possess firearms. Yet many people who engage \nin serious spousal or child abuse ultimately are not charged with or \nconvicted of felonies. At the end of the day, maybe following a plea \nbargain, they are convicted of misdemeanors. And these people are still \nfree under Federal law to possess firearms.\n  This legislation will close this loophole, and will help keep guns \nout of the hands of people who have proven themselves to be violent and \na threat to those closest to them. The legislation would add to the \nlist of persons disqualified from owning or possessing a firearm \nindividuals who have been convicted of any crime involving domestic \nviolence, regardless of the length, term, or manner of punishment. This \nincludes violent crimes committed by a spouse, former spouse, paramour, \nparent, guardian or similar individual.\n  Mr. President, although there is a growing awareness about the \nproblem of domestic violence, in many places, even today, these \noutrageous acts are not taken as seriously as other forms of brutal \nbehavior. Yet each year an estimated 2 million women are victimized by \ndomestic violence. That is 10 times the number of women who are \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. Of those 2 million women, nearly 6,000 \ndie at the hands of men who at least at one time claimed to love them. \nAbout 70 percent of the time, those hands are holding a gun.\n  Mr. President, much of the killing and maiming associated with \ndomestic violence could not happen but for the presence of a firearm. \nThe New England Journal of Medicine reports that in households with a \nhistory of battering, a gun in the home increases the likelihood that a \nwoman will be murdered fivefold. Often, the only difference between a \nbattered woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun.\n  Acts of domestic violence, by their nature, are especially dangerous \nand require special attention. These crimes involve people who have a \nhistory together, and who perhaps share a home or a child. These are \nnot violent acts between strangers, and they do not arise from a chance \nmeeting. Even after a split, the individuals involved often by \nnecessity have a continuing relationship of some sort. The husbands, \nboyfriends, and former husbands who commit these crimes often have a \nrecord of violent and threatening behavior. And yet, frequently, these \nmen are being permitted to possess firearms--with no legal \nrestrictions.\n  The statistics and data are clear. Domestic violence, no matter how \nit is labeled, leads to more domestic violence. And guns in the hand of \nconvicted spouse abusers lead to death.\n  To me, Mr. President, it is a simple proposition.

A bill to provide for school-bus safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n          THE OMNIBUS SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation, the Omnibus School Transportation Safety Act of 1996, that \nwould improve the safety of schoolbus travel.\n  The legislation would require background checks of schoolbus drivers, \nestablish minimum proficiency standards for such drivers, and promote \nadvanced technologies that can help prevent schoolbus accidents. In \naddition, the bill calls for a variety of studies that could improve \nschoolbus safety and increase the information on bus safety available \nto school districts and parents.\n  Mr. President, America's schoolchildren have a right to safe \ntransportation to and from school. And we have a responsibility to do \neverything we can to guarantee that safety.\n  To ensure our children's safety, we first must ensure that bus \ndrivers are decent individuals who will not harm their passengers. \nUnfortunately, sexual deviants often are attracted to driving a \nschoolbus because the job gives them easy access to children who are \nthe focus of their sexual desires.\n  Children who ride on schoolbuses, particularly those in elementary \nschool, are extremely vulnerable to physical abuse. They are too young \nto comprehend what is being done to them and too small to physically \ndefend themselves from an attack. As a nation, we have a responsibility \nto provide as much protection as possible to this vulnerable \npopulation. My bill therefore would require all States to perform a \nFederal background check on potential schoolbus drivers before they are \nallowed to be alone with our children.\n  Eighteen States--Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nDelaware, Florida, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, \nOregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Louisiana--\nalready conduct State and Federal background checks on their drivers. \nMy amendment generally would not affect how these States administer \ntheir programs.\n  Fourteen States--Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nMinnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, \nTexas, West Virginia, Nebraska, Illinois, and Wisconsin--currently \nperform only state background checks. This is well-meaning, but \ninsufficient. A convicted sexual deviant can easily move to one of \nthese States, receive a clean background check, and begin driving his \nprey to and from school. My bill therefore would require those States \nto participate in the nationwide, Federal program.\n  There also are 18 States--Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, \nIowa, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, \nOklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, and \nWyoming--that have no background checks for their schoolbus drivers. \nThere is no rational reason why these States should not do more to \nprotect their citizens.\n  Mr. President, during the 2 months after California instituted \nFederal criminal background checks in 1990, it screened out 150 \nconvicted sex offenders, child molesters, and violent criminals who \ntried to get permits to drive schoolbuses. This is shocking and my bill \nwould address this problem.\n  Beyond requiring background checks for prospective schoolbus drivers, \nMr. President, my bill includes a variety of provisions designed to \nreduce school-bus accidents.\n  During the past 10 years, 300 school-age pedestrians under 19 years \nof age have died in schoolbus-related crashes. Two-thirds were killed \nby their own schoolbus. Half of all school-age pedestrians killed by \nschoolbuses in the past 10 years were 5- and 6-year-olds. On average, \n21 school-age pedestrians are killed by schoolbuses each year, and 9 \nare killed by other vehicles involved in schoolbus-related crashes.\n  Mr. President, as a nation, we need to do much more to prevent \nschoolbus accidents. This bill attacks the problem on a number of \nfronts.\n  First, it would establish proficiency standards for schoolbus \ndrivers.\n  Mr. President, driving a schoolbus with 40 young, screaming children \nis a unique skill that deserves specialized training. Unfortunately, \nmany drivers are distracted when their young passengers are noisy or \notherwise disruptive, and the results can be tragic. Inattention is one \nof the two factors most often reported by police for schoolbus drivers \nstriking school-age pedestrians.\n\n[[Page S2648]]\n\n  Bus drivers already are required to possess a commercial driver's \nlicense with a general endorsement for those driving vehicles with more \nthan 15 passengers. However, there are no Federal standards \nspecifically directed to schoolbus drivers. My bill would require the \nSecretary of Transportation to prescribe such standards.\n  Mr. President, some States already prescribe a level of proficiency \nfor schoolbus drivers, but many do not. My bill generally would not \ninterfere with existing State programs, but it would ensure that all \nschoolbus drivers meet a minimum standard of proficiency.\n  Another way that my bill would reduce schoolbus accidents is by \nassisting States to develop safer places for children to enter and \nleave their bus. For example, States could make bus stops more safe by \nincreasing their visibility. Similarly, States could establish special \nsafe areas in which children could disembark from busses, away from \ntraffic.\n  The legislation also would require the Secretary of Transportation to \npromote the use and reduce the cost of hazard warning systems or \nsensors that alert schoolbus drivers of pedestrians or vehicles in, or \napproaching, the path of the schoolbus. These types of warning systems \ncan be critical in saving the lives of young people. Unfortunatately, \nmany school districts have failed to invest in such systems. One reason \nis that their cost can be high. We need to explore ways to reduce those \ncosts.\n  Another provision in the bill would require the Secretary to improve \ntraining materials on schoolbus safety and to improve the distribution \nand availability of such materials to schools for use by the student \nsafety patrols. The most effective way to protect schoolchildren is to \nteach them to protect themselves. The Department of Transportation can \ndo more in this area.\n  My legislation also would promote research into the possibility of \ninstalling safety belts in schoolbuses.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the loss of life attributed to \nschoolbus accidents that I mentioned earlier, approximately 10,000 \nschoolbus passengers are injured every year. Most injuries occur during \nside and rollover collisions. In this type of collision, the \ncompartmentalized seat does not protect children, who can fall up to 8 \nfeet to strike the roof, windows, other seats, and other children.\n  To reduce these types of injuries, the State of New Jersey requires \nthe installation and use of safety belts in all schoolbuses. New \nJersey's State law in this area was adopted after a study by the New \nJersey Office of Highway Traffic Safety into the safety of lap \nseatbelts in large school vehicles. That study concluded that \ninstallation of seatbelts in all schoolbuses would improve vehicles' \noverall safety performance. The study recommended that schoolbuses be \nrequired to be equipped with seatbelts, which led to later enactment of \nthe New Jersey law.\n  Mr. President, I support this law and believe it should be adopted on \na Nation-wide basis. It is nearly impossible for a bus without belts to \nrollover without causing injuries or death. However, I recognize that \nsome in Washington believe more information is needed before \nestablishing such a Federal requirement.\n  One cause of this skepticism is that the Federal Government does not \nstudy crashes in which there are no injuries. The National \nTransportation Safety Board only investigates bus crashes where there \nare severe injuries or fatalities. Therefore, the data they collect do \nnot accurately reflect the benefits of safety belts in schoolbuses.\n  A bus with safety belts costs an average of $1,000 more than a bus \nwithout belts. With an estimated schoolbus life of 15 years, seatbelt \ninstallation would cost approximately $66 per bus per year.\n  Children are already required to wear seatbelts in cars. Installation \nof seatbelts on the standard size schoolbuses would reinforce the \nimportance of wearing seatbelts, reduce injuries to our children, cost \nrelatively little to install and maintain, and overall, makes schoolbus \ntransportation safer for our children.\n  My bill would require the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration [NHTSA] to study the safety impact of safety belts on \nschoolbuses. It specifically requires that NHTSA evaluate the real life \nconsequences of New Jersey's safety belt law. I am hopeful that the \nresulting study will help end the longstanding debate on this issue, so \nwe can move forward to protect the lives of our Nation's children.\n  Mr. President, this legislation also requires the Secretary of \nTransportation to begin a rulemaking process to determine the \nfeasibility and practicability of: First, decreasing the flammability \nof materials used in the construction of the interiors of schoolbuses; \nsecond, informing purchasers of schoolbuses on the secondary market \nthat those buses may not meet current NHTSA standards; and third, \nestablishing construction and design standards for wheelchairs used in \nthe transportation of students in schoolbuses.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary to conduct a variety of studies \ndesigned to provide an accurate data base of schoolbus safety \ninformation. In addition, the bill, in response to requests from some \nStates, calls for Federal guidelines on the securing in a schoolbus of \nchildren under the age of five, and on measures to facilitate their \nevacuation in an emergency.\n  Mr. President, the Omnibus School Transportation Safety Act of 1996 \nis comprehensive legislation that would dramatically reduce deaths and \ninjuries of children associated with schoolbus accidents.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the legislation, along with a section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill, be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1633\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Omnibus \n     School Transportation Safety Act of 1996''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the United States, school buses travel more than \n     4,000,000,000 miles each year to transport approximately \n     25,000,000 children to and from school and various school-\n     related activities.\n       (2) School buses are specifically designed to carry \n     children safely to and from school, and generally are \n     operated by educational agencies that receive Federal \n     assistance for educational activities.\n       (3) On the average, each year in the United States--\n       (A) 17 occupants are killed while riding school buses, of \n     which--\n       (i) 10 pupils are killed while riding type I school buses \n     with a gross weight rating of greater than 10,000 pounds, and \n     those school buses are predominantly used in the United \n     States;\n       (ii) 2 pupils are killed while riding other vehicles used \n     as school buses; and\n       (iii) 5 drivers are killed while driving school buses;\n       (B) 38 children are killed in loading zones surrounding \n     school buses;\n       (C) 480 children are seriously injured while riding school \n     buses; and\n       (D) 160 children are seriously injured while boarding or \n     leaving school buses.\n       (4) Although most crashes involving school buses are minor, \n     some examples of serious crashes that have had tragic \n     consequences, include--\n       (A) the school bus crash that occurred in Alton, Texas;\n       (B) the school bus crash that occurred in October of 1995, \n     in Fox River Grove, Illinois; and\n       (C) the recent school bus crash outside of Green Bay, \n     Wisconsin, that killed the driver.\n       (5) Each year approximately 35,000 school buses are \n     manufactured in the United States. The components for those \n     buses are produced in various locations throughout the United \n     States. The few companies that manufacture those buses ship \n     the buses throughout the United States and to foreign \n     countries.\n       (6) Numerous Federal laws, including subtitle VI of title \n     49, United States Code, regulate school buses as commercial \n     motor vehicles. Subtitle VI of title 49, United States Code, \n     provides for--\n       (A) motor vehicle safety standards under chapter 311 of \n     that subtitle; and\n       (B) the regulation of commercial motor vehicle operators \n     under chapter 313 of that subtitle.\n\n     SEC. 2.

DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENT VEHICLE-HIGHWAY SYSTEMS \n                   FOR SCHOOL BUS SAFETY.\n\n       Section 6055(d) of the Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems \n     Act of 1991 (23 U.S.C. 307 note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (2);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (3) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(4) ensure that 1 or more operational tests advance the \n     use and reduce the cost of intelligent vehicle-highway system \n     technologies (including hazard warning systems or sensors) \n     that alert school bus drivers of pedestrians or vehicles in, \n     or approaching, the path of the school bus.''.\n\n     SEC. 6. STUDY OF OCCUPANT RESTRAINTS IN SCHOOL BUSES.\n\n       (a) Study.--The National Transportation Safety Board \n     organized under chapter 11 of title 49, United States Code, \n     shall conduct a study on the safety consequences of the \n     requirement of the State of New Jersey for lap belts in \n     school buses.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the National \n     Transportation Safety Board shall submit to the Congress a \n     report containing the findings of the study conducted under \n     this section.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the National Transportation Safety \n     Board to carry out this section $100,000, which shall remain \n     available until expended.\n\n     SEC. 7. TRAFFIC ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE SCHOOL BUS \n                   SAFETY.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary \n     shall ensure that each State receiving aid to conduct highway \n     safety programs under section 402(c) of title 23, United \n     States Code, may utilize a portion of such aid for the \n     purpose of conducting traffic engineering activities in order \n     to improve the safe operation of school buses.\n\n     SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF PRACTICABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF \n                   CERTAIN SAFETY AND ACCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR \n                   SCHOOL BUSES.\n\n       (a) Commencement of Rulemaking Process.--Not later than 6 \n     months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall commence or continue to carry out a \n     rulemaking process to determine the feasibility and \n     practicability of--\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\n       (1) a requirement for a decrease in the flammability of the \n     materials used in the construction of the interiors of school \n     buses;\n       (2) a requirement that individuals, local educational \n     agencies, or companies that sell in the secondary market \n     school buses that may be used in interstate commerce inform \n     purchasers of those buses that those buses may not meet \n     applicable National Highway Transportation Safety \n     Administration standards or Federal Highway Administration \n     standards; and\n       (3) the establishment of construction and design standards \n     for wheelchairs used in the transportation of pupils in \n     school buses.\n       (b) Final Rule.--Not later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue a final \n     regulation providing for any requirement or standard referred \n     to in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a) that the \n     Secretary determines to be feasible and practicable.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--If the Secretary makes a \n     determination that a requirement or standard referred to in \n     paragraph (1), (2), or (3) is not feasible or practicable, \n     not later than the date specified in subsection (b), the \n     Secretary shall prepare and submit to the Congress a report \n     that provides the reasons for that determination.\n\n     SEC. 9. GUIDELINES FOR SAFE TRANSPORTATION OF CHILDREN BY \n                   SCHOOL BUS.\n\n       The Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration shall develop and disseminate guidelines for \n     ensuring the safe transportation in school buses of children \n     under the age of 5. Those guidelines shall include \n     recommendations for the evacuation of such children from such \n     buses in the event of an emergency.\n\n     SEC. 10. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON SCHOOL BUS SAFETY.\n\n       (a) Dissemination of Information.--In carrying out research \n     on highway safety under section 403 of title 23, United \n     States Code, in consultation with the appropriate officials \n     or representatives of the American Automobile Association, \n     State educational agencies, and highway safety organizations, \n     the Secretary shall provide for the improvement of--\n       (1) training materials on school bus safety; and\n       (2) the distribution and availability of such materials to \n     public and private schools for use by the student safety \n     patrols of those schools and to appropriate law enforcement \n     agencies.\n       (b) Funding.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     of the funds made available to the Secretary for research on \n     highway safety and traffic conditions under section 403 of \n     title 23, United States Code, for each of fiscal years 1996 \n     through 2001, $100,000 shall be available for each of those \n     fiscal years for the purposes of carrying out this section.\n\n     SEC. 11. STUDY AND REPORT ON SCHOOL BUS SAFETY.\n\n       (a) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall carry out a study to \n     determine--\n       (A) the extent to which public transit vehicles (as defined \n     by the Secretary) are engaged in school bus operations;\n       (B) the point at which a public transit vehicle is \n     sufficiently engaged in such operations as to be considered a \n     school bus for purposes of regulation under Federal law; and\n       (C) the differences between school bus operations carried \n     out directly by schools or local educational agencies and \n     school bus operations carried out by schools or local \n     educational agencies by contract or tripper service (as \n     defined by the Secretary).\n       (2) Areas.--The study conducted under this subsection shall \n     address the differences between the services and operations \n     referred to in paragraph (1)(C) in terms of--\n       (A) crash injury data;\n       (B) driver and carrier requirements;\n       (C) passenger transportation requirements;\n       (D) routes and operational requirements that affect safety;\n       (E) vehicle attributes that affect safety;\n       (F) bus construction and design standards;\n       (G) Federal and State operating assistance (per passenger, \n     per mile, per hour);\n       (H) total operating costs;\n       (I) Federal and State capital assistance (per passenger, \n     per mile, per hour);\n       (J) total capital costs; and\n       (K) any other factor that the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     committees described in paragraph (2) a report on the results \n     of the study carried out under subsection (a).\n       (2) Committees.--The committees referred to in paragraph \n     (1) are--\n       (A) the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the \n     Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     of the Senate;\n       (C) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;\n       (D) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of \n     the House of Representatives;\n       (E) the Committee on Commerce of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (F) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 12. IMPROVED INTERSTATE SCHOOL BUS SAFETY.\n\n       (a) Applicability of Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Regulations to Interstate School Bus Operations.--Section \n     31136 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking the second sentence of subsection (e); and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Applicability to School Transportation Operations of \n     Local Educational Agencies.--Not later than 18 months after \n     the date of enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall \n     issue regulations making the relevant commercial motor \n     carrier safety regulations issued under subsection (a) \n     applicable to all interstate school transportation operations \n     by local educational agencies (as defined in section 14101 of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     8801)).''.\n       (b) Education Program.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall develop \n     and implement an education program informing all local \n     educational agencies that those agencies are required to \n     comply with the Federal commercial motor vehicle safety \n     regulations issued under section 31136 of title 49, United \n     States Code, when providing interstate transportation on a \n     school bus vehicle to and from school-sanctioned and school-\n     related activities.\n\n     SEC. 13. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Omnibus School Transportation Safety Act of 1996--Section by Section\n\n       Sec. 1: Short Title; Findings.\n       Sec. 2: Definitions.\n       Sec. 3: Directs the Secretary to prescribe proficiency \n     standards for school bus drivers.\n       At present, school bus drivers are required to have a \n     Commercial Drivers License (CDL). However, CDL training for \n     bus drivers is geared primarily towards commercial motor \n     carrier drivers. ``Inattention'' and ``failure to yield'' \n     were the factors most often reported by police for school bus \n     drivers striking a school-age pedestrian. A school bus driver \n     faces unique driving and pupil control situations that \n     current CDL training does not address. This section will \n     require school bus drivers to be trained to handle these \n     unique situations before they are allowed on the road.\n       Sec. 4: Requires states to conduct federal background \n     checks with fingerprints of prospective school bus drivers.\n       School bus drivers are alone and off of school property \n     with students for extended periods of time. At present, 18 \n     States conduct Federal background checks, 14 States only do \n     state background checks, and 18 States do no background \n     checks on potential drivers. State background checks are not \n     sufficient. Someone can easily move from one State to another \n     and leave their criminal history behind. This provision is \n     designed to ensure that parents know who is alone with their \n     children. Just 2 months after requiring fingerprint criminal \n     background checks, California screened out 150 convicted sex \n     offenders, child molesters and violent criminals who tried to \n     get permits to drive school buses. Funding to assist states \n     that are not already committing resources to this type of \n     activity is provided through the Department of Education's \n     crime free school program.\n       Sec. 5: Directs the Secretary to do one or more operation \n     tests to advance the use and reduce the cost of hazard \n     warning systems that alert school bus drivers of pedestrians \n     or vehicles in, or approaching, the path of the school bus.\n       Two out of every three children killed in school bus \n     related accidents are killed outside the school bus. Many are \n     struck by their own school bus. The causes vary from driver \n     inattentiveness, blind spots, or children's clothing being \n     caught on a part of the bus causing the bus to drag the child \n     to death. These accidents occur in the bus' ``danger zone.'' \n     While there are electronic devices on the market that are \n     designed to detect and warn drivers when an object is in the \n     danger zone, most are expensive and have reliability \n     problems. The goal of this section is to increase the \n     reliability and reduce the cost of existing technology.\n       Sec. 6: Directs to the National Transportation Safety Board \n     to study the safety consequences of required use of safety \n     belts in New Jersey school buses.\n       Approximately 10,000 school bus passengers are injured \n     every year. Most injuries and fatalities in the bus occur \n     during side and rollover collisions. In these types of \n     collisions the ``compartmentalized'' seat does not protect \n     children who fall about eight feet and strike the roof, \n     windows, seats and other children. Safety belts have been \n     standard equipment in passenger automobiles for quite some \n     time, and they have proven to be effective life-saving and \n     injury-preventing devices. However, not all school buses are \n     required to be equipped with seat belts.\n       The debate on whether or not safety belts should be \n     required on school buses is heated. However, the lack of \n     sufficient data, makes an accurate estimate on the \n     effectiveness of school bus seat belts very difficult. \n     Therefore, my bill directs the National Transportation Safety \n     Board to study the safety consequences of the use of safety \n     belts in New Jersey school buses. New Jersey is the only \n     State which has mandatory school bus safety belt use and it \n     will provide an excellent opportunity for researchers to \n     build the base of knowledge on this subject that we need to \n     determine if safety belts in school buses should be the norm.\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\n       Sec. 7: Provides aid for the purpose of conducting traffic \n     engineering activities in order to improve the safe operation \n     of school buses in the ``danger zone.''\n       An overwhelming number of students are killed during the \n     loading and unloading of the school bus. Proper engineering \n     of loading and unloading zones will improve the safety and \n     reduce the number of accidents and fatalities which take \n     place in the ``danger zone.'' This provision will allow \n     States to utilize section 402(C) funds to assist in the \n     development of safety guidelines for the construction and \n     selection of school bus loading and un-loading zones.\n       Sec. 8: Requires the Secretary to begin a rulemaking \n     process to determine the feasibility and practicality of:\n       A requirement for a decrease in the flammability of the \n     materials used in the construction of the interiors of school \n     buses;\n       A requirement that sellers of school buses in the secondary \n     market inform purchasers that such buses may not meet current \n     National Highway Transportation Safety Administration or \n     Federal Highway Administration standards and;\n       Establishing construction and design standards \n     for wheelchairs used in the transportation of students in \n     school buses.\n       Reduction of the flammability of material in school buses \n     continues to be on the National Transportation Safety Board's \n     most wanted list. NTSB made this recommendation after the \n     1988 Carrollton, KY bus accident. In that incident, a pre-\n     1977 school bus was struck by a pick-up truck. The bus' gas \n     tank was ruptured and a fire ensued, engulfing the entire \n     bus. The bus driver and 26 bus passengers were fatally \n     injured. Had stricter flammability requirements been in \n     effect during construction of this bus the NTSB believes more \n     of the passengers could have escaped the bus without serious \n     injury.\n       Used school buses are a popular form of transportation for \n     church groups and civic organizations. Unfortunately, many of \n     these groups believe that school buses are built to the \n     highest safety standards available. This is not the case. \n     Therefore, the bill would require that potential purchasers \n     of used buses are made aware of this fact so they can modify \n     their uses of the bus based upon the level of safety the bus \n     offers in certain situations.\n       While there are Federal standards relating to how \n     wheelchairs must be secured into school buses, there are no \n     standards for the wheelchairs themselves. This provision is \n     designed to ensure that students who use a wheelchair are \n     afforded maximum protection in case of a school bus accident.\n       Sec. 9: Requires NHTSA to develop and disseminate \n     guidelines on securing children under the age of five in \n     school buses and on evacuating those same children from \n     school buses.\n       For one reason or another school districts are beginning to \n     transport more and more children below the age of five in \n     traditional school buses. Most, if not all, school buses and \n     school bus seats are designed to accommodate and protect \n     children age five and older. In addition, state laws and \n     common sense dictate that children under the age of four use \n     a car seat when riding in a motor vehicle. Many communities \n     are struggling with the appropriate way to safely transport \n     children below the age of five in school buses. This \n     provision would require NHTSA to develop guidelines on \n     securing young children in school buses. The provision also \n     addresses the problems evacuation of children in car seats \n     could pose in an emergency.\n       Sec. 10: Requires the Secretary to improve and distribute \n     school bus safety information.\n       Every year approximately 20 children are killed outside \n     their school bus. They are either struck by their own bus or \n     by another vehicle. One of the most effective ways to prevent \n     these types of accidents is to properly educate children and \n     their parents to these dangers. While a variety of safety \n     information is available, it is not widely distributed. This \n     provision would require the Secretary to review existing \n     safety material, make improvements if necessary and then \n     ensure that the material is adequately distributed to \n     children and parents.\n       Sec. 11: Require the Secretary to carry out a study to \n     determine the following:\n       The extent to which public transit vehicles are engaged in \n     school bus operations;\n       The point at which a public transit vehicle is sufficiently \n     engaged in such operations as to be considered a school bus \n     for purposes of regulation under Federal law and;\n       The differences between school bus operations carried out \n     directly by schools or school districts and school bus \n     operations carried out by schools or school districts by \n     contract.\n       Federal law prohibits school districts from contracting out \n     to the local municipal bus service to carry out the school \n     district's pupil transportation activities. However, there \n     are some specific exceptions to this rule. With present \n     budget pressures school districts are increasingly looking to \n     take advantage of these exceptions also known as ``tripper \n     service.'' This provision is designed to determine how many \n     communities may be using tripper service as a means of school \n     transportation, at what point a municipal bus engaged in \n     tripper service should be considered a school bus, and the \n     differences between contracted school bus operations and non-\n     contracted school bus operations.\n       Sec. 12: Extends the applicability of Federal Motor \n     Carriers Safety Regulations to the school transportation \n     operations of Local Education Agencies.\n       When operating across State lines, school buses almost \n     without exception must use the same highways--many of them \n     high-speed arteries--as other vehicles. The speeds attained \n     are considerably greater and there is an elevated risk of \n     associated driver fatigue. This fact underscores the need for \n     comprehensive and consistent application of the FMCSR's to \n     any school bus operating across state lines when engaged in \n     school-related and sanctioned activities.\n       Since their inception in 1935, the FMCSR's have been \n     incrementally modified. For example, in 1989 the FHWA issued \n     modifications which for the first time subjected all \n     interstate contractor-operated school transportation \n     operations to the FMCSR's. In 1994, the FHWA extended \n     application of the FMCSR's to most interstate private bus \n     operations such as scout groups and churches. My bill would \n     extend the applicability of FMCSR's to buses used by local \n     education agencies which are used in interstate commerce.\n       Sec. 13: Authorization of Appropriations.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Helms, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Warner, Mr. Lott, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Abraham, Mr. McCain, \n        Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Coats, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Mack, \n        and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1635.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation which \nwill have a profound impact on America's future. I am pleased to be \njoined by the chairman of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations \nCommittees, the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nthe Republican leadership, and other Republicans strongly interested in \nmissile defense, in introducing the Defend America Act of 1996. An \nidentical bill is being introduced in the House by the Speaker and the \nchairmen of the Appropriations Committee and the National Security \nCommittee, among others. This bill addresses the most fundamental \nresponsibility the U.S. Government has to its citizens: to protect them \nfrom harm. At present, the United States has no defense--I repeat--no \ndefense against ballistic missiles.\n  The Defend America Act of 1996 answers the question of whether \nAmericans should be protected from the threat of ballistic missile \nattack with a resounding ``Yes.'' There should be no doubt that we have \nthe technical capability to defend our great Nation from the growing \nthreat of ballistic missiles. What we need is the will and the \nleadership. We have seen no leadership from the White House on this \nissue. Indeed, we have witnessed a complete denial from the highest \nlevels of the administration that there is even a threat to the United \nStates. President Clinton vetoed the fiscal year 1996 Defense \nauthorization bill because it required developing a national missile \ndefense system for deployment by the end of 2003. President Clinton \nrefuses to defend America preferring to rely on the false protection of \nthe cold-war-era antiballistic missile [ABM] treaty.\n\n  The cold war is over and the threat from ballistic missiles is real \nand growing. Among others, North Korea, Iran, Libya, Iraq, and Syria \nare seeking to obtain weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile \ndelivery systems. China and Russia have been engaged in transferring \nrelated components and technologies.\n  Just last week, the former Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, James Woolsey testified before the House National Security \nCommittee on his views of the threat posed by ballistic missiles--as \nwell as the current national intelligence estimate on this threat. I \nwould like to quote from his testimony:\n\n       We are in the midst of an era of revolutionary improvements \n     in missile guidance. These improvements will soon make \n     ballistic missiles much more effective for blackmail purposes \n     . . . even without the need for warheads containing weapons \n     of mass destruction. . . .\n       With such guidance improvements, it is quite reasonable to \n     believe that within a few years Saddam or the Chinese rulers \n     will be able to threaten something far more troubling . . .\n\n  Woolsey went on to say:\n\n       But, in current circumstances, nuclear blackmail threats \n     against the United States may be effectively posed by \n     North Korean intermediate ranged missiles targeted on \n     Alaska or Hawaii, or by Chinese ICBM's targeted on Los \n     Angeles.\n\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\n\n  With respect to the national intelligence estimate, Woolsey \ncriticized the narrow focus of the estimate which concentrated on \nindigenous intercontinental ballistic missile development--as opposed \nto the transfer of such components and technology. As Woolsey pointed \nout, since the end of the cold war, Russia, China, and North Korea have \nbeen actively exporting missile technology and components. Furthermore, \nWoolsey noted that the national intelligence estimate only looked at \nthe threat to the 48 continental States. Well, the last time I checked, \nAlaska and Hawaii were part of the United States. The bottom line is \nthat the threat is real and we cannot wait for it to arrive on our \ndoorstep before we act. As former Assistant Secretary of Defense \nRichard Perle stated before the National Security Committee, and I \nquote:\n\n       If we achieve a defensive capability a little before it is \n     absolutely necessary, no harm will have been done. But if we \n     are too late, the result could be catastrophic. In cases like \n     this, it is always wise to err on the side of too much, too \n     soon, rather than too little, too late.\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation establishes a clear policy to deploy \na national missile defense [NMD] system by the end of 2003, that is \ncapable of providing a highly effective defense of U.S. territory \nagainst limited, unauthorized, or accidental ballistic missile attacks. \nThe bill also specifies the components of a national missile defense \nsystem that are to be developed for deployment, including: An \ninterceptor system, fixed ground-based radars, space-based sensors, and \nbattle management, command, control, and communications.\n  To implement this policy, this legislation directs the Secretary of \nDefense to: Promptly initiate planning to meet this deployment goal; \nconduct by the end of 1998, an integrated systems test using NMD \ncomponents; to use streamlined acquisition procedures to reduce cost \nand increase efficiency; and to develop a follow-on NMD program.\n\n  The Secretary of Defense is also required to submit a detailed report \nto the Congress no later than March 15, 1997, which outlines his plans \nfor implementing this policy, the estimate costs associated with the \ndevelopment and deployment of the NMD system, a cost and operational \neffectiveness analysis of follow-on options, and a determination of the \npoint at which NMD development would conflict with the ABM Treay.\n  With respect to the ABM Treaty, the legislation urges the President \nto bring the Russians on board, by pursuing high-level discussions with \nRussia to amend the ABM Treaty to allow for the deployment of the NMD \nsystem specified in this act. If the Russians do agree, the legislation \nrequires any agreement to be submitted to the Senate for advice and \nconsent. However, if a satisfactory agreement is not reached within a \nyear of the date of enactment of this legislation, the President and \nCongress will consider U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.\n  Mr. President, deploying a national missile defense system--which \nwill protect all 50 States--should be our top defense priority. The \nDefend America Act lays out a realistic and responsible course by which \nwe can do so.\n  A national missile defense system will not only defend, it will \ndeter--by reducing the incentive of rogue regimes to acquire ballistic \nmissiles and weapons of mass destruction.\n  I hope that the White House is listening. Republicans are united and \nclear in their message that America must be defended. We are ready to \nexercise leadership to fulfill our responsibility to all Americans to \nprotect them from ballistic missile attack.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1635\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Defend America Act of \n     1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although the United States possesses the technological \n     means to develop and deploy defensive systems that would be \n     highly effective in countering limited ballistic missile \n     threats to its territory, the United States has not deployed \n     such systems and currently has no policy to do so.\n       (2) The threat that is posed to the national security of \n     the United States by the proliferation of ballistic missiles \n     is significant and growing, both quantitatively and \n     qualitatively.\n       (3) The trend in ballistic missile proliferation is toward \n     longer range and increasingly sophisticated missiles.\n       (4) Several countries that are hostile to the United States \n     (including North Korea, Iran, Libya, and Iraq) have \n     demonstrated an interest in acquiring ballistic missiles \n     capable of reaching the United States.\n       (5) The Intelligence Community of the United States has \n     confirmed that North Korea is developing an intercontinental \n     ballistic missile that will be capable of reaching Alaska or \n     beyond once deployed.\n       (6) There are ways for determined countries to acquire \n     missiles capable of threatening the United States with little \n     warning by means other than indigenous development.\n       (7) Because of the dire consequences to the United States \n     of not being prepared to defend itself against a rogue \n     missile attack and the long-lead time associated with \n     preparing an effective defense, it is prudent to commence a \n     national missile defense deployment effort before new \n     ballistic missile threats to the United States are \n     unambiguously confirmed.\n       (8) The timely deployment by the United States of an \n     effective national missile defense system will reduce the \n     incentives for countries to develop or otherwise acquire \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles, thereby inhibiting as \n     well as countering the proliferation of missiles and weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (9) Deployment by the United States of a national missile \n     defense system will reduce concerns about the threat of an \n     accidental or unauthorized ballistic missile attack on the \n     United States.\n       (10) The offense-only approach to strategic deterrence \n     presently followed by the United States and Russia is \n     fundamentally adversarial and is not a suitable basis for \n     stability in a world in which the United States and the \n     states of the former Soviet Union are seeking to normalize \n     relations and eliminate Cold War attitudes and arrangements.\n       (11) Pursuing a transition to a form of strategic \n     deterrence based increasingly on defensive capabilities and \n     strategies is in the interest of all countries seeking to \n     preserve and enhance strategic stability.\n       (12) The deployment of a national missile defense system \n     capable of defending the United States against limited \n     ballistic missile attacks would (A) strengthen deterrence at \n     the levels of forces agreed to by the United States and \n     Russia under the START I Treaty, and (B) further strengthen \n     deterrence if reductions below START I levels are implemented \n     in the future.\n       (13) Article XIII of the ABM Treaty envisions ``possible \n     changes in the strategic situation which have a bearing on \n     the provisions of this treaty''.\n       (14) Articles XIII and XIV of the treaty establish means \n     for the parties to amend the treaty, and the parties have in \n     the past used those means to amend the treaty.\n       (15) Article XV of the treaty establishes the means for a \n     party to withdraw from the treaty, upon six months notice \n     ``if it decides that extraordinary events related to the \n     subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme \n     interests''.\n       (16) Previous discussions between the United States and \n     Russia, based on Russian President Yeltsin's proposal for a \n     Global Protection System, envisioned an agreement to amend \n     the ABM Treaty to allow (among other measures) deployment of \n     as many as four ground-based interceptor sites in addition to \n     the one site permitted under the ABM Treaty and unrestricted \n     exploitation of sensors based within the atmosphere and in \n     space.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n       (a) It is the policy of the United States to deploy by the \n     end of 2003 a National Missile Defense system that--\n       (1) is capable of providing a highly-effective defense of \n     the territory of the United States against limited, \n     unauthorized, or accidental ballistic missile attacks; and\n       (2) will be augmented over time to provide a layered \n     defense against larger and more sophisticated ballistic \n     missile threats as they emerge.\n       (b) It is the policy of the United States to seek a \n     cooperative transition to a regime that does not feature an \n     offense-only form of deterrence as the basis for strategic \n     stability.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Development of System.--To implement \n     the policy established in section 3(a), the Secretary of \n     Defense shall develop for deployment an affordable and \n     operationally effective National Missile Defense (NMD) system \n     which shall achieve an initial operational capability (IOC) \n     by the end of 2003.\n       (b) Elements of the NMD System.--The system to be developed \n     for deployment shall include the following elements:\n       (1) An interceptor system that optimizes defensive coverage \n     of the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against \n     limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \n     attacks and includes one or a combination of the following:\n       (A) Ground-based interceptors.\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\n       (B) Sea-based interceptors.\n       (C) Space-based kinetic energy interceptors.\n       (D) Space-based directed energy systems.\n       (2) Fixed ground-based radars.\n       (3) Space-based sensors, including the Space and Missile \n     Tracking System.\n       (4) Battle management, command, control, and communications \n     (BM/C3).\n\n     SEC. 5. IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall--\n       (1) upon the enactment of this Act, promptly initiate \n     required preparatory and planning actions that are necessary \n     so as to be capable of meeting the initial operational \n     capability (IOC) date specified in section 4(a);\n       (2) plan to conduct by the end of 1998 an integrated \n     systems test which uses elements (including BM/C3 \n     elements) that are representative of, and traceable to, the \n     national missile defense system architecture specified in \n     section 4(b);\n       (3) prescribe and use streamlined acquisition policies and \n     procedures to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of \n     developing the system specified in section 4(a); and\n       (4) develop an affordable national missile defense follow-\n     on program that--\n       (A) leverages off of the national missile defense system \n     specified in section 4(a), and\n       (B) augments that system, as the threat changes, to provide \n     for a layered defense.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPORT ON PLAN FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM \n                   DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT.\n\n       Not later than March 15, 1997, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the Secretary's plan for \n     development and deployment of a national missile defense \n     system pursuant to this Act. The report shall include the \n     following matters:\n       (1) The Secretary's plan for carrying out this Act, \n     including--\n       (A) a detailed description of the system architecture \n     selected for development under section 4(b); and\n       (B) a discussion of the justification for the selection of \n     that particular architecture.\n       (2) The Secretary's estimate of the amount of \n     appropriations required for research, development, test, \n     evaluation, and for procurement, for each of fiscal years \n     1997 through 2003 in order to achieve the initial operational \n     capability date specified in section 4(a).\n       (3) A cost and operational effectiveness analysis of \n     follow-on options to improve the effectiveness of such \n     system.\n       (4) A determination of the point at which any activity that \n     is required to be carried out under this Act would conflict \n     with the terms of the ABM Treaty, together with a description \n     of any such activity, the legal basis for the Secretary's \n     determination, and an estimate of the time at which such \n     point would be reached in order to meet the initial \n     operational capability date specified in section 4(a).\n\n     SEC. 7. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) ABM Treaty Negotiations.--In light of the findings in \n     section 2 and the policy established in section 3, Congress \n     urges the President to pursue high-level discussions with the \n     Russian Federation to achieve an agreement to amend the ABM \n     Treaty to allow deployment of the national missile defense \n     system being developed for deployment under section 4.\n       (b) Requirement for Senate Advice and Consent.--If an \n     agreement described in subsection (a) is achieved in \n     discussions described in that subsection, the President shall \n     present that agreement to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent. No funds appropriated or otherwise available for any \n     fiscal year may be obligated or expended to implement such an \n     amendment to the ABM Treaty unless the amendment is made in \n     the same manner as the manner by which a treaty is made.\n       (c) Action Upon Failure To Achieve Negotiated Changes \n     Within One Year.--If an agreement described in subsection (a) \n     is not achieved in discussions described in that subsection \n     within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     the President and Congress, in consultation with each other, \n     shall consider exercising the option of withdrawing the \n     United States from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of that treaty.\n\n     SEC. 8. ABM TREATY DEFINED.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the term ``ABM Treaty'' means the \n     Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of \n     Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-\n     Ballistic Missile Systems, and signed at Moscow on May 26, \n     1972, and includes the Protocols to that Treaty, signed at \n     Moscow on July 3, 1974.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am extremely proud to be a principal \ncosponsor of the Defend America Act of 1996, which was introduced by \nSenator Dole today. This legislation will fill a glaring void in U.S. \nnational security policy by requiring the deployment of a national \nmissile defense system by 2003 that is capable of defending the United \nStates against a limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \nattack.\n  Ironically, most Americans already believe that we have such a system \nin place. This assumption is understandable since under the \nConstitution the President's first responsibility is to provide for the \ndefense of the American homeland. Unfortunately, the current President \nhas decided that this obligation is one that can be indefinitely \ndelayed. I join Senator Dole and others today in proclaiming that the \ntime has come to end America's complete vulnerability to ballistic \nmissile blackmail and attack.\n  The President and senior members of the administration have argued \nthat there is no threat to justify deployment of a national missile \ndefense system. This is simply not true. The political and military \nsituation in the former Soviet Union has deteriorated, leading to \ngreater uncertainty over the control and security of Russian strategic \nnuclear forces. China is firing missiles near Taiwan as if it were a \nskeet range, and has even made veiled threats against the United \nStates. North Korea is developing an intercontinental ballistic missile \nthat will be capable of reaching the United States once deployed. Other \nhostile and unpredictable countries, such as Libya, Iran, and Iraq, \nhave made clear their desire to acquire missiles capable of reaching \nthe United States. The technology and knowledge to produce missiles and \nweapons of mass destruction is available on the open market.\n  China's recent provocations against Taiwan highlight the need for the \nUnited States to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as \npossible. Although veiled threats against the United States may be only \nsaber rattling, American military and political leaders should not \nignore them. If the United States possessed even a limited national \nmissile defense system, U.S. decision-makers would have a much greater \ndegree of flexibility in considering our military and diplomatic \noptions. A vulnerable America is not only subject to missile attack, \nbut also to blackmail and intimidation.\n  Last year, President Clinton vetoed the Defense authorization bill \nmainly because it called for deployment of a national missile defense \nsystem. The administration argued that there was no need for such a \nsystem, that the threat is 10 or 15 years away. China has clearly \nillustrated how their judgment is flawed. The threat is here today.\n  If the situation should deteriorate between China and Taiwan, \nPresident Clinton will almost certainly regret the fact that the United \nStates has no means of dealing with Chinese missile threats other than \nby our own nuclear threats. This is hardly a credible response. A \nnational missile defense system, on the other hand, would eliminate the \nrisk and uncertainty that would surely occur if China and the United \nStates engaged in a series of nuclear threats and counterthreats. This \nwould be an invitation for disaster. If we had an operational national \nmissile defense system, we could confidently deal with Chinese missile \nthreats and pursue our policies and objectives without intimidation.\n  The other important factor to bear in mind when considering the need \nfor a national missile defense system, is that such a system can \nactually discourage countries from acquiring long-range missiles in the \nfirst place. In this sense, we should view national missile defense as \na powerful nonproliferation tool, not just something to be considered \nsome time in the future as a response to newly emerging threats.\n  The policy advocated in the Defend America Act of 1996 is virtually \nidentical to that contained in the fiscal year 1996 Defense \nAuthorization Act, which was passed by Congress and vetoed by the \nPresident. Like the legislation vetoed by the President, the Defend \nAmerica Act of 1996 would require that the entire United States be \nprotected against a limited, accidental, or unauthorized attack by the \nyear 2003. It differs from the vetoed legislation in that it provides \nthe Secretary of Defense greater flexibility in determining the precise \narchitecture for the system.\n  The Defend America Act of 1996 urges the President to begin \nnegotiations to amend the AMB Treaty to allow for deployment of an \neffective system. But it also recommends that, if these negotiations \nfail to produce acceptable amendments within 1 year, Congress and the \nPresident should consider withdrawing the United States from the ABM \nTreaty. Nothing in this legislation, however, requires or advocates \nabrogation or violation of the ABM Treaty.\n  Mr. President, 3 months ago, the President of the United States \nvetoed\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\nthe Defense authorization bill because he opposed the deployment of a \nsystem to defend the American people against ballistic missile attack. \nToday, I am honored to join Senator Dole in sending a clear message--we \nwill not stand idly by while the United States remains undefended \nagainst a real and growing threat. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday will fulfill a constitutional, strategic, and moral obligation \nthat has been neglected for 4 years.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this legislation \nto establish a policy for deploying a national defense system for the \nUnited States. This bill, the National Missile Defense Act of 1996, \nreturns the United States on a clear path toward deploying a system to \ndefend the American people against limited, accidental, or unauthorized \nballistic missile attacks.\n  In 1991, the Congress enacted the first Missile Defense Act, in a \nbipartisan effort to give direction to the Strategic Defense Initiative \nprogram, now known as the Ballistic Missile Defense program. The need \nfor theater missile defense systems had been tragically demonstrated \nduring the Persian Gulf war, and it was clear that the potential \nthreats to our continent would continue to exist, even with the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union.\n  Subsequently, that policy was watered down and its deployment \nobjectives were delayed time and again. I congratulate Senator Dole for \ntaking the lead today in restoring much-needed direction to our \nnational missile defense efforts.\n  Our Nation has invested over $38 billion on missile defense programs \nover the past 15 years, with very little effective defensive capability \nto show for it. We are at a turning point in the development of \ncapabilities to effectively defend our citizens and our troops deployed \noverseas from the devastating effects of ballistic missile attacks.\n  We should focus our missile defense programs on the risk of \naccidental or unauthorized missile launch, missile proliferation in the \nThird World, and particularly the risk of theater missile attacks on \nour forces and allies.\n  Deployment of effective, mobile theater missile defense systems for \nour troops in the field should be our first priority. To do so requires \nan evaluation of the many ongoing research programs to determine which \ndemonstrates the most promise for deployable capability against \nbattlefield missile attacks.\n  I am greatly disappointed that the administration chose to ignore \nCongressional direction and cut the theater missile defense funding \napproved by the Congress last year. The core programs identified in the \nfiscal year 1996 Defense authorization bill, including both lower and \nupper tier systems, must be fully funded to ensure the most effective \nprotection for our troops in the field. I fully expect Congress to \nrestore the funding and restate the programmatic direction to make \nthese systems available to our forces.\n  At the same time, we must develop a deployment plan for an initial \nnational missile defense system to provide an effective defense of U.S. \nterritory against limited ballistic missile attacks. This bill \nestablishes a goal of 2003 to deploy such a system and directs the \nSecretary of Defense to develop a plan to implement that goal. It is \nnow up to the Congress to provide the funding to develop and procure \nthe most cost-effective system.\n  Both efforts, toward theater and national missile defense systems, \nmust balance the critical need for defenses with the reality of fiscal \nconstraints. Every effort should be made to engage our allies both \nfinancially and technically in developing these systems.\n  Mr. President, the threat of proliferation is too great to ignore. We \nmust not replace the nuclear confrontation of the cold war with \nvulnerability to dictators, extremists, and nations who threaten us \nwith nuclear blackmail, or our forces and allies with missile attack. \nWithout effective, deployed missile defense systems, we remain at risk.\n  I intend to work with Senator Dole to achieve early passage of this \nlegislation in the Senate, and I urge President Clinton to approve it \nto ensure the safety of the American people.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am proud to join the Republican \nleadership of both the Senate and the House, and all Republican members \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee, as an original cosponsor of the \nDefend America Act of 1996. I call on all Members of Congress to join \nus in our effort to protect the citizens of the United States from \nballistic missile attack.\n  Earlier this year, President Clinton's veto of the Defense \nauthorization bill forced us to reluctantly drop the important national \nmissile defense provisions that we had included in that bill. At that \ntime, we promised that we would be back with separate legislation to \nprovide for the defense of the United States. With the introduction of \ntoday's legislation, we have fulfilled that promise and will continue \nthe fight until this legislation is enacted into law--over President \nClinton's veto, if necessary.\n  Many Americans find it hard to believe that we currently have no \nsystem in place which could defend our Nation against even a single \nintercontinental ballistic missile strike. This, despite the fact that \nRussia and China currently have the capability to reach our shores with \ntheir intercontinental ballistic missiles; and North Korea is well on \nits way to deploying a long-range missile capable of striking Alaska. \nIn addition, over 30 nations now have short-range ballistic missiles--\n30 nations, many hostile to the United States. As China's saber \nrattling against Taiwan continues, we hear reports of veiled threats \nfrom China of a missile attack against California--something they are \nvery capable of doing. And today's papers report that Iraq continues to \npossess Scud missiles.\n  The need for defenses against these capabilities is clear. The cold \nwar may be over, but the desire of more and more nations to acquire \nballistic missiles is growing.\n  But the Clinton administration believes there is no threat, and they \nhave presented the Congress with a defense budget request which ``slow \nrolls'' our ballistic missile defense efforts. The American people \ndeserve better.\n  That is why I have long been in the forefront of the Republican \neffort to provide both our troops deployed overseas and Americans here \nat home with adequate defenses to counter the very real threat of \nballistic missile attack. I drafted the Missile Defense Act of 1991 \nwhich--in the aftermath of the Iraqi Scud missile attacks--set the \nUnited States on the path to acquiring and deploying theater and \nnational missile defense systems. I also joined with my Republican \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee in drafting the Missile \nDefense Act of 1995, an update of the earlier Missile Defense Act. \nUnfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, President Clinton's veto stopped \nthat Republican effort to defend Americans.\n  The Defend America Act calls for the deployment of a national missile \ndefense (NMD) system to protect the United States against limited, \nunauthorized or accidental ballistic missile attacks. It is important \nto emphasize that we are talking about a limited system--one that would \nprovide a highly effective capability against a limited ballistic \nmissile attack. This is precisely the type of defensive system we need \nto deal with the threats we are facing in the post-cold-war world.\n  A key difference between the Defend America Act and the missile \ndefense legislation adopted last year, is that the current bill does \nnot require the deployment of a specific NMD system. Rather, it \nestablishes the requirement to deploy a system by a date certain, but \nleaves it to the Secretary of Defense to propose a plan by March 15, \n1997, to implement this requirement. This is a prudent approach which \nfocuses the debate on the real issue--do you want to defend the \nAmerican people against ballistic missile attacks?\n  Mr. President, we all remember the Iraqi Scud missile attacks on our \nforces in Saudi Arabia, and our friends in Israel. I was in Tel Aviv \nduring the last Scud attack--February 18, 1991.\n  I do not want to see U.S. citizens subjected to the terror I \nwitnessed in Israel. I pray that we never see a time when Americans are \nforced to carry gas masks around because some madman is threatening our \nshores. We owe it to our citizens to take action now--before it is too \nlate--to provide them with effective defenses against these types of \nattacks.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the legislation \nintroduced today by Senator Dole regarding\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\nnational missile defense. I am proud to be an original cosponsor, and I \nwant to commend Senator Dole for his steadfast commitment to defending \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is walking a very dangerous tightrope. For \nreasons that are unknown and certainly inconceivable to most Americans, \nPresident Clinton refuses to defend our country against ballistic \nmissiles, even though the technology to do so is available today.\n  The truth is our Nation is absolutely, completely vulnerable to \nballistic missiles. We have no defense whatsoever against a missile \ntargeted on our territory, our industry, our national treasures, or our \npeople. The Patriot missiles that everyone remembers from Desert Storm \n5 years ago are not capable of stopping a long-range missile. In fact, \nthey can only defend very small areas against short-range missiles. The \nPatriot is a point-defense system that we send along with our troops \nwhen they go into harm's way.\n  But here at home we have no defenses against long-range missiles \nbased in China, in Russia, or in North Korea. We have no defenses \nagainst the missiles that Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya are so \nvigorously seeking to acquire. That is the truth. That is a fact. And \nthat is unacceptable.\n  When told of this situation, the vast majority of Americans become \nenraged. They cannot understand why their elected Representatives would \nleave them defenseless against the likes of Saddam Hussein, Mu'ammar \nQadhafi, or Kim Jong-Il. They cannot understand why the tax dollars \nthat they contribute for national defense are not being used to protect \nthem. Frankly, they have every right to be upset. There is simply no \nexcuse.\n\n  The Congress agrees with the American people and took action last \nyear to defend all Americans against ballistic missiles, whatever their \nsource. In the Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1996, \nCongress established a program to develop and deploy a national missile \ndefense system for the United States. This program was not some \nelaborate star wars concept, but rather, a very modest yet capable \nground-based system that would provide a limited defense of America \nagainst accidental, unauthorized, or hostile missile attacks.\n  But President Clinton vetoed the Defense bill specifically because of \nthe requirement to defend America. In fact, in his statement of \nadministration policy, the President called national missile defense \nquote ``unwarranted and unnecessary.''\n  Mr. President, that is a very insightful quote, and it gets right to \nthe heart of the differences between President Clinton, Presidential \ncandidate Bob Dole, and the Republican Congress. To President Clinton, \nproviding for the common defense is ``unwarranted and unnecessary.'' To \nthe Congress and Senator Dole, it is the most fundamental of our \nconstitutional responsibilities.\n  Simply put, this is a defining issue. It is an issue that defines our \nNation's character and commitment to its people. It is an issue that \ndefines the two parties. It is an issue that defines the very basic \ndifference between two men who are seeking the Presidency. It is an \nissue that history will undoubtedly look back and pass judgment upon \nand, for better or worse, it is an issue that will define our \ngeneration.\n  Mr. President, if we fail to take action to defend America now, while \nwe still have the chance, we will certainly regret it. At some point in \nthe very near future, we will have waited too long. The theoretical \nthreat of a hostile ballistic missile launch will have become a \nreality. And we will have no defense against it.\n  What will it take for President Clinton to recognize this threat? \nMust a ballistic missile equipped with a chemical, biological, or \nnuclear warhead rain down upon citizens before he will act? Must tens \nof thousands of Americans perish before he corrects this terrible \nvulnerability.\n  To those of us who are cosponsoring this legislation, the answer is, \n``No.'' The time to act is now, not tomorrow. Our Nation is in \njeopardy. Ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction are \nspreading throughout the world and we cannot stop them. In fact, some \n30 nations currently possess, or are actively acquiring, weapons of \nmass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.\n  Just yesterday, the United Nations admitted that Iraq is covertly \nstoring up to 16 ballistic missiles armed with chemical or biological \nwarheads. Iraq is the most inspected and thoroughly monitored country \nin the world. If we cannot find these missiles in the deserts of Iraq, \nhow can we expect to track them in the mountains and valleys of China, \nNorth Korea, Iran, or Syria?\n  The answer is, We can't, and even if we could, we have no system to \ncounter them. The only solution is to develop missile defenses. This \nbill does just that, and would require that our Nation deploy a \nnational missile defense system capable of protecting all Americans by \nthe year 2003.\n  Mr. President, this is not about politics. It is not about \npartisanship. It is about national security and keeping faith with \nthose who elected us and those who depend upon us to safeguard their \nlives and property. If we ignore this obligation, we will have failed \nin our most fundamental constitutional responsibility. To me that is \nunacceptable. It runs against every principle that I stand for, and as \nlong as I have a breath in my body, I will fight to prevent that from \nhappening.\n  Mr. President, I want to again thank the distinguished majority \nleader for bringing this issue before the Senate. He does our Nation a \nprofound service by highlighting the missile defense issue, and I am \nproud to cosponsor this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1637. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to revise \nthe tax rules on expatriation, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                the expatriation tax reform act of 1996\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the time has come to close one of \nthe most outrageous tax loopholes on our books today. In fact, it is so \noutrageous, it's hard to believe.\n  But today a small number of very wealthy individuals--often \nbillionaires--can renounce their U.S. citizenship in order to avoid \npaying their fair share of taxes. And under current law, those same \nindividuals can still live in the U.S. for up to half a year--tax-free.\n  That's right. Amazingly, the current tax code has a loophole big \nenough for the super rich to fly their private jets right through. I \ncall it the Benedict Arnold loophole. You can turn your back on the \ncountry that made you rich--to get even richer.\n  In many cases, those same people come right back to the United \nStates. They spend up to 6 months here and claim to be citizens of \nanother country just so they can skip out on their tax bill.\n  In one case, for example, a very wealthy American acquired \ncitizenship in Belize, a small country along the Caribbean coast. Soon \nthereafter, Belize tried to set up a counsel's office in Florida where \ntheir new citizen had his factories. That way their new ``counsel'' \ncould live in the U.S. for a large part of the year without paying his \nU.S. taxes. Ultimately, this was not allowed, but these types of games \nshould be stopped once and for all.\n  Hard working, tax paying, middle-class Americans have every right to \nbe outraged by these tax loopholes. They are costing Americans about \n$1.5 billion. And the money these wealthy tax cheats fail to pay is \nadding to our debt and to the bill that our kids will one day be forced \nto pay. That's unconscionable.\n  The bill I am introducing today says enough is enough: It's time to \nclose the Benedict Arnold loophole. My legislation provides that if \nthese so called ``expatriates'' spend 30 days in the United States they \nmust pay their full taxes as a resident alien. Essentially, they would \nbe treated like a resident alien, similar to how a U.S. citizen is \ntreated.\n  In addition, my bill provides that--upon renouncing their \ncitizenship--these individuals would pay taxes on all of their gains, \nincluding those not yet sold. Under current law they can effectively \nescape paying their fair share of taxes by delaying the sale of their \nassets through available loopholes. The Senate passed a provision in \nlast year's Budget Reconciliation bill, but it was gutted in \nconference.\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\n  Where there is a problem with a bilateral tax treaty, the Secretary \nof the Treasury may waive the provision for that individual.\n  I hope that the bill I am introducing today become law this year. I \nurge the Senate to support and pass this common sense measure that will \nsave taxpayer $1.5 billion.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. Glenn, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Kerrey, \n        Mr. Bennett, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1638. A bill to promote peace and security in South Asia; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n        THE SOUTH ASIA PEACE AND SECURITY PROMOTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today along with my colleagues, Senators \nGlenn, D'Amato, John Kerry, Bennett, and Feinstein, I am introducing \nlegislation in an effort to restore credibility to our Nation's already \ndamaged nuclear nonproliferation policy. Nonproliferation is one of our \nmost important national security concerns, if not the most important. \nEven the President admitted last year that no issue is more important \nto the security of all people than nuclear nonproliferation.\n  At present, our efforts in this area are tied to another vital goal: \nthe promotion of peace and security in South Asia. I have visited South \nAsia. I have said before it is a region of striking contrasts--a region \nof such enormous potential clouded by tension and instability.\n  As all of us well know, last year President Clinton requested, and \nCongress agreed to, a one time exception and partial repeal of one our \nmost important nonproliferation laws: the so-called Pressler amendment. \nThe Pressler amendment, approved by Congress in 1985, prohibits United \nStates military and nonmilitary assistance to Pakistan, including arms \nsales, so long as Pakistan possesses a nuclear explosive device. The \nSenate had an extensive debate on this subject last fall. As a result \nof last year's exception--known as the Brown amendment--approximately \n370 million dollars' worth of American military goods is scheduled for \ndelivery to Pakistan.\n  The Brown amendment was very controversial. The central point of the \ncontroversy was the fact that the Brown amendment was both waiving and \nrepealing nuclear nonproliferation law without obtaining one concrete \nnonproliferation concession from Pakistan. We have never provided that \nkind of exception to any other country before. That was one of the \ncentral reasons why I opposed the Brown amendment. I feared it would \nsend the worst possible message: Nuclear proliferation pays.\n  The Clinton administration lobbied the Congress quite heavily on the \nBrown amendment. The administration even tried to convince Members of \nCongress that Pakistan did make a nonproliferation concession. The \nClinton administration claimed its support for the Brown amendment was \nbased in part on an understanding it believed it had with the \nGovernment of Pakistan. On August 3, 1995, Acting Secretary of State \nPeter Tarnoff stated the context of this understanding in a letter to \nthe distinguished ranking member and former chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Nunn:\n\n       Pakistan knows that the decision to resolve the equipment \n     problem is based on the assumption that there will be no \n     significant change on nuclear and missile non-proliferation \n     issues of concern to the United States.\n\n  Frankly, at the time, I felt the justification was too weak at best \nand unbelievable at worst. I say that from the standpoint of \nexperience. You see, the Pressler amendment was passed with a similar \nassurance from Pakistan. Let me remind my colleagues that the Pressler \namendment was designed to ensure that Pakistan--at that time our \nNation's third largest foreign aid recipient--continued to receive \nUnited States assistance. We had an understanding that Pakistan would \nnot develop a bomb program, and in return, we would pass the Pressler \namendment so that our existing laws would not result in a United States \naid cutoff. As we all know, they did build a bomb program, and \ncontinued to receive U.S. taxpayer dollars. So I had some serious \nmisgivings and a sense of foreboding when the Clinton administration \nstated it was basing its support of the Brown amendment on an assurance \nfrom Pakistan.\n  But that was then, this is now. Now we have a clear, unequivocal \nstatement by the Director of Central Intelligence that Pakistan did not \naccept the administration's position in August. This is what Director \nJohn Deutch told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on \nFebruary 22:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, the intelligence community continues to get \n     accurate and timely information on Chinese activities that \n     involve inappropriate weapons technology assistance to other \n     countries: nuclear technology to Pakistan, M-11 missiles to \n     Pakistan, cruise missiles to Iran.\n\n  For the record, I would like to point out that the Director said ``M-\n11 missiles,'' not ``M-11 missile technology.''\n  So, the administration's assumption that the Government of Pakistan \nwould freeze development of its bomb program was erroneous. Our \nintelligence community has found ``accurate and timely information'' \nthat Pakistan has, indeed, made significant changes on nuclear and \nmissile proliferation issues of concern to the United States. The \nnuclear technology to which Director Deutch alluded would allow \nPakistan a 100-percent increase in its capacity to make enriched \nuranium, the explosive material of nuclear weapons. The M-11s are \nmodern, mobile, nuclear capable ballistic missiles and clearly intended \nto be the principal delivery system of the Pakistani nuclear weapons \nsystem.\n\n  With the underlying assumption of the administration's position now \ndestroyed, there is no longer any justification for the \nadministration's support of the Brown amendment. The administration has \nthe authority to put the Brown amendment on hold. Federal law \nspecifically states that if the President determines that a country has \ndelivered or received ``nuclear enrichment equipment, materials or \ntechnology,'' no funds may be made available under the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961, which would include military equipment \npurchased with Foreign Military Sales [FMS]. All the President needs to \ndo is enforce our nonproliferation laws and most, if not all of the \nmilitary equipment provided by the Brown amendment remains undelivered. \nThat is what I urged the President to do last month.\n  Sadly, even though Pakistan broke its assurance to the Clinton \nadministration, it has been reported yesterday that the President \nintends to go through with the transfer. This is stunning news. The \nBrown amendment alone was a tough blow to our nonproliferation policy. \nNow the Clinton administration is preparing to cripple our already \nshaken credibility as an enforcer of nuclear nonproliferation. If that \nis the President's decision, and I certainly hope he reconsiders, then \nthe law requires that he make an appropriate certification to the \nCongress. This gives Congress two options: First, it could disapprove \nof the President's certification. Under the law it would have 30 days \nto do that. Or, should a certification not be forthcoming, it could \nenact the legislation I am introducing today. This bill, which I \nintroduce with bipartisan support, simply repeals the Brown amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe passage of this legislation is necessary if \nour Nation's nuclear nonproliferation policy is to have any \ncredibility. Indeed, beyond the simple policy justifications for this \nlegislation, I urge my colleagues to keep in mind the circumstance that \nbrings me to the floor today. As I stated a moment ago, Pakistan's \nreceipt of nuclear technology from China is a sanctionable offense, as \nis its receipt of M-11 missile technology. What makes these offenses \ndisturbing is that they were occurring while Pakistan was lobbying the \nadministration and Congress to waive and partially repeal nuclear \nnonproliferation law. Equally disturbing are reports that members of \nthe Clinton administration knew of the ring magnet transfer at that \ntime, but did not divulge this information to members of Congress. The \nirony would be humorous if the issue wasn't so serious.\n\n  I believe that if all my colleagues were aware of this blatant \nviolation of our non-proliferation laws last fall, the Brown amendment \nwould have failed. Indeed, a supporter of the Brown amendment, \nCongressman Doug Bereuter, admitted that if the Brown amendment was \nreconsidered, its passage would be unlikely. I am confident\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\nenough that this Congress understands the seriousness of this matter \nand would agree that we need to repeal the Brown amendment or at least \nsuspend its implementation until the underlying policy of the \nadministration is restored--that being the return of the ring magnets \nand the M-11s from Pakistan to China.\n  Mr. President, finally a word about South Asia. Also on February 22, \nCIA Director Deutch named South Asia as his No. 1 worry in the annual \nworld wide threat assessment. He noted, ``the potential for conflict is \nhigh.'' Just a few weeks ago, the Washington Post reported that \nPakistan is preparing for a possible nuclear weapons test. Even a \nlimited nuclear exchange between Pakistan and India would result in \ndeaths and destruction on an unprecedented scale in world history. \nUnder the circumstances, I feel it would be the height of \nirresponsibility to allow for military aid to one side in such an \nunstable environment. The aftermath of the Brown amendment is proof \nthat our relationship with India is impacted by United States \nnonproliferation policy. Because of India's unsafeguarded nuclear \nprogram, there is no United States-Indian agreement for nuclear \ncooperation. United States military cooperation with India is virtually \nnonexistent. The United States will not export certain forms of missile \nequipment and technology to India and any other goods that are related \nto weapons of mass destruction. It is true that United States sanctions \nhave not been invoked against India, but that is because India has not \nviolated its commitments under United States law.\n  I stand ready to seek a commonsense approach to improve our relations \nwith all the countries in South Asia. We need a commonsense approach to \ndeal with the problems in that troubled region. Illicit narcotics \ntrafficking, terrorism, economic stagnation, and weapons proliferation \nare just some of the issues that plague South Asia. We must seek ways \nto help these countries address all these problems. I am ready to start \nthat process. We can start by repealing the Brown amendment and begin \nworking on an approach that serves the mutual interests of the people \nof the United States and the people of South Asia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROMOTION OF PEACE AND SECURITY IN SOUTH ASIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The American people fervently desire that all the \n     peoples of South Asia enjoy peace and share an increased \n     sense of security.\n       (2) The peace and security of South Asia are threatened by \n     an arms race, particularly the spread of weapons of mass \n     destruction and their modern delivery systems.\n       (3) Congress has granted both a one-time exception to and \n     partial repeal of United States nuclear nonproliferation laws \n     in order to permit the Government of Pakistan to receive \n     certain United States military equipment and training and \n     limited economic aid.\n       (4) The exception and partial repeal was based on direct \n     assurances to the United States Government that ``there will \n     be no significant change on nuclear and missile \n     nonproliferation issues of concern to the United States''.\n       (5) The Director of Central Intelligence has informed \n     Congress that Pakistan has taken recent delivery of ``nuclear \n     technology'' and ``M-11 missiles'' from the People's Republic \n     of China.\n       (6) The justification for the exception to and partial \n     repeal of United States nonproliferation laws is no longer \n     valid.\n       (b) Repeal.--Section 620E of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2375) is amended to read as if the amendments \n     made to such section by section 559 of the Foreign \n     Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act, 1996 (Public Law 104-107) had not been \n     made.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last September the Senate approved an \namendment offered by Senator Brown that allowed the administration to \ndeliver hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military equipment to \nPakistan. In doing so, we decided to ignore Pakistan's continuing \nefforts to acquire nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles to carry \nthem, and we turned our backs on United States non-proliferation law \nand international arms control agreements. Today, I am pleased to \ncosponsor a bill being introduced by Senator Pressler that will repeal \nthis misguided provision and will help put U.S. nonproliferation policy \nback on track.\n  During Senate consideration of the Brown amendment, the proponents, \nincluding the administration, argued that transferring the military \nequipment would remove what had become an irritant in our relations \nwith Pakistan and would result in enhanced cooperation on \nnonproliferation issues. Unfortunately, the opposite has happened.\n  Even as we debated the Brown amendment we had clear and convincing \nevidence that Pakistan had received M-11 ballistic missiles from \nChina--a sanctionable offense under the Missile Technology Control \nRegime. We now know that Pakistan also has continued to pursue its \nNuclear Weapons Program. In an unclassified hearing earlier this year, \nDirector of Central Intelligence John Deutch testified to the \nIntelligence Committee that he was especially concerned about Pakistani \nefforts to acquire nuclear technology. Although he did not provide \ndetails, the press has reported that last summer China sent Pakistan \nspecialized magnets for use in centrifuges to produce enriched uranium. \nSuch a transfer would violate the 1994 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act. \nFinally, Director Deutch told the Intelligence Committee that Pakistan \nwas likely to test a nuclear weapon if India did, hardly the restraint \nwe were promised.\n  Since the late 1970's the Pakistani Government has repeatedly assured \nthe United States that it does not possess nuclear weapons despite our \ncertainty that it does. As recently as November of 1994, Prime Minister \nBhutto said in an interview with David Frost ``We have neither \ndetonated one, nor have we got nuclear weapons.'' Now they are \npracticing the same deception with regard to acquiring missiles from \nChina. In July of 1995, a press release from the Pakistan Embassy \nasserted that ``Pakistan has not acquired the M-11 or any other missile \nfrom China that violates the Missile Technology Control Regime.'' The \nevidence to the contrary is, in my opinion, overwhelming.\n  Pakistan has been a friend and ally of the United States since its \nindependence. But how many times can you let a friend mislead you and \nhow many times can you let a friend put you in danger before you are \nforced to change the nature of the relationship. This is not a question \nof whether we want good relations with Pakistan. Of course we do. We \nwant good relations with all countries, but the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and the delivery systems to carry them is \nfar more important to our national security than relations with any one \ncountry. Indeed, this is one of the most important national security \nissues facing us today.\n  I congratulate my colleague from South Dakota for his leadership on \nthis issue and I am pleased to cosponsor his legislation. I hope that \nwe can address this issue before the transfer of this equipment is \ncompleted.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \n        Gramm):\n  S. 1639. A bill to require the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services to carry out a demonstration project to \nprovide the Department of Defense with reimbursement from the Medicare \nProgram for health care services provided to Medicare-eligible \nbeneficiaries under TRICARE; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    medicare subvention legislation\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation \nwhich will demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Medicare reimbursement \nto the Department of Defense [DOD] for treatment of military \nbeneficiaries age 65 and older. This bill will enable these individuals \nto enroll in Tricare Prime and be treated in military hospitals.\n\n\n                        current system is flawed\n\n  As I am sure my colleagues know, Tricare is DOD's new managed health \ncare program. While Tricare has merit, it also has flaws: It bars all \nMedicare-eligible retirees and family members from enrolling in Tricare \nPrime. In fact, all career military members and their families \neventually will be affected, because even those who enroll now will be \ndropped from Tricare at age 65, when they become eligible for\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\nMedicare. In my view, this breaks long standing health care commitments \nto retirees, may increase costs, and affect military readiness.\n\n\n                        identifying the problem\n\n  Current law inadvertently encourages DOD and Medicare to work against \neach other. As the defense budget tightens, DOD has a strong incentive \nto push older retirees and families out of the military medical system \nand back into Medicare, although Medicare probably costs both the \nGovernment and retirees more money than care under the military system. \nTheoretically, Medicare-eligible retirees may still use military \nhospitals on a space-available basis. However, space-available care is \nrapidly becoming nonexistent as military facilities downsize and \nTricare expands across the country.\n\n\n                  medicare subvention is the solution\n\n  It seems to me, the solution to this problem is to change the law to \nallow Medicare subvention, allowing Medicare to reimburse DOD for care \nprovided to older beneficiaries enrolling in Tricare Prime or otherwise \nusing military hospitals.\n\n\n               demonstration test of medicare subvention\n\n  We need to demonstrate to the interested parties, Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and Department of Defense, that subvention \nis indeed a feasible and cost-effective program. Therefore I am \nintroducing the legislation which gives those agencies the authority to \nconduct such a test. I believe this test will justify implementing \nsubvention and allow those eligible military retirees over 65 to \nparticipate in Tricare Prime and receive care in military hospitals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1639\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT \n                   OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FOR HEALTH CARE \n                   PROVIDED TO MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES \n                   UNDER TRICARE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     and subject to subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense and \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall enter into \n     an agreement in order to carry out a demonstration project \n     under which the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     reimburses the Secretary of Defense, on a capitated basis, \n     from the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) for certain health care \n     services provided by the Secretary of Defense to medicare-\n     eligible military beneficiaries through the TRICARE program.\n       (b) Project Requirements.--(1)(A) The Secretary of Defense \n     shall budget for and expend on health care services in each \n     region in which the demonstration project is carried out an \n     amount equal to the amount that the Secretary would otherwise \n     budget for and expend on such services in the absence of the \n     project.\n       (B) The Secretary may not be reimbursed under the project \n     for health care services provided to medicare-eligible \n     military beneficiaries in a region until the amount expended \n     by the Secretary to provide health care services in that \n     region exceeds the amount budgeted for health care services \n     in that region under subparagraph (A).\n       (2) The agreement between the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide that the \n     cost to the medicare program of providing services under the \n     project does not exceed the cost that the medicare program \n     would otherwise incur in providing such services in the \n     absence of the project.\n       (3) The authority of the Secretary of Defense to carry out \n     the project shall expire 3 years after the date of the \n     commencement of the project.\n       (c) Reports.--Not later than 14 months after the \n     commencement of the demonstration project under subsection \n     (a), and annually thereafter until the year following the \n     year in which the project is terminated, the Secretary of \n     Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     jointly submit to Congress a report on the demonstration \n     project. The report shall include the following:\n       (1) The number of medicare-eligible military beneficiaries \n     provided health care services under the project during the \n     previous year.\n       (2) An assessment of the benefits to such beneficiaries of \n     receiving health care services under the project.\n       (3) A description of the cost-shifting, if any, among \n     medical care programs of the Department of Defense that \n     results from the project.\n       (4) A description of the cost-shifting, if any, from the \n     Department to the medicare program that results from

GRAZING FEE.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) The fee for each animal unit month in \n     a grazing fee year to be determined by the Secretary and the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall be equal to the three-year \n     average of the total gross value production for beef cattle \n     for the three years preceeding the grazing fee year, \n     multiplied by the ten-year average of the United States \n     Treasury Securities six-month bill ``new issue'' rate, \n     divided by twelve: Provided, That the grazing fee shall not \n     be less than $1.50 per animal unit month.\n       (2) The gross value of production for beef cattle shall be \n     determined by the Economic Research Service of the Department \n     of Agriculture in accordance with subsection (e)(1).\n       (b) Definition of Animal Unit Month.--For billing purposes \n     only, the term ``animal unit month'' means one month's use \n     and occupancy of range by--\n       (1) one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, burro, or mule; or \n     seven sheep or goats; each of which is six months of age or \n     older on the date on which the animal begins grazing on \n     Federal land;\n       (2) any such animal regardless of age if the animal is \n     weaned on the date on which the animal begins grazing on \n     Federal lands; and\n       (3) any such animal that will become twelve months of age \n     during the period of use authorized under a grazing permit or \n     lease.\n       (c) Livestock Not Counted.--There shall not be counted as \n     an animal unit month the use of Federal land for grazing by \n     an animal that is less than six months of age on the date \n     which the animal begins grazing on Federal land and that is \n     the natural progeny of an animal on which a grazing fee is \n     paid if the animal is removed from the Federal land before \n     becoming twelve months of age.\n       (d) Other Fees and Charges.--(1) A service charge shall be \n     assessed for each crossing permit, transfer of grazing \n     preference, and replacement or supplemental billing notice \n     except in a case in which the action is initiated by the \n     authorized officer.\n       (2) The fees and charges under section 304(a) of the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1734(a)) shall reflect processing costs and shall be adjusted \n     periodically as costs change.\n       (3) Notice of a change in a service charge shall be \n     published in the Federal Register.\n       (e) Criteria for ERS.--(1) The Economic Research Service of \n     the Department of Agriculture shall continue to compile and \n     report the gross value of production of beef cattle, on a \n     dollars-per-bred-cow basis for the United States, as \n     currently published in ``Economic Indicators of the Farm \n     Sector: Cost of Production--Major Field Crops and Livestock \n     and Dairy'' (Cow-calf production cash costs and returns).\n       (2) For the purposes of a determining a grazing fee for a \n     given grazing fee year, the gross value of production (as \n     defined in subsection (a)) for the previous calendar year \n     shall be made available to the Secretary and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, and published in the Federal Register, on or \n     before February 15 of each year.\n\n     SEC. 116. USE OF STATE SHARE OF GRAZING FEE RECEIPTS.\n\n       Section 10 of the Act of June 28, 1934 (commonly known as \n     the ``Taylor Grazing Act'') (43 U.S.C. 315i) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``the benefit of'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``investment in all forms of on-\n     the-ground improvements that benefit rangeland resources, and \n     for support of local public schools in''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``the benefit of'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``investment in all forms of on-\n     the-ground improvements that benefit rangeland resources, and \n     for support of local public schools in''.\n\n     SEC. 117. CONSIDERATION OF ACTIONS BY AFFILIATES\n\n       In issuing or renewing grazing permits or leases, the \n     Secretary may only consider acts undertaken by--\n       (1) the permittee or lessee;\n       (2) persons under the direct control of the permittee or \n     lessee; or\n       (3) persons acting in collusion with the permittee or \n     lessee.\n\n              Title II--Management of National Grasslands\n\n     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``National Grasslands \n     Management Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the inclusion of the National Grasslands within the \n     National Forest System has prevented the Secretary of \n     Agriculture from effectively administering and promoting \n     grassland agriculture on National Grasslands as originally \n     intended under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act;\n       (2) the National Grasslands can be more effectively managed \n     by the Secretary of Agriculture if administered as a separate \n     entity outside of the National Forest System; and\n       (3) a grazing program on National Grasslands can be \n     responsibly carried out while protecting and preserving \n     recreational, environmental, and other multiple uses of the \n     National Grasslands.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide for \n     improved management and more efficient administration of \n     grazing activities on National Grasslands while preserving \n     and protecting multiple uses of such lands, including but not \n     limited to preserving hunting, fishing, and recreational \n     activities, and protecting wildlife and wildlife habitat in \n     accordance with applicable laws.\n\n     SEC. 203. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this title, the term--\n       (1) ``National Grasslands'' means those areas managed as \n     National Grasslands by the Secretary of Agriculture under \n     title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1010-1012) on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     title; and\n       (2) ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n     SEC. 204.

Such regulations \n     shall facilitate the efficient administration of grazing and \n     provide protection for environmental values, including but \n     not limited to wildlife and wildlife habitat, and Federal \n     lands equivalent to that on units of the National Forest \n     System.\n       (e) Conforming Amendment to Bankhead-Jones Act.--Section 31 \n     of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. 1010) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``To accomplish the purposes of title III of this Act, the \n     Secretary is authorized and directed to develop a separate \n     program of land conservation and utilization for the National \n     Grasslands, in order thereby to correct maladjustments in \n     land use, and thus assist in promoting grassland agriculture \n     and secure occupancy and economic stability of farms and \n     ranches, controlling soil erosion, reforestation, preserving \n     and protecting natural resources, protecting fish and \n     wildlife and their habitat, developing and protecting \n     recreational opportunities and facilities, mitigating floods, \n     preventing impairment of dams and reservoirs, developing \n     energy resources, conserving surface and subsurface moisture, \n     protecting the watersheds of navigable streams, and \n     protecting the public lands, health, safety, and welfare, but \n     not to build industrial parks or commercial enterprises.''.\n       (f) Hunting, Fishing, and Recreational Activities.--Nothing \n     in this title shall be construed as limiting or precluding \n     hunting or fishing activities on National Grasslands in \n     accordance with applicable Federal and State laws, nor shall \n     appropriate recreational activities be limited or precluded.\n       (g) Valid Existing Rights.--Nothing in this title shall \n     affect valid existing rights, reservations, agreements, or \n     authorizations. Section 1323(a) of Public Law 96-487 shall \n     continue to apply to non-Federal lands and interests therein \n     within the boundaries of the National Grasslands.\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\n       (h) Fees and Charges.--Fees and charges for livestock \n     grazing on the National Grasslands shall be determined in \n     accordance with section 115 of this Act, except that the \n     Secretary may adjust the grazing fee to compensate for \n     approved conservation practice expenditures.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      PRESSLER AMENDMENT NO. 3560\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER proposed an amendment to amendment No. 3555 proposed by \nMr. Domenici to the bill (S. 1459) to provide for uniform management of \nlivestock grazing on Federal land, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In section 202(a)(3), after ``preserving'' insert \n     ``sporting,''.\n       In section 202(b), strike ``hunting, fishing, and \n     recreational activities'' and insert ``sportsmen's hunting \n     and fishing and other recreational activities''.\n       In section 205(f), strike ``Hunting, Fishing, and \n     Recreational Activities.--Nothing in this title shall be \n     construed as limiting or precluding hunting or fishing \n     activities'' and insert ``Sportsmen's Hunting and Fishing and \n     Other Recreational Activities.--Nothing in this title shall \n     be construed as limiting or precluding sportsmen's hunting or \n     fishing activities''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/21/senate-section/article/S2659-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2662-S2688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE PRESIDIO PROPERTIES ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      MURKOWSKI AMENDMENT NO. 3561\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill (H.R. 1296) to provide for the administration of certain \nPresidio properties at minimal cost to the Federal taxpayer; as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n\n                 TITLE I--THE PRESIDIO OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\n     SECTION 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Presidio, located amidst the incomparable scenic \n     splendor of the Golden Gate, is one of America's great \n     natural and historic sites;\n       (2) the Presidio is the oldest continuously operated \n     military post in the Nation dating from 1776, and was \n     designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962;\n       (3) preservation of the cultural and historic integrity of \n     the Presidio for public use recognizes its significant role \n     in the history of the United States;\n       (4) the Presidio, in its entirety, is a part of the Golden \n     Gate National Recreation Area, in accordance with Public Law \n     92-589;\n       (5) as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, \n     the Presidio's significant natural, historic, scenic, \n     cultural, and recreational resources must be managed in a \n     manner which is consistent with sound principles of land use \n     planning and management, and which protects the Presidio from \n     development and uses which would destroy the scenic beauty \n     and historic and natural character of the area and cultural \n     and recreational resources;\n       (6) removal and/or replacement of some structures within \n     the Presidio must be considered as a management option in the \n     administration of the Presidio; and\n       (7) the Presidio will be managed through an innovative \n     public/private partnership that minimizes cost to the United \n     States Treasury and makes efficient use of private sector \n     resources.\n\n     SECTION 102. AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SECRETARY OF \n                   THE INTERIOR.\n\n       (a) Interim Authority.--the Secretary of the Interior \n     (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') is \n     authorized to manage leases in existence on the date of this \n     Act for properties under the administrative jurisdiction of \n     the Secretary and located at the Presidio. Upon the \n     expiration of any such lease, the Secretary may extend such \n     lease for a period terminating not later than 6 months after \n     the first meeting of the Presidio Trust.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) certain scattered parcels of Federal land located \n     within Gilpin County, Colorado, are currently administered by \n     the Secretary of the Interior as part of the Royal Gorge \n     Resource Area, Canon City District, United States Bureau of \n     Land Management;\n       (2) these land parcels, which comprises approximately 133 \n     separate tracts of land, and range in size from approximately \n     38 acres to much less than an acre have been identified as \n     suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management \n     through its resource management planning process and are \n     appropriate for disposal; and\n       (3) even though the Federal land parcels in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, are scattered and small in size, they nevertheless \n     by virtue of their proximity to existing communities appear \n     to have a fair market value which may be used by the Federal \n     Government to exchange for lands which will better lend \n     themselves to Federal management and have higher values for \n     future public access, use and enjoyment, recreation, the \n     protection and enhancement of fish and wildlife and fish and \n     wildlife habitat, and the protection of riparian lands, \n     wetlands, scenic beauty and other public values.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Title to authorize, \n     direct, facilitate and expedite the land exchange set forth \n     herein in order to further the public interest by disposing \n     of Federal lands with limited public utility and acquire in \n     exchange therefor lands with important values for permanent \n     public management and protection.\n\n     SECTION 1102. LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The exchange directed by this Title shall \n     be consummated if within 90 days after enactment of this Act, \n     Lake Gulch, Inc., a Colorado Corporation (as defined in \n     section 1104 of this Title) offers to transfer to the United \n     States pursuant to the provisions of this Title the offered \n     lands or interests in land described herein.\n       (b) Conveyance by Lake Gulch.--Subject to the provisions of \n     section 1103 of this Title, Lake Gulch shall convey to the \n     Secretary of the Interior all right, title, and interest in \n     and to the following offered lands--\n       (1) certain lands comprising approximately 40 acres with \n     improvements thereon located in Larimer County, Colorado, and \n     lying within the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National Park \n     as generally depicted on a map entitled ``Circle C Church \n     Camp'', dated August 1994, which shall upon their acquisition \n     by the United States and without further action by the \n     Secretary of the Interior be incorporated into Rocky Mountain \n     National Park and thereafter be administered in accordance \n     with the laws, rules and regulations generally applicable to \n     the National Park System and Rocky Mountain National Park;\n       (2) certain lands located within and adjacent to the United \n     States Bureau of Land Management San Luis Resource Area in \n     Conejos County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 3,993 \n     acres and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Quinlan \n     Ranches Tract'', dated August 1994; and\n       (3) certain lands located within the United States Bureau \n     of Land Management Royal Gorge Resource Area in Huerfano \n     County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 4,700 acres \n     and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Bonham Ranch-\n     Cucharas Canyon'', dated June 1995: Provided, however, That \n     it is the intention of Congress that such lands may remain \n     available for the grazing of livestock as determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary in accordance with applicable \n     laws, rules, and regulations: Provided further, That if the \n     Secretary determines that certain of the lands acquired \n     adjacent to Cucharas Canyon hereunder are not needed for \n     public purposes they may be sold in accordance with the \n     provisions of section 203 of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 and other applicable law.\n       (c) Substitution of Lands.--If one or more of the precise \n     offered land parcels identified above is unable to be \n     conveyed to the United States due to appraisal or other \n     problems, Lake Gulch and the Secretary may mutually agree to \n     substitute therefor alternative offered lands acceptable to \n     the Secretary.\n       (d) Coveyance by the United States.--(1) Upon receipt of \n     title to the lands identified in subsection (a) the Secretary \n     shall simultaneously convey to Lake Gulch all right, title, \n     and interest of the United States, subject to valid existing \n     rights, in and to the following selected lands--\n\n[[Page S2672]]\n\n       (A) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 18, Lots 118-220, which comprise \n     approximately 195 acres and are intended to include all \n     federally owned lands in section 18, as generally depicted on \n     a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July \n     1994;\n       (B) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 17, Lots 37, 38, 39, 40, 52, 53, and 54, \n     which comprise approximately 96 acres, as generally depicted \n     on a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July \n     1994; and\n       (C) certain unsurveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range, 73 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 13, which comprise approximately 11 acres, \n     and are generally depicted as parcels 302-304, 306 and 308-\n     326 on a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated \n     July 1994: Provided, however, That a parcel or parcels of \n     land in section 13 shall not be transferred to Lake Gulch if \n     at the time of the proposed transfer the parcel or parcels \n     are under formal application for transfer to a qualified unit \n     of local government. Due to the small and unsurveyed nature \n     of such parcels proposed for transfer to Lake Gulch in \n     section 13, and the high cost of surveying such small \n     parcels, the Secretary is authorized to transfer such section \n     13 lands to Lake Gulch without survey based on such legal or \n     other description as the Secretary determines appropriate to \n     carry out the basic intent of the map cited in this \n     subparagraph.\n       (2) If the Secretary and Lake Gulch mutually agree, and the \n     Secretary determines it is in the public interest, the \n     Secretary may utilize the authority and direction of this \n     Title to transfer to Lake Gulch lands in sections 17 and 13 \n     that are in addition to those precise selected lands shown on \n     the map cited herein, and which are not under formal \n     application for transfer to a qualified unit of local \n     government, upon transfer to the Secretary of additional \n     offered lands acceptable to the Secretary or upon payment to \n     the Secretary by Lake Gulch of cash equalization money \n     amounting to the full appraised fair market value of any such \n     additional lands. If any such additional lands are located in \n     section 13 they may be transferred to Lake Gulch without \n     survey based on such legal or other description as the \n     Secretary determines appropriate as long as the Secretary \n     determines that the boundaries of any adjacent lands not \n     owned by Lake Gulch can be properly identified so as to avoid \n     possible future boundary conflicts or disputes. If the \n     Secretary determines surveys are necessary to convey any such \n     additional lands to Lake Gulch, the costs of such surveys \n     shall be paid by Lake Gulch but shall not be eligible for any \n     adjustment in the value of such additional lands pursuant to \n     section 206(f)(2) of the Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act of 1976 (as amended by the Federal Land Exchange \n     Facilitation Act of 1988) (43 U.S.C. 1716(f)(2)).\n       (3) Prior to transferring out of public ownership pursuant \n     to this Title or other authority of law any lands which are \n     contiguous to North Clear Creek southeast of the City of \n     Black Hawk, Colorado in the County of Gilpin, Colorado, the \n     Secretary shall notify and consult with the County and City \n     and afford such units of local government an opportunity to \n     acquire or reserve pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 or other applicable law, such \n     easements or rights-of-way parallel to North Clear Creek as \n     may be necessary to serve public utility line or recreation \n     path needs: Provided, however, That any survey or other costs \n     associated with the acquisition or reservation of such \n     easements or rights-of-way shall be paid for by the unit or \n     units of local government concerned.\n\n     SECTION 1103.

The use of any \n     water rights acquired pursuant to this section shall be \n     limited to water that can be used or exchanged for water that \n     can be used on the Blanca Wetlands. Any requirement or \n     proposal to utilize facilities of the San Luis Valley \n     Project, Closed Basin Diversion, in order to effectuate the \n     use of any such water rights shall be subject to prior \n     approval of the Rio Grande Water Conservation District.\n       (b) Restrictions on Selected Lands.--(1) Conveyance of the \n     selected lands to Lake Gulch pursuant to this Title shall be \n     contingent upon Lake Gulch executing an agreement with the \n     United States prior to such conveyance, the terms of which \n     are acceptable to the Secretary of the Interior, and which--\n       (A) grant the United States a covenant that none of the \n     selected lands (which currently lie outside the legally \n     approved gaming area) shall ever be used for purposes of \n     gaming should the current legal gaming area ever be expanded \n     by the State of Colorado; and\n       (B) permanently hold the United States harmless for \n     liability and indemnify the United States against all costs \n     arising from any activities, operations (including the \n     strong, handling, and dumping of hazardous materials or \n     substances) or other acts conducted by Lake Gulch or its \n     employees, agents, successors or assigns on the selected \n     lands after their transfer to Lake Gulch: Provided, however, \n     That nothing in this Title shall be construed as either \n     diminishing or increasing any responsibility or liability of \n     the United States based on the condition of the selected \n     lands prior to or on the date of their transfer to Lake \n     Gulch.\n       (2) Conveyance of the selected lands to Lake Gulch pursuant \n     to this Title shall be subject to the existing easement of \n     Gilpin County Road 6.\n       (3) The above terms and restrictions of this subsection \n     shall not be considered in determining, or result in any \n     diminution in, the fair market value of the selected land for \n     purposes of the appraisals of the selected land required \n     pursuant to section 1102 of this Title.\n       (c) Revocation of Withdrawal.--The Public Water Reserve \n     established by Executive order dated April 17, 1926 (Public \n     Water Reserve 107), Serial Number Colorado 17321, is hereby \n     revoked insofar as it affects the NW\\1/4\\SW\\1/4\\ of Section \n     17, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, which covers a portion of the selected lands \n     identified in this Title.\n\n     SECTION 1104.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (94 \n     Stat. 2371), enacted on December 2, 1980, established Gates \n     of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and Gates of the \n     Arctic Wilderness. The village of Anaktuvuk Pass, located in \n     the highlands of the central Brooks Range, is virtually \n     surrounded by these national park and wilderness lands and is \n     the only Native village located within the boundary of a \n     National Park System unit in Alaska.\n       (2) Unlike most other Alaskan Native communities, the \n     village of Anaktuvuk Pass is not located on a major river, \n     lake, or coastline that can be used as a means of access. The \n     residents of Anaktuvuk Pass have relied increasingly on snow \n     machines in winter and all-terrain vehicles in summer as \n     their primary means of access of pursue caribou and other \n     subsistence resources.\n       (3) In a 1993 land exchange agreement, linear easements \n     were reserved by the Inupiat Eskimo people for use of all-\n     terrain vehicles across certain national park lands, mostly \n     along stream and river banks. These linear easements proved \n     unsatisfactory, because they provided inadequate access to \n     subsistence resources while causing excessive environmental \n     impact from concentrated use.\n       (4) The National Park Service and the Nunamiut Corporation \n     initiated discussions in 1985 to address concerns over the \n     use of all-terrain vehicles on park and wilderness land. \n     These discussions resulted in an agreement, originally \n     executed in 1992 and thereafter amended in 1993 and 1994, \n     among the National Park Service, Nunamiut Corporation, the \n     City of Anaktuvuk Pass, and Arctic Slope Regional \n     Corporation. Full effectuation of this agreement, as amended, \n     by its terms requires ratification by the Congress.\n\n     SECTION 1402. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Ratification.--\n       (1) In general.--The terms, conditions, procedures, \n     covenants, reservations and other provisions set forth in the \n     document entitled ``Donation, Exchange of Lands and Interests \n     in Lands and Wilderness Redesignation Agreement Among Arctic \n     Slope Regional Corporation, Nunamiut Corporation, City of \n     Anaktuvuk Pass and the United States of America'' \n     (hereinafter referred to in this Title as ``the Agreement''), \n     executed by the parties on December 17, 1992, as amended, are \n     hereby incorporated in this Title, are ratified and \n     confirmed, and set forth the obligations and commitments of \n     the United States, Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, \n     Nunamiut Corporation and the City of Anaktuvuk Pass, as a \n     matter of Federal law.\n       (2) Land Acquisition.--Lands acquired by the United States \n     pursuant to the Agreement shall be administered by the \n     Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the \n     ``Secretary'') as part of Gates of the Arctic National Park \n     and Preserve, subject to the laws and regulations applicable \n     thereto.\n       (b) Maps.--The maps set forth as Exhibits C1, C2, and D \n     through I to the Agreement depict the lands subject to the \n     conveyances, retention of surface access rights, access \n     easements and all-terrain vehicle easements. These lands are \n     depicted in greater detail on a map entitled ``Land Exchange \n     Actions, Proposed Anaktuvuk Pass Land Exchange and Wilderness \n     Redesignation, Gates of the Arctic National Park and \n     Preserve'', Map No. 185/80,039, dated April 1994, and on file \n     at the Alaska Regional Office of the National Park Service \n     and the offices of Gates of the Arctic National Park and \n     Preserve in Fairbanks, Alaska. Written legal descriptions of \n     these lands shall be prepared and made available in the above \n     offices. In case of any discrepancies, Map No. 185/80,039 \n     shall be controlling.\n\n     SECTION 1403.

CONFORMANCE WITH OTHER LAW.\n\n       (a) Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.--All of the lands, \n     or interests therein, conveyed to and received by Arctic \n     Slope Regional Corporation or Nunamiut Corporation pursuant \n     to the Agreement shall be deemed conveyed and received \n     pursuant to exchanges under section 22(f) of the Alaska \n     Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1601, \n     1621(f)). All of the lands or interests in lands conveyed \n     pursuant to the Agreement shall be conveyed subject to valid \n     existing rights.\n       (b) Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.--\n     Except to the extent specifically set forth in this Title or \n     the Agreement, nothing in this Title or in the Agreement \n     shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the rights, \n     privileges, or obligations of any person, including \n     specifically the preference for subsistence uses and access \n     to subsistence resources provided under the Alaska National \n     Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.).\n\n          TITLE XV--ALASKA PENINSULA SUBSURFACE CONSOLIDATION\n\n     SECTION 1501.

CERTAIN CONVEYANCES.\n\n       (a) Interests in Lands.--For the purposes of section 21 (c) \n     of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1620 \n     (e)), the receipt of consideration, including, but not \n     limited to, lands, cash or other property, by a Native \n     Corporation for the relinquishment to the United States of \n     land selection rights granted to any Native Corporation under \n     such Act shall be deemed to be an interest in land.\n       (b) Authority to Appoint and Remove Trustee.--In \n     establishing a Settlement Trust under section 39 of such Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1629c), Koniag may delegate, in whole or in part, \n     the authority granted to Koniag under subsection (b)(2) of \n     such section to any entity that Koniag may select without \n     affecting the status of the trust as a Settlement Trust under \n     such section.\n\n                       TITLE XVI--STERLING FOREST\n\n     SECTION 1601. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission was \n     established pursuant to a joint resolution of the 75th \n     Congress approved in 1937 (Public Resolution No. 65; ch. 706; \n     50 Stat. 719), and chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New York and chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New Jersey;\n       (2) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission is responsible \n     for the management of 23 parks and historic sites in New York \n     and New Jersey, comprising over 82,000 acres;\n       (3) over 8,000,000 visitors annually seek outdoor \n     recreational opportunities within the Palisades Park System;\n       (4) Sterling Forest is a biologically diverse open space on \n     the New Jersey border comprising approximately 17,500 acres, \n     and is a highly significant watershed area for the State of \n     New Jersey, providing the source for clean drinking water for \n     25 percent of the State;\n       (5) Sterling Forest is an important outdoor recreational \n     asset in the northeastern United States, within the most \n     densely populated metropolitan region in the Nation;\n       (6) Sterling Forest supports a mixture of hardwood forests, \n     wetlands, lakes, glaciated valleys, is strategically located \n     on a wildlife migratory route, and provides important habitat \n     for 27 rare or endangered species;\n       (7) the protection of Sterling Forest would greatly enhance \n     the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, a portion of which \n     passes through Sterling Forest, and would provide for \n     enhanced recreational opportunities through the protection of \n     lands which are an integral element of the trail and which \n     would protect important trail viewsheds;\n       (8) stewardship and management costs for units of the \n     Palisades Park System are paid for by the States of New York \n     and New Jersey; thus, the protection of Sterling Forest \n     through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve \n     a minimum of Federal funds;\n       (9) given the nationally significant watershed, outdoor \n     recreational, and wildlife\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\n     qualities of Sterling Forest, the demand for open space in \n     the northeastern United States, and the lack of open space in \n     the densely populated tri-state region, there is a clear \n     Federal interest in acquiring the Sterling Forest for \n     permanent protection of the watershed, outdoor recreational \n     resources, flora and fauna, and open space; and\n       (10) such an acquisition would represent a cost effective \n     investment, as compared with the costs that would be incurred \n     to protect drinking water for the region should the Sterling \n     Forest be developed.\n\n     SECTION 1602.

SKI AREA PERMIT RENTAL CHARGE.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a rental \n     charge for all ski area permits issued pursuant to section 3 \n     of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. \n     497b), the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; \n     16 U.S.C. 497), or the 9th through 20th paragraphs under the \n     heading ``SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS'' under the heading \n     ``UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR'' in the Act of June \n     4, 1897 (30 Stat. 34, chapter 2), on National Forest System \n     lands. Permit rental charges for permits issued pursuant to \n     the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 shall be \n     calculated as set forth in subsection (b). Permit rental \n     charges for existing ski area permits issued pursuant to the \n     Act of March 4, 1915, and the Act of June 4, 1897, shall be \n     calculated in accordance with those existing permits: \n     Provided, That a permittee may, at the permittee's option, \n     use the calculation method set forth in subsection (b).\n       (b)(1) The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) shall be \n     calculated by adding the permittee's gross revenues from lift \n     ticket/year-round ski area use pass sales plus revenue from \n     ski school operations (LT+SS) and multiplying such total by \n     the slope transport feet percentage (STFP) on National Forest \n     System land. The amount shall be increased by the gross year-\n     round revenue from ancillary facilities (GRAF) physically \n     located on national forest land, including all permittee or \n     subpermittee lodging, food service, rental shops, parking \n     other ancillary operations, to determine the adjusted gross \n     revenue (AGR) subject to the permit rental charge. The final \n     rental charge shall be calculated by multiplying the AGR by \n     the following percentages for each revenue bracket and adding \n     the total for each revenue bracket:\n       (A) 1.5 percent of all adjusted gross revenue below \n     $3,000,000;\n       (B) 2.5 percent for adjusted gross revenue between \n     $3,000,000 and $15,000,000;\n       (C) 2.75 percent for adjusted gross revenue between \n     $15,000,000 and $50,000,000; and\n       (D) 4.0 percent for the amount of adjusted gross revenue \n     that exceed $50,000,000.\n       Utilizing the abbreviations indicated in this subsection \n     the ski area permit fee (SAPF) formula can be simply \n     illustrated as:\n       SAPF=((LT+SS)STFP)+GRAF=AGR; AGR%BRACKETS\n       (2) In cases where ski areas are only partially located on \n     national forest lands, the slope transport feet percentage on \n     national forest land referred to in subsection (b) shall be \n     calculated as generally described in the Forest Service \n     Manual in effect as of January 1, 1992. Revenues from Nordic \n     ski operations shall be included or excluded from the rental \n     charge calculation according to the percentage of trails \n     physically located on national forest land.\n       (3) In order to ensure that the rental charge remains fair \n     and equitable to both the United States and the ski area \n     permittees, the adjusted gross revenue figures for each \n     revenue bracket in paragraph (1) shall\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\n     be adjusted annually by the percent increase or decrease in \n     the national Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar \n     year. No later than 5 years after the date of enactment of \n     this Act and every 10 years thereafter the Secretary shall \n     submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \n     the United States Senate and the Committee on Resources of \n     the United States House of Representatives a report analyzing \n     whether the ski area permit rental charge legislated by this \n     Act is returning a fair market value rental to the United \n     States together with any recommendations the Secretary may \n     have for modifications of the system.\n       (c) The rental charge set forth in subsection (b) shall be \n     due on June 1 of each year and shall be paid or pre-paid by \n     the permittee on a monthly, quarterly, annual or other \n     schedule as determined appropriate by the Secretary in \n     consultation with the permittee. Unless mutually agreed \n     otherwise by the Secretary and the permittee, the payment or \n     prepayment schedule shall conform to the permittee's schedule \n     in effect prior to enactment of this Act. To reduce costs to \n     the permittee and the Forest Service, the Secretary shall \n     each year provide the permittee with a standardized form and \n     worksheets (including annual rental charge calculation \n     brackets and rates) to be used for rental charge calculation \n     and submitted with the rental charge payment. Information \n     provided on such forms shall be compiled by the Secretary \n     annually and kept in the Office of the Chief, U.S. Forest \n     Service.\n       (d) The ski area permit rental charge set forth in this \n     section shall become effective on June 1, 1996 and cover \n     receipts retroactive to June 1, 1995: Provided, however, That \n     if a permittee has paid rental charges for the period June 1, \n     1995, to June 1, 1996, under the graduated rate rental charge \n     system formula in effect prior to the date of enactment of \n     this Act, such rental charges shall be credited toward the \n     new rental charge due on June 1, 1996. In order to ensure \n     increasing rental charge receipt levels to the United States \n     during transition from the graduated rate rental charge \n     system formula to the formula of this Act, the rental charge \n     paid by any individual permittee shall be--\n       (1) for the 1995-1996 permit year, either the rental charge \n     paid for the preceding 1994-1995 base year or the rental \n     charge calculated pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher;\n       (2) for the 1996-1997 permit year, either the rental charge \n     paid for the 1994-1995 base year or the rental charge \n     calculated pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher;\n       (3) for the 1997-1998 permit year, either the rental charge \n     for the 1994-1995 base year or the rental charge calculated \n     pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher.\n       If an individual permittee's adjusted gross revenue for the \n     1995-1996, 1996-1997, or 1997-1998 permit years falls more \n     than 10 percent below the 1994-1995 base year, the rental \n     charge paid shall be the rental charge calculated pursuant to \n     this Act.\n       (e) Under no circumstances shall revenue, or subpermittee \n     revenue (other than lift ticket, area use pass, or ski school \n     sales) obtained from operations physically located on non-\n     national forest land be included in the ski area permit \n     rental charge calculation.\n       (f) To reduce administrative costs of ski area permittees \n     and the Forest Service the terms ``revenue'' and ``sales'', \n     as used in this section, shall mean actual income from sales \n     and shall not include sales of operating equipment, refunds, \n     rent paid to the permittee by sublessees, sponsor \n     contributions to special events or any amounts attributable \n     to employee gratuities or employee lift tickets, discounts, \n     or other goods or services (except for bartered goods and \n     complimentary lift tickets) for which the permittee does not \n     receive money.\n       (g) In cases where an area of national forest land is under \n     a ski area permit but the permittee does not have revenue or \n     sales qualifying for rental charge payment pursuant to \n     subsection (a), the permittee shall pay an annual minimum \n     rental charge of $2 for each national forest acre under \n     permit or a percentage of appraised land value, as determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary.\n       (h) Where the new rental charge provided for in subsection \n     (b)(1) results in an increase in permit rental charge greater \n     than one half of one percent of the permittee's adjusted \n     gross revenue as determined under subsection (b)(1), the new \n     rental charge shall be phased in over a five year period in a \n     manner providing for increases of approximately equal \n     increments.\n       (i) To reduce federal costs in administering the provisions \n     of this Act, the reissuance of a ski area permit to provide \n     activities similar in nature and amount to the activities \n     provided under the previous permit shall not constitute a \n     major Federal action for the purposes of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.).\n\n     SECTION 1802. WITHDRAWALS.\n\n       Subject to valid existing rights, all lands located within \n     the boundaries of ski area permits issued prior to, on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act pursuant to authority \n     of the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; 16 \n     U.S.C. 497), and the Act of June 4, 1897, or the National \n     Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b) are \n     hereby and henceforth automatically withdrawn from all forms \n     of appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition \n     under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing \n     and all amendments thereto. Such withdrawal shall continue \n     for the full term of the permit and any modification, \n     reissuance, or renewal thereof. Unless the Secretary requests \n     otherwise of the Secretary of the Interior, such withdrawal \n     shall be canceled automatically upon expiration or other \n     termination of the permit and the land automatically restored \n     to all appropriation not otherwise restricted under the \n     public land laws.\n\n       TITLE XIX--THE SELMA TO MONTGOMERY NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL\n\n     SECTION 1901.\n\n       That section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1244(a)) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new paragraph.\n       ``(20) The Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, \n     consisting of 54 miles of city streets and United States \n     Highway 80 from Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church in Selma to the \n     State Capitol Building in Montgomery, Alabama, traveled by \n     voting rights advocates during March 1965 to dramatize the \n     need for voting rights legislation, as generally described in \n     the report of the Secretary of the Interior prepared pursuant \n     to subsection (b) of this section entitled ``Selma to \n     Montgomery'' and dated April 1993. Maps depicting the route \n     shall be on file and available for public inspection in the \n     Office of the National Park Service, Department of the \n     Interior. The trail shall be administered in accordance with \n     this Act, including section 7(h). The Secretary of the \n     Interior, acting through the National Park Service, which \n     shall be the lead Federal agency, shall cooperate with other \n     Federal, State and local authorities to preserve historic \n     sites along the route, including (but not limited to) the \n     Edmund Pettus Bridge and the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church.''.\n\n               TITLE XX--UTAH PUBLIC LANDS MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n     SECTION 2001.

Copies of both the notice of intention to \n     relinquish and the determination concerning the contaminated \n     state of the lands shall be published in the Federal Register \n     by the Secretary of the Interior.\n       (d) Effect of Contamination.--(1) If any land which is the \n     subject of a notice of intention to relinquish under \n     subsection (b)(3) is contaminated, and the Secretary of the \n     Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the Army, \n     determines that decontamination is practicable and \n     economically feasible, taking into consideration the \n     potential future use and value of the land, and that upon \n     decontamination, the land could be opened to the operation of \n     some or all of the public land laws, including the mining \n     laws, the Secretary of the Army shall decontaminate the land \n     to the extent that funds are appropriated for such purpose.\n       (2) If the Secretaries of the Army and the Interior \n     conclude either that the contamination of any or all of the \n     lands proposed for relinquishment is not practicable or \n     economically feasible, or that the lands cannot be \n     decontaminated sufficiently to allow them to be opened to the \n     operation of the public land laws, or if Congress declined to \n     appropriate funds for decontamination of the lands, the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall not be required to accept the \n     lands proposed for relinquishment.\n       (3) If, because of their contaminated state, the Secretary \n     of the Interior declines under paragraph (2) to accept \n     jurisdiction of the lands proposed for relinquishment, or if \n     at the expiration of the withdrawal made by the Title the \n     Secretary of the Interior determines that some of the lands \n     withdrawn by this Title are contaminated to an extent which \n     prevents opening such contaminated lands to operation of the \n     public land laws--\n       (A) the Secretary of the Army shall take appropriate steps \n     to warn the public of the contaminated state of such lands \n     and any risks associated with entry onto such lands;\n       (B) after the expiration of the withdrawal, the Secretary \n     of the Army shall undertake no activities on such lands \n     except in connection with decontamination of such lands; and\n       (C) the Secretary of the Army shall report to the Secretary \n     of the Interior and to the Congress concerning the status of \n     such lands and all actions taken in furtherance of the \n     subsection.\n       (4) If the lands are subsequently decontaminated, upon \n     certification by the Secretary of the Army that the lands are \n     safe for all nomilitary uses, the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall reconsider accepting jurisdiction over the lands.\n       (5) Nothing in this Title shall affect, or be construed to \n     affect, the Secretary's obligations, if any, to decontaminate \n     such lands pursuant to applicable law, including but not \n     limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response \n     Compensation and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), and \n     the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource \n     Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).\n       (e) Program of Decontamination.--Throughout the duration of \n     the withdrawal and reservation made by the Title, the \n     Secretary of the Army, to the extent funds are made \n     available, shall maintain a program of decontamination of the \n     lands withdrawn by this Title at least at the level of effort \n     carried out during fiscal year 1992.\n       (f) Acceptance of Lands Proposed for Relinquishment.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of \n     the Interior, upon deciding that it is in the public interest \n     to accept jurisdiction over those lands proposed for \n     relinquishment, is authorized to revoke the withdrawal and \n     reservation established by this Title as it applies to the \n     lands proposed for relinquishment. Should the decision be \n     made to revoke the withdrawal and reservation, the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall publish in the Federal Register an \n     appropriate order which shall--\n       (1) terminate the withdrawal and reservation;\n       (2) constitute official acceptance of full jurisdiction \n     over the lands by the Secretary of the Interior; and\n       (3) state the date upon which the lands will be opened to \n     the operation of the public land laws, including the mining \n     laws if appropriate.\n\n     SECTION 2108. DELEGATION.\n\n       The function of the Secretary of the Army under this Act \n     may be delegated. The functions of the Secretary of the \n     Interior under this Title may be delegated, except that the \n     order referred to in section 2007(f) may be approved and \n     signed only by the Secretary of the Interior, the Deputy \n     Secretary of the Interior, or an Assistant Secretary of the \n     Department of the Interior.\n\n     SECTION 2109. HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The United States and all departments or \n     agencies thereof shall be held harmless and shall not be \n     liable for any injuries or damages to persons or property \n     suffered in the course of any mining, mineral activity, or \n     geothermal leasing activity conducted on lands comprising the \n     Fort Carson Military Reservation or Pinon Canyon Maneuver \n     Site, including liabilities to non-Federal entities under \n     sections 107 or 113 of the\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\n     Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and \n     Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9607 and 9613, or section 7003 of \n     the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource \n     Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6973.\n       (b) Indemnification.--Any party conducting any mining, \n     mineral or geothermal leasing activity on such lands shall \n     indemnify the United States and its departments or agencies \n     thereof against any costs, fees, damages, or other \n     liabilities, including costs of litigation, arising from or \n     related to such mining activities, including costs of \n     minerals disposal, whether arising under the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Resource Compensation and Liability Act, the \n     Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or otherwise.\n\n     SECTION 2110. AMENDMENTS TO MILITARY LANDS WITHDRAWAL ACT OF \n                   1986.\n\n       (a) Use of Certain Resource.--Section 3(f) of the Military \n     Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-606; 100 Stat. \n     3461) is amended by adding at the end a new paragraph (2) as \n     follows:\n       ``(2) Subject to valid existing rights, the Secretary of \n     the military department concerned may utilize sand, gravel, \n     or similar mineral or material resources from lands withdrawn \n     for the purposes of this Act when the use of such resources \n     is required for construction needs on the respective lands \n     withdrawn by this Act.''.\n       (b) Technical Correction.--Section 9(b) of the Military \n     lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-606; 100 Stat. \n     3466) is amended by striking ``7(f)'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof, ``8(f)''.\n\n     SECTION 2111. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as \n     may be necessary to carry out this Title.\n\n                TITLE XXII--SNOWBASIN LAND EXCHANGE ACT\n\n     SECTION 2201. FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) in June 1995, Salt Lake City, Utah, was selected to \n     host the 2002 Winter Olympic Games and the Snowbasin Ski \n     Resort, which is owned by the Sun Valley Company, was \n     identified as the site of six Olympic events: the men's and \n     women's downhills, men's and women's Super-Gs, and men's and \n     women's combined downhills;\n       (2) in order to adequately accommodate these events, which \n     are traditionally among the most popular and heavily attended \n     at the Winter Olympic Games, major new skiing, visitor, and \n     support facilities will have to be constructed at the \n     Snowbasin Ski Resort on land currently administered by the \n     United States Forest Service;\n       (3) while certain of these new facilities can be \n     accommodated on National Forest land under traditional Forest \n     Service permitting authorities, the base area facilities \n     necessary to host visitors to the ski area and the Winter \n     Olympics are of such a nature that they should logically be \n     located on private land;\n       (4) land exchanges have been routinely utilized by the \n     Forest Service to transfer base area lands to many other ski \n     areas, and the Forest Service and the Sun Valley Company have \n     concluded that a land exchange to transfer base area lands at \n     the Snowbasin Ski Resort to the Sun Valley Company is both \n     logical and advisable;\n       (5) an environmental impact statement and numerous resource \n     studies have been completed by the Forest Service and the Sun \n     Valley Company for the lands proposed to be transferred to \n     the Sun Valley Company by this Title;\n       (6) the Sun Valley Company has assembled lands with \n     outstanding environmental, recreational, and other values to \n     convey to the Forest Service in return for the lands it will \n     receive in the exchange, and the Forest Service has \n     identified such lands as desirable for acquisition by the \n     United States; and\n       (7) completion of a land exchange and approval of a \n     development plan for Olympic related facilities at the \n     Snowbasin Ski Resort is essential to ensure that all \n     necessary facilities can be constructed, tested for safety \n     and other purposes, and become fully operational in advance \n     of the 2002 Winter Olympics and earlier pre-Olympic events.\n       (b) Determination.--The Congress has reviewed the previous \n     analyses and studies of the lands to be exchanged and \n     developed pursuant to this Title, and has made its own review \n     of these lands and issues involved, and on the basis of those \n     reviews hereby finds and determines that a legislated land \n     exchange and development plan approval with respect to \n     certain National Forest System Lands is necessary to meet \n     Olympic goals and timetables.\n\n     SECTION 2202. PURPOSE AND INTENT.\n\n       The purpose of this Title is to authorize and direct the \n     Secretary to exchange 1,320 acres of federally-owned land \n     within the Cache National Forest in the State of Utah for \n     lands of approximately equal value owned by the Sun Valley \n     Company. It is the intent of Congress that this exchange be \n     completed without delay within the period specified by \n     section 2104.\n\n     SECTION 2203. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Title--\n       (1) the term ``Sun Valley Company'' means the Sun Valley \n     Company, a division of Sinclair Oil Corporation, a Wyoming \n     Corporation, or its successors or assigns; and\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n\n     SECTION 2204. EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) Federal Selected Lands.--(1) Not later than 45 days \n     after the final determination of value of the Federal \n     selected lands, the Secretary shall, subject to this Title, \n     transfer all right, title, and interest of the United States \n     in and to the lands referred to in paragraph (2) to the Sun \n     Valley Company.\n       (2) The lands referred to in paragraph (1) are certain \n     lands within the Cache National Forest in the State of Utah \n     comprising 1,320 acres, more or less, as generally depicted \n     on the map entitled ``Snowbasin Land Exchange--Proposed'' and \n     dated October 1995.\n       (b) Non-Federal Offered Lands.--Upon transfer of the \n     Federal selected lands under subsection (a), and in exchange \n     for those lands, the Sun Valley Company shall simultaneously \n     convey to the Secretary all right, title and interest of the \n     Sun Valley Company in and to so much of the following offered \n     lands which have been previously identified by the United \n     States Forest Service as desirable by the United States, or \n     which are identified pursuant to paragraph (5) prior to the \n     transfer of lands under subsection (a), as are of approximate \n     equal value to the Federal selected lands:\n       (1) Certain lands located within the exterior boundaries of \n     the Cache National Forest in Weber County, Utah, which \n     comprise approximately 640 acres and are generally depicted \n     on a map entitled ``Lightning Ridge Offered Lands'', dated \n     October 1995.\n       (2) Certain lands located within the Cache National Forest \n     in Weber County, Utah, which comprise approximately 635 acres \n     and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Wheeler Creek \n     Watershed Offered Lands-Section 2'' dated October 1995.\n       (3) Certain lands located within the exterior boundaries of \n     the Cache National Forest in Weber County, Utah, and lying \n     immediately adjacent to the outskirts of the City of Ogden, \n     Utah, which comprise approximately 800 acres and are \n     generally depicted on a map entitled ``Taylor Canyon Offered \n     Lands'', dated October 1995.\n       (4) Certain lands located within the exterior boundaries of \n     the Cache National Forest in Weber County, Utah, which \n     comprise approximately 2,040 acres and are generally depicted \n     on a map entitled ``North Fork Ogden River-Devil's Gate \n     Valley'', dated October 1995.\n       (5) Such additional offered lands in the State of Utah as \n     may be necessary to make the values of the lands exchanged \n     pursuant to this Title approximately equal, and which are \n     acceptable to the Secretary.\n       (c) Substitution of Offered Lands.--If one or more of the \n     precise offered land parcels identified in paragraphs (1) \n     through (4) of subsection (b) is unable to be conveyed to the \n     United States due to appraisal or other reasons, or if the \n     Secretary and the Sun Valley Company mutually agree and the \n     Secretary determines that an alternative offered land package \n     would better serve long term public needs and objectives, the \n     Sun Valley Company may simultaneously convey to the United \n     States alternative offered lands in the State of Utah \n     acceptable to the Secretary in lieu of any or all of the \n     lands identified in paragraph (1) through (4) of subsection \n     (b).\n       (d) Valuation and Appraisals.--(1) Values of the lands to \n     be exchanged pursuant to this Title shall be equal as \n     determined by the Secretary utilizing nationally recognized \n     appraisal standards and in accordance with section 206 of the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The appraisal \n     reports shall be written to Federal standards as defined in \n     the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land \n     Acquisitions. If, due to size, location, or use of lands \n     exchanged under this Title, the values are not exactly equal, \n     they shall be equalized by the payment of cash equalization \n     money to the Secretary or the Sun Valley Company as \n     appropriate in accordance with section 206(b) of the Federal \n     Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(b)). \n     In order to expedite the consummation of the exchange \n     directed by this Title, the Sun Valley Company shall arrange \n     and pay for appraisals of the offered and selected lands by a \n     qualified appraiser with experience in appraising similar \n     properties and who is mutually acceptable to the Sun Valley \n     Company and the Secretary. The appraisal of the Federal \n     selected lands shall be completed and submitted to the \n     Secretary for technical review and approval no later than 120 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, and the \n     Secretary shall make a determination of value not later than \n     30 days after receipt of the appraisal. In the event the \n     Secretary and the Sun Valley Company are unable to agree to \n     the appraised value of a certain tract or tracts of land, the \n     appraisal, appraisals, or appraisal issues in dispute and a \n     final determination of value shall be resolved through a \n     process of bargaining or submission to arbitration in \n     accordance with section 206(d) of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(d)).\n       (2) In order to expedite the appraisal of the Federal \n     selected lands, such appraisal shall--\n       (A) value the land in its unimproved state, as a single \n     entity for its highest and best use as if in private \n     ownership and as of the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (B) consider the Federal lands as an independent property \n     as though in the private marketplace and suitable for \n     development to its highest and best use;\n       (C) consider in the appraisal any encumbrance on the title \n     anticipated to be in the conveyance to Sun Valley Company and \n     reflect its effect on the fair market value of the property; \n     and\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\n       (D) not reflect any enhancement in value to the Federal \n     selected lands based on the existence of private lands owned \n     by the Sun Valley Company in the vicinity of the Snowbasin \n     Ski Resort, and shall assume that private lands owned by the \n     Sun Valley Company are not available for use in conjunction \n     with the Federal selected lands.\n\n     SECTION 2205. GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The exchange authorized by this Title \n     shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:\n       (1) Reserved rights-of-way.--In any deed issued pursuant to \n     section 5(a), the Secretary shall reserve in the United \n     States a right of reasonable access across the conveyed \n     property for public access and for administrative purposes of \n     the United States necessary to manage adjacent federally-\n     owned lands. The terms of such reservation shall be \n     prescribed by the Secretary within 30 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Right of Rescission.--This Title shall not be binding \n     on either the United States or the Sun Valley Company if, \n     within 30 days after the final determination of value of the \n     Federal selected lands, the Sun Valley Company submits to the \n     Secretary a duly authorized and executed resolution of the \n     Company stating its intention not to enter into the exchange \n     authorized by this Title.\n       (b) Withdrawal.--Subject to valid existing rights, \n     effective on the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal \n     selected lands described in section 5(a)(2) and all National \n     Forest System lands currently under special use permit to the \n     Sun Valley Company at the Snowbasin Ski Resort are hereby \n     withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the public \n     land laws (including the mining laws) and from disposition \n     under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing.\n       (c) Deed.--The conveyance of the offered lands to the \n     United States under this Title shall be by general warranty \n     or other deed acceptable to the Secretary and in conformity \n     with applicable title standards of the Attorney General of \n     the United States.\n       (d) Status of Lands.--Upon acceptance of title by the \n     Secretary, the land conveyed to the United States pursuant to \n     this Title shall become part of the Wasatch or Cache National \n     Forests as appropriate, and the boundaries of such National \n     Forests shall be adjusted to encompass such lands. Once \n     conveyed, such lands shall be managed in accordance with the \n     Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (commonly known as the \n     ``Weeks Act''), and in accordance with the other laws, rules \n     and regulations applicable to National Forest System lands. \n     This subsection does not limit the Secretary's authority to \n     adjust the boundaries pursuant to section 11 of the Act of \n     March 1, 1911 (``Weeks Act''). For the purposes of section 7 \n     of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 \n     U.S.C. 4601-9), the boundaries of the Wasatch and Cache \n     National Forests, as adjusted by this Title, shall be \n     considered to be boundaries of the forests as of January 1, \n     1965.\n\n     SECTION 2206. PHASE I FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION.\n\n       (a) Phase I Facility Finding and Review.--(1) The Congress \n     has reviewed the Snowbasin Ski Area Master Development Plan \n     dated October 1995 (hereinafter in this section referred to \n     as the ``Master Plan''). On the basis of such review, and \n     review of previously completed environmental and other \n     resource studies for the Snowbasin Ski Area, Congress hereby \n     finds that the ``Phase I'' facilities referred to in the \n     Master Plan to be located on National Forest System land \n     after consummation of the land exchange directed by this \n     Title are limited in size and scope, are reasonable and \n     necessary to accommodate the 2002 Olympics, and in some cases \n     are required to provide for the safety of skiing competitors \n     and spectators.\n       (2) Within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary and the Sun Valley Company shall review the \n     Master Plan insofar as such plan pertains to Phase I \n     facilities which are to be constructed and operated wholly or \n     partially on National Forest System lands retained by the \n     Secretary after consummation of the land exchange directed by \n     this Title. The Secretary may modify such Phase I facilities \n     upon mutual agreement with the Sun Valley Company or by \n     imposing conditions pursuant to subsection (b) of this \n     section.\n       (3) Within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary shall submit the reviewed Master Plan on the \n     Phase I facilities, including any modifications made thereto \n     pursuant to paragraph (2), to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the \n     Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives for a 30-day review period. At the end of the \n     30-day period, unless otherwise directed by Act of Congress, \n     the Secretary may issue all necessary authorizations for \n     construction and operation of such facilities or \n     modifications thereof in accordance with the procedures and \n     provisions of subsection (b) of this section.\n       (b) Phase I Facility Approval, Conditions, and Timetable.--\n     Within 120 days of receipt of an application by the Sun \n     Valley Company to authorize construction and operation of any \n     particular Phase I facility, facilities, or group of \n     facilities, the Secretary, in consultation with the Sun \n     Valley Company, shall authorize construction and operation of \n     such facility, facilities, or group of facilities, subject to \n     the general policies of the Forest Service pertaining to the \n     construction and operation of ski area facilities on National \n     Forest System lands and subject to reasonable conditions to \n     protect National Forest System resources. In providing \n     authorization to construct and operate a facility, \n     facilities, or group of facilities, the Secretary may not \n     impose any condition that would significantly change the \n     location, size, or scope of the applied for Phase I facility \n     unless--\n       (1) the modification is mutually agreed to by the Secretary \n     and the Sun Valley Company; or\n       (2) the modification is necessary to protect health and \n     safety. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n     the Secretary's responsibility to monitor and assure \n     compliance with the conditions set forth in the \n     construction and operation authorization.\n       (c) Congressional Directions.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, Congress finds that consummation of the \n     land exchange directed by this Title and all determinations, \n     authorizations, and actions taken by the Secretary pursuant \n     to this Title pertaining to Phase I facilities on National \n     Forest System lands, or any modifications thereof, to be \n     nondiscretionary actions authorized and directed by Congress \n     and hence to comply with all procedural and other \n     requirements of the laws of the United States. Such \n     determinations, authorizations, and actions shall not be \n     subject to administrative or judicial review.\n\n     SECTION 2207. NO PRECEDENT.\n\n       Nothing in section 2104(d)(2) of this Title relating to \n     conditions or limitations on the appraisal of the Federal \n     lands, or any provision of section 2106 relating to the \n     approval by the Congress or the Forest Service of facilities \n     on National Forest System lands, shall be construed as a \n     precedent for subsequent legislation.\n\n            TITLE XXIII--COLONIAL NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.\n\n     SECTION 2301. COLONIAL NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.\n\n       (a) Transfer and Rights-of-Way.--The Secretary of the \n     Interior (hereinafter in this Title referred to as the \n     ``Secretary'') is authorized to transfer, without \n     reimbursement, to York County, Virginia, that portion of the \n     existing sewage disposal system, including related \n     improvements and structures, owned by the United States and \n     located within the Colonial National Historical Park, \n     together with such rights-of-way as are determined by the \n     Secretary to be necessary to maintain and operate such \n     system.\n       (b) Repair and Rehabilitation of System.--The Secretary is \n     authorized to enter into a cooperative agreement with York \n     County, Virginia, under which the Secretary will pay a \n     portion, not to exceed $110,000, of the costs of repair and \n     rehabilitation of the sewage disposal system referred to in \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Fees and Charges.--In consideration for the rights-of-\n     way granted under subsection (a), and in recognition of the \n     National Park Service's contribution authorized under \n     subsection (b), the cooperative agreement under subsection \n     (b) shall provide for a reduction in, or the elimination of, \n     the amounts charged to the National Park Service for its \n     sewage disposal.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that:\n       (1) In 1899, the citizens of Cuprum, Idaho, commissioned \n     E.S. Hesse to conduct a survey describing these lands \n     occupied by their community. The purpose of this survey was \n     to provide a basis for the application for a townsite patent.\n       (2) In 1909, the Cuprum Townsite patent (Number 52817) was \n     granted, based on an aliqot parts description which was \n     intended to circumscribe the Hesse survey.\n       (3) Since the day of the patent, the Hesse survey has been \n     used continuously by the community of Cuprum and by Adams \n     Country, Idaho, as the official townsite plat and basis for \n     conveyance of title within the townsite.\n       (4) Recent boundary surveys conducted by the United States \n     Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and the United \n     States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, \n     discovered inconsistencies between the official aliquot parts \n     description of the patented Cuprum Townsite and the Hesse \n     survey. Many lots along the south and east boundaries of the \n     townsite are now known to extend onto National Forest System \n     lands outside the townsite.\n       (5) It is the determination of Congress that the original \n     intent of the Cuprum Townsite application was to include all \n     the lands described by the Hesse survey.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Title to amend the \n     1909 Cuprum Townsite patent to include those additional lands \n     described by the Hesse survey in addition to other lands \n     necessary to provide an administratively acceptable boundary \n     to the National Forest System.\n\n     SECTION 3202. AMENDMENT OF PATENT.\n\n       (a) The 909 Cuprum Townsite patent is hereby amended to \n     include parcels 1 and 2, identified on the plat, marked as \n     ``Township 20 North, Range 3 West, Boise Meridian, Idaho, \n     Section 10: Proposed Patent Adjustment Cuprum Townsite, \n     Idaho'' prepared by Payette N.F.--Land Survey Unit, drawn and \n     approved by Tom Betzold, Forest Land Surveyor, on April 25, \n     1995. Such additional lands are hereby conveyed to the \n     original patentee, Pitts Ellis, trustee, and Probate Judge of \n     Washington County, Idaho, or any successors or assigns in \n     interest in accordance with State law. The Secretary of \n     Agriculture may correct clerical and typographical errors in \n     such plat.\n       (b) The Federal Government shall survey the Federal \n     property lines and mark and post the boundaries necessary to \n     implement this section.\n\n     SECTION 3203. RELEASE.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 120 of the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of \n     1980, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9620), the United States shall \n     not be liable and shall be held harmless from any and all \n     claims resulting from substances or petroleum products or any \n     other hazardous materials on the conveyed land.\n\n           TITLE XXXIII--ARKANSAS AND OKLAHOMA LAND EXCHANGE\n\n     SECTION 3301.

Mr. President, last year, I introduced bipartisan \nlegislation to establish a Corporate Subsidy Review, Reform, and \nTermination Commission.\n  The proposed eight-member panel, styled after the military base \nclosing commission would review Federal programs as well as provisions \nof the U.S. Tax Code to identify those that unduly subsidize specific \nprofit-making companies, select industries, or segments of an industry \nin a manner that is unfair or anticompetitive and has no compelling \npublic benefit. The Commission would recommend to Congress specific \nreforms and or termination of such subsidies, and Congress would \nconsider the package under limited procedures spelled out in the \nlegislation.\n  The establishment of such a Commission, though an inferior \nalternative to Congress taking action directly, has become necessary \nbecause Congress does not appear willing or able to eliminate or \nsignificantly reform corporate subsidies.\n  In these times of budget austerity, we are asking millions of \nAmericans--from families who receive food stamps to our men and women \nin uniform--to sacrifice in order to stop the Nation's fiscal bleeding. \nAs a matter of simple fairness, we have a moral obligation to ensure \nthat corporate interests share the burden.\n  The Cato and Progressive Policy Institutes, have identified 125 \nFederal programs that subsidize industry to the tune of $85 billion \nevery year, and PPI found an additional $30 billion in tax loopholes to \npowerful industries.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear, I am sure there are a number of \nprograms which could be classified as a corporate subsidy which may \nserve a public interest. And, every Senator in this Chamber, including \nthis Senator, have supported at one time or another a variety of these \nprograms.\n  So, no one is pure or innocent on the question of corporate \nsubsidies. But, blame is not the issue, that's only an oft-used \ndiversion. The issue is what is required of us today to reduce the debt \nthat grown larger every day, eating up a greater percentage of the \nbudget in debt service and submerging the prospects of our children as \nthey are required to spend an evergrowing portion of their life to pay \nour bills.\n  Under such circumstances, we are compelled to take a harder, more \njudicious, look at corporate subsidies and eliminate those that are not \njustified and do not have a compelling public interest.\n  As the Public Policy Institute observed,\n\n       The President and Congress can break the current impasse \n     and substantially reduce both spending and projected deficits \n     * * * if they are willing to eliminate or reform scores of \n     special spending programs and tax provisions narrowly \n     targeted to subsidize influential industries.\n\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, by acknowledging that I do not really \nlike the idea of commissions. In some instances reasonable and well-\nintentioned people may disagree on what is pork as opposed to a \nnecessary and vital program. But in many instances we know what can and \nshould be eliminated. The reality, however, is that Members will simply \nnot gore their own ox, unless others are forced to do the same. As with \nmilitary base closures--the mentality is--we either all go together or \nwe do not go at all. Perhaps that is the only fair way to do it.\n  An independent corporate pork commission with privileged and \nexpedited procedures to ensure congressional action would help us even \nbetter define what is an unnecessary and unwarranted corporate subsidy, \nand it will help us depoliticize the process, guarantee that the pain \nis shared, and might be the only realistic means of achieving the \nmeaningful reform that the public and our dire fiscal circumstances \ndemand.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to refine a commission \nand congressional consideration process that is fair, targeted, and \nappropriate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/21/senate-section/article/S2716-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CF INDUSTRIES, INC.\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today along with my \ncolleagues: Mr. Graham and Mr. Mack of Florida, Mr. Simon and Mrs. \nMoseley-Braun of Illinois, and Mr. Johnston of Louisiana, to pay \ntribute to CF Industries, Inc., which is celebrating its 50th \nanniversary this year. CF is an interregional farm supply cooperative \nowned by 11 regional cooperatives in the United States and Canada. CF's \nnitrogen, phosphate, and potash products reach over 1 million farmer-\nowners who depend on the CF system to manufacture and distribute \nagricultural fertilizers to them. We would like to congratulate CF and \nits employees on the high-quality products and services they have \nprovided to the Nation's farmers over the past 50 years and their \ncommitment to sound environmental, health, and safety practices.\n  Established in 1946 as Central Farmers Fertilizer Co., CF began as a \nbroker for sales of fertilizer products to farmer-members with the goal \nof becoming the Nation's major fertilizer supplier for the agricultural \ncooperative community. Through 1960, CF evolved from a broker to a \nmanufacturer and distributor of fertilizer products.\n  Today, CF has become more than the founding members have ever \nenvisioned. CF manufacturing plants include nitrogen fertilizer \ncomplexes in Donaldsonville, LA, and Medicine Hat, AB, Canada, as well \nas extensive phosphate mining and manufacturing facilities in Florida. \nCF plants have the capacity to produce more than 8 million tons of \nfertilizer products annually. In 1995, CF sales totaled over $1.3 \nbillion.\n  Products are distributed to farmer-members in 46 States and two \nCanadian provinces through an extensive system.

PAUL'S EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate St. \nPaul's Evangelical Lutheran Church of Northville, MI, on their 100th \nanniversary. Just over 100 years ago, a group of German speaking \nresidents began meeting on Sunday mornings, forming what was to become \nthe Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Reformation of Northville. On \nAugust 30, 1896, the congregation celebrated Holy Communion for the \nfirst time.\n  Remembering the verse in Proverbs, ``The fear of the Lord is the \nbeginning of wisdom,'' the congregation started a Christian Day School \nin September with seven children attending the first\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\nsemester. Less than 1 year later, St. Paul's church purchased the deed \nto property on Elm Street. The church still resides at that location.\n  On November 28, 1948, ground was broken for the new church building. \nDedicated in February 1950, the Gothic building contained three \nbeautiful stained glass windows located above the altar symbolizing the \nHoly Trinity. Other windows throughout the nave tell the story of \nChrist's apostles.\n  Since 1896, the congregation at St. Paul's has met faithfully on \nSunday mornings. The Day School continues to serve families of St. \nPaul's and the Northville community.\n  Again, congratulations to this community. I wish it many more years \nof fellowship and worship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/21/senate-section/article/S2716-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ICI EXPORT LTD.\n\n Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I applaud the Anti-Defamation League \n[ADL] for its continuing work to expose and combat hate crimes, and to \nbring your attention to its most recent ``Audit of Anti-Semitic \nIncidents.'' For the past 17 years, the ADL has compiled data about \nanti-Jewish attacks. Their efforts in the collection of data and the \ndevelopment of programs regarding anti-Semitic acts increase public \nawareness of this problem, and help generate constructive solutions. I \ncommend ADL for continuing this important endeavor and would like to \nshare with you some of their recent findings.\n  In 1995, the total number of anti-Semitic incidents reported to the \nAnti-Defamation League--including acts against property and persons--\nwas 1,843. I am pleased to report that this total represents a decrease \nof 223 incidents, or 11 percent, from the 1994 total of 2,066. This is \nthe largest decline in 10 years. Unfortunately, the decline is \ncontrasted with the seriousness of many of the incidents reported. For \nthe fifth straight year in a row, acts of anti-Semitic harassment \nagainst individuals outnumber incidents of vandalism against \ninstitutions and other property. In 1995, the 1,116 incidents of \nharassment account for 61 percent of all incidents, compared to 727 \naccounts of vandalism. Fortunately, the 1,116 incidents of harassment, \nthreats, and assaults represents a decrease of 81, or 7 percent from \nthe 1994 total of 1,197, which was the highest on record. Although it \nis encouraging to see the number of harassments down from previous \nyears, I am troubled that incidents of harassment remain one of the \ndominant forms of anti-Semitic activity.\n  Although the ADL audit provides useful statistics about anti-Semitism \ngenerally, it is particularly revealing to consider specific incidents. \nOne particularly violent incident occurred in Cincinnati, OH, when a \ngroup of four youths assaulted the son of a community rabbi, chasing \nhim for about a block before they caught him outside of the synagogue \nand beat him until he collapsed on the street. The ADL also reported an \nincident of arson in New York City, at Freddy's Fashion Mart, where \neight people, including the arsonist himself, died. At Fresno State \nCollege, following the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak \nRabin, the student-run newspaper printed an article calling Rabin, \n``The most despicable mass murderer the 20th century has seen, making \nHitler look like Big Bird.''\n  Sadly, 1995 saw a large number of anti-Semitic incidences on college \ncampuses. One disturbing incident occurred at the University of \nPennsylvania. On March 24, two students were walking in an area \nimmediately off campus. Derogatory epithets were shouted at them by two \nstudents sitting on the porch of a private home. When the Jewish \nstudents confronted them, one of the two went into the house and \nreturned brandishing a shotgun which he used to threaten the Jewish \nstudents, who quickly fled the scene.\n  On another somber note, the number of arrests made in conjunction \nwith anti-Semitic hate crimes was 108, a significant decrease of 33 \nfrom last year's arrest total of 141. This may be attributed to either \nfewer crimes or underreporting of crime instances. However, the number \nof arrests is still relatively high, which is encouraging. Law \nenforcement agencies have been making intensive efforts to refine \nprocedures for investigation of hate crimes, with the assistance of the \nADL and other human relations organizations.\n  In closing, I again want to commend the ADL for its outstanding and \nimportant work and ask that portions of the ADL report be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                 Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents--1995\n\n\n                              the findings\n\n       In 1995, the total number of anti-Semitic incidents \n     reported to the Anti-Defamation League--including acts \n     against both property and persons--was 1,843. This total, \n     comprising reports from 42 states and the District of \n     Columbia, represents a decrease of 223 incidents, or 11 \n     percent, from the 1994 total of 2,066.\n       The four states reporting the highest totals of anti-\n     Semitic incidents of all kinds in 1995 were: New York (370), \n     California (264), New Jersey (228), and Florida (152). These \n     four states account for 1,014 of the 1,843 incidents reported \n     (55 percent).\n       The 1995 audit reveals the following new developments:\n       (1) The decline in violent crime in the U.S. that has been \n     reported by Federal and municipal law enforcement in 1995 \n     carries over\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\n     into anti-Semitic bias incidents as well. The overall 11 \n     percent decline reflected in this year's Audit is the first \n     since 1992, and the largest decline in 10 years. Thus, the \n     Audit statistics mirror the state of crime in American \n     society. Enhanced security awareness by Jewish institutions, \n     steadily improving law enforcement action, and passage of \n     hate crimes legislation have likely contributed to this \n     decline.\n       (2) The decline is contrasted with the seriousness of many \n     of the incidents reported. An extremely violent arson \n     incident in New York City led to several deaths. In addition, \n     the number of cemetery desecrations (one of the most serious \n     and hurtful forms of vandalism, which affects an entire \n     community) actually increased over 1994.\n       (3) The number of incidents occurring on the college campus \n     shows the first decline since 1987, and only the second since \n     the Audit began separately counting such incidents in 1984. \n     In 1995, 118 campus incidents occurred, a decrease of 25 (17 \n     percent) from the 1994 total of 143.\n       In addition to the aforementioned findings, the 1995 \n     figures maintain two important trends noted in the 1994 ADL \n     study:\n       (1) For the fifth straight year, acts of anti-Semitic \n     harassment outnumber incidents of vandalism. In 1995, the \n     1,116 incidents of harassment account for 61 percent of all \n     incidents, vs. 727 incidents of vandalism. The number of \n     harassments and assaults in 1995 dropped by 81, or 7 percent, \n     from 1994.\n       (2) As in previous years, of the total of 727 incidents of \n     vandalism, the number of vandalism incidents committed \n     against public properly locations (362)--i.e., public school \n     buildings, bridges, and sign posts--in 1995 was more than \n     twice that committed against synagogues and other Jewish \n     institutional targets (145). (The remaining 220 vandalism \n     incidents were perpetrated against privately owned property.) \n     This pattern continues a trend seen over the previous five \n     years. Vandals, it seems, are still opting for the more \n     numerous and harder-to-protect public locations rather than \n     the generally better secured and increasingly more aware \n     Jewish institutions. In recent years, such institutions have \n     also become better protected by more intensive law \n     enforcement action.\n\n\n              fewer incidents--but many still very serious\n\n       In contrast to the overall decline in incidents reported in \n     1995, there were several particularly troubling incidents \n     which took place over the last year.\n       On November 11, 1995, the FBI arrested four suspects in a \n     foiled attempt to bomb several offices of civil rights \n     organizations around the country, including ADL Regional \n     Offices. Willie Ray Lampley, Cecilia Lampley, Larry Wayne \n     Crow, and John Dare Baird had been allegedly conspiring since \n     August 1995 to build homemade bombs out of ammonium nitrate, \n     fuel oil, and other ingredients to destroy the ADL Houston \n     office, a second unnamed ADL office, the Southern Poverty Law \n     Center in Montgomery, Alabama, and two other targets to be \n     decided by the ``Tri-State Militia.''\n       The FBI became aware of the plans on a tip from local law \n     enforcement sources in South Dakota, and closely monitored \n     the development plot through the use of undercover informants \n     and surveillance. All of the suspects were arrested without \n     incident, and indicted on Federal charges.\n       On December 8th, Roland Smith entered Freddy's Fashion Mart \n     on Harlem's historic 125th Street in New York City. According \n     to the New York Times (Dec. 9, 10), he then produced a \n     revolver and yelled ``It's on now!'' and ordered all blacks \n     to leave the store. After this he began to fire the gun, and \n     to spread a flammable liquid over the racks of clothing in \n     the store, before igniting them. When the fire department had \n     finally extinguished the flames, 8 people were dead, \n     including Smith. An additional 4 people were wounded.\n       Fred Harari, the Jewish owner of Freddy's, was involved in \n     a landlord-tenant dispute with Sikhulu Shange, the black \n     owner of the Record Shack, a store subletting an adjacent \n     property. (The entire property was actually owned by the \n     United House of Prayer for All People, a Black church). Mr. \n     Shange enlisted the support of the 125th Street Vendors \n     Association, which organized demonstrations outside of \n     Freddy's. Though it started as a simple economic dispute, the \n     demonstrators quickly began to characterize it in terms of a \n     white Jewish-owned business trying to force a black business \n     off 125th Street. In late November, Mr. Harari complained \n     that the demonstrations, which was supported by community \n     newspapers and radio stations, were taking an anti-Semitic \n     tone, and were laced with increasingly violent racist \n     rhetoric.\n       On Saturday, February 18, members of the Ohev Shalom \n     Synagogue in York, PA, arrived for services to find a severed \n     pig's head mounted on the front door. The community quickly \n     rallied behind the efforts of law enforcement officials to \n     apprehend the perpetrator, and support the synagogue. At a \n     vote on a motion to condemn the incident, town supervisor \n     Lori Mitrick states that the Jewish community should know \n     ``this is not just an embarrassment to them, it is an \n     embarrassment to all decent human beings.''\n       Determined police work led to the eventual arrest and \n     conviction of 22-year-old Mason E. Aldrich for institutional \n     vandalism, desecration of venerated objects, and criminal \n     conspiracy. He was sentenced to 23 months in jail and ordered \n     to perform 120 hours of community service, including 15 hours \n     of cultural awareness programming with ADL.\n       In interviews leading up to his October 16 Million Man \n     March, the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan sought to \n     justify his referring to Jews and others as ``blood \n     suckers.'' On Reuters Television, Farrakhan explained, ``Many \n     of the Jews who owned the homes, the apartments in the black \n     community, we considered them bloodsuckers because they took \n     from our community but didn't offer anything back to our \n     community.'' Minister Farrakhan was interviewed by many \n     national news programs in the weeks leading up to the march, \n     interspersing many of his remarks with thinly veiled \n     conspiracy theory anti-Semitism.\n       In addition to the above incidents, other troubling acts \n     included the beating of a rabbi's son in Cincinnati, OH, and \n     the intimidation of the cast of a play about the Holocaust in \n     Honolulu, HI. At the University of Pennsylvania, two Jewish \n     students were threatened by other students brandishing a \n     shotgun, after being taunted with anti-Semitic epithets. In \n     California, a home-made fire-bomb was thrown at a synagogue. \n     The bomb did not detonate, and the synagogue was spared. \n     (Please see Examples of Harassment, Threats and Assaults, p. \n     4; Campus Incidents, p. 9; and A Look at Some Noteworthy \n     Incidents, p. 13, for more information.)\n\n\n                   Harassment, threats, and assaults\n\n       In 1995, the number of incidents of anti-Semitic \n     harassment, threats, and assaults directed at Jewish \n     individuals and institutions totaled 1,116. This total \n     represents a decrease of 81, or 7 percent from the 1994 total \n     of 1,197, which was the highest on record.\n       This category of incidents covers a large variety of \n     intimidating and hostile acts, including: slanderous anti-\n     Semitic and neo-Nazi hate literature mailed or disseminated \n     in public places; slurs directed against Jewish individuals \n     walking to synagogue services or campus gatherings; speeches \n     given on campus containing anti-Semitic language; Holocaust-\n     denial advertisements in campus newspapers; a threatening \n     phone call to a synagogue or Jewish school; as well as direct \n     physical violence against Jewish persons as a result of their \n     identity. Although many incidents of harassment are not \n     crimes, they continue to constitute overt and painful \n     expressions of anti-Semitic hatred.\n       While it is encouraging that the number of harassments is \n     down from previous years, a troubling trend has been \n     maintained in the 1995 totals. As in past years, incidents of \n     harassment are significantly more common than incidents of \n     vandalism. While any expression of anti-Semitic behavior is \n     troubling, the high number of these more personalized attacks \n     is a cause for particular concern.\n\n\n         examples of harassment, threat, and assault incidents\n\n       The following is a representative sampling of 1995 \n     incidents of anti-Semitic harassment, threats, and assaults \n     in the 20 states reporting the highest totals of such acts.\n       1. New York (200 incidents) March--Upon leaving a dance \n     club late at night, a group of men was approached by several \n     people who asked if they were Jewish.

Minnesota (20) February--The National Socialist \n     American Workers Freedom Movement, a neo-Nazi group, \n     distributed flyers questioning the Holocaust and filled with \n     virulently anti-Semitic statements. (Minneapolis)\n       15. Texas (20) February--A 15-year-old Jewish student was \n     assaulted by a gang of 15 skinheads. He escaped without \n     serious injury. (Alamo Heights)\n       16.
