Mr. President, this morning there will be a period for \nmorning business until the hour of 10:30 a.m., with Senators permitted \nto speak for up to 5 minutes each. Following morning business today, it \nwould be my intention to begin consideration of a continuing \nresolution. We are fast approaching the end of this fiscal year. It \ncertainly is my hope that we would be allowed to begin this important \nappropriations measure. At this time, we are unable to reach an \nagreement to begin that bill. I tried several different approaches last \nFriday in discussions with the Democratic leader. We were not able to \ncome to any agreement at that time, but we will keep working today. \nHopefully, we can reach some understanding as to how we would proceed.\n  In accordance with the agreement reached on Friday, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the maritime security legislation today at \n4:30, with a series of rollcall votes beginning at 5 p.m. on or in \nrelation to pending amendments as well as final passage on that. I \npresume there would be at least four votes at that time. So we will \nhave the stacked votes at 5 o'clock.\n  We are also hoping that the one outstanding issue on S. 1505, the \npipeline safety bill, could be resolved, and we could complete action \non that measure also.\n  It is my understanding that the VA-HUD appropriations conference \nreport may be available for consideration this afternoon. I know that \nthe agreement has been worked out and that they are scheduled to vote \nsometime today. I do not know exactly what time we will get it. But as \nsoon as we get it, we will try to get it into the mix at the earliest \npossible opportunity. It certainly is an important appropriations bill \ndealing with the Veterans' Administration and, of course, all of our \nhousing policies in the country. We need to get that bill completed in \norder for the checks to go out on time at the end of this week or \ncertainly the first of next week.\n  We will stand in recess today from 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly \npolicy conferences to meet. Once again, I ask for the cooperation of \nall Senators as we begin what I hope will be the final week of the \nSenate's business prior to adjournment. In order to accomplish that, it \nis going to take a lot of cooperation, a lot of give-and-take. I \ncertainly will make every effort to work with all Senators. I hope \nSenators understand that this week is going to be very hard to schedule \nvotes around other events, especially if we are really moving seriously \ntoward completing our work, as we should, on Friday or Saturday.\n  In addition to that, we are working to see if we can clear problems \nwith the NIH revitalization authorization bill. I understand there is \nthe potential point of order that maybe can be worked out. There is a \nlot of support for this important legislation. I hope maybe we could do \nit like we did last week on the Magnuson fisheries bill, the FAA \nreauthorization, and the maritime bill. We can work through those \nproblems and hopefully get about an hour to have some discussion to get \na vote.\n  We are also working with Senator Kassebaum, who is very, very \ninterested in the job partnership training legislation. There are \nproblems there again, a point of order, which looks like it may not be \nresolvable, but we may call it up for some discussion this\n\n[[Page S11126]]\n\nweek and see what can be accomplished.\n  I want to remind Senators we expect a veto override vote to occur on \nThursday on the partial-birth abortion ban. And there are requests from \nSenators to be able to speak on that matter today also. But we would \nschedule a vote for Thursday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11125-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN DURICKA\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate and all Americans lost a true \nprofessional yesterday. Veteran Associated Press photographer John \nDuricka died Monday at Arlington Hospital after long battle with \ncancer.\n  The measure of John's professionalism and dedication is that he was \non the job almost right up to the time of his death--doing what he \nloved and doing it wonderfully well.\n  John's combination of mature demeanor and tough determination was a \nfamiliar face to all of us here in the Senate. He was a news \nphotographer first--make no doubt about that.\n  But he also respected the institution which he illustrated to the \nworld every day with his pictures. Unlike the White House or the \nFederal agencies where photographers often are cordoned off from those \nthey cover, the Congress shares its space with the media.\n  John Duricka respected that unique relationship that we had with him \nand we returned that respect with our trust and appreciation for his \ntalent.\n  I want to express the Senate's sympathy to his son Darren, his \ndaughter Tammy, and his mother Emily Duricka.\n  All who treasure our freedoms of the press and free expression will \nmiss his outstanding contributions to that end. We in the Senate will \nmiss a respected friend.

BURTON\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on August 13, Geary Thomas Burton tragically \nand unexpectedly died while undergoing surgery to correct a knee injury \nhe sustained during a recent church-related softball game. He was only \n45 years old at the time of his death. Geary was known to all of us on \nthe Armed Services Committee and to many here in the Senate because he \nwas a very important member of the staff of the Armed Services \nCommittee from 1989 to 1991.\n  Today, I want to take this opportunity to recall Geary's many \nprofessional accomplishments and describe for my colleagues the life of \nthis remarkable individual who served the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee with great distinction for more than 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  Geary Burton was born on June 30, 1951, in Pittsburgh, PA. We are \nprivileged to have his mother, Lura Burton, sitting in the Senate \nGallery today, along with Geary's sister Nancy and her daughers Claudia \nand Claudette. It was through Mrs. Burton's love, hard work, and \ndevotion in raising Geary and his sister, Nancy, that he developed such \nstrong character and learned the value and importance of a good \neducation. In 1973, Geary earned a bachelor of arts degree at Thiel \nCollege in Greenville, PA, where he majored in political science. He \ncontinued his education and earned a law degree from Duquesne Law \nSchool in 1976.\n  With great energy and dedication, Geary used his education and skills \nas an attorney in the service of our country. In August 1973, he \nreceived a commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps. \nHe served as a criminal trial lawyer on active duty with the Judge \nAdvocate General Corps from 1977 to 1981. Even after his release from \nactive duty in March 1981, Geary continued to serve as an officer in \nthe Marine Corps Reserve. In November 1982, he was promoted to the rank \nof major. We all know the Marines set very high standards--and Geary \nfully met these standards. Geary's accomplishments as one of ``The Few \nand the Proud'' are notable. I recall in many conversations with Geary \nhe was extremely proud of his service with this elite military \norganization.\n  In March 1981, Geary accepted a position with the Office of General \nCounsel at the General Accounting Office, where he served as legal \ncounsel to the evaluator staff charged with auditing the Department of \nDefense, a very major responsibility. Geary consistently demonstrated a \nhigh degree of proficiency in performing his duties and moved quickly \nup the civil service ranks. In less than 7 years, he earned three \npromotions and obtained a GS-15 ranking at the age of 36--which is a \nremarkable achievement.\n  Geary joined the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee as a \ndetailee from the General Accounting Office in April 1989 to work on \nthe complex issues of defense acquisition reform. I remember \nrequestiang from the GAO one of their best people. We did not know \nGeary at the time but we really needed help. They certainly lived up to \nthat request because they sent us a very talented young man. He quickly \nearned the respect and admiration of his fellow staff members as well \nas Senators on both sides of the aisle with whom he was in regular \ncontact. Geary's tenure with the Armed Services Committee lasted until \nDecember 1992. During that period, he served as counsel to the \ncommittee for defense procurement and small business issues. We tried \nto keep Geary but finally the GAO demanded he come home because they \nneeded him very bad.\n  Geary successfully conducted research, drafted legislation, and \ndeveloped congressional and public support for many key legislative \ninitiatives. He performed a vital role in helping the Armed Services \nCommittee make numerous changes to defense acquisition policy that were \nrequired in the face of the post-cold-war defense build-down. Geary \nworked hard to enhance the role of small and disadvantaged businesses, \nhistorically black colleges and universities, and other minority \neducational institutions in defense acquisition practices. Geary's key \nparticipation in the establishment of the Pilot Mentor-Protege Program \nwas a direct reflection of the innovation and creativity that he \nbrought to the committee in drafting acquisition legislation. In \naddition, Geary provided outstanding staff work in the oversight of \nprograms designed to foster greater government-industry cooperation and \nto increase the use of commercial products and processes in Government \nprocurement which has saved and will continue to save on an increasing \nbasis literally millions and billions of the tax dollars for the \nAmerican people. This of course has been a top priority of Secretary of \nDefense Bill Perry.\n  While Geary's dedication and professional competence contributed to a \nhighly successful career, Geary was totally devoted to his family and \nthe community in which he lived. He was an active member of St. John \nthe Evangelist Baptist Church in Columbia, MD. In his extended \ncommunity of Howard County, MD, Geary served as a member of the board \nfor the African-American Coalition and helped establish the Black \nStudent Achievement Program. There is a saying that ``Those who possess \nthe torch of wisdom should allow others to come and light their candles \nby that torch.'' Geary Burton followed this principle in both his \nprofessional and personal life to the great benefit of both the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and his local community. His service to our \ncommittee, to the Senate, and to the Nation was superb.\n\n  Geary will be missed most of all by his devoted family but he will \nalso be missed by all of us who worked with him. He was simply a superb \nindividual in every sense of the word.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to say to Geary's family--his wife, \nLaVarne; his two daughters, Ruth Giovanni and Beth Angela; his stepson \nKevin Taylor; his mother Lura Burton; his sister, Nancy Bellony, and \nher\n\n[[Page S11127]]\n\ndaughters Claudia and Claudette--that my thoughts and prayers, and \nthose of all of the members and staff of the Armed Services Committee \nwith whom Geary served, are with you in these difficult days. Geary was \na respected colleague and trusted friend. We will always be grateful \nfor his service to the Senate and to his Nation. We will always recall \nwith great fondness and with wonderful, wonderful memories his warm \npersonality and the energy and enthusiasm with which he approached his \nwork and his life.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd be \npermitted to proceed in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished President pro tempore of the \nSenate is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thurmond pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2104 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may inquire, I believe I have been \nallocated 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the President.\n  Mr. President, I have served as a Member of this body for nearly 16 \nyears.\n  In that time, few accomplishments have given me as much pride as the \nday in February 1993 when President Clinton signed into law the Family \nand Medical Leave Act.\n  Enactment of family leave legislation threw millions of struggling \nAmericans a lifeline.\n  It made it easier for the American people to balance the \nresponsibilities of work with the needs of their families.\n  And most important, it said to the American people: If you or a loved \none becomes ill, you won't be forced to choose between your family and \nyour job.\n  I point out that we were the last of the industrialized nations--in \nfact, last of many nations in this World--to actually adopt a family \nand medical leave policy.\n  It took 7 years from the introduction of the legislation until it \nfinally became law. Patricia Schroeder--also representing the State \nwhich the Presiding Officer represents--was the author of the \nlegislation in the House. I introduced the legislation in the Senate. \nSeven years we spent trying to get this bill to become the law of the \nland. It was an experience fraught with highs and lows.\n  Today, September 24, marks the fourth anniversary of one of those \nmoments on the road to passage. It was in 1992, on September 24, that \nthe Senate voted to override President Bush's veto of the Family and \nMedical Leave Act. Today, to mark this important anniversary, Americans \nare gathering all across the country in nearly 40 States.\n\n  Families, community members, and businessmen who found life better \nunder the Family and Medical Leave Act will meet and share their \nexperiences with the American public. And today the First Lady will \ntravel to Connecticut to hear from those in my State who have seen the \nbenefits of the Family and Medical Leave Act in their own families' \nlives.\n  Now, I would like to go back to 4 years ago today. On that date in \n1992, 67 of our colleagues--from both sides of the aisle--joined me in \nvoting to override the President's veto of the Family and Medical Leave \nAct. It was in fact only the second veto override of President Bush. \nUnfortunately, 6 days later, the House voted to sustain the President's \nveto, thereby killing the Family and Medical Leave Act once again. It \nhad been the second veto we had been through in 7 years.\n  Our former colleague, Bob Dole, the then minority leader of the \nSenate, was one of those 31 Senators to vote against giving America's \nworking families a helping hand. And just this month on the campaign \ntrail Bob Dole attacked the Family and Medical Leave Act as what he \ncalled, and I quote him, ``the long arm of the Federal Government.''\n  I think the 12 million Americans who have taken advantage of the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act over the past 2 years would probably \ndisagree with that view. I think that the 67 million Americans who are \nnow covered and eligible to take family and medical leave would have a \ndifferent opinion than that of the former minority and majority leader.\n  For those, such as former Senator Dole, who continue to doubt the \nsuccess of the Family and Medical Leave Act, I urge them to examine a \nrecent bipartisan report which highlights the success of this \nlegislation.\n  You may recall, Mr. President, that as part of the legislation we \nformed a bipartisan commission on family and medical leave to examine \nwhat the ramifications would be. Members of the commission were made up \nof both Democrat and Republican appointees, as well as opponents and \nproponents of the legislation. We spent over a year examining the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act with significant surveys of employers and \nemployees, with hearings conducted across the country, as well as here \nin Washington, to examine what the implications of the bill had been.\n  The overall findings of this commission were clear. In fact, the \ncommission was unanimous that the Family and Medical Leave Act has been \nan overwhelming success. What is more, according to the commission's \nfinal report, the law represents, and I am quoting the report, ``a \nsignificant step in helping a larger cross-section of working Americans \nmeet their medical and family care-giving needs while still maintaining \ntheir jobs and economic security.''\n  The bottom line is that family and medical leave legislation is \nallowing millions of working Americans significant opportunities to \nkeep their health benefits, maintain job security, and take leave for \nlonger and greater reasons.\n  Let us be clear on one point. Contrary to Senator Dole's \nprotestations, family leave has also been good for American business. \nThe conclusions of the bipartisan report, I think, are very important \nin this regard. And they certainly are a far cry from the concerns that \nBob Dole and others voiced when this legislation was being considered \nin Congress.\n  Mr. President, let me draw your attention, if I may, to this first \nchart which reflects a survey done of business leaders by the \ncommission. The vast majority of businesses, nearly 94 percent reported \nlittle or no additional costs associated with the Family and Medical \nLeave Act. I was stunned by this conclusion since the commission was \nanalyzing the initial phases of the legislation. The initial phases of \na legislation are always the most difficult, with businesses having to \naccommodate, get used to it, and develop bureaucratic procedures within \ntheir own businesses to accommodate the new legislation.\n\n  In my view, it is almost an astounding result that 94 percent of the \nbusinesses surveyed reported no difficulty in this initial time period. \nI assumed that such positive results would have come later as business \nbecame more used to the law and not during the initial stages, which \ntend to be the most awkward time.\n  So that was a rather compelling result from the list of the employers \nwe surveyed. By the way, let me add that there were hundreds of \nemployers and employees questioned in the commission's survey of \nreactions to the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  When it comes to the employee performance, which was another concern\n\n[[Page S11128]]\n\nthat was presented during the debate over family leave--as well as by \nour former colleague, Bob Dole--about what would be the effect on \nemployee performances, what would happen to productivity, what would \nhappen to growth when you had people moving in and moving out, as the \ncritics claimed, nearly 96 percent of the employers reported no \nnoticeable effect on growth. The concern was that this legislation \nwould bring growth rates down. In fact, according to employers, 95.8 \npercent said there was no noticeable effect at all. Interestingly, 1 \npercent said they had a positive growth effect. If fact, we had only \n3.1 percent who said it had a negative effect, again, in just the first \n2 years of the bill being the law of the land.\n  More than 94 percent reported no effect on employee turnover. This \nwas another accusation, that we are going to get huge turnover rates \nfrom family leave legislation, and yet on turnover rates, 94.7 percent \nof businesses reported no problems with turnover whatsoever.\n  Eighty-three percent of the employers reported no noticeable impact \non employee productivity. We were told, once again, that productivity \nrates would fall--businesses would lose people and have to hire \ntemporary employees to come in for a period of time. Supposedly this \nwould cause productivity rates would fall. In fact, 83 percent said the \nlaw had no impact on productivity whatsoever. In fact, 12.6 percent \nactually said the law had a positive effect on productivity because, I \npresume, people no longer had to worry about losing their job because \nof a family crisis.\n  As we all know, Mr. President, family and medical leave is more than \njust statistics. There are real Americans behind these numbers. In \ncompiling our bipartisan report on family and medical leave, we heard \ntestimony from Americans who have been helped by this legislation. None \nof the commissioners--none of the commissioners, Mr. President--will \never forget the story of the Weaver family that we heard during our \nhearing in Chicago.\n  Melissa Weaver of Port Lavaca, TX, was 10 years old when she was \ndiagnosed with a rare form of cancer, and after undergoing a year of \nsurgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatments, her doctor regretfully \ninformed her parents, Ken and Rosie Weaver, that she had only a few \nmonths to live. Because of the Family and Medical Leave Act, over the \nnext 7 weeks, the Weavers were given the bittersweet opportunity to \nspend every moment together with Melissa during her final days.\n  In January 1994, Nedra Ward, an administrative assistant in Chicago, \ndiscovered she was pregnant. After her first trimester, she developed \ncomplications, putting her health and pregnancy at risk. Her employer \nallowed her to take time off on an intermittent basis. Today, she has \nboth her job and a healthy, strong, baby boy.\n  Jonathan Zingman's second daughter was born in 1994. Two weeks after \nthe cesarean section birth, the baby developed an infection and was \nhospitalized. Jonathan Zingman took 2 weeks off from work to aid his \nwife in recovering from surgery, to take care of his new daughter, and \nto give his older daughter an opportunity to adjust to her new sister.\n  What the Weavers, Nedra Ward, and Jonathan Zingman all have in common \nis that due to the Family and Medical Leave Act, they were not forced \nto make a choice between their jobs and their families.\n\n  As the author of this legislation, I would prefer that no one would \never have to use it because of a sickness, but as we all know, life is \nnot so kind. The Family and Medical Leave Act has given these three \nAmerican families, as it will millions of others, the opportunity to \ntake medical leave when illness strikes and the necessary time to care \nfor ailing family members and loved ones.\n  I hope that Mr. Dole and others, particularly Mr. Dole, would retract \nany suggestion that he might repeal the Family and Medical Leave Act if \nelected. I can think of few other pieces of legislation that have had \nsuch a positive and beneficial impact on the American public as this \nlegislation, which is now the law of the land because President Clinton \nsigned it in February 1993. But for 7 long years we had to fight day in \nand day out to enact family and medical leave legislation. We fought \nthrough two veto overrides, in which we succeeded in one but eventually \nlost the fight in the House of Representatives. To repeal this \nlegislation now would be a major setback, in my view, for America's \nworking families and I hope that on this one piece of legislation Bob \nDole will admit he was wrong and agree today that family and medical \nleave will, and must, remain the law of the land.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, Kentucky writer and farmer Wendell Berry \nwrote that:\n\n       Though I would just as soon get along without it, a \n     humbling awareness of the complexity of moral issues is said \n     to be a good thing. If such an awareness is, in fact good--\n     and if I, in fact, have it--I have tobacco to thank for it.\n\n  Like Berry, any awareness I have of moral complexities is also thanks \nto tobacco. Now I know there are some people who don't think there is \nanything at all complex about the tobacco issue. For them it is simply \nmoney versus morality.\n  For them there is no family business, there is no tradition, there is \nno farmer. And perhaps most disturbing--there is no appetite for \nreason.\n  That is something that we seem to be in short supply of here, from \nthose who are determined to regulate an industry out of business to \nthose who would rather play politics than protect our farmers.\n  These opportunists are thinking only of themselves and today, rather \nthan all of us and tomorrow. And in the process, teenagers keep \nsmoking, farmers fret about their futures, and the litigation \ncontinues.\n  I will admit that when it comes to Kentucky, I can be as hard as a \nbull's head. But, on the issue of teen smoking, I have been as \nreasonable as they come. I am one of the biggest defenders of tobacco, \nyet 1 year ago I, Wendell Ford, introduced legislation putting severe \nrestrictions on the tobacco industry in an effort to reach a reasonable \nsolution to the problem of teen smoking. Today, a full year later, none \nof my friends on the other side of the aisle have joined as a cosponsor \nor offered other legislative options.\n  And this is not my first attempt at reason on the issue of youth \nsmoking or on the issue of the health effects of smoking by any means.\n  Mr. President, when I was Governor back in 1973, I worked with the \nlegislature to create the Tobacco Research Board and authorized the \nUniversity of Kentucky to begin an intensive research program directed \ntoward ``proving or disproving questions about health hazards to \ntobacco users . . ..''\n  In 1984, I sat down at the table and came up with reasonable warning \nlabels for tobacco products.\n  In 1992, I sat down at the table and hammered out an agreement on a \nnational minimum age for the purchase of cigarettes. We backed those \nSAMSHA purchasing requirements with teeth, to ensure States did \neverything they could to enforce the law.\n  In 1994, I was right at the table when my colleague, Senator \nLautenberg, decided to offer his pro kids bill, prohibiting smoking in \nany building that receives Federal funds and to which children have \naccess. I did not stand in the way.\n  I sat down at the table time and again because like everyone else, I \nam against youth smoking. But I also sat down at the table because I \nrealized that inaction was not a solution to the problem of youth \nsmoking, just as it is not a solution today.\n\n[[Page S11129]]\n\n  Don't get me wrong. I am as angry as I can be that the FDA is being \ngiven jurisdiction over tobacco. Bringing in the FDA will only create a \nwhole new bureaucracy when tobacco is already regulated by at least \nseven Federal agencies including USDA, HHS, BATF, IRS, SAMSHA, EPA, and \nthe FTC. I have it right here, Mr. President, a stack of all the \ncurrent Federal tobacco laws and regulations--oh, about 18 inches \ntall--and this does not even include the tens of thousands of pages of \nState tobacco law and regulations. And now with the new FDA \nregulations, I can add another 200 pages from the Federal Register to \nthis stack here on my desk.\n  But despite my frustrations and complete opposition to FDA \nregulation, I know that simply ignoring the problem is not going to \nfly, just as putting tobacco out of business is not going to fly.\n  The only answer is a legislative solution. Unfortunately, instead of \nworking with me over the past year to come up with a legislative \nsolution for our farmers, many in Congress have chosen to use the FDA \nregulations as a campaign rallying cry. But while they are stonewalling \nto win the tobacco farmers' vote today, where will they be if the \ncourts rule against our farmers tomorrow? They must be prepared to \nanswer for their inaction.\n  Anyone who says this can be solved with one vote at the polls in \nNovember is not shooting straight. That is because everyone familiar \nwith this issue knows that the FDA would have been sued if they took \nthis action, and they would have been sued if they took no action.\n  I do not care who you have in the White House next January or holding \nthe gavel here in Congress, you have a problem that is going to be \nsolved one of two ways--in the courts or in Congress. It's a fact that \nfarmers have a bigger voice in the Halls of Congress then they do in a \ncourt room. We are forcing farmers to play Russian roulette with the \ncourt system and giving them an uncertain and ambiguous future.\n  It has been clear to me--and should be clear to others--that we must \nhave a legislative solution for our farmers. We need a legislative \nsolution because FDA jurisdiction has been rejected by the courts in \nthe past, because the question of FDA regulation may be tied up in \nlitigation into the next century, and because many aspects of the FDA \nregulation go beyond what is needed to target youth smoking.\n  With good reason, tobacco supporters are most troubled by this last \nreason--that the FDA regulations go beyond what is necessary to target \nteen smoking. We do not believe Dr. Kessler's desire to reduce smoking \nis his only motivation for regulating tobacco, and the regulations \nthemselves further undermine his credibility on the issue. Let me \nquote, Mr. President, from the Federal Register notice accompanying the \nregulation:\n\n       . . . FDA intends to classify cigarettes and smokeless \n     tobacco at a future time,--\n\n  Classify cigarettes and smokeless tobacco at a future time?\n\n     and will impose any additional requirements that apply as a \n     result of their classification. . . .\n\n  It does not sound like they are just after youth smoking.\n  Like me, my farmers want to know exactly what that means for tobacco. \nAccording to Dr. Kessler, a pretty grim future. Back in February 1994 \nin a letter concerning FDA authority over tobacco, he wrote:\n\n       A strict application of these provisions could mean, \n     ultimately, removal from the market of tobacco products \n     containing nicotine at levels that cause or satisfy \n     addiction. Only those tobacco products from which the \n     nicotine had been removed or, possibly, tobacco products \n     approved by FDA for nicotine-replacement therapy would then \n     remain on the market.\n\n  Documentation like this makes Dr. Kessler's interest in the narrow \nissue of teen smoking suspect to say the least. In fact, his public \nstatements and testimony in 1994 are full of references to FDA \nregulations, but never in the limited context of youth smoking. I don't \nthink I am alone in fearing that the sympathetic issue of youth smoking \nhas become a convenient vehicle for darker ulterior motives.\n  A legislative solution is clearly needed to prevent Dr. Kessler from \npromoting his agenda under the guise of youth smoking. But that \nlegislative solution will come only if all the players are sitting at \nthe table ready to negotiate. It has never worked any other way with \ntobacco.\n  Congressman Baesler and I have had legislation out there for a full \nyear. What it represents is a good starting point for protecting \ntobacco farmers' interests instead of leaving the decision to some \ncourt that we have no control over. But, while we've got Members \nwilling to protect NASCAR and rodeos with legislation, we've found \nlittle support from other tobacco State Members to try and help our \nfarmers. Congressman Bliley has gone so far as to say this is a \nquestion for the courts, not Congress.\n  Think about it. This year two of the largest tobacco companies have \ncome out with even tougher proposals than mine in an effort to have a \nlegislative solution that keeps FDA out of the business of regulating \ntobacco. Some will dismiss the tobacco company's action as public \nrelations. I call it being reasonable.\n  They too, have found little support. This should be a team effort but \ninstead has turned into partisan conflict that has wasted an entire \nyear and weakened our overall strength in the fight to save the youth \nfrom smoking and to protect our farmers.\n\n  Mr. President, I introduced my legislation because I am fiercely \nopposed to Government interference in the legal decision of adults in \nthis country. I introduced this legislation because I believe someone \nneeds to truly look out for the tobacco farmers' interests. I \nintroduced this legislation because I believe the problem of teen \nsmoking calls for reason, not rhetoric.\n  Over and over again, I have sat down at the table and tried to come \nup with solutions for my farmers. For this past year I sat at the table \nalone because others would rather play politics. I believe the decision \nto stay away will have long-term implications for the future of tobacco \nfarming and for the well-being of the industry as a whole.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Kessler was able to introduce his regulations \nbecause he said cigarettes were a device. Now he has made the thumb and \ntwo fingers a device because he says smokeless is included in that. So \nif you dip and get some tobacco, then your thumb and two fingers become \na device--a device. So, cigarettes are a device, your thumb and index \nfingers are a device.\n  Something about this is wrong, Mr. President. After the November \nelection is over, I am sure it will get out of the political arena as \nsome try to bilk the tobacco companies for all the campaign funds they \ncan get and they try to bilk the poor tobacco farmer out of a vote. \nOnce November 5 is past, maybe we will be able to find someone willing \nto sit down at the table.\n  I was chastised in a letter I received yesterday for being in the \nposition I am in. They say that--taking their numbers--3,000 young \nfolks start smoking every day; that is over 1 million a year. With the \nlitigation of these regulations being in the courts 3 to 5 years, say 5 \nyears, they themselves have allowed over 6 million young people to \nstart smoking, instead of sitting down trying to work out something \nreasonable that can stop it.\n  Now, you say you are trying to protect the farmer. I am, but I voted \nfor every piece of legislation that has come through here to help \nprevent youth smoking, from labeling to smoke-free schools. I voted for \nSAMSHA, which is imposed upon the States. Where are those who want to \ndo something for youth? All they want to do is run ads in the \nnewspapers against my colleagues. They want to write big stories and \nhave a lot of money in their till so they can get out there and beat \ntheir chest about how wonderful a job they are doing, while they are \nletting youths go down the tubes and the tobacco farmer go down the \ntubes.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, those affected by this issue, \ncome reason together. Reason together so we can return to our farm \nfamilies not only a sense of security and stability but a sense of \ndignity about the work they do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11128-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11129-S11130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMUNITY SERVICE MAKES A DIFFERENCE\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today regarding a \nrecent collaboration between AmeriCorps\n\n[[Page S11130]]\n\nand Habitat for Humanity. Everyday on television and in newspapers we \nare reminded in some way of the problems of our Nation's distressed \nurban areas. I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to one \nexample of how community service is making a real difference in the \narea of affordable housing for hard-working families in cities across \nthe country. On June 22, 1996, Habitat for Humanity sponsored the Home \nStretch Build. Several hundred community volunteers and 75 Habitat \nAmeriCorps members from Americus and Savannah, GA; Miami, FL; \nCleveland, OH and the District of Columbia built nine new homes in \nSoutheast Washington, DC. That day Habitat for Humanity founder and \npresident, Millard Fuller, said the following about the AmeriCorps \nProgram:\n\n       There are a bunch of good folks out here today, doing \n     something very, very worthwhile. I'm particularly pleased \n     with the AmeriCorps people here, over 75 of them, and I want \n     to salute you . . . for the outstanding work that you do. \n     This army of peaceful people, who are making good news happen \n     all over this Nation. Twenty-five thousand of them. And I \n     want you to know that we at Habitat for Humanity feel \n     privileged and honored to have the AmeriCorps people with us, \n     and we want more of them as time goes on. We love to be \n     partners with you in this work, and I salute all the \n     AmeriCorps people.\n\n  Mr. President, this is another in the long list of examples of \nnational service participants reaping the threefold benefit of national \nservice--benefit to the community where the service is performed, \nbenefit to the servers for serving their communities, and the benefit \nderived from the education of the servers in the future. I applaud the \nNational Service Corporation for its ongoing efforts, and urge my \ncolleagues to take note of the successes of these young people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11129-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, traumatic brain injury is a silent epidemic \nwhich afflicts one person in the United States every 15 seconds. Nearly \n250,000 Americans suffer severe head injuries; and brain injury is the \nNo. 1 killer of young Americans under the age of 40. More than 20 \nmillion Americans are affected one way or another by brain injury, with \nan estimated 60,000 deaths expected this year alone.\n  The Brain Injury Association, Inc., chaired by Martin B. Foil, Jr., \nof Concord, NC, was instrumental in the passage of the Traumatic Brain \nInjury Act which was signed into law on July 29, 1996. Mr. Foil, and \nhis wife, ``Puddin,'' have worked tirelessly over the past 5 years to \nhelp pass this important legislation. The Foils' son, Philip, was \ninjured in a car accident and suffered serious brain injury. The Foils \nturned that personal tragedy into a triumph for others. The Traumatic \nBrain Injury Act has focused a national spotlight on brain injury as a \nmajor health problem, and provides research grants for the prevention, \ntreatment, and rehabilitation of brain injury.\n  Mr. President, brain injury in the United States costs an estimated \n$48.6 billion annually. Most of this expense is paid for by taxpayers \nthrough Medicare and Medicaid. It is hoped--and that is what the \nTraumatic Brain Injury Act is all about, providing hope--it is hoped \nthat funds from the Traumatic Brain Injury Act will lead to innovative \ntreatments which will help victims and their families better deal with \nthis devastating injury.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Charlotte (NC) Observer \narticle regarding the Foil family dated August 4, 1996, be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Charlotte Observer, Aug. 4, 1996]\n\n Concord Teen's Brain Injury Led Parents To Fight For More Prevention \n                              and Research\n\n                             (By John Monk)\n\n       Between the grim aftermath of the crash of TWA Flight 800 \n     and the attention riveted on Atlanta's Olympics, it passed \n     almost unnoticed. But Martin Foil, wife ``Puddin'' and son \n     Philip of Concord pulled off their own Olympian feat last \n     week.\n       President Clinton invited the family to the White House as \n     he signed a bill aimed at preventing and researching \n     traumatic brain injuries. For the Foils, the signing in the \n     Oval Office culminated two long struggles: their 12-year-old \n     battle with a brutal accident that left their son disabled, \n     and their fight to find treatment for similar injuries.\n       ``We've been working on this 5 years,'' said Foil, 63, CEO \n     of Tuscarora Yarns, Inc. in Mount Pleasant, NC, and chairman \n     of the Washington-based Brain Injury Association.\n       The bill authorizes $15 million in research grants for the \n     prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of brain injuries. \n     It allots an additional $9 million for the Centers for \n     Disease Control to monitor brain injuries.\n       The Foils' struggle began more than a decade ago.\n       In December 1984, Philip Foil was driving home from Concord \n     High School. At 16, he was a bright, well-liked student who \n     tutored colleagues in algebra and wanted to be a doctor. A \n     car crossed a center line and slammed into Philip's car. In \n     an instant Philip suffered severe head injuries. For 114 \n     days, he lay in a coma. He woke to a life where, because his \n     brain can't signal his body, he would need rehabilitation and \n     care the rest of his life.\n       The Foils discovered that many people with traumatic brain \n     injuries fall through the cracks of the nation's medical \n     system. Brain injuries are not always formally recognized. \n     Families who must care for the victims undergo enormous \n     stress.\n       ``Many people have been denied benefits from government \n     programs, from insurance companies, as a result,'' said Dr. \n     George Zitnay, president of the Brain Injury Association.\n       In the first years following Philip's accident, the Foils \n     concerned themselves with his rehabilitation. He has made \n     enormous progress, now able to walk with assistance and talk \n     with the help of a vocalizing machine.\n       These days, there are tens of thousands of people like \n     Philip. Modern medical treatment means many more people than \n     ever survive brain injuries. No one has exact statistics on \n     the number of brain-injured people. But the association \n     estimates that up to 56,000 Americans die and more than \n     300,000 are hospitalized each year. Of the hospitalized, \n     nearly 100,000 will sustain lifelong disabling conditions \n     from sports, gunshot, and traffic accidents.\n       Most people who survive brain injuries are likely to live \n     out their normal life span in a handicapped condition, and \n     the cost is prohibitive.\n       ``The average cost for a debilitating brain injury is $6 \n     million or more,'' said Foil.\n       For years, Foil said, his grief over his son's injury kept \n     him from getting involved in efforts to help publicize brain \n     injuries. Gradually, he reached outward and contacted the \n     association.\n       In 1992, when Foil became chairman, he gave top priority to \n     passing legislation to research and prevent brain injuries.\n       Thousands of groups and lobbyists try each year to get \n     legislators to introduce bills, but only a small percentage \n     wind up as law.\n       Luck intervened.\n       Representative Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., was elected to the \n     U.S. House of Representatives in 1992. As a state senator, \n     Greenwood had won reforms for brain-injured victims.\n       Once in Washington, Greenwood was assigned to the House \n     Commerce Committee, where any brain-injury legislation would \n     originate. He became an expert in health care and won GOP \n     leadership backing for a bill involving about $8 million a \n     year for three years, a tiny sliver of the $1 trillion-a-year \n     Federal budget.\n       Meanwhile, Foil's group won allies in the Senate, including \n     Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan. In \n     July, Congress passed the bill that Clinton signed last week.\n       The Foils' battle is not over.\n       Their son, Philip, lives at home and will always need care. \n     His parents are thankful he's a vital part of the family.\n       Congress may take a second action. Clinton signed an \n     authorization bill--a law that allows money to be spent for a \n     specific purpose. Now, Congress must pass an appropriations \n     bill, which will actually permit the money to be spent.\n       ``We'll get the money,'' said Foil. ``Congress would be \n     ashamed not to give it to us.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11130-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11130-S11131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, it took many of us by surprise when the \njunior\n\n[[Page S11131]]\n\nSenator from Kansas, Nancy Landon Kassebaum, announced late last year \nthat she would not run for reelection this time. She and I arrived in \nthe Senate together after being elected in 1978, and it has been honor \nto serve here with her. Now, we will be leaving together when our terms \nexpire at the end of this Congress.\n  Senator Kassebaum is someone who is thoughtful and deliberative, and \nher colleagues truly listen to her. She also has a willful \ndetermination which not only commands but earns the respect of others. \nShe comes from a well-known political legacy as the daughter of the \n1936 Republican nominee for President Alf Landon, who lived to be 100 \nyears of age. She has consistently demonstrated shrewdness, \nintelligence, and prudence in her approach to the issues since she has \nbeen in office.\n  Senator Kassebaum is perhaps best known for her leadership as ranking \nmember and chair of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, working \nthere for bipartisan agreements on the many contentious issues which \nconfront that committee. She is also known for her role in foreign \naffairs, having worked for many years on the Subcommittee on African \nAffairs of the Foreign Relations Committee. She was a major force \nbehind the establishment of sanctions against South Africa and was key \nin deciding the conditions under which they should be eased before \napartheid finally ended. Her background in education and the humanities \nhas made her a strong leader on these issues as well.\n  The people of Kansas and the Nation have benefited greatly from the \nservice of Nancy Kassebaum in the U.S. Senate. She has led by example, \nand this body will be a decidedly lesser place after she leaves. I \ncommend her and wish her well as she moves on to a new phase of her \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11130-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO UYLESS WARDELL WHITE\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues a tribute written by Christopher Lee McCall to his uncle, \nthe late Uyless Wardell White, of my hometown, Tuscumbia, AL. The \nWhites are known as a pioneer family in northwest Alabama. They are \nwell-known in the Muscle Shoals area for Christian fellowship, civil \nresponsibility, excellence in education, and total family devotion.\n  This fitting tribute written by Christopher McCall to his uncle \ninvokes the memory of the love of Ruth for Naomi found in the Bible in \nthe First Chapter of the Book of Ruth, verses 16 and 17:\n\n       . . . entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from \n     following after thee: whither thou goest, I will go; and \n     where thou lodgest, I will lodge.

Mr. President, when I learned that Senator David Pryor \nwas not planning on seeking reelection this year, I realized that few \nMembers of this body have meant so much to the Nation while at the same \ntime serving the people of their State.\n  Back in 1951, at the age of 16, young David Pryor served as a page \nhere in the Senate. Looking back, he summed it up this way: ``It was \nthe first time I'd seen Washington, the first time I'd seen the \nCapitol, the first time I'd seen the Senate, and the first time I'd \nbeen in a taxicab.''\n  Times have changed since 1951. Most of the faces that David Pryor saw \nduring that initial visit are long gone. Some of the problems facing \nthe Nation have been solved. New ones have arisen. But, since his \nelection by the people of Arkansas in 1978, the same year I was first \nelected, Senator David Pryor has worked for this Nation's betterment. \nHe is perhaps best known for his excellent work on behalf of the \nNation's elderly citizens through the Senate Aging Committee, which he \nchaired for several years.\n  The State of Arkansas has benefitted immeasurably from his service. \nAlongside men like Senators J. William Fulbright and Dale Bumpers, \nSenator Pryor has been an outstanding standard bearer of the legacy and \ntradition of those who have served Arkansas in the Senate.\n  ``Smart as heck'' was how he described Senator Fulbright in 1951. It \nwill be no surprise to read similar comments written by those pages who \nhave encountered Senator Pryor during their service. He is also a true \ngentleman, and always treats others with respect and courtesy, traits \nthat are all-too-often missing in today's harsh political climate.\n  He is a man with deep ties to his State. He started his own newspaper \nin his home town after graduating from the University of Arkansas. He \nspent years as a country lawyer, serving everyone who walked in the \ndoor. In fact, as a lawyer, he participated in the famous coon case--an \nownership dispute over a dog in which the judge allowed the dog to \nchoose its own owner.\n  The Senate itself has benefitted from the efforts of David Pryor. He \nhas worked to maintain its dignity and unique style of debate and \npolicymaking. He has served in the Senate for nearly 18 years. We came \nhere together, and will leave together.\n  Senator Pryor has made many contributions to both his constituents \nand his colleagues. We will wish him well as he leaves to enter a new \nphase of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11131-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11131-S11132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JIM EXON\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, along with many of our colleagues, the \nsenior Senator from Nebraska has announced that he will retire at the \nend of this Congress. When Jim Exon leaves, the Senate will have lost \none of its most loyal and dedicated Members. The business of governing \noften comes down to being a team player. While he has not been \nreluctant to stand his ground when his conscience required him to do \nso, Jim Exon has also stuck by his team on the toughest votes that help \nto define our two parties.\n  Senator Exon has gained our deep respect because of the wisdom of the \nmeasures he has advocated. He wrote the law that prevents the foreign \ntakeover of American corporations which threatens our national \nsecurity. Also, he increased the penalty for drug sales near truck \nstops to make America's highways even safer. These are just two of the \nnumerous legislative initiatives Jim Exon accomplished during his \nsuccessful tenure in the Senate.\n  He has been quick to recognize and adapt to the dramatic global \nchanges which have occurred over the last 6 years. His foresight in \nadvocating the establishment of barter arrangements with the former \nSoviet Republics will become even more apparent as those nations become \nmore fully integrated into the world economy.\n  Senator Exon has not been afraid to stand by his beliefs. While we \nwere not always on the same sides of a given issue, there has never \nbeen a doubt in my mind that he based his decisions and votes on what \nhe believed to be in his State's and the country's best interest. He \nhas been an outstanding leader on defense and national security issues.\n  Senator Jim Exon has demonstrated in his 18 years in the Senate that \nhe is valuable both for his inclination to be a team player and his \nwillingness to stick to his position in the face of stiff\n\n[[Page S11132]]\n\nopposition. We were elected the same year, and will be leaving together \nwhen our terms expire early in 1997, and I wish him well. The people of \nNebraska have had a true friend in Senator Jim Exon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11131-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, 2 years ago, we in the Senate--and the \nNation--were saddened to hear that our colleague Paul Simon would not \nseek reelection this year. As a national figure who truly embodies \nintegrity, respectability, and character, Senator Simon will certainly \nbe missed here.\n  Paul Simon was one of the first politicians to disclose his personal \nfinances so that they would be open to scrutiny by the public. He has \nfirmly supported a balanced budget amendment in order to prevent the \nGovernment from continuing to spend itself into greater debt. He has \nbeen the Democratic standard bearer on the balanced budget amendment \nlegislation, and I am still hopeful that we see it become a reality \nbefore we both leave in early 1997. In the same vein, he has supported \na line-item veto for the President to allow the Chief Executive to trim \nfat from the budget. Senator Simon recognizes that the Founding Fathers \ndid not intend for the Government to operate in the red.\n  I think that Senator Simon's strong commitment to integrity in \nGovernment can be traced to his roots in the newspaper business. At the \nage of 19, he bought his own newspaper, the Troy Tribune. As its \npublisher, he crusaded against local gangsters who had subverted local \nlaw and order. His success in running his own newspaper no doubt \ninfluenced his belief in the ability of the Government to operate in a \nthrifty and effective manner while maintaining the same honesty that he \nhad shown in running his paper.\n  The business flourished, expanding to 14 papers. Then he decided to \nsell his interest so that he could devote himself full time to serving \nhis country through Government service. We will always remember the \ncandor, wit, and knowledge he brought to the 1988 Presidential race.\n  It has been my personal privilege and pleasure to have served on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee with him. He is not a lawyer, but his keen \ninsight into the legal issues that affect real people is enlightening \nand instructive. He is an outstanding member of that committee.\n  This body will be a decidedly lesser place without Paul Simon. We \ncongratulate him and will wish him well after he leaves.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nup to 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11132-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11132-S11133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IMMIGRATION EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in a few moments the House and Senate \nconference committee on the immigration bill will meet, and I believe \nwe will approve far-reaching reform on immigration by striking out the \nso-called Gallegly amendment, which allows the States to deny public \neducation to children who are not legally present in the United States.\n  The Gallegly amendment, Mr. President, is fundamentally unfair \nbecause it is directed at children. It is my view that the children \nought to have an opportunity for education for many reasons. One reason \nis that if they are to be self-supporting adults, if they are to have \nan acceptable quality of life and become good citizens or residents of \nthe United States of America, they need an education. Second, if they \nare not in school, they are going to be on the street, and there will \nbe problems of delinquency, there will be problems of juvenile crime.\n  The answer is not to exclude illegal alien children from having an \neducation, but instead to tighten up the restrictions on illegal \nimmigration and to protect our borders. The immigration bill which is \nnow pending in the House-Senate conference will be a significant step \nforward in reform, to reform the immigration laws, to protect U.S. \nborders, to provide for expeditious treatment of immigrants who are \nillegally in the United States, to deport those immigrants in \naccordance with our laws.\n  It is said that the education of illegal alien children is a magnet \nto draw illegal immigrants into the United States. The answer is not to \nexclude those children from education, but the answer is to protect \nAmerican borders so that the illegal immigrants do not gain access to \nthe United States, do not enter the United States, and that children \nare not here, posing a significant problem in terms of their conduct on \ndelinquency and crime and in terms of their conduct when they grow to \nadults, assuming they stay in the United States.\n  There have been those who say that it ought to be the financial \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to pay the cost of education, \nand I am in agreement with that principle, Mr. President. It has been a \nfailure of the Federal Government to protect U.S. borders. I think it \nis fair to respond that it ought to be the obligation of the Federal \nGovernment to pay to educate the illegal alien children that it has \nallowed to enter. However, the answer is not to deny those children \neducation while they are in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is very important to make sharp \ndistinctions as to how we treat children of illegal immigrants from how \nwe deal with the problem of illegal immigration generally. The way to \ndeal with the problem of illegal immigration is to protect our borders. \nIt is not to deny education to children once they are in the United \nStates. Neither is it sound, sensible, or fair to deny citizenship to \nchildren who are born in the United States to immigrants who have \nillegal status. The hallmark of America, the hallmark of the Statue of \nLiberty, and the hallmark of the melting pot is to respect the status \nof American citizenship of any child born in the United States.\n\n  That is a matter, Mr. President, that I feel particularly strong \nabout since both of my parents were immigrants. They both came to the \nUnited States legally; that is, to the best of my knowledge, \ninformation, and belief they came legally. My father came from Ukraine \nin 1911--literally walked across Europe, sailed at the bottom of the \nboat, in steerage, to come to America to find an opportunity for \nhimself and his children. Harry Specter, my father, didn't know that he \nhad a round-trip ticket when he came here--not back to Ukraine but to \nFrance, and not back to Paris and the Follies Bergere, but to the \nArgonne Forest, where he served in the American expedition forces to \nmake the world safe for democracy, with shrapnel in his legs until the \nday he died.\n  My mother came with her family as a child of 5 from a small town on \nthe Russian-Polish border, I believe with legal immigrant status, \nalthough I would be hard pressed to prove that my parents were legal \nimmigrants if someone were to challenge the status of Arlen Specter as \na citizen of the United States.\n  But when we deal with the problem of illegal immigration, or legal \nimmigration, we have to have a very, very sharp focus on what is \nappropriate public policy. The bill in its final form, in my judgment, \nis somewhat too harsh in taking away benefits from legal immigrants and \ndenying some benefits to other immigrants. But I think reform is \nnecessary, and the compromise that has been worked out is a reasonably \ngood compromise, and if we find problems, we can correct them at a \nlater date.\n  But I want to repeat that it is obnoxious, unfair, and un-American to \ndeny U.S. citizenship to anyone born in this county, no matter what \ntheir status. I am glad that the bill before us does not incorporate \nthis proposal.\n  The conference report has been held up for a very protracted period \nof time over the Gallegly amendment because there is so much sentiment \nin the Congress that we ought not to deny education to children \nregardless of their immigration status. There has been the threat of a \nveto from the White House. But I think it is highly unlikely that the \nconference report could pass the Senate with the Gallegly amendment in \nit.\n  There has been an effort by a variety of amendments to grandfather \nchildren so that once they are in school, they can complete the 6th \ngrade and elementary school or complete high school. There was an \namendment which\n\n[[Page S11133]]\n\nI had suggested, which I was not really fond of and didn't really think \nwas the ultimate solution but a stop-gap measure, to have a mandatory, \nexpedited vote in 2\\1/2\\ years, 30 months after implementation of the \nGallegly provision, to see the impact of the Gallegly provision on \ndelinquency, on education, and on family life, and then a second vote \nat the end of 5 years, 60 months. I felt that the Gallegly amendment \nwould, if presented in isolation, be rejected by the Congress, and that \nwe would not deny education to children in this country regardless of \nthe status of their parents. But I believe, after a lot of \ndeliberation, the issue has been resolved.\n  I am looking forward to the conference which will start in just a few \nminutes in which we will delete the Gallegly amendment so that the \nStates will not have the option to deny education to children \nregardless of their parents' status. We can bring this immigration \nreform bill to the floor, and we can pass it and, I think, have it \nsigned into law.\n  I thank the Chair. In the absence of any other Senator, Mr. \nPresident, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PEROT AND THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on the \ndecision to exclude Mr. Perot from the upcoming Presidential debates. I \nwant to make it clear from the outset that I support my President and I \nsupport my party, but I do believe that Mr. Perot ought to be included \nin these debates. After all, Mr. Perot and his party have now qualified \nto be on the ballot in all 50 States in this Nation. He has become \neligible for Federal funding. In fact, he will receive nearly $30 \nmillion in Federal funding, based on his previous performance. Last \nelection he received nearly 20 percent of the vote nationwide, and some \nexit polls indicate he would have done even better if people had not \nalready made the judgment that he could not win. In polling that has \nbeen done this year, 76 percent of the American people have indicated \nthey would like to see him included.\n  I think, for all of those reasons, Mr. Perot deserves to be included. \nBut I think there are other reasons as well. I think Mr. Perot has made \na significant contribution to the national debate and discussion over \ndeficit reduction. Frankly, if you go back to the 1992 debates and the \n1992 campaign, Mr. Perot can rightfully claim that he served as a prod \nto both parties to discuss deficit reduction. I believe that remains \none of the foremost challenges this country faces. Mr. Perot would help \nthe debate, in terms of a focus on deficit reduction.\n  Mr. Perot has also made a contribution in two other areas that have \nreceived very little attention during this Presidential campaign. \nFirst, with respect to the question of trade, he has a different view \nthan either the Republican challenger, Mr. Dole, or the incumbent \nPresident, President Clinton. This country deserves a debate and \ndiscussion on trade policy as part of this Presidential campaign.\n  Finally, I think Mr. Perot has also made a contribution with respect \nto the question of campaign finance reform. We have heard virtually \nnothing in this campaign about campaign finance reform.\n  I hope the Presidential commission will review their decision and \ndecide to include Mr. Perot. Again, I emphasize, I am not a Perot \nsupporter. I do not intend to vote for him for President of the United \nStates. I intend to support the President. I intend to support my \nparty. I think the President has an outstanding record in terms of \nactually delivering on deficit reduction.\n  I recall very well, when the President came in, in 1992, he inherited \na budget deficit of $290 billion. That has now been reduced, by the \nbest estimate for this year, to $116 billion, about a 60-percent \nreduction. In fact, the deficit has come down every year for 4 years in \na row.\n  Partly because of the Clinton economic plan that was passed in 1993--\nthat was a deficit reduction plan--I believe we have seen the \nresurgence of this economy. We have become the most competitive nation \nin the world, replacing Japan. Not only have we seen a dramatic \nreduction in the deficit, but we have seen a significant strengthening \nof economic growth. We have had the strongest private sector economic \ngrowth on this President's watch than on that of the last three \nPresidents. We have also seen the lowest misery index--the measure of \ninflation and unemployment--in 28 years. Business investment is \nincreasing at a rate that is the highest in 30 years. We have seen the \ncreation of more than 10 million new jobs during this President's term.\n  I think this President has an outstanding record to take before the \nAmerican people. But I think most of us also know that the job is not \nfinished. The job is not yet completed. More needs to be done. I do \nbelieve Mr. Perot would play a positive role in putting a focus on the \nadditional deficit reduction that needs to be made in this country.\n  As I have stated, I also believe he would make a positive \ncontribution to a debate on trade policy and with respect to \nthe question of campaign finance reform. I am sure the occupant of the \nchair may share these views. Or perhaps not.\n\n  I do think the commission's decision is fatally flawed. When they \nmake a determination that somebody not be included because they have no \nrealistic chance of winning, what are they going to do when one of the \ntwo major candidates has no realistic prospect of winning? We have had \nseveral Presidential campaigns where that was the case. Let's go back \nto the 1984 Presidential race with Ronald Reagan as the incumbent \nPresident. There was no realistic chance anybody was going to beat him. \nShould we have canceled the Presidential debates altogether?\n  This year we see the challenger 17 points behind. Nobody has ever \nmade up that kind of gap. Should the Presidential commission determine \nMr. Dole has no realistic chance of winning the election, and therefore \ncancel the debates? The logic used by the commission--that because \nsomebody does not have a realistic prospect of winning the election \nthey should be excluded from the debates--is a slippery slope.\n  We ought to include those who have met the tests that Mr. Perot has \nmet. I understand Mr. Perot is a controversial figure. His 1992 \nPresidential campaign--with his entrance into the race, his withdrawal, \nand his reentrance--raised many questions. But we are still left with \nsome basic facts.\n  First, he has qualified to be on the ballot in all 50 States. He has \ndone that. His party has qualified to be on the ballot in every State \nin the Nation.\n  Second, he has become eligible for Federal matching funds. The only \npeople who have managed to do that this year are Bill Clinton, Bob \nDole, and Ross Perot. Nobody else has qualified to get Federal matching \nfunds.\n  Third, he received nearly 20 percent of the national vote in the last \nelection. I think that merits inclusion in these debates. Finally, \nperhaps most important, the vast majority of the American people, \naccording to the polls, want him included. They want to hear a debate \nthat includes Mr. Perot. It does not mean they want to vote for him \nnecessarily, but they want to see him included in the debate.\n  As I have said before, I think he has demonstrated he has made a \npositive contribution on the issues of deficit reduction, trade, and \ncampaign finance reform.\n  So, I hope the Presidential commission will review their decision and \ndecide to include Mr. Perot without having a court have to review this \ndecision for them.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator's thoughtful \ncomments are well received, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I pay tribute today to Senator James Exon, \nwho is completing his third term in the Senate and has unfortunately, \ndecided to retire. His retirement caps a long and distinguished career \nof public service unique to his home State of Nebraska. Jim Exon and I \nhave served together on the Armed Services Committee, and I have \nadmired his strong support of our national defense. At the same time, \nas a conservative, and as ranking member on the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Senator Exon has had a practical, direct, moderate \ntemperament which has put him in tune with national sentiment on the \nneed to control spending. He has been a leader of efforts to balance \nthe budget, and that includes a need to reduce defense spending where \npossible, given the end of the cold war, and particularly in tempering \nthe tendency to throw too much money on expensive new hardware systems.\n  Jim Exon is against waste and he has put his legislative shoulders \nbehind that effort. He would agree with William Shakespeare, who wrote \nin King Henry V:\n\n     I can get no remedy\n     against this consumption of\n     the purse: borrowing only\n     lingers and lingers it out,\n     but the disease is incurable.\n\n  Jim Exon will be missed here. I shall miss his candid style, his no-\nnonsense temperament, and his refreshing directness, all of which are \nmixed with a down-home sense of humor. As a Senator, Jim Exon has \nalways retained a modest sense of himself, never succumbing to the \ninflation of ego, which is a constant temptation in a body so much in \nthe national limelight.\n  Senator Exon's success as a three-term Senator follows a string of \nother successes. After graduating from the University of Omaha in 1942, \nhe volunteered for the U.S. Army Signal Corps and served in the Pacific \ntheater in New Guinea, in the Philippines, and, finally, in Japan, and \nwas honorably discharged as a master sergeant in December of 1945. He \nreturned from the war to start a business career and developed a very \nsuccessful office equipment company.\n  At the same time, he followed in his family's political footsteps. \nHis grandfather served as a county judge in South Dakota, and Jim's \nearly grassroots experience came in campaigning for his grandfather \nthere. Jim started in politics by becoming a prominent leader of the \nNebraska Democratic Party, serving as State vice chairman and National \nCommitteeman.\n  Jim came to the Senate in 1978 after having served as the Governor of \nNebraska for two terms from 1970-1978, longer than any other person in \nthat State's history. The experience served him well. He was rewarded \nby the people of Nebraska when he achieved the unique accomplishment of \nhaving been elected directly to the United States Senate.\n  Jim Exon comes from the heartland of America and is an admirable \nreflection of the values, the solid citizenship, and the loyalty that \ncharacterize our heartland. He reflects the basic American values that \nhonor family, fiscal responsibility, and national security.\n  Last year in the context of landmark telecommunications reform \nlegislation, he was the author of a provision intending to protect \nchildren from computer pornography by making it illegal to send \nindecent material to a child or display it on computer screens where \nchildren can access it.\n  He has been, as well, a leader in protecting American businesses from \ntakeovers by foreign firms in the area of national security. Known as \nthe Exon-Florio law, passed in 1988, this act gave the President \nauthority to investigate and stop foreign takeovers of American \ncompanies in the case where the takeover would threaten U.S. national \nsecurity.\n  Jim Exon is rock solid. This year he and his wife, Patricia, will \nhave celebrated their 53rd wedding anniversary, which goes to show that \nyou can still stay married to your first wife a long, long time. He \nreturns to Nebraska to join his three children, Steve, Pam, and Candy, \nalong with his eight grandchildren, a very wealthy man he is indeed--\neight grandchildren.\n  In citing his reasons for retirement, Jim Exon laments recent trends \nin American politics, such as the ``vicious polarization of the \nelectorate,'' the erosion of the art of honest compromise as the \nessence of the Democratic process, and the negative attack ads \ndominating current political campaigns. As he departs, I hope that he \nwill be a continuing force against these trends and that he, at least, \nwill help inculcate in the new men and women who are entering politics \nin Nebraska the same values of fairness; good humor; practical, \nindependent sense--common sense--and honest achievement that have so \nclearly emphasized and characterized his own career.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor this morning to \npay tribute to my distinguished retiring colleague, David Pryor.\n  When I think about Congress suffering--and I use the term \n``suffering'' advisedly--the largest number of retirees in 100 years, I \nhave a tendency to wax eloquent about my own personal beliefs as to why \nthat is happening. There are 13 Senators who have chosen to leave \nvoluntarily this year. Among them are some of the very best.\n  I have confessed on occasion when I didn't think it would hurt me \npolitically to the fact that I am not a terribly effective legislator \nbecause I have a very difficult time compromising. I have strong \nbeliefs, and sometimes compromise is just out of the question for me. \nAnd, yet, we all know that 535 Members of the Congress cannot each have \nhis or her own way on every issue.\n  But the people who are retiring are essentially people who are very \ngood legislators because they understand the art of politics; the \nnecessity for compromise. And I call them ``bridge builders''--because \nthey don't let stand between them differences in philosophies and \npersonalities. As the U.S. Senate has become more ideological and more \nentrenched in hard core ideas, where name calling somehow or other has \nbecome the substitute for ideas, we need bridge builders.\n  David Pryor was born in Camden, Ouachita County, AR, in 1934 to very \ndevoted parents. All of David's life manifest in his personality and \ncharacter is the unexcelled upbringing he enjoyed.\n  He graduated from the University of Arkansas Law School in 1964 with \nan LLB degree, went home to his native Camden and established a \nnewspaper called the Ouachita Citizen that he operated for 4 years. \nDuring that period of time he was also elected to the Arkansas State \nlegislature, to the House of Representatives, for three terms--1960, \n1962, and 1964.\n  I remember--I guess it was 1966--when David was elected to the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. It was in 1968 that I met him for the first \ntime, and that was just one of those typical political handshakes. The \nDemocratic Party was having a forum in Little Rock. I had the itch to \nrun for Governor in 1968. Luckily for me I chose not to do it that \nyear. But David Pryor spoke at this meeting in Little Rock in 1968. And \nI was absolutely awe-stricken--he was good looking, articulate, and had \nsome very good ideas. And I thought how wonderful it must be to serve \nin the House of Representatives and be able to come here and say these \nthings for this giant crowd here this evening. And it only piqued my \ninterest in running for office that much more.\n  So besides my father, who actually encouraged me to go into politics \nwhen I was a child, David was my next inspiration because of that \nevening in Little Rock in 1968.\n  After losing a race for the Senate in 1972, he came back in 1974 and \nran for Governor and won handily, and served\n\n[[Page S11135]]\n\nour State for 4 years. That was two terms, then, 2-year terms. He \nserved our State admirably.\n  He became then, and has remained ever since, the most popular \npolitician in Arkansas by far. I said the other evening, and I have \nsaid it many times, it pains me to say that. The thing that makes it \nbearable is I know it is true. Everybody in our State, virtually \neverybody, loves David Pryor, as does virtually every Member of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  In all of the years that David has been in politics, and certainly \nall the years he has been in Congress, I have never heard anybody \naccuse him of having Potomac fever, and the reason he is easily the \nmost popular politician in Arkansas is because he has never lost that \ncommon touch of letting people know that he is concerned about them. He \nnever looks past you to see who is next in line. You get his undivided \nattention, no matter how crazy the idea might be. David Pryor has \nalways been a listener.\n  I read a book one time called, ``Lee, The Last Years.'' It is the \nstory of Robert E. Lee after the war, written by a man named Charles \nBracelen Flood. And the most poignant part of the book was a \ndescription of Lee after he surrendered to Grant at Appomattox. He then \ngot on his horse Traveler and, with a small entourage of Confederate \nofficers and men, started on roughly a 5-day trek from Appomattox \nCourthouse to Richmond, where a home had been prepared for him.\n  As they went through various southern villages and communities, huge \ncrowds lined the streets awaiting for hours the arrival of Lee and his \nentourage--rebel yells, unbelievable cheers, of people for this losing \nGeneral.\n  About the third day of this trek toward Richmond, Lee stopped at a \npoint where a battle had been fought and there were still rotting \ncorpses on the battlefield. He got off his horse and he waved his arm \ntoward the battlefield and he said, ``This could have been avoided.'' \nAnd the rest of what he said I paraphrase, but it was essentially this: \nAt the time when this Nation needed men of courage and vision and \nrestraint, we had politicians who saw that it was to their advantage to \nfoment the flames of war. And this is the result.\n  James Fallows has written a book called ``Breaking the News: How the \nMedia Undermines American Democracy.'' It is a very interesting and \nalmost unassailable hypothesis, in this book. But I can tell you, \ndemocracy always hangs by a thread. And here we have a man like David \nPryor, who has all the qualities that Robert E. Lee described, and \nmore: tenacious, determined on what he believes, intellect, the \ncharacter to stick with his ideas in a totally honest way, and vision \nabout where the country ought to be heading. These are remarkable \ntraits to be wrapped up in one man, and rare and unusual in the U.S. \nCongress. So, at a time when democracy perhaps hangs by a more slender \nthread than ever, losing a man like David Pryor, who possesses those \nqualities, is just short of disastrous for the country and certainly, \nto me, as a friend and colleague.\n  In the years I have served with David, almost 18 years, now, I have \nnever seen him duck a tough vote, though there have been plenty of \nopportunities. He has always been able and willing to take the heat in \norder to cast those votes.\n  When David came to the Senate he had been Governor 4 years, but we \nreally did not know each other. We knew each other politically, and we \nwould see each other at political events, and we were friends. But it \nwas only after he came to the Senate that we developed a friendship in \nthe truest meaning of the word. So, I have been close to him in a lot \nof his travail. I can tell you, I do not know of very many people who \nhave suffered in their personal life as much as David--really, terribly \ntraumatic things. Despite all of that, including the current trauma, I \nhave never seen him down. I have never seen him look for sympathy or \nindicate that he was looking for sympathy.\n  I remember when my wife, Betty--and I do not mind saying this now, \nbecause it was about 15 years ago--was diagnosed with cancer. It was a \ndicey situation. She was going to be operated on at Georgetown at 8:30 \nin the morning. I got there at 8, and David was already there. I guess \nthat morning was the sealing of this, what will now be a lifelong \nfriendship.\n  During his entire adult life since he graduated law school, he and \nBarbara have undergone these traumatic experiences together. She has \nbeen by his side. I have watched her. I have watched her strength. I \nhave watched her values sustain her and David both. And in all \nfairness, she has never been shy about expressing her thoughts and \nideas with her beloved husband, David.\n  Then, of course, it has been a love affair. I know that David never \nloved anybody else from the day he set eyes on Barbara Lunsford and \nthey have both been tremendous parents to three very fine sons--they \nare so proud of them, and justifiably.\n  While I am senior by 4 years to David Pryor in the U.S. Senate, he \nhas been my mentor, my consultant, and my best friend. I will miss him \nand I wish him Godspeed and good luck.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11134-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11135-S11136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I had the pleasure earlier today of \nlistening to the distinguished Senator from Connecticut talk about the \nFamily Leave Act. He talked in very laudatory terms of the many \npositive changes that it has brought about.\n  Mr. President, I also want to voice a positive response to the fact \nthat employers do provide family leave, a time to be with their family \nand loved ones at a time that is important, during medical emergencies. \nBut, Mr. President, I think it would be a shame to allow the subject to \npass without observing what the real issue was.\n  The real issue in the Family and Medical Leave Act was not that \npeople should have time with their families. Of course they should. \nMany employers provided that before the act was in place. Certainly I \nbelieve, within the possibilities of jobs--not all jobs have \nflexibility--but within the possibilities of the jobs involved, that \ncertainly should be the case in terms of company policy.\n  But, Mr. President, with all due respect to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut, he just doesn't get it. One of the tragedies, I \nthink, of our system as it developed is that our legislative bodies are \npopulated by people who have not had the experience of real work in the \nprivate sector. They have not had an opportunity to be involved in \nbusiness and understand what is involved when you have an essential \nfunction that has to be done and someone is not there.\n  Perhaps most of all, Mr. President, many, unfortunately, do not \nunderstand what they have done to our country in the last few years by \nflooding it, inundating it with regulations and rules and laws.\n  I think of it in terms of the company that I used to work for. When I \nwas corporate counsel, it was myself and a part-time assistant \nsecretary. Right now, that same function, with similar \nresponsibilities, is composed of four full-time attorneys, three legal \nassistants, and a backup division of more than 120 people. Do they do a \nbetter job than I did? Yes; I suspect they do.\n  But, Mr. President, what has happened is an explosion of regulation. \nThe problem is not whether or not people should have family medical \nleave. The problem is whether or not the Federal Government ought to \ndictate the minute details of how jobs are run in this country, how \nthings operate in this country.\n  The question is not whether or not we have an economy that is \nflexible and variable or whether or not we divert the resources of this \ncountry to micromanage things from the top; the question, with all due \nrespect to those who worked so hard on that piece of legislation, is \nnot whether or not you have family or medical leave. Of course you \nought to have it. The question is whether or not you have a Government, \na Federal Government, that sees its responsibility as one of \ncentralizing control of the Nation, one of mandating and dictating the \ndetails of how we live our daily lives.\n\n[[Page S11136]]\n\n  It may come as a surprise to some, but most Americans are pretty good \nat knowing what is good for them. They might even know better than \nthose of us in Washington who so often tell them what to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11135-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, the first point is that the Federal \nReserve Board apparently now has broken up its meeting today and \nannounced that there will be no change in the Federal funds rate--the \ninterest rate that the Federal Reserve sets that has a significant \nimpact on our economy, obviously.\n  I have been a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve Board. I would \nsay that, if they have decided not to increase interest rates today, I \ncommend them for that decision. I think it is the right decision.\n  The Federal funds rate is already one-half of 1 percent above where \nit ought to be historically, given the rate of inflation. There is no \njustification for an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve \nBoard. Inflation is under control--well under control--coming down 5 \nyears in a row. Last month there was a one-tenth of 1 percent increase \nin the Consumer Price Index, virtually no inflation. So there was no \nbasis for the Federal Reserve Board to consider an interest rate \nincrease.\n  Some have suggested the Fed would meet in secret today if they wanted \nto, go in the room, shut the door, and make the decision in secret, and \nit would in effect increase interest rates today in order to respond to \nwhat they consider to be the need in the marketplace. But the Fed \napparently decided not to do so. Again, I want to say that I think that \nis the right decision for this country, and for our economy because \nthey ought not fight a foe that does not exist with remedy that is \ninappropriate. That is what they would have done, if they had increased \ninterest rates today.\n  I found it interesting the other day that the Washington Post had a \nstory saying the FBI has been called out to find out who leaked \ninformation at the Fed about what the regional Fed bank presidents have \nrecommended with respect to interest rates. I would much sooner see the \nFBI called out to find out who withheld information from the American \npeople, and what they talk about is the incredible secrecy of this \ninstitution called the Federal Reserve Board. Would it not be nice if \neveryone could have all the information about how and when they make \ndecisions about monetary policy instead of calling the FBI out to find \nout who leaked information so the American people have some knowledge \nabout who was recommending what on interest rate policies?\n\n  Mr. President, thank you. That is therapy for me to get that off my \nchest this early after the Federal Reserve Board met and apparently \nmade the right decision. There is an old saying. ``Even the stopped \nclock is right twice a day.'' I will not compare the Fed to a stopped \nclock, but at least to say that the Fed is right on interest rates. \nThey did not change the rate. There was no justification in making a \nchange, and they should not have made a change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I think it is appropriate, as a result \nof the comments of the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from \nMissouri, to talk about another issue that deals with the issue of \nlife, an issue that will be before us in a very short few days. That is \nthe issue of partial-birth abortions.\n  I took to the floor on Friday afternoon when this place was pretty \nempty to talk about the issue of partial-birth abortions. I said at \nthat time that while the term ``partial-birth abortion'' is used, this \nis not a pro-life or pro-choice issue. This is not whether you are for \nor against abortion. This debate should be limited, must be limited to \nthe procedure that we are discussing, and that is the procedure called \npartial-birth abortions.\n  I said at that time that I thought we should have a good debate, that \nthe Senate, being the greatest deliberative body in the history of the \nworld, should live up to its moniker, that we should have a deliberate, \nthoughtful debate on facts. I felt if we did have such a debate here, \nif we had such a deliberate, thoughtful debate, that, in fact, people \nwho may have voted one way the last time, when presented with all the \nfacts, in reexamining all the information that has come to light since \nthe original vote in the Senate, might feel compelled to vote for this \nbill and override the President's veto.\n  I read an article today in the Washington Post that gave me some hope \nthat people who consider themselves to be pro-choice can take a good \nlook at the facts and change their mind on this procedure, this \ngruesome procedure. What gave me heart was an article published today \nin the Washington Post by Richard Cohen. Richard Cohen is a columnist \nwho proclaims himself to be, and has consistently been, pro-choice. He \nbelieves in the woman's right to choose--in fact, in this article so \nstates again.\n  Mr. Cohen, back in June of last year, wrote an article that condemned \nthe bill.\n  In fact, it says, ``In Defense of Late-Term Abortions,'' Tuesday, \nJune 20, 1995, the Washington Post.\n  He goes on to give his reasons why he believes that partial-birth \nabortions should continue to be legal in this country.\n  Fast forward to today an article by Richard Cohen: ``A New Look at \nLate-Term Abortion'':\n\n       A rigid refusal even to consider society's interest in the \n     matter endangers abortion rights.\n\n\n[[Page S11137]]\n\n\n  He writes this article from the perspective of someone who is a \ndefender of abortion rights, someone who still believes in a woman's \nright to choose, using his terms.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  A New Look at Late-Term Abortion--A Rigid Refusal Even to Consider \n       Society's Interest in the Matter Endangers Abortion Rights\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       Back in June, I interviewed a woman--a rabbi, as it \n     happens--who had one of those late-term abortions that \n     Congress would have outlawed last spring had not President \n     Clinton vetoed the bill. My reason for interviewing the rabbi \n     was patently obvious: Here was a mature, ethical and \n     religious woman who, because her fetus was deformed, \n     concluded in her 17th week that she had no choice other than \n     terminate her pregnancy. Who was the government to second-\n     guess her?\n       Now, though, I must second-guess my own column--although \n     not the rabbi and not her husband (also a rabbi). Her \n     abortion back in 1984 seemed justifiable to me last June, and \n     it does to me now. But back then I also was led to believe \n     that these late-term abortions were extremely rare and \n     performed only when the life of the mother was in danger or \n     the fetus irreparably deformed. I was wrong.\n       I didn't know it at the time, of course, and maybe the \n     people who supplied my data--the usual pro-choice groups--\n     were giving me what they thought was precise information. And \n     precise I was. I wrote the ``just four one-hundredths of one \n     percent of abortions are performed after 24 weeks'' and that \n     ``most, if not all, are performed because the fetus is found \n     to be severely damaged or because the life of the mother is \n     clearly in danger.''\n       It turns out, though, that no one really knows what \n     percentage of abortions are late-term. No one keep figures. \n     But my Washington Post colleague David Brown looked behind \n     the purported figures and the purported rationale for these \n     abortions and found something other than medical crises of \n     one sort or another. After interviewing doctors who performed \n     late-term abortions and surveying the literature, Brown--a \n     physician himself--wrote: ``These doctors say that while a \n     significant number of their patients have late abortions for \n     medical reasons, many others--perhaps the majority--do not.''\n       Brown's findings brought me up short. If, in fact, most \n     women seeking late-term abortions have just come to grips a \n     bit late with their pregnancy, then the word ``choice'' has \n     been stretched past a reasonable point. I realize that many \n     of these women are dazed teenagers or rape victims and that \n     their anguish is real and their decision probably not \n     capricious. But I know, too, that the fetus being destroyed \n     fits my personal definition of life. A 3-inch embryo (under \n     12 weeks) is one thing; but a nearly fully formed infant is \n     something else.\n       It's true, of course, that many opponents of what are often \n     called ``partial-birth abortions'' are opposed to any \n     abortions whatever. And it also is true that many of them \n     hope to use popular repugnance over late-term abortions as a \n     foot in the door. First these, then others and then still \n     others. This is the argument made by pro-choice groups: Give \n     the antiabortion forces this one inch, and they'll take the \n     next mile.\n       It is instructive to look at two other issues: gun control \n     and welfare. The gun lobby also thinks that if it gives in \n     just a little, its enemies will have it by the throat. That \n     explains such public relations disasters as the fight to \n     retain assault rifles. It also explains why the National \n     Rifle Association has such an image problem. Sometimes it \n     seems just plain nuts.\n       Welfare is another area where the indefensible was defended \n     for so long that popular support for the program evaporated. \n     In the 1960s, '70s and even later, it was almost impossible \n     to get welfare advocates to concede that cheating was a \n     problem and that welfare just might be financing generation \n     after generation of households where no one works. This year, \n     the program on the federal level was trashed. It had few \n     defenders.\n       This must not happen with abortion. A woman really ought to \n     have the right to choose. But society has certain rights, \n     too, and one of them is to insist that late-term abortions--\n     what seems pretty close to infanticide--are severely \n     restricted, limited to women whose health is on the line or \n     who are carrying severely deformed fetuses. In the latter \n     stages of pregnancy, the word abortion does not quite \n     suffice; we are talking about the killing of the fetus--and, \n     too often, not for any urgent medical reason.\n       President Clinton, apparently as misinformed as I was about \n     late-term abortions, now ought to look at the new data. So \n     should the Senate, which has been expected to sustain the \n     president's veto. Late-term abortions once seemed to be the \n     choice of women who, really, had no other choice. The facts \n     now are different. If that's the case, then so should be the \n     law.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will not read the entire article, but \nit is in the Record, and I do not think what I do read, which is most \nof the article, takes away from the meaning.\n  He mentioned a case in his previous article in June of a woman who \nhad an abortion and used that sort of to justify late-term abortions \nand particularly the partial-birth abortion procedure. He revisits that \nin the beginning of the article and says he still agreed this woman who \ndid not have a partial-birth abortion but had a late-term abortion, was \nright to do so. But he said, ``What seemed justifiable to me last June, \ndoes not now.''\n  He said:\n\n       I was led to believe that these late-term abortions were \n     extremely rare and performed only when the life of the mother \n     was in danger or the fetus irreparably deformed.\n\n  You heard in the House of Representatives last week when they were \ndebating this issue and you will hear over and over again from the \nadvocates of partial-birth abortions that this is only done in extreme \nmedical emergencies when fetuses have no chance of survival outside of \nthe womb and that they are done very rarely.\n  Mr. Cohen says:\n\n       I was wrong. I didn't know at the time, of course, and \n     maybe the people who supplied my data, the usual pro-choice \n     groups * * * \n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from \nPennsylvania that the 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I ask my colleague, since \nI want to respond to some of what he said and I do not have that much \ntime and we are under a 5-minute rule, if he can complete in 2, and \nthen I can make my 5-minute remarks, because I cannot stay to hear the \nrest of my friend's remarks. So if he can complete in 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nCalifornia speak for 5 minutes, and I will just continue from there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I came to the floor today because I \nlistened to the Senator's presentation, and I think it is very \ninteresting. We have had a number of high-profile men comment on this \nparticular vote that is coming up, and my colleague from Pennsylvania \ngoes at length into the remarks of a columnist.\n  I think it is very important to listen to the women who were told \nthat if they didn't have this particular procedure that my colleague \nwants to outlaw they could die, they could be made permanently \ninfertile, they could be paralyzed for life, these women who have come \nto our offices to beg us to stay out of the emergency room, to stay out \nof the surgical room, to support the President's veto of this extreme \nbill.\n  Why do I call it extreme? I call it extreme because this bill would \nban the procedure, regardless of the circumstance. It has a narrow \nexception, and I have it here: ``* * * to save the life of a mother \nwhose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness or injury, \nprovided that no other medical procedure would suffice.''\n\n  This is the first time in history that the people who oppose abortion \nhave made such a narrow life exception. The Hyde amendment simply says \nwe can outlaw the procedure except ``to save the life of the mother'' \nif the pregnancy is carried to term.\n  This life exception is so narrow in this bill that a physician could \nonly use this life-saving procedure if the woman had a preexisting \ncondition such as diabetes, but not if he believed carrying the \npregnancy forward or a Caesarean section or other methods would, in \nfact, endanger her life.\n  If a physician does choose to use this procedure, even in the \nsituation of a preexisting condition of the woman, this physician could \nbe hauled into court and have to provide a defense for himself.\n  I say to my friends, if this debate was really about outlawing this \nprocedure, we could pass this bill in 1 minute. Every one of us who \nvoted for the amendment that I offered, which simply said make an \nexception for the health and life of the mother--and we did not even \nleave it open-ended; we said serious adverse health risk--we\n\n[[Page S11138]]\n\nwere willing to ban this procedure, every one of us who voted against \nthis bill, if it had a true life exception and if, in fact, it had a \nhealth exception tightly drawn so that if a woman was told, ``You may \nnot bear another child again unless you have this procedure,'' or ``You \nmay be paralyzed for life unless you have this procedure,'' or, ``You \ncould even die if that procedure goes forward in those cases,'' we \nwould all vote together.\n  If the people who stand up here and quote columnists would come \ntogether with us, we could craft a bill in a minute that would, in \nfact, outlaw this procedure, except if the woman's life was threatened \nif the pregnancy was carried to term or she had severe health \nconsequences facing her family. We could pass that 100 to nothing. But \nwe don't have that before us today, because those on the other side \nwould rather have a political hot-potato issue again.\n  It is sad. We can outlaw this procedure today with an exception for \nlife of the mother or serious health impacts, but, no, better to make \nthe President have to explain it. And let me tell you, he is explaining \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated \nSeptember 23 that he has sent to us.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing to urge that you vote to \n     uphold my veto of H.R. 1833, a bill banning so-called \n     partial-birth abortions. My views on this legislation have \n     been widely misrepresented, so I would like to take a moment \n     to state my position clearly.\n       First, I am against late-term abortions and have long \n     opposed them, except, as the Supreme Court requires, where \n     necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. As \n     Governor or Arkansas, I signed into law a bill that barred \n     third trimester abortions, with an appropriate exception for \n     life or health. I would sign a bill to do the same thing at \n     the federal level if it were presented to me.\n       The procedure aimed at in H.R. 1833 poses a difficult and \n     disturbing issue. Initially, I anticipated that I would \n     support the bill. But after I studied the matter and learned \n     more about it, I came to believe that it should be permitted \n     as a last resort when doctors judge it necessary to save a \n     woman's life or to avert serious consequences to her health.\n       In April, I was joined in the White House by five women who \n     were devastated to learn that their babies had fatal \n     conditions. These women wanted anything other than an \n     abortion, but were advised by their doctors that this \n     procedure was their best chance to avert the risk of death or \n     grave harm, including, in some cases, an inability to bear \n     children. These women gave moving testimony. For them, this \n     was not about choice. Their babies were certain to perish \n     before, during or shortly after birth. The only question was \n     how much grave damage the women were going to suffer. One of \n     them described the serious risks to her health that she \n     faced, including the possibility of hemorrhaging, a ruptured \n     cervix and loss of her ability to bear children in the \n     future. She talked of her predicament:\n       ``Our little boy had . . . hydrocephaly. All the doctors \n     told us there was no hope. We asked about in utero surgery, \n     about shunts to remove the fluid, but there was absolutely \n     nothing we could do. I cannot express the pain we still feel. \n     This was our precious little baby, and he was being taken \n     from us before we even had him. This was not our choice, for \n     not only was our son going to die, but the complications of \n     the pregnancy put my health in danger, as well.''\n       Some have raised the question whether this procedure is \n     ever most appropriate as a matter of medical practice. The \n     best answer comes from the medical community, which believes \n     that, in those rare cases where a woman's serious health \n     interests are at stake, the decision of whether to use the \n     procedure should be left to the best exercise of their \n     medical judgment.\n       The problem with H.R. 1833 is that it provides an exception \n     to the ban on this procedure only when a doctor is convinced \n     that a woman's life is at risk, but not when the doctor \n     believes she faces real, grave risks to her health.\n       Let me be clear. I do not contend that this procedure, \n     today, is always used in circumstances that meet my standard. \n     The procedure may well be used in situations where a woman's \n     serious health interests are not at risk. But I do not \n     support such uses, I do not defend them, and I would sign \n     appropriate legislation banning them.\n       At the same time, I cannot and will not accept a ban on \n     this procedure in those cases where it represents the best \n     hope for a woman to avoid serious risks to her health.\n       I also understand that many who support this bill believe \n     that a health exception could be stretched to cover almost \n     anything, such as emotional stress, financial hardship or \n     inconvenience. That is not the kind of exception I support. I \n     support an exception that takes effect only where a woman \n     faces real, serious risks to her health. Some have cited \n     cases where fraudulent health reasons are relied upon as an \n     excuse--excuses I could never condone. But people of good \n     faith must recognize that there are also cases where the \n     health risks facing a woman are deadly serious and real. It \n     is in those cases that I believe an exception to the general \n     ban on the procedure should be allowed.\n       Further, I reject the view of those who say it is \n     impossible to draft a bill imposing real, stringent limits on \n     the use of this procedure--a bill making crystal clear that \n     the procedure may be used only in cases where a woman risks \n     death or serious damage to her health, and in no other case. \n     Working in a bipartisan manner, Congress could fashion such a \n     bill.\n       That is why I asked Congress, by letter dated February 28 \n     and in my veto message, to add a limited exemption for the \n     small number of compelling cases where use of the procedure \n     is necessary to avoid serious health consequences. As I have \n     said before, if Congress produced a bill with such an \n     exemption, I would sign it.\n       In short, I do not support the use of this procedure on \n     demand or on the strength of mild or fraudulent health \n     complaints. But I do believe that it is wrong to abandon \n     women, like the women I spoke with, whose doctors advise them \n     that they need the procedure to avoid serious injury. That, \n     in my judgment, would be the true inhumanity. Accordingly, I \n     urge that you vote to uphold my veto of H.R. 1833.\n       I continue to hope that a solution can be reached on this \n     painful issue. But enacting H.R. 1833 would not be that \n     solution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in this letter, the President says that he \nwould sign such a bill that outlawed this procedure with those humane \nexceptions.\n  So, Mr. President, as we approach this vote, I am going to be on this \nfloor as often as I can, and I hope others will, to make the offer to \nmy friends on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from California \nthat the 5 minutes under morning business have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let's ban this procedure except for life \nof the mother or serious health impact.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  (Disturbance in the galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the galleries that applause \nis not appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as I was saying, quoting Mr. Cohen:\n\n       I didn't know at the time--\n\n  Mr. Cohen, who, again, previously wrote that he was in favor of \nallowing this procedure to be legal, says:\n\n       I didn't know at the time, of course, and maybe the people \n     who supplied my data--the usual pro-choice groups--were \n     giving me what they thought was precise information. And \n     precise I was. I wrote that ``just four one-hundredths of one \n     percent of abortions are performed after 24 weeks'' and that \n     ``most, if not all, are performed because the fetus is found \n     to be severely damaged or because the life of the mother is \n     clearly in danger.''\n       It turns out, though, that no one really knows what \n     percentage of abortions are late-term. No one keeps figures. \n     But my Washington Post colleague David Brown looked behind \n     the purported figures and the purported rationale for these \n     abortions and found something other than medical crises of \n     one sort or another. After interviewing doctors who performed \n     late-term abortions and surveying the literature, Brown--a \n     physician himself--wrote: ``These doctors say that while a \n     significant number of their patients have late-term abortions \n     for medical reasons, many others--perhaps the majority--do \n     not.\n       Brown's findings brought me up short. If, in fact, most \n     women seeking late-term abortions have just come to grips a \n     little bit late with their pregnancy, then the word \n     ``choice'' has been stretched past a reasonable point. I \n     realize that many of these women are dazed teenagers or rape \n     victims and that their anguish is real and their decision \n     probably not capricious. But I know, too, that the fetus \n     being destroyed fits my personal definition of life. A 3-inch \n     embryo (under 12 weeks) is one thing; but a nearly fully \n     formed infant is something else.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       A woman really ought to have the right to choose. But \n     society has certain rights, too, and one of them is to insist \n     that late-term abortions--[which] seems pretty close to \n     infanticide--are severely restricted, limited to women whose \n     health is on the line or who are carrying severely deformed \n     fetuses. In the latter stages of pregnancy, the word abortion \n     does not quite suffice; we are talking about the killing of \n     the fetus--and, too often, not for any urgent medical reason.\n       President Clinton, apparently as misinformed as I was about \n     late-term abortions,\n\n[[Page S11139]]\n\n     now ought to look at the new data. So should the Senate, \n     which has been expected to sustain the president's veto. \n     Late-term abortions once seemed to be the choice of women \n     who, really, had no other choice. The facts now are \n     different. If that's the case, then so should be the law.\n\n  Mr. President, what Mr. Cohen talks about is the fact that late-term \nabortions are not as rare as some would suggest, and that partial-birth \nabortions are not as rare.\n  The Senator from California said that we should not get involved in \nthe emergency room. The Senator from California knows that the partial-\nbirth abortion procedure is not an emergency procedure. It is a 3-day \nprocedure. It takes 3 days from the time the woman presents herself to \nthe abortionist to the time that the abortion is completed. So it can \nnever be used in an emergency.\n  She also said, well, if we only had an exception for the health of \nthe mother. The Senator from California, who debates this issue on the \nfloor a lot, knows fully well, that health of the mother has been \ninterpreted by courts over and over and over again to include virtually \neverything. When I say that, what do I mean? Yes, it includes physical \nhealth, but it includes mental health, financial health, social health, \nany kind of health impact. That is a limitation without limit.\n  There is no limitation when we put in there health of the mother. And \nthat is exactly what she wants to accomplish. That is exactly what she \nwants to accomplish. She does not want to limit this procedure, or any \nother abortion procedure, at any time during the pregnancy for any \nreason. I respect her opinion. I just do not agree with it. I do not \nthink the Members of the Senate agree with that. There is new evidence \nout. I hope that my colleagues--and the Senator from California made it \nsound like this was a pro-life/pro-choice issue. I can give her a \nlaundry list. She knows them well, and that many people who are pro-\nchoice here in the Senate and in the House voted for this bill to \noutlaw this procedure.\n  Why? Because this crosses the line. This goes too far. You have a \nperson here who, in very strong terms in this article, talks about how \nadamantly pro-choice he is; and he in fact writes the reason we should \ndraw the line here is because if you do not draw the line, you endanger \na woman's right to choose generally because of the extremism of this \nposition.\n  I do not think the Senate should go down in history as that body that \nallowed infanticide to continue, as so described, not only by Mr. \nCohen, but by the former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop and the Pope, \nand many others. Senator Moynihan, others--Senator Moynihan, I say to \nSenator Boxer, is not adamantly pro-life by any stretch of the \nimagination, and has said this looks perilously close to infanticide.\n  How often does this procedure take place? Again, let us look at all \nthe information that we have gathered since the original vote in the \nSenate. This is The Sunday Record in Bergen County, NJ, September 15, \n1996, just a few days ago, an article, ``The facts on partial-birth \nabortion.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n the Facts on Partial-Birth Abortion--Both Sides Have Misled the Public\n\n                           (By Ruth Pabawer)\n\n       Even by the highly emotional standards of the abortion \n     debate, the rhetoric on so-called ``partial-birth'' abortions \n     has been exceptionally intense. But while indignation has \n     been abundant, facts have not.\n       Pro-choice activists categorically insist that only 500 of \n     the 1.5 million abortions performed each year, in this \n     country involve the partial-birth method, in which a live \n     fetus is pulled partway into the birth canal before it is \n     aborted. They also contend that the procedure is reserved for \n     pregnancies gone tragically awry, when the mother's life or \n     health is endangered, or when the fetus is so defective that \n     it won't survive after birth anyway.\n       The pro-choice claim has been passed on without question in \n     several leading newspapers and by prominent commentators and \n     politicians, including President Clinton.\n       But interviews with physicians who use the method reveal \n     that in New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 partial-birth \n     abortions are performed each year--three times the supposed \n     national rate. Moreover, doctors say only a ``minuscule \n     amount'' are for medical reasons.\n       Within two weeks, Congress is expected to decide whether to \n     criminalize the procedure. The vote must override Clinton's \n     recent veto. In anticipation of that showdown, lobbyists from \n     both camps have orchestrated aggressive campaigns long on \n     rhetoric and short on accuracy.\n       For their part, abortion foes have implied that the method \n     is often used on healthy, full-term fetuses, an almost-born \n     baby delivered whole. In the three years since they began \n     their campaign against the procedure, they have distributed \n     more than 9 million brochures graphically describing how \n     doctors ``deliver'' the fetus except for its head, then \n     puncture the back of the neck and aspirate brain tissue until \n     the skull collapses and slips through the cervix--an image \n     that prompted even pro-choice Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-\n     N.Y., to call it ``just too close to infanticide.''\n       But the vast majority of partial-birth abortions are not \n     performed on almost-born babies. They occur in the middle of \n     the second trimester, when the fetus is too young to survive \n     outside the womb.\n       The reason for the fervor over partial birth is plain: The \n     bill marks the first time the House has ever voted to \n     criminalize the abortion procedure since the landmark Roe v. \n     Wade ruling. Both sides know an override could open the door \n     to more severe abortion restrictions, a thought that comforts \n     one side and horrifies the other.\n\n\n                          how often it's done\n\n       No one keeps statistics on how many partial-birth abortions \n     are done, but pro-choice advocates have argued that intact \n     ``dilation and evacuation''--a common name for the method, \n     for which no standard medical term exists--is very rare, ``an \n     obstetrical non-entity,'' as one put it. And indeed, less \n     than 1.5 percent of abortions occur after 20 weeks gestation, \n     the earliest point at which this method can be used, \n     according to estimates by the Alan Guttmacher Institute of \n     New York, a respected source of data on reproductive health.\n       The National Abortion Federation, the professional \n     association of abortion providers and the source of data and \n     case histories for this pro-choice fight, estimates that the \n     number of intact cases in the second and third trimesters is \n     about 500 nationwide. The National Abortion and Reproductive \n     Rights Action League says ``450 to 800'' are done annually.\n       But those estimates are belied by reports from abortion \n     providers who use the method. Doctors at Metropolitan Medical \n     in Englewood estimate that their clinic alone performs 3,000 \n     abortions a year on fetuses between 20 and 24 weeks, of which \n     at least half are by intact dilation and evacuation. They are \n     the only physicians in the state authorized to perform \n     abortions that late, according to the state Board of Medical \n     Examiners, which governs physicians' practice.\n       The physicians' estimate jibe with state figures from the \n     federal Centers for Disease Control, which collects data on \n     the number of abortions performed.\n       ``I always try an intact D first,'' said a Metropolitan \n     Medical gynecologist, who, like every other provider \n     interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity \n     for fear of retribution. If the fetus isn't breech, or if \n     the cervix isn't dilated enough, providers switch to \n     traditional, or ``classic,'' D utero dismemberment.\n       Another metropolitan area doctor who works outside New \n     Jersey said he does about 250 post-20-week abortions a year, \n     of which half are by intact D The doctor, who is also a \n     professor at two prestigious teaching hospitals, said he has \n     been teaching intact D since 1981, and he said he knows of \n     two former students on Long Island and two in New York City \n     who use the procedure. ``I do an intact D whenever I can, \n     because it's far safer,'' he said.\n       The National Abortion Federation said 40 of its 300 member \n     clinics perform abortions as late as 26 weeks, and although \n     no one knows how many of them rely on intact D, the number \n     performed nationwide is clearly more than the 500 estimated \n     by pro-choice groups like the federation.\n       The federation's executive director, Vicki Saporta, said \n     the group drew its 500-abortion estimate from the two doctors \n     best known for using intact D, Dr. Martin Haskell in Ohio, \n     who Saporta said does about 125 a year, and Dr. James McMahon \n     in California, who did about 375 annually and has since died. \n     Saporta said the federation has heard of more and more \n     doctors using intact D, but never revised its estimate, \n     figuring those doctors just picked up the slack following \n     McMahon's death.\n       ``We've made umpteen phone calls [to find intact D \n     practioners],'' said Saporta, who said she was surprised by \n     The Record's findings. ``We've been looking for spokespeople \n     on this issue. . . . People do not want to come forward [to \n     us] because they're concerned they'll become targets of \n     violence and harassment.''\n\n\n                             When it's done\n\n       The pro-choice camp is not the only one promulgating \n     misleading information. A key component of The National Right \n     to Life Committee's campaign against the procedure is a \n     widely distributed illustration of a well-formed fetus being \n     aborted by the partial-birth method. The committee's \n     literature calls the aborted fetuses ``babies'' and asserts \n     that the partial-birth method has ``often been performed'' in \n     the third trimester.\n       The National Right to Life Committee and the National \n     Conference of Catholic Bishops\n\n[[Page S11140]]\n\n     have highlighted cases in which the procedure has been \n     performed well into the third trimester, and overlaid that on \n     instances in which women have had less-than-compelling \n     reasons for abortion. In a full-page ad in the Washington \n     Post in March, the bishops' conference illustrated the \n     procedure and said, women would use it for reasons as \n     frivolous ad ``hates being fat,'' ``can't afford a baby and a \n     new car,'' and ``won't fit in to prom dress.''\n       ``We were very concerned that if partial-birth abortion \n     were allowed to continue, you could kill not just an unborn, \n     but a mostly born. And that's not far from legitimizing \n     actual infanticide,'' said Helen Alvare, the bishops' \n     spokeswoman.\n       Forty-one states restrict third-trimester abortions, and \n     even states that don't--such as New Jersey--may have no \n     physicians or hospitals willing to do them for any reason. \n     Metropolitan Medical's staff won't do abortions after 24 \n     weeks of gestation. ``The nurses would stage a war,'' said a \n     provider there. ``The law is one thing. Real life is \n     something else.''\n       In reality, only about 600--or 0.04 percent--of abortions \n     of any type are performed after 26 weeks, according to the \n     latest figures from Guttmacher. Physicians who use the \n     procedures say the vast majority are done in the second \n     trimester, prior to fetal viability, generally thought to be \n     24 weeks. Full term is 40 weeks.\n       Right to Life legislative director Douglas Johnson denied \n     that his group had focused on third-trimester abortions, \n     adding, ``Even if our drawings did show a more developed \n     baby, that would be defensible because 30-week fetuses have \n     been aborted frequently by this method, and many of those \n     were not flawed, even by an expansive definition.\n\n\n                             WHY IT'S DONE\n\n       Abortion rights advocates have consistently argued that \n     intact D are used under only the most compelling \n     circumstances. In 1995, the Planned Parenthood Federation of \n     America issued a press release asserting that the procedure \n     ``is extremely rare and done only in cases when the woman's \n     life is in danger or in cases of extreme fetal abnormality.''\n       In February, the National Abortion Federation issued a \n     release saying, ``This procedure is most often performed when \n     women discover late in wanted pregnancies that they are \n     carrying fetuses with anomalies incompatible with life.''\n       Clinton offered the same massage when he vetoed the Partial \n     Birth Abortion Ban Act in April, and surrounded himself with \n     women who had wrenching testimony about why they needed \n     abortions. One was an antiabortion marcher whose health was \n     compromised by her 7-month-old fetus neuromuscular disorder.\n       The woman, Coreen Costello, wanted desperately to give \n     birth naturally, even knowing her child would not survive. \n     But because the fetus was paralyzed, her doctors told her a \n     live vaginal delivery was impossible. Costello had two \n     options, they said: abortion or a type of Caesarean section \n     that might ruin her chances of ever having another child. She \n     chose an intact D\n       But most intact D cases are not like Coreen Costello's. \n     Although many third-trimester abortions are for heart-\n     wrenching medical reasons, most intact D patients have \n     their abortions in the middle of the second trimester. And \n     unlike Coreen Costello, they have no medical reason for \n     termination.\n       ``We have an occasional amnio-abnormality, but it's a \n     minuscule amount,'' said one of the doctors at Metropolitan \n     Medical, an assessment confirmed by another doctor there: \n     ``Most are Medicaid patients black and white, and most are \n     for elective, not medical, reasons: people who didn't \n     realize, or didn't care, how far along they were. Most are \n     teenagers.''\n       The physician who teaches said: ``In my private practice, \n     90 to 95 percent are medically indicated. Three of them today \n     are Trisomy-21 [Down syndrome] with heart * * *, the mother \n     has brain cancer and needs chemo. But in the population I see \n     at the teaching hospitals, which is mostly a clinic \n     population, many, many fewer are medically indicated.''\n       Even the Abortion Federation's two prominent providers of \n     intact D have showed documents that publicly contradict the \n     federation's claims.\n       In a 1992 presentation at an Abortion Federation seminar, \n     Haskell described intact D in detail and said he routinely \n     used it on patients 20 to 24 weeks pregnant. Haskell went on \n     to tell the American Medical News, the official paper of the \n     American Medical Association, that 80 percent of those \n     abortions were ``purely elective.''\n       The federation's other leading provider, Dr. McMahon, \n     released a chart to the House Judiciary Committee listing \n     ``depression'' as the most common maternal reason for his \n     late-term non-elective abortions, and listing ``cleft lip'' \n     several times as the fetal indication. Saporta said 85 \n     percent of McMahon's abortions were for severe medical \n     reasons.\n       Even using Saporta's figures, simple math shows 56 of \n     McMahon's abortions and 100 of Haskell's each year were not \n     associated with medical need. Thus, even if they were the \n     only two doctors performing the procedure, more than 30 \n     percent of their cases were not associated with health \n     concerns.\n       Asked about the disparity, Saporta said the pro-choice \n     movement focused on the compelling cases because those were \n     the majority of McMahon's practice, which was mostly third-\n     trimester abortions. Besides; Saporta said, ``When the \n     Catholic bishops and Right to Life debate us on TV and radio, \n     they say a woman at 40 weeks can walk in and get an abortion \n     even if she and the fetus are healthy.'' Saporta said that \n     claim is not true. ``That has been their focus, and been \n     playing defenses ever since.''\n\n\n                       where lobbying has left us\n\n       Doctors who rely on the procedure say the way the debate \n     has been framed obscures what they believe is the real issue. \n     Banning the partial-birth method will not reduce the number \n     of abortions performed. Instead, it will remove one of the \n     safest options for mid-pregnancy termination.\n       ``Look, abortion is abortion. Does it really matter if the \n     fetus dies in utero or when half of it's already out?'' said \n     one of the * * * method at Metropolitan Medical in Englewood. \n     * * * what's safest for the woman,'' and this procedure, he \n     said, is safest for abortion patients 20 weeks pregnant or \n     more. There is less risk of uterine perforation from sharp \n     broken bones and destructive instruments, one reasons the \n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has \n     opposed the ban.\n       Pro-choice activists have emphasized that nine of 10 \n     abortions in the United States occur in the first trimester, \n     and that these have nothing to do with the procedure abortion \n     foes have drawn so much attention to. That's true, physicians \n     say, but it ducks the broader issue.\n       By highlighting the tragic Coreen Costellos, they say, pro-\n     choice forces have obscured the fact that criminalizing \n     intact D would jettison the safest abortion not only for \n     women like Costello, but for the far more common patient: a \n     woman 4\\1/2\\ to 6 months pregnant with a less compelling \n     reason--but still a legal right--to abort.\n       That strategy is no surprise, given Americans queasiness \n     about later-term abortions. Why reargue the morality of or \n     the right to a second-trimester abortion when anguishing \n     examples like Costello's can more compellingly make the case \n     for intact D?\n       To get around the bill, abortion providers say they could \n     inject poison into the amniotic fluid or fetal heart to \n     induce death in utero, but that adds another level of \n     complication and risk to the pregnant woman. Or they could \n     use induction--poisoning the fetus and then ``delivering'' it \n     dead after 12 to 48 hours of painful labor. That method is \n     clearly more dangerous, and if it doesn't work, the patient \n     must have a Caesarean section, major surgery with far more \n     risks.\n       Ironically, the most likely response to the ban is that \n     doctors will return to classic D, arguably a far more \n     gruesome method than the one currently under fire. And, pro-\n     choice advocates now wonder how safe from attack that is, now \n     that abortion foes have American's attention.\n       Congress is expected to call for the override vote this \n     week or next, once again turning up the heat on Clinton \n     barely seven weeks from the election.\n       Legislative observers from both camps predict that the vote \n     in the House will be close. If the override suceeds--a two-\n     thirds majority is required--the measure will be sent to the \n     Senate, where the override is less likely, given that the \n     initial bill passed by 54 to 44. . . .\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, let me, if I can, just quote from some \nof the article as to the facts that were uncovered.\n  You heard Mr. Cohen reference Dr. Brown in his work with the \nWashington Post finding out about more of these procedures being \nperformed in more late-term abortion procedures being done in this \ncountry. Let me share with you this analysis done by a Ruth Padawer, \nwho is the health reporter for the newspaper. She talks about how the \nprochoice people say that this is a very rare procedure. I quote:\n\n       But interviews with physicians who use the method reveal \n     that in New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 partial-birth \n     abortions are performed each year--three times the supposed \n     national rate. Moreover, doctors say only a ``minuscule \n     amount'' are for medical reasons.\n\n  What are we talking about here? We are talking about abortions \nperformed--I know this is an uncomfortable topic for many people to \nlisten to, and I am sure some people are tuning out and turning off. \nBut this is going on in this country. We have an obligation to face up \nto who we are and what we are doing here, and not turn our backs \nbecause it is just not proper dinner conversation.\n  We are performing abortions in this country on babies, fully formed \nbabies in their third trimester, and viable babies who are in the late \nsecond. I am talking about 22, 23, 24 weeks, the second trimester.\n  As I said on Friday, my wife is a neonatal intensive care nurse. She \ntook care of 22-week-olds and 21-week-olds and 24-week-olds in \nPittsburgh at Magee Woman's Hospital. She has told me story after story \nof how many of them have survived and how the percentages are \nincreasing.\n\n[[Page S11141]]\n\n  We are talking about delivering these babies, for no medical reason, \nfeet first through the birth canal, and then kill, by taking a pair of \nmetzenbaum scissors and shoving them into the base of the skull, \ninserting the catheter into the brain and sucking the brains out to \nkill the baby, and then deliver the head. And 1,500 times, according to \nthis article, it happens in New Jersey alone every year. The facts, as \npresented by those who argued against the bill, the facts they quoted \nfrom reputable sources, were only a few hundred in the country done \nevery year.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       But those estimates are belied by reports from abortion \n     providers who use the method. Doctors at Metropolitan Medical \n     Center in Englewood estimate that their clinic alone performs \n     3,000 abortions a year on fetuses between 20 and 24 weeks, of \n     which at least half are by partial-birth abortions.\n       ``I always try an intact D (which is the medical term for \n     partial-birth abortion) first,'' said a Metropolitan Medical \n     gynecologist, who, like every other provider interviewed for \n     this article, spoke on condition of anonymity.\n       Another metropolitan area doctor who works outside New \n     Jersey said he does about 260 post 20-week abortions a year, \n     of which half are partial-birth abortions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n       The doctor, who is also a professor at two prestigious \n     teaching hospitals, said he has been teaching intact D \n     partial-birth abortions since 1981, and he said he knows of \n     two former students on Long Island and two in New York City \n     who use the procedure.\n\n  In fact, he says, ``I do an intact D whenever I can * * *''\n  This is not a rare procedure. This is a procedure that is done all \ntoo frequently in this country. Those were not presented to this Senate \nwhen it deliberated on this bill the first time. Those facts were \nsomehow not researched well by the prochoice groups, like the \nGuttmacher Institute that provided us the statistics we were using in \nthe first place, because there is no, as Mr. Cohen said, national \nrecord keeping of this. There is no agency in Government that keeps \ntrack of this. We only have to go by the people who provide the \nabortions to tell us what they do. And of course--I shouldn't say ``of \ncourse''--but what has happened, in fact, is that they provided us a \nnumber that is not anywhere close to the numbers that really go on in \nthis country.\n  I would suggest that if they were so cavalier with their numbers as \nto how many, how cavalier are they with other facts associated with \nthis issue? The fact of the matter is, this is not a prolife/prochoice \nissue. This is an issue about how far we will go as a country, how far \nwe have gone in blurring the lines.\n  I asked the question to a person the other day on the Fox Morning \nNews when I was on last week--I will ask it to the Senator from \nCalifornia, if she would answer--and that is, if we had a 24-week baby \nor 25-week or 26-week baby delivered, normal baby, healthy fetus, that \nsomeone just decided, as these articles indicate, they wanted to have a \nlate-term abortion because they just did not get around to it sooner, \nor they had a change of heart, if that baby were pulled through the \nbirth canal, feet first, and delivered, everything except for the head, \nand by some mistake of the doctor, the baby's head also was delivered, \ninstead of the doctor, as has been testified before having to hold the \nbaby's head in so he can puncture the skull and suction the brains, if \nthe doctor let the baby's head slip out, I ask the Senator from \nCalifornia, if that baby's head slipped out and that baby was born, \nwould the doctor and the mother have a right to choose whether that \nbaby should live? Would the doctor be able to kill the baby at that \npoint?\n\n  I am happy to yield time to the Senator from California if the \nSenator would like to answer that question. Would the doctor be \npermitted at that point to kill the baby?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, the Senator clearly does not understand the Supreme \nCourt decision of Roe versus Wade, which I strongly support, and I \ndaresay the majority of Senators and the majority of the American \npeople support. That is, a woman has the right to choose in the first \ntrimester, and after that the State comes in with strong and strict \ncontrols. A woman does not have an unfettered right to choose after the \nfirst trimester. The Senator should know that and should read that \ncase. She does not, except if her life is threatened.\n  I would assume, frankly, since the Republican platform does not even \nhave a like exception----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I reclaim my time. I would like an answer. If I can, \nlet me restate the question again, based on the information that has \nbeen read here and the facts that have been provided.\n  You have the former Surgeon General of the United States who says \nthis procedure is never medically necessary. You have an article that I \nwill be reading from later, from a series, a group of gynecologists and \nobstetricians that say partial-birth abortion is bad medicine.\n  You have some organizations who support--I think the American College \nof Gynecologists opposes the legislation, but not because they support \npartial-birth abortions. They do not recognize that as proper medical \nprocedure. They do not like any criminalization of anything. They do \nnot like to have doctors be subject to any kind of criminal complaints. \nThat is why they are opposed to it. That is what they said in their \nletter to Congress.\n  We should focus on the question. The fact of the matter is, we have \nsufficient evidence here that these are not medically necessary \nabortions. They are not to save the life of the mother. In fact, we \nhave a provision in our bill, as the Senator knows, to make an \nexception for the life of the mother. They are not medically necessary. \nIt is for the health of the mother. You have physician after physician \nafter physician saying so. So talk about the facts.\n  I ask this question--and I know the Senator would like to give a long \nanswer and give a speech--but see if you can answer the question very \nsuccinctly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If a partial-birth abortion was being performed on this \nbaby, and for some reason the head slipped out and the baby was \ndelivered, which, in my understanding, is not unprecedented, would the \ndoctor, in consultation with the mother, be able to choose to kill the \nbaby?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend that I am going to take 5 minutes to \nanswer his question because it is a very serious question and I intend \nto answer it in my time, so he can finish up in his time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, after the Senator from California \nspeaks, I will talk about the medical necessity for this procedure, and \nI will cite a group of physicians and other people, other physicians, \nwho have written extensively on the fact that this procedure is never \nmedically indicated. In fact, it is contraindicated. In fact, it is \nmore dangerous to the mother to have one than to do other procedures \nthat are not under the debate here in the Senate.\n  I will get to that as soon as the Senator answers my question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt the debate, and \nI have a different subject I want to comment on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if the Senator from California is going \nto speak for 5 minutes, that I be allowed by unanimous consent to \nfollow the Senator from California for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from North Dakota because I know he has \nbeen patiently waiting to talk about another topic. I was not going to \ncome back to the floor, but I understand that the Senator from \nPennsylvania, in what I consider to be a very unfair way, described my \nposition on a woman's right to choose. Now, I would never, never do \nthat for another Senator because this is a crucial issue.\n  As a mother, as a grandmother, whose grandson is the most precious \nthing in my life, I do not want to hear that there is another Senator \non the floor talking about how I regard pregnancy, motherhood, or \nchildbearing. I\n\n[[Page S11142]]\n\nwould rather have the chance, if someone is going to attack me on an \nissue, that that person be courageous enough to do it when I am on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. So I have come back to the floor to speak.\n  What I want to say is that the vast majority of Americans believe \nthis entire subject should be left to the privacy of families, to the \nreligious convictions of our people, and that U.S. Senators do not \nbelong in the hospital room, they do not belong in the consulting room, \nand if the woman is told by a doctor, ``You might die unless I use a \ncertain procedure, you might die, and the children you have now will \nnot have a mother,'' and if that doctor believes this procedure is the \nonly one to save the life of that woman or to spare her a life of \ninfertility or paralysis, I believe families should have the right to \nmake that choice.\n  If the Senator from Pennsylvania was faced with that choice, if his \ndaughter was in that situation, I really do believe in his heart of \nhearts if this was not a hot political issue, that he would want the \nability, with his God, with his family, to make this decision.\n  Now, my colleague talks about doctors who say this procedure is not \nnecessary. Some believe it is not. They do not have to use this \nprocedure.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who do this \nwork every day, opposes this legislation that does not have an \nexception for the life and health of the mother. The American Medical \nWomen's Association opposes this legislation that does not have a true \nlife exception or a health exception. The California Medical \nAssociation strongly opposes this extreme legislation.\n  Now, I just want to put on the record when we are talking about \nemergency procedures and abortions that take place in late term, this \nis not about a woman's right to choose. This is about an emergency \nhealth situation. My colleagues come here and quote columnists, and on \nand on. I wish they would look in the eyes of the women in this country \nwho have had this procedure who know because of this procedure they \nwere able to bear children.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, I know this is a hard vote, but when the \nAmerican people understand that the legislation before the Senate has \nno life exemption, it only says if a woman has a preexisting condition \nher doctor may use that procedure, and then he will have to defend \nhimself in a courtroom if he does, but it does not have the Hyde \nlanguage--life-of-the-mother, straightforward--that we have seen in \nother pieces of legislation. That Hyde exception is not in this bill. \nThat is why some of my colleagues are going to stand against this bill.\n  Now, the Boxer amendment we put forward said very simply that this \nprocedure can only be used if it can spare a woman's life or if she \ncould suffer long-term, serious, adverse health impacts. Now, does that \nnot sound reasonable? Does that not sound fair?\n  I say to my colleagues, if they look in their heart and it happened \nto their wife, and the doctor said, ``She will die if I do not use this \nprocedure,'' not because she has diabetes or a preexisting condition \nbut because the problem with the fetus is so great, if she does not \nhave this procedure she could bleed to death, I say to my colleagues, \nif they look in their heart, and the doctor looked at them and said, \n``You could lose your wife unless I use this procedure,'' they look in \ntheir heart and they are honest; or, if the doctor said, ``You will \nnever have another baby unless I use this procedure,'' or she will be \nparalyzed from the waist down and in a wheelchair for the rest of her \nlife.\n\n  I honestly believe--I do believe--my colleagues, that if you take \naway the 30-second commercials that Americans are going to see in this \ncampaign, you would say to the doctors, ``Save my life.'' And that is \nall we are asking. All we are asking is only use this procedure if the \nwoman's life is at stake or she would suffer serious adverse health \nrisks if the procedure was not used. I think that is a moderate \nposition. Roe versus Wade does not allow abortions at the end term. The \nState has a right to regulate it. I hope Senators will not misstate \nother Senators' positions. It is too important of a debate.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11136-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11142-S11144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WATER ISSUES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to address a different subject. It \nhas to do with water issues, a subject that will cause some eyes to \nglaze over perhaps in some quarters, but an important subject to my \nState.\n  You know that I come from a small State. I come from the State of \nNorth Dakota, which is large in expanse, 10 times the size of \nMassachusetts, but with 640,000 people. So it is a sparsely populated \nState.\n  A lot of people do not know that we have a flood in North Dakota that \ncame and stayed--a permanent flood the size of the State of Rhode \nIsland. It was not an accidental flood. It was a flood that came and \nstayed in my State because 50 years ago there were some who felt that \nwe should harness the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers and, as part of \nthe flood control provisions called the Pick-Sloan Act, to harness the \nMissouri River so that it didn't flood the cities downstream. So that \nthey could have reliable navigation downstream, they decided, ``Let us \nbuild some dams on the Missouri River.'' One of those dams was built in \nNorth Dakota. President Eisenhower came out to dedicate the dam. It is \ncalled the Garrison Dam.\n  What the Federal Government said then to the State of North Dakota \nis, in order for us to control flooding downstream and to protect the \nlarger cities downstream, would you please play host to a large flood \nthat comes and stays forever? The people of North Dakota said, why \nwould we want to play host to a large flood that comes to stay, a one-\nhalf-million-acre flood forever? The Federal Government says, if you \nwill do that, we will make certain promises to you. We will promise \nthat that dam will be able to generate cheap hydroelectric power, and \nthat will benefit the residents of the region. And, No. 2, more \nimportantly, we will allow you to take the water from behind that dam \nand move it all around your State for economic and municipal and rural \nwater systems. That will help you develop economically, and it will \nprovide new jobs and new opportunities for your State.\n  So the people of North Dakota 50 years ago said, ``Well, that sounds \nlike a reasonable proposition.'' And the dam was built and dedicated, \nas I said, by President Eisenhower in the 1950's. The Garrison \ndiversion project was authorized in 1965 by the Congress. Work began on \nit, and in the 1970's it became very controversial. In fact, some \nportions of this project, some features to move water around our State, \nbecame so controversial that some of the major environmental \norganizations in the country decided to try to kill the project \naltogether. Remember, this is part of a promise that was made to North \nDakota that relates very much to its economic opportunity and its \neconomic future.\n  Recognizing that it was very troublesome to have the opposition of \nsome of these major organizations, I worked to reformulate this \nproject. In 1986 the Congress passed a reformulation act called the \nGarrison Diversion Reformulation Act. This year, 10 years later, we \nappropriated $23 million for this project. That brings it to nearly \n$350 million during the past 10 years since it was reformulated. Now it \nappears that we will once again be required in the next Congress to \nmake a final revision in this project in order to see its completion \nfor our State.\n  A substantial amount has been done in North Dakota with this project; \n$200 million, in what is called an MR fund, has been available to \nNorth Dakota to move water around the State with a southwest pipeline \nin southwestern North Dakota. It has improved water quality in many \ncommunities in North Dakota.\n  So we have derived substantial benefit from it. But we have not been \nable to move Missouri water to the eastern part of North Dakota into \nthe Red River to help the cities of Fargo and Grand Forks, among \nothers. That has not been completed, and all of us are anxious to get \nthat done.\n  I hope in the next Congress to propose, along with my colleagues, a \nfinal revision of the Garrison diversion project that will achieve two \ngoals: First, with the realistic constraints that we have on financing \nhere in the\n\n[[Page S11143]]\n\nCongress and the environmental restraints that exist on new \nenvironmental standards, I think we can reduce the authorized cost of \nthis project for the American taxpayers and we can substitute a \nsubstantial State water development fund for the irrigation projects \nthat are currently authorized. That would give the State much more \nflexibility in meeting its water needs, which might include irrigation \nbut would include many other things as well.\n  Second, in a project revision we can make appropriate changes to the \nfeatures of the project in order to finally move the Missouri River \nwater from the western part of our State to the eastern part of our \nState for municipal, rural, and industrial purposes.\n  I expect that the proposal to revise a water program in North Dakota \nwould be referred to the Senate Energy Committee, on which I sit, and \nit is my hope that the Congress will agree to make some practical \nrevisions in this project; first, to save money, but, second and more \nimportantly, to finally complete this comprehensive project for North \nDakota.\n  I expect that we will probably hold some hearings in North Dakota \nlate in this year in order to take testimony from North Dakotans, \nmyself, and my colleagues from North Dakota, to talk about the \nrevisions that are necessary in order to develop a statewide consensus. \nThat would include working with the Governor, the State legislature, \nIndian tribes, local communities, the Garrison Conservancy District, \nNorth Dakota Water Coalition, environmental groups, water users, and \nvirtually all interested North Dakotans in order to reach some kind of \nconsensus on this project.\n  This is not a project in which the State of North Dakota went to the \nFederal Government and said, ``By the way, would you give us something? \nCould we implore you to provide for us a water project?'' It didn't \nhappen that way at all. The Federal Government came to our State and \nsaid, ``We would like you to play host to a permanent flood, and, if \nyou do, we will provide you this benefit.'' This benefit called the \nGarrison conservancy project--or the Garrison diversion project, \nrather--included, first, an authorized 1 million acres of irrigation. \nThen it was downsized to 250,000 acres; then downsized again to 130,000 \nacres. It had a series of canals and features by which water could be \npumped and moved from the western part of North Dakota to the eastern \npart of North Dakota.\n  The feature that was included in the 1986 Reformulation Act that now \nappears not to be able to be built with respect engineering standards \nand other standards that would be practical is something called the \nSykeston Canal. That is a key feature that involves the moving of water \nthrough the features in this project from the western part of the State \nto the eastern part of the State.\n  The Garrison Conservancy District is now proposing that it be \nreplaced with a pipeline proposal. There are other ideas as well. The \npipeline proposal I think has some merit, and I think it is an approach \nthat might well be workable. But it seems to me in reinvestigating this \nproject we will have to find a feature that replaces the Sykeston \nCanal.\n  The Sykeston Canal was put in in the first place in 1986 because the \nLonetree Reservoir, the original feature which was so enormously \ncontroversial nationally, in 1996 when the Sykeston Canal was proposed, \nit was judged at that point that it may or may not be practical, and if \nit was not, we would have to revisit the issue. It seems to me that we \nwill have to revisit that issue next year.\n  Some would say that North Dakota has not gotten what it should get \nfrom this project. Some are very impatient. I recognize that. But about \n$350 million has been made available in expenditures in pursuit of \ncompleting this water project, including the $200 million for the MR \nfund. We have made substantial progress in a wide range of areas. But \nnow we want to finish this project and do it in a reasonable time. We \nthink that this is an achievable goal. It is not easy to find consensus \non all of these issues, but this project is much more important than \nsome would realize.\n\n  North Dakota is a semiarid State with 15 to 17 inches of rainfall a \nyear. The ability to use the water in this reservoir for agricultural \nand rural municipal purposes is critical to the future of our State. \nOur State struggles to keep people. We have 640,000. We used to have \n680,000 not too many years ago. And to keep people in North Dakota--a \nwonderful State with a low crime rate, with a wonderful education \nsystem and a lot of other advantages--we must provide jobs and must \nprovide opportunity. That is what this project is about.\n  Some needs remain unchanged. There is a continuing requirement to \npermanently solve the water problems of the Devil's Lake basin in my \nState where there is substantial flooding at the moment. That lake, the \nDevil's Lake area, suffers from intermittent cycles of ruinous draught \nand chronic flooding, and that warrants the construction of inlets and \noutlets as a part of a comprehensive water plan. We hope that will be \nexcluded in the Garrison Diversion Project.\n  Finally, a final revision would have to meet the needs of native \nAmericans who suffered the most in the inundation of their lands in \nNorth Dakota for this project.\n  In the final analysis, this issue is about opportunity and jobs in \nour State. It is about good faith on the part of the Federal Government \nto fulfill its obligations to North Dakota. All of us are impatient \nthat we get this completed. But the reality is projects of this size \nare never completed quickly or without problems. We have met the \nchallenges in the past, will in the future, and hope to provide \nproposed revisions that will allow us to finally complete this project.\n  North Dakotans' elected leaders--Republicans and Democrats --every \nmajor elected leader in our State for three decades has spoken with one \nbipartisan voice on this issue. For a State the size of North Dakota, \nthat is crucial. We must plan together, work together, and pull \ntogether if we are to finish this project for the future of North \nDakota. I hope that will be the case. I hope we will make some final \nrevisions and take meaningful strides to completion of a dream in our \nState in the next Congress.\n  I would like to reiterate that for some 50 years, North Dakota has \nsought to realize the benefits of federally assisted water development \nsince Congress proposed the Garrison diversion project as the backbone \nof State water development. Federal law provided that this \ncomprehensive water plan was to accompany the construction by the Corps \nof Engineers of the Garrison Dam, which provided substantial flood \ncontrol and navigation benefits for downstream States.\n\n  Last week the Congress approved $23 million to continue work on the \nGarrison diversion project in North Dakota. Nearly $350 million has \nbeen appropriated for Garrison diversion since the Congress enacted my \nlegislation in 1986 making revisions in the project.\n  The Garrison project is not completed but it has generated hundreds \nof jobs and has brought quality drinking water and irrigation systems \nto three Indian reservations and rural and municipal water systems to \ndozens of communities all across North Dakota.\n  It now appears that further revisions will have to be made in the \nauthorization of this project in order to see it to completion.\n  During the next Congress, I hope to propose, along with my \ncolleagues, a final revision of the Garrison project that will achieve \ntwo goals. In tune with current fiscal constraints and environmental \nstandards, we can reduce the authorized cost of the project and we can \nsubstitute a State water development fund for the irrigation projects \nto give the State more flexibility in meeting its water needs. Second, \nin a project revision we can make appropriate changes to the features \nin order to finally move Missouri River water throughout the State for \nmunicipal, rural, and industrial purposes.\n  I would expect that legislation to revise the project would be \nreferred to the Senate Energy Committee, on which I sit. It would be my \nhope that the Congress would agree to make some practical revisions in \nthe project to save money and to finally complete a comprehensive \nproject for North Dakota.\n  I expect the North Dakota congressional delegation will hold some \nhearings in North Dakota toward the end of\n\n[[Page S11144]]\n\nthis year to take testimony from North Dakotans about the revisions \nnecessary in order to meet the State's current water needs and to \nfinally finish work on the project. We will work with the governor, the \nState legislature, Indian tribes, local communities, the Garrison \nConservancy District, the North Dakota Water Coalition, environmental \ngroups, water users and all interested North Dakotans in order to reach \na statewide consensus on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to offer my colleagues some history on how \nthe Garrison diversion project got started and why a final revision is \nnecessary in order to complete the project.\n  In the 1940's the Federal Government wanted to harness the Missouri \nRiver to prevent massive downstream flooding in States along the Lower \nMissouri and Mississippi Rivers. Annual flood damage to downstream \ncities on the Missouri River was very costly. Also, the lack of stable \nwater levels prevented reliable commercial navigation on the Missouri \nRiver.\n\n  So the Federal Government proposed a series of six dams, one of which \nwas to be located in North Dakota. The Garrison Dam would wall up water \nin a reservoir that would be one-half million acres in size. In short, \nthe Federal Government asked North Dakota to play host to a permanent \nflood as big as the entire State of Rhode Island.\n  The Federal Government said if you North Dakotans will do that, we \nwill provide you with some significant benefits. The dam itself will \ngenerate low cost hydro-electric power and you will have access to some \nof this inexpensive electricity for rural development. And more \nimportantly, the Federal Government will provide a Garrison diversion \nproject which will allow you to move reservoir water around your State \nfor massive irrigation--over 1 million acres--and for municipal, rural, \nand industrial uses.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers completed work on the dam in the mid-\n1950's. The permanent flood arrived in North Dakota and the downstream \nStates received the bulk of the immediate benefits. The Missouri River \nno longer raged with uncontrolled flooding in the spring. Downstream \nnavigation and barge traffic was reliable once again.\n  For North Dakota, the Congress authorized in 1965 a Garrison \ndiversion project with water systems and an irrigation plan--downsized \nto 250,000 acres--as a payment for our permanent flood. The features of \nthat project included a series of canals and pumping stations that \nwould move water from the Missouri River in the western part of North \nDakota to the eastern part of our State, all the way to the Red River \nand would allow for substantial amounts of irrigation with the diverted \nwater along the way.\n  Some features of the Garrison diversion project became very \ncontroversial in the 1970's and national environmental organizations \nattempted to kill the project. The result was that progress on the \nproject was slowed.\n  In 1986 the Congress enacted my legislation reformulating the \nGarrison diversion project and resolving the controversies. The \nirrigation features were reduced in scope to 130,000 acres and a \nmunicipal and industrial water fund of $200 million was created and \ngiven priority in appropriations.\n  A new feature called the Sykeston Canal was created to be a \nreplacement for the Lonetree Reservoir, which had become a lightening \nrod for opposition to the project. At the time, the engineering and \ncost evaluation of the Sykeston Canal was suspect and we agreed then \nthat if the Sykeston Canal proved to be unworkable we would have to \nrevisit that issue.\n  The Garrison Diversion Unit Reformulation Act also provided for a \nwater treatment facility to treat Missouri River water that would reach \nthe Hudson Bay drainage after it flowed through for use by cities such \nas Fargo and Grand Forks along the Red River. The act also established \nrequirements for wildlife mitigation, and for recreation development in \nNorth Dakota.\n  In the intervening years since the 1986 Reformulation Act, Congress \nhas provided nearly $350 million in expenditures, most of which was \nused for the $200 million MR Fund. North Dakota has made enormous \nprogress in building a southwest water pipeline and many other \nexpenditures that have improved water delivery for cities and towns \nwith undrinkable or inadequate water in our State.\n  However, we are impatient in wanting to finally finish the features \nof the project and move Missouri water to eastern North Dakota so that \nour eastern cities have an assured supply of municipal and industrial \nwater.\n  It is now clear that the Sykeston Canal is not a workable feature, \nfrom both an engineering and a cost standpoint so we must develop a new \nconnecting link can be completed in a way that achieves our goal.\n  Therefore, it is necessary to make one last revision to this project. \nThis final revision should include a substitute for the Sykeston Canal, \nas well as converting the bulk of the authorized irrigation acreage to \na more flexible state water development fund that can be used for a \nwide range of North Dakota needs.\n  The Garrison Conservancy District has proposed a pipeline approach as \na replacement for the Sykeston Canal. I believe that has substantial \npromise. Most of the work has been completed on the key features of \nthis project and we are close to being able to realize the dream of a \nwater diversion project that will help all of our State.\n  Naturally, some needs remain unchanged. There is a continuing \nrequirement to permanently solve the water problems of the Devils Lake \nBasin. The lake suffers from an intermittent cycle of ruinous drought \nand chronic flooding, which warrants the construction of an inlet/\noutlet system as part of a comprehensive water management plan for the \nbasin. Presently, Devils Lake is threatened by a 120-year flood, which \nmay require the construction of an emergency outlet for which plans \nhave already been developed.\n  Likewise, a final Garrison plan must meet the water development needs \nof native Americans and citizens of the Red River Valley. Native \nAmericans suffered the most from the inundation of lands in North \nDakota and their requirements for MR and irrigation must be addressed \nby the Congress. The cities of Fargo and Grand Forks and communities up \nand down the Red River Valley likewise look to Garrison diversion as \nthe only realistic resource for problems of water quality and quantity.\n  The final form of Garrison diversion will also continue the State's \ncommitment to protect and enhance wildlife and habitat. It has \nestablished a precedent-setting wildlife trust fund. Recreational \ndevelopment provided under Garrison diversion will also contribute to \nfish and wildlife management.\n  In the final analysis, this issue is about a future of jobs and \nopportunity in North Dakota's future. And it is about good faith--on \nthe part of the Federal Government to fulfill its pledge to the people \nof North Dakota for water development.\n  All of us are impatient to get this project completed. But the \nreality is projects of this size are not completed quickly just because \nthey are so massive in scope. Controversies must be resolved.\n  Since the project was authorized in the mid-1960's, North Dakota's \nelected leaders have spoken with one bipartisan voice in support of \nthis project and I hope that will continue to be the case. It takes all \nof the collective energy that we can muster in a State of our size to \nget this project completed. We must plan together, work together and \npull together to finish the work on this project.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, are we functioning as in morning \nbusiness, each Senator allotted time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is correct. We are \noperating in morning business. Each Senator is allotted up to 5 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11142-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11144-S11151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                VALUJET\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today on a matter of vital \nconcern to the economic well-being of thousands of Georgia families. I \nthink we all remember the tragedy of the event in May, May 11, when \nValuJet 592 plunged into the Florida Everglades. And, forever, as with \nany incident like this, we all are grieving over the families that were \naffected.\n  However, following this investigation, ValuJet airlines was grounded \nand went through the most thorough, grinding analysis of every aspect \nof\n\n[[Page S11145]]\n\ntheir procedures possible. Because, obviously, safety is first and \nforemost, the center of any question as to whether the airlines could \nreturn to the air. I do not think it is generally known that on August \n29, at 3:45 p.m., after having gone through this arduous procedure, the \nFederal Aviation Administration returned ValuJet airline's carrier \noperating certificate. In their own press release it says, ``This \naction will permit ValuJet to resume operations at a future date if the \nairline is found to be managerially and financially fit by the \nDepartment of Transportation.''\n  The point I want to make here is that 4,000 employees have been \nunable to draw a paycheck; 4,000 homes, not to mention the hundreds of \nbusiness associated with the peripheral support of the airline, they \nhave not been able to draw a paycheck. The FAA settled the preeminent \nquestion, is the airline safe? And they returned the certificate.\n  The Department of Transportation, which I had not realized, also must \nverify or issue a certificate to allow the airline to return to \noperations. It is now September 24, nearly a full month--and this is \njust the story of Washington over and over and over. The Department of \nTransportation said, on August 29, that the background and experience \nof ValuJet's management team fully qualifies them to oversee the \ncarrier's operation. The Department of Transportation review of \nValuJet, its forecast of current financial condition, finds that, ``the \ncompany continues to have available to it funds sufficient to allow it \nto recommence operations at its planned, scaled-back level without \nundue economic risk to consumers. ValuJet has taken a number of steps \nto strengthen management procedures and has demonstrated a disposition \nto comply with all applicable laws and regulations.''\n  August 29: FAA returns the certificate. It is safe. August 29: The \nDepartment of Transportation issues its findings that in the three \nmajor criteria it is to review it appears the airline is ready to fly. \nToday is September 24, and there is not one engine turning and there is \nnot one paycheck being issued to one of those 4,000 families. In fact, \nwe are being threatened with firing the remaining 400 employees. This \nis not right. This is not right. This is what everybody out there \nbecomes so incensed about in the Washington apparatus. This airline is \nnow ready to fly. Those workers need to be put back to work. The \neconomic health that this airline represents needs to be returned to \nthe air.\n  They have met the criteria that their Government demanded for safety \nand they have met the other basic criteria. We are now mired in \nbureaucracy. There was a period of time when this press release was \nissued, 7 days, during which anybody who had anything to say could say \nit. The airline had 4 days to comment on it. That has happened. It is \nlong since passed. We still do not have the authorization to fly. I am \njust stunned by it. I do not know why. It happens every day in this \ntown, the insensitivity, the 9 to 5 attitude. So what if 4,000 people \nare not getting a paycheck? So what if every day that goes by actually \nthreatens one of the major criteria, economic solvency? Obviously, they \ndo not become more solvent by sitting nailed to a tarmac. So what if we \nare about to fire 400 more people, even though FAA has said it is ready \nto go and DOT has said for all practical purposes it is ready to go?\n  Mr. President, these folks need to get their bureaucratic mishmash \nsettled, and they need to get this airline back in the air, and they \nneed to get these families economically solvent and able to pay their \nmortgages and pay for their kids' education, and get their families \nback together.\n  Mr. President, I can see the consternation on your face, which means \nmy 5 minutes has expired. I appreciate the Chair's patience, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, while my colleague from California was \non the floor I didn't get a chance to hear her, and much of what she \nsaid was in response to my question--and I use that term loosely \nbecause, in what I heard, she did not respond to the question. My \nquestion is a very simple question. The question, obviously, needs to \nbe asked and, hopefully, at some point someone will answer me. That is, \nwhat will be the position of innocence if, in the performance of this \nprocedure where the baby is delivered feet first, this birth canal, the \nentire baby's arms and legs, torso, are outside of the mother's womb \ncompletely, arms and legs moving outside the mother, all that is left \nin is the head, that is, when this procedure is performed and the baby \nis then killed, what if--which is not unknown from what I understand--\nif, for some reason, when the shoulders were delivered the head were \naccidentally delivered, will the mother and the physician then have a \nright to choose whether that baby lives or not? Or, would they be \nresponsible--would the physician have to do something to keep the baby \nalive, since it is now completely outside the mother?\n\n  I understand the Senator from California went in, started talking \nabout when the procedure should be used, and certain facilities, and \nall the things that could happen as a result of not using this \nprocedure, talked about Roe versus Wade, but did not answer the \nquestion as to whether it was still the woman's right to choose at that \npoint. Since she wanted to have the abortion, whether it would still be \nthe woman's right to terminate that pregnancy? She defends the \nprocedure, but she does not answer the question, and I will ask that \nquestion again, as I will be on the floor for some time. I will ask \nthat question again of the Senator from California or anybody else who \nwants to defend this procedure being used on a 24-week-old or 30-week-\nold baby.\n  The Senator from California talked about this procedure as medically \nnecessary to stop--to prohibit infertility or if it is more dangerous \nbecause it could cause paralysis, and all of these medical-health \nreasons why this procedure should be performed. Let me read to you some \ninformation from a group of physicians. They call themselves FACT, \nPhysicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth.\n  The first quote is from a doctor, Nancy Romer, chairman of obstetrics \nand gynecology at Miami Valley Hospital, in Ohio. People deserve to \nknow, ``partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect \na woman's health or her fertility.''\n  ``Never medically indicated.'' The Senator from California talked \nabout how the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \nsupport this procedure. You hear this often, how ACOG, which is how \nthey go, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have come \nout in opposition to the bill and support partial-birth abortions. That \nis only half true.\n  They have opposed this bill. I will read to you the letter. I have a \ncopy of the letter sent to the Speaker of the House dated last week:\n\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: The American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists, an organization representing more than 37,000 \n     physicians dedicated to improving women's health care, does \n     not support H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of \n     1995. The College finds very disturbing that Congress would \n     take any action that would supersede the medical judgment of \n     trained physicians and criminalize medical procedures that \n     may be necessary to save the life of a woman. Moreover, in \n     defining what medical procedures doctors may not perform, \n     H.R. 1833 employs terminology that is not even recognized in \n     the medical community--demonstrating why Congressional \n     opinion should never be substituted for professional medical \n     judgment. For these reasons we urge to you oppose the veto \n     override. . . .\n\n  They do not support this procedure. What is very clear in this \nletter, to me, and I think to everyone who reads it, is they do not \nlike having procedures criminalized. They do not want any doctor \nprocedure criminalized. They want the doctor, basically, to have the \nsay what kind of procedures they perform, if any.\n  I would ask the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--\nand they will give me an answer. I guarantee you, in fact we will write \nthem a letter today and fax it over: If this procedure was done and the \nbaby's head slipped out, would the obstetrician be allowed to kill the \nbaby?\n  If they would be so kind as to respond to that I will send the \nletter, if necessary. But I would suspect the answer would be pretty \nclear: No. No.\n  I do not know if we will get that answer from anybody on the other \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S11146]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me return to the issue of partial-birth abortion. \nI would like to respond to a comment that was made about an hour ago, I \nguess, by my colleague from California, Senator Boxer. She is certainly \nvery eloquent. She and I have debated this issue before, and I suspect \nwe will be debating it again.\n  She made a statement to the effect that we have heard from the men, \nwe have heard men come down to the floor, we have heard from the men, \nnow let's hear from the women. Mr. President, there are many women in \nthis country adamantly opposed to partial-birth abortions. I have \nreceived in my office over 90,000 postcards and letters from people in \nOhio. That does not include the thousands of calls that we have \nreceived. By looking at some of these postcards, it is clear that a \nlarge number of these individuals are women who are writing about this \nissue.\n  But let's talk about three specific people, three women, three women \nwho are professionals, who are experts, who have, I think, something \nreally to say about this issue.\n  Let me first start with Brenda Shafer. Brenda Shafer described \nherself as pro-choice. She is working as a nurse in Dayton, OH. I am \ngoing to read very briefly from the testimony that she gave to the \nJudiciary Committee on November 17, 1995. She is describing at this \npoint, Mr. President, in her testimony how she came to work in Dr. \nHaskell's office. This is what she said:\n\n       So, because of strong pro-choice views that I held at that \n     time, I thought this assignment would be no problem for me. \n     But I was wrong. I stood at the doctor's side as he performed \n     the partial-birth abortion procedure, and what I saw is \n     branded on my mind forever.\n\n  Then she describes what she saw:\n\n       The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and \n     his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the \n     scissors in the back of his head and the baby's arms jerked \n     out, like a startled reaction, like a flinch, like a baby \n     does when he thinks he is going to fall. The doctor opened up \n     the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the \n     opening and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby went \n     completely limp. I was really completely unprepared for what \n     I was seeing. I almost threw up as I watched Dr. Haskell \n     doing these things.\n\n  Then she goes on:\n\n       I've been a nurse for a long time, and I've seen a lot of \n     death, people maimed in auto accidents, gunshot wounds, you \n     name it. I've seen surgical procedures of every sort. But in \n     all my professional years, I never witnessed anything like \n     this.\n\n  Finally, she concluded:\n\n       I will never be able to forget it. What I saw done to that \n     little boy and to those other babies should not be allowed in \n     this country. I hope that you will pass the Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act.\n\n  Brenda Shafer described herself as pro-choice. She knew she was \nwalking into a clinic where abortions were done. That is what they did. \nThat is what she saw. That is what she described. No dispute about it. \nDr. Haskell himself in the printed literature, articles he has written, \ndescribes, basically, the same procedure. That is Brenda Shafer.\n\n  The next woman I would like to reference and call the Senate's \nattention to and the testimony she gave to our committee is Dr. Pamela \nSmith. Dr. Pamela Smith is the director of medical education, \ndepartment of obstetrics and gynecology, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, \nChicago, IL.\n  In her testimony, she systematically described how this procedure is \nreally not indicated, that it is not a medical procedure that is \nrequired. It does not really have to take place.\n  Let me read a portion of the testimony that she gave.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, here is what she says about the necessity \nof this procedure:\n\n       I went around and described the procedure of partial-birth \n     abortion to a number of physicians and lay persons who I knew \n     to be pro-choice. They were horrified to learn that such a \n     procedure was even legal.\n\n  Later on in her testimony she says the following. Again, this is Dr. \nPamela Smith:\n\n       Now, the cruelty to the baby is there for everyone to see, \n     if you will acknowledge it. But I think that it is more \n     difficult for people to recognize the risk to the mother that \n     is associated with these procedures. I might also add that \n     these risks have been acknowledged not only in standard \n     medical literature, but by people who perform abortions as \n     well.\n\n  Continuing her testimony, she concludes as follows:\n\n       Enactment of this legislation is needed both to protect \n     human offspring from being subjected to a brutal procedure \n     and to safeguard the health of pregnant women in America.\n\n  This is just one of the witnesses that we heard who said this \nprocedure is simply not indicated, it is not something that is accepted \nin the medical field. It is not something that medical journals \nrecognize. It is not something that doctors believe is necessary. That \nwas Dr. Pamela Smith.\n  Let me conclude with a third individual, and that is Dr. Nancy Romer, \na medical doctor. She is a clinical professor, ob-gyn, Wright State \nUniversity, chairman of the department. This is her quote:\n\n       This procedure is currently not an accepted medical \n     procedure. A search of medical literature reveals no mention \n     of this procedure, and there is no critically evaluated or \n     peer review journal that describes this procedure. There is \n     currently also no peer review or accountability of this \n     procedure. It is currently being performed by a physician \n     with no obstetric training in an outpatient facility behind \n     closed doors and no peer review.\n\n  Again, only one of several witnesses who testified that this is \nreally not an accepted medical procedure at all.\n  Mr. President, I will be commenting further about this issue later on \nin the debate.\n  Let me conclude by saying what we are really about today, tomorrow \nand Thursday when we vote on this matter when we determine whether or \nnot there are enough votes in this Senate to do what the House did, and \nthat is override the President's veto, a veto that I believe was very \nmisguided. The issue really is about what kind of a people we are and \nwhat we will tolerate, what we will turn our back to, what we will turn \nour head on and what we will say is OK: ``I wouldn't do it, I don't \nlike it, but I'm not going to do anything about it.''\n\n  I think we really define who we are as a people, what kind of a \npeople we are in this debate, because, Mr. President, if this procedure \ncan be accepted, can be allowed in this country, I think virtually \nanything can be allowed.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania, who has been very eloquent in this \nmatter, and other colleagues have referred to the fact that this \nchild--there is nothing else to call it, a child--is within seconds of \nbeing born, is within inches of being born. It is almost all the way \nout when that child is killed in the manner described by Nurse Shafer, \nand that if this procedure--and I think that almost debases the English \nlanguage by calling it a ``procedure,'' it is such a sterile word--is \nallowed to continue in this country, there is literally no limit to \nwhat we will tolerate, what we will turn our back on, what we will say: \n``We don't like it, but we will put up with it.''\n  So I think we really do in this debate define what we are as a \npeople, what we care about, what is important to us and what is not \nimportant to us. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nOhio for his statement and for the tremendous amount of work he has \ndone on this issue from the committee level through passage in the \nSenate, and here he is back again.\n  I can tell you that those of us who have spoken on this issue do not \nrelish the opportunity to do so. It is a very difficult issue. It is a \nvery tough issue to talk about. And Senator DeWine has eight children. \nI have three children. My wife and I are expecting our fourth in March. \nWe know how very serious this issue is. And we very much believe that \nin this case, on this issue, this is an issue of the life and death of \na little baby. And we think it is important for us to stand up and say \nsomething about it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 20 minutes to \nspeak on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S11147]]\n\n  Mr. President, what I was talking about a few minutes ago, Senator \nDeWine highlighted. I just want to reinforce some of the evidence that \nhas come forward throughout the process of the hearings and the debates \nin the House and Senate, but also new information that has been made \navailable to us. I want to say again to Members who are thinking about \nthis issue, who have possibly opposed this issue in the past, that \nthere certainly is enough information that has come out since the \noriginal passage of this bill that would give any Member who truly does \ndeliberate on this issue the opportunity to take another look and to \ngather all the facts.\n  I am going to read an article written by four obstetricians, two who \nthe Senator from Ohio just referred to, Nancy Romer and Pamela Smith, \nbut also Curtis Cook and Joseph DeCook. These are all obstetricians. \nThey are members of an organization called PAHCT, which is, Physicians \nAd Hoc Coalition for Truth. My understanding is that that group is now \ncomprised of over 300 such physicians who share the opinion of this \ntext that was printed on Thursday, September 19, in the Wall Street \nJournal.\n       The House of Representatives will vote in the next few days \n     on whether to override President Clinton's veto of the \n     Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. The debate on the subject has \n     been noisy and rancorous. You've heard from the activists. \n     You've heard from the politicians. Now may we speak?\n\n  And speaking as obstetricians.\n\n       We are the physicians who, on a daily basis, treat pregnant \n     women and their babies. And we can no longer remain silent \n     while abortion activists, the media and even the president of \n     the United States continue to repeat false medical claims \n     about partial-birth abortion. The appalling lack of medical \n     credibility on the side of those defending this procedure has \n     forced us--for the first time on our professional careers--to \n     leave the sidelines in order to provide some sorely needed \n     facts in a debate that has been dominated by anecdote, \n     emotion and media stunts.\n       Since the debate on this issue began, those whose real \n     agenda is to keep all types of abortion legal--at any stage \n     of pregnancy, for any reason--have waged what can only be \n     called an orchestrated misinformation campaign.\n       First the National Abortion Federation and other pro-\n     abortion groups claimed the procedure didn't exist. When a \n     paper written by the doctor who invented the procedure was \n     produced, abortion proponents changed their story, claiming \n     the procedure was only done when a women's life was in \n     danger. Then the same doctor, the nation's main practitioner \n     of the technique, was caught-on tape-admitting that 80% of \n     his partial-bath abortions were ``purely elective.''\n       Then there was the anesthesia myth. The American public was \n     told that it wasn't the abortion that killed the baby, but \n     the anesthesia administered to the mother before the \n     procedure. This claim was immediately and thoroughly \n     denounced by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, which \n     called the claim ``entirely inaccurate.'' Yet Planned \n     Parenthood and its allies continued to spread the myth, \n     causing needless concern among our pregnant patients who \n     heard the claims and were terrified that epidurals during \n     labor, or anesthesia during needed surgeries, would kill \n     their babies.\n       The lastest baseless statement was made by President \n     Clinton himself when he said that if the mothers who opted \n     for partial-birth abortions had delivered their children \n     naturally, the women's bodies would have been ``eviscerated'' \n     or ``ripped to shreds'' and they ``could never have another \n     baby.''\n       That claim is totally and completely false. Contrary to \n     what abortion activities would have us believe, partial-birth \n     abortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's \n     health or her fertility. In fact, the opposite is true: The \n     procedure can pose a significant and immediate threat to both \n     the pregnant woman's health and her fertility. It seems to \n     have escaped anyone's attention that one of the five women \n     who appeared at Mr. Clinton's veto ceremony had five \n     miscarriages after her partial-birth abortion.\n       Consider the dangers inherent in partial-birth abortion, \n     which usually occurs after the fifth month of pregnancy. A \n     woman's cervix is forcibly dilated over several days, which \n     risks creating an ``incompetent cervix,'' the leading cause \n     of premature deliveries. it is also an invitation to \n     infection, a major cause of infertility. The abortionist then \n     reaches into the womb to pull a child feet first out of the \n     mother (internal podalic version), but leaves the head \n     inside. Under normal circumstances, physicians avoid breech \n     births whenever possible; in this case, the doctor \n     intentionally causes one--and risks tearing the uterus in the \n     process. He then forces scissors through the base of the \n     baby's skull--which remains lodged just within the birth \n     canal. This is a partially ``blind'' procedure, done by feel, \n     risking direct scissor injury to the uterus and laceration of \n     the cervix or lower uterine segment, resulting in immediate \n     and massive bleeding and the threat of shock or even death to \n     the mother.\n       None of this risk is ever necessary for any reason. We and \n     many other doctors across the U.S. regularly threat women \n     whose unborn children suffer the same conditions as those \n     cited by the women who appeared at Mr. Clinton's veto \n     ceremony. Never is the partial-birth procedure necessary. \n     Not for hydrocephaly (excessive cerebrospinal fluid in the \n     head), not for polyhydramnios (an excess of amniotic fluid \n     collecting in the women) and not for trisomy (genetic \n     abnormalities characterized by an extra chromosome). \n     Sometimes, as in the case of hydrocephaly, it is first \n     necessary to drain some of the fluid from the baby's head. \n     And in some cases, when vaginal delivery is not possible, \n     a doctor performs a Caesarean section. But in no case is \n     it necessary to partially deliver an infant through the \n     vagina and then kill the infant.\n       How telling it is that although Mr. Clinton met with women \n     who claimed to have needed partial-birth abortions on account \n     of these conditions, he has flat-out refused to meet with \n     women who delivered babies with these same conditions, with \n     no damage whatsoever to their health or future fertility!\n       Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was recently asked \n     whether he'd ever operated on children who had any of the \n     disabilities described in this debate. Indeed he had. In \n     fact, one of his patients--``with a huge omphalocele [a sac \n     containing the baby's organs] much bigger than here head''--\n     went on to become the head nurse in his intensive care unit \n     many years later.\n\n  So he delivered this baby that had these organs outside the body. Not \nonly was that repaired, but that woman went on to become the head nurse \nin his intensive care unit.\n\n       Mr. Koop's reaction to the president's veto? ``I believe \n     that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical advisers on what \n     is fact and what is fiction'' on the matter, he said. Such a \n     procedure, he added, cannot truthfully be called medically \n     necessary for either the mother or--he scarcely need point \n     out--for the baby.\n       Considering these medical realities, one can only conclude \n     that the women who thought they underwent partial-birth \n     abortions for ``medical'' reasons were tragically misled. And \n     those who purport to speak for women don't seem to care.\n       So whom are you going to believe? The activist-extremists \n     who refuse to allow a little truth to get in the way of their \n     agenda? The politicians who benefit from the activists' \n     political action committees? Or doctors who have the facts?\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to read from the American Medical News. \nThis was an interview with C. Everett Koop. In fact, I read most of it. \nI ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From American Medical News, Aug. 19, 1996]\n\n                        The View From Mount Koop\n\n                 (By Diane Gianelli and Christina Kent)\n\n       Q: Clinton just vetoed a bill to ban ``partial birth'' \n     abortions, a late-term abortion technique that practitioners \n     refer to as ``intact dilation and evacuation'' or ``dilation \n     and extraction.'' In so doing, he cited several cases in \n     which women were told these procedures were necessary to \n     preserve their health and their ability to have future \n     pregnancies. How would you characterize the claims being made \n     in favor of the medical need for this procedure?\n       A: I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical \n     advisers on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to \n     late-term abortions. Because in no way can I twist my mind to \n     see that the late-term abortion as described--you know, \n     partial birth, and then destruction of the unborn child \n     before the head is born--is a medical necessity for the \n     mother. It certainly can't be a necessity for the baby. So I \n     am opposed to . . . partial birth abortions.\n       Q: In your practice as a pediatric surgeon, have you ever \n     treated children with any of the disabilities cited in this \n     debate? For example, have you operated on children born with \n     organs outside of their bodies?\n       A: Oh, yes indeed. I've done that many times. The prognosis \n     usually is good. There are two common ways that children are \n     born with organs outside of their body. One is an \n     omphalocele, where the organs are out but still contained in \n     the sac composed of the tissues of the umbilical cord. I have \n     been repairing those since 1946. The other is when the sac \n     has ruptured. That makes it a little more difficult. I don't \n     know what the national mortality would be, but certainly more \n     than half of those babies survive after surgery.\n       Now every once a while, you have other peculiar things, \n     such as the chest being wide open and the heart being outside \n     the body. And I have even replaced hearts back in the body \n     and had children grow to adulthood.\n       Q: And live normal lives?\n       A: Serving normal lives. In fact, the first child I ever \n     did, with a huge omphalocele much bigger than her head, went \n     on to develop well and become the head nurse in my intensive \n     care unit many years later.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I think it is important to realize again the new information that has \ncome out. The information provided by\n\n[[Page S11148]]\n\nthese physicians, the information provided by Mr. Cohen. And I have an \narticle here by David Brown, published in the Washington Post, on \nSeptember 17, just last week. This was the article that Mr. Cohen \nreferred to in his column where he changed his mind. He changed his \nmind. Someone who is admittedly very pro-choice changed his mind on \nwhether this procedure should be legal or not.\n  One of the reasons he changed his mind--the principal reason was as a \nresult of Dr. Brown's article talking about ``Late Term Abortions, Who \nGets Them and Why,'' which is the name of the article by David Brown. \nHe talks about who gets them and why. He talks about Dr. Haskell from \nOhio, who says, ``I'll be quite frank: most of my abortions are \nelective in that 20-24 week range. In my particular case, probably 20 \npercent of the abortions are for genetic reasons. And the other 80 \npercent are purely elective.''\n  Elective means, according to David Brown, that the fetuses were \nnormal, or that the pregnant woman was not seriously ill.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article by David Brown be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 17, 1996]\n\n                          Late Term Abortions\n\n                            (By David Brown)\n\n       In a White House ceremony in April, President Clinton \n     vetoed a bill outlawing a technique of abortion done only in \n     the second half of pregnancy. Termed ``partial-birth \n     abortion'' by the people who decry it, and ``intact dilation \n     and evacuation'' by the people who perform it, the technique \n     has become the latest lightning rod in the nation's stormy \n     debate about abortion.\n       Standing next to the president when he announced the veto \n     were five women who had undergone late-term abortions with \n     the controversial technique because their fetuses had severe \n     developmental defects.\n       The women, Clinton said, ``represent a small, but extremely \n     vulnerable group . . . They all desperately wanted their \n     children. They didn't want abortions. They made agonizing \n     decisions only when it became clear their babies would not \n     survive, their own lives, their health, and in some cases \n     their capacity to have children in the future were in \n     danger.''\n       Others have sketched similar pictures. The Planned \n     Parenthood Federation of America called this procedure \n     ``extremely rare and done only in cases when the woman's life \n     is in danger or in cases of extreme fetal abnormality.'' The \n     National Abortion Federation, an abortion providers' \n     organization, said that ``in the majority of cases'' where it \n     is used, there is a ``severe fetal anomaly [birth defect].''\n       But it is not possible to speak with certainty about who \n     undergoes ``intact D,'' as the ``partial-birth abortion'' \n     is known in medicine. The federal government does not collect \n     such information. Physicians do not have to report it to the \n     state health departments. Researchers do not study the \n     question or publish their findings in medical journals.\n       Interviews with doctors who use the procedure and public \n     comments by others show that the situation is much more \n     complex. These doctors say that while a significant number of \n     their patients have late abortions for medical reasons, many \n     others--perhaps the majority--do not. Often they are young or \n     poor. Some are victims of rape or incest.\n       Physicians who perform abortions beyond the first third of \n     pregnancy say that use of intact D is quite rare. Just over \n     1 percent (about 17,000) of all abortions in this country \n     occur after the 20th week of fetal development; it is after \n     that point when the intact D procedure is sometimes used. \n     Only a fraction are believed to be intact D, the \n     controversial method in which the fetus is pulled by the feet \n     out of the uterus and the head is punctured so it can also \n     pass through the cervix. What's more, very few doctors \n     perform this surgery; interviews with abortion experts \n     suggest that there are less than 20.\n       What follows are sketches of the experience of several \n     physicians who perform the intact D procedure, as well as \n     the experience of doctors who perform abortions on patients \n     with advanced pregnancies using an alternative technique. \n     Taken as a group, the descriptions and observations by these \n     practitioners paint a more complete picture of who decides to \n     end their pregnancy at an advanced stage, and why.\n\n\n                          A QUESTION OF SAFETY\n\n       One of the better-known practitioners of intact D is \n     Martin Haskell, an Ohio physician who in 1992 presented a \n     ``how-to'' paper on the technique at a medical conference in \n     Texas. The dissemination of this document to antiabortion \n     activists set the stage for the current campaign to ban the \n     technique.\n       Although Haskell declined to be interviewed for this \n     article, in his 1992 paper he said he had performed ``over \n     700 of these procedures.'' Three years ago, American \n     Medical News, a weekly publication of the American Medical \n     Association, interviewed Haskell about his technique.\n       ``I'll be quite frank most of my abortions are elective in \n     that 20-24 week range,'' Haskell said, according to a \n     transcript of the interview, which has circulated widely \n     during the debate on the ``partial-birth abortion'' bill. \n     ``In my particular case, probably 20 percent [of the \n     abortions] are for genetic reasons. And the other 80 percent \n     are purely elective.''\n       ``Elective'' is not a medical term generally used with \n     abortion, but it is often used in medicine to denote \n     procedures that are not medically required. In this context, \n     it appears to mean that the fetuses were normal or that the \n     pregnant woman was not seriously ill.\n       The American Medical News reporter also asked Haskell \n     ``whether or not the fetus was dead beforehand.'' The doctor \n     answered: ``No it's not. No it's really not. A percentage are \n     for various numbers of reasons. . . . In my case, I would \n     think probably about a third of those are definitely dead \n     before I actually start to remove the fetus. And probably the \n     other two-thirds are not.''\n       Also performing intact D abortions in Ohio is a 45-year-\n     old physician named Martin Ruddock. Interviewed recently, he \n     declined to estimate how many abortions he did each year, but \n     said that only 5 to 10 percent were done in the later stages \n     of pregnancy. Beyond the 18th or 19th week, Ruddock prefers \n     to use the intact D technique.\n       He believes it is safer than its most common alternative, \n     which is called ``dismemberment dilation and evacuation.'' In \n     that procedure, the fetus is removed in pieces, generally \n     limbs first. It requires that the surgeon exert a great deal \n     of force on the fetus inside the uterus, and it often \n     produces short, bony fragments that can damage a woman's \n     reproductive organs. On rare occasions, ``dismemberment D'' \n     also exposes a woman to fetal substance (primarily brain \n     tissue) that can cause dangerous reactions.\n       ``To minimize those problems is why the [intact] procedure \n     was developed,'' Ruddock said.\n       In practice, however, he employs it only a third of the \n     times he'd like to, he said. Often the position of the fetus, \n     or some other variable, makes intact D impossible, and he \n     uses dismemberment instead. However, whenever he uses the \n     intact method, he first cuts the umbilical cord--a maneuver \n     designed to make sure the fetus is dead before he punctures \n     its skull.\n       ``The fundamental argument [of the technique's opponents] \n     is that the fetus is alive. And what I am saying is that in \n     my practice that never happens,'' he said.\n       In 45 percent of the cases done beyond beyond 20 weeks of \n     gestation, he said, the fetuses have obvious developmental \n     abnormalities or the women carrying them have illnesses that \n     are being made worse by the pregnancy. In the other 55 \n     percent, however, the fetuses are normal.\n       Another practitioner, who did not want to be identified, is \n     a physician in the New York area who is affiliated with \n     several teaching institutions. He does about 750 in the \n     second trimester of pregnancy. He uses intact D in ``well \n     under a quarter'' of those, he said. About one-third are his \n     private patients, and the rest are ones he sees at the \n     teaching hospitals, where he instructs physicians in \n     training.\n       This doctor said that the ``great majority'' of the private \n     patients have medical reasons for their abortions: Either the \n     fetus is abnormal or the pregnant woman's health is \n     threatened by the pregnancy.\n       The nonprivate patients, however, are different. They tend \n     to have lower incomes, and the fraction of them who have \n     medical reasons for abortion ``is not nearly as high, [but] I \n     can't quantify it,'' he said. In the cases in which there is \n     no medical indication, the fetuses are usually normal.\n\n\n                    A California Doctor's Experience\n\n       The notion that intact D is done only in the third \n     trimester--very late in the pregnancy, generally after 24 \n     weeks--and only when the fetus has catastrophic defects, \n     appears to have arisen from widespread publicity about the \n     practice of a doctor in Los Angeles named James T. McMahon, \n     who died last year. His specialty was the very late abortion \n     of fetuses with severe developmental defects.\n       Patients came to him from across the United States and \n     sometimes even from outside the country. All of the women who \n     appear with Clinton at the veto ceremony had their abortions \n     done by him.\n       McMahon used intact D extensively because after about the \n     26th week of gestation dismemberment of fetuses is extremely \n     difficult, if not impossible.\n       In a letter written in 1993 to doctors who referred \n     patients to him, he said that in 1991 he'd done 65 third-\n     trimester abortions. All of these cases, he said, were \n     ``nonelective.'' Of all the abortions done beyond 20 weeks, \n     80 percent were for that he termed ``therapeutic \n     indications''--that is, medical reasons.\n       In documents submitted to the House subcommittee on the \n     Constitution, McMahon provided a list of some of these \n     reasons. He categorized 1,358 abortions he'd performed over \n     the years, all of them done (his testimony suggested) on \n     women at least 24 weeks pregnant.\n       Most of them were for extremely rare genetic defects.\n       The list contained a few slightly more common conditions \n     including anencephaly\n\n[[Page S11149]]\n\n     (lack of a brain) in 29 cases, spina bifida (open spinal \n     column) in 28 cases and congenital heart disease in 31 cases. \n     A few of the conditions on the list, however, are rarely \n     fatal. Cleft lip, cited as the ``indication'' in 9 cases, is \n     surgically correctable after birth, sometimes with permanent \n     disability and sometimes without.\n       The maternal indications in McMahon's list were similarly \n     varied. The severity of the illnesses can't be inferred, \n     although many of the problems he gave are not commonly life-\n     threatening. These included breathlessness on exertion, one \n     case; electrolyte disturbance, one case; diabetes, five \n     cases; and hyperemesis gravidarum (intractable vomiting \n     during pregnancy), six cases. The two most common maternal \n     indications were depression (39 cases) and sexual assault (19 \n     cases).\n       Although the few other doctors who are known to use the \n     intact D method refused to be interviewed, one overseas \n     practitioner would. He is David Grundmann, a 49-year-old \n     physician from Brisbane, Australia, who learned the technique \n     from McMahon about five years ago during a visit to the \n     United States.\n       Grundmann performs abortion up to 22 weeks of gestation \n     and, like McMahon, treats patients who travel great distances \n     for his services. He and his two partners do 60 to 100 intact \n     D cases a year.\n       In an interview last week, he said that in about 15 percent \n     of those cases, there is a severe defect of the fetus.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                           The Women Affected\n\n       It's difficult to say how representative these five doctors \n     are of the rest of the small fraternity of practitioners who \n     perform intact D in the United States. Interviews with \n     physicians who use other abortion techniques--generally \n     dismemberment--may help indirectly illuminate why most late-\n     term abortions, including intact D abortions, are done.\n       Warren Hern, a 57-year-old physician who practices in \n     Boulder, Colo., has a master's degree in public health and a \n     doctorate in anthropology. He is one of the few providers of \n     late-stage abortions who publishes research on the topic in \n     medical journals.\n       Hern performs between 1,500 and 2,000 abortions a year. \n     About 500 are on women 20 to 25 weeks pregnant. Of those, \n     about one-quarter involve abnormal fetuses. He does between \n     10 and 25 abortions each year on women more than 26 weeks \n     pregnant, and all of them involve fetal abnormalities or \n     serious maternal disease, he said.\n       ``It is true that a significant proportion of the community \n     is offended by any abortion after 26 weeks that is not \n     medically indicated,'' he said. ``We practice medicine in a \n     social context. So that is why I will not perform an abortion \n     after 26 weeks just because a woman has decided she does not \n     want to carry the pregnancy to term.''\n       Women seeking an abortion late in pregnancy ``are often \n     young, frequently not married, and many have a child already, \n     or more,'' said Steve Lichtenberg, a obstetrician-\n     gynecologist in Chicago who does abortions up to 22 weeks of \n     development. Many are poor, have not completed school or \n     established themselves in the work force, he said, and are in \n     excellent health.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``The number who volunteer that information is \n     substantially smaller than the number who've actually been \n     subjected to social or sexual violence.''\n       Herbert Wiskind is the administrator of the 19-bed Midtown \n     Hospital in Atlanta, whose four doctors perform about 25 \n     abortions a week on women at least 18 weeks pregnant. In his \n     experience many of the late procedures occur simply because \n     of denial.\n       ``You have a young girl who becomes pregnant, someone 15 or \n     16 years old,'' he said. ``She doesn't know how to tell her \n     parents or her boyfriend. So she puts herself on a diet and \n     tries to deny she's pregnant.''\n       However, Wiskind said, some fetal defects aren't diagnosed \n     until late in pregnancy for unavoidable reasons. \n     Amniocentesis, one technique of fetal genetic screening is \n     done between weeks 15 and 17 of pregnancy. Several weeks can \n     then pass before test results are known, and when they \n     indicate a problem it often takes a woman several more weeks \n     to decide about abortion, he said. In addition, many \n     deformities can only be diagnosed through sonograms and were \n     not apparent until the midpoint of pregnancy or later.\n       Thomas J. Mullin does abortions through the 24th week of \n     gestation, as calculated by sonographic measurement of the \n     fetus's head. He practices in the New York area.\n       Of the procedures Mullin does in weeks 20 through 24, about \n     one-third are for fetal abnormalities, he said. In about 10 \n     percent of cases, the woman has an illness, such as severe \n     diabetes or painful uterine fibroids, that is not necessarily \n     life-threatening but is clearly made worse by pregnancy.\n       ``The remainder of them are just errors,'' he said. ``Many \n     are young patients--12 to 20 years old--who are not in touch \n     with their reproductive system as well as they should be, so \n     they get stuck later than they want in pregnancy. They get \n     surprised, basically.''\n       Jaroslav Hulka, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at \n     the University of North Carolina, supervises a teaching \n     program whose physicians do 250 to 300 abortions a year on \n     women carrying fetuses between 13 and 22 weeks old.\n       ``Ninety-five percent of those are normal--that's fair to \n     say,'' he said. Occasionally, fetuses up to 24 weeks old are \n     aborted if they have a condition incompatible with life. The \n     physicians use the dismemberment technique--an arduous and \n     potentially risky procedure.\n       ``The technique that the Congress is concerned about \n     [intact D] is a level of skill above this,'' Hulka said. \n     ``They are doing what we're all supposed to do--namely, \n     minimize the risk to the patient.''\n       Practitioners of the intact procedure argue that their \n     method is the least traumatic among the many variants of \n     dilation and evacuation abortions used and is not--as their \n     critics claim--the most barbarous. In testimony submitted \n     last year to a congressional subcommittee, the late James \n     McMahon wrote:\n       ``In a desired pregnancy, when the baby is damaged or the \n     mother is at risk, the decision to abort may be \n     intellectually obvious, but emotionally it is always a \n     personal anguish of enormous proportions . . . For the \n     physician who is willing to help the patient in this dilemma, \n     choices are few. Intact D can often be the best among a \n     short list of difficult options. . . . Dealing with the \n     tragic situations that I confront daily makes me constantly \n     aware that I can only limit the hurt by doing gentle surgery \n     and giving sympathetic counsel.''\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. Brown talks about the different reasons--and a lot \nof the reasons given by physicians are reasons that are not medical \nnecessities. Dr. Markman from California, I believe, performed nine \nabortions on third-trimester abortions on babies. The fetal \nabnormality? Cleft palate.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith sums it up best in a letter written October 28, last \nyear, to Charles Canady, who carried this bill over in the House. The \nlast paragraph:\n\n       There are absolutely no obstetrical situations encountered \n     in this country which require a partially delivered human \n     fetus to be destroyed to preserve the health of the mother. \n     Partial birth abortion is a technique devised by abortionists \n     for their own convenience, ignoring the health risks of the \n     mother. The health status of women in this country will \n     thereby only be enhanced by the banning of this procedure.\n\n  I think Mr. Cohen and the doctors I will refer to later have hit the \nnail on the head on what is going on with this whole debate.\n  I came to the floor last year and spoke on this issue. It is the \nfirst time in 6 years as a Senator and Congressman that I had ever \ntaken to the floor of either body and utter the word ``abortion.'' I am \npro-life. I feel very strongly about that. But I have never felt moved \nbefore to stand up and do something about it until I saw this.\n  I thought eventually in this country if we go out, as I have tried to \ndo and talk to people, and try to change hearts by talking to people, \nyoung people, and talk about abortion, talk about how it is a scourge \non our country, and that 1.5 million of these are performed every year \nin this country. It is not a healthy thing for women who have them. It \nis certainly not a healthy thing for our society that so many are done. \nI thought if we just kept vigilant we would see what the President said \nhe would like to see--that abortions are safe, legal, and rare.\n  To me, this bill and the President's veto of this bill showed me that \nthe rhetoric--how appealing it is, that abortions be rare--is just \nrhetoric. You cannot, you cannot, in your heart want abortions to be \nrare and allow this to happen in this country. What are you saying? \nWhat are you saying to those young people who are home from school and \nmaybe made the mistake of plopping on C-SPAN 2 for a few seconds and \nthey hear someone stand up and say you can deliver a baby and you can \nkill it. What are you saying to people who actually have to deal with \nthis issue, saying we can kill, not as Mr. Cohen says, a few weeks old \ninch-long embryo, but a fully formed viable baby, viable baby, inches \naway from that first breath. What kind of a message does that send? \nWhat kind of a country are we?\n  If we knew of a procedure that had dogs delivered and then we \nperformed that procedure on puppies, do you know how many letters from \nanimal rights activists we would be getting now--and some of the very \nsame people who would argue to keep this legal would argue to ban the \nother. What does that say about us?\n  You have the President of the United States who works very hard in \nthe language of his veto message to try to cast the debate in a \ndifferent light, talking about issues that really are not\n\n[[Page S11150]]\n\nsubstantive here. I will read again and again until the cows come home, \n``there is absolutely no obstetrical situation encountered in this \nsituation which requires a partially delivered human fetus to be \ndestroyed to preserve the health of the mother.'' Yet the President \nvetoed it. Why? To preserve the health of the mother. It does not \nhappen that way.\n\n  We try to form the debate around things that people can feel \ncomfortable with. This issue is an issue that a lot of people do not \nfeel comfortable with. We do not like to talk about it. But we have to \ntalk about this because we are defined not by what the President of the \nUnited States would like us to feel comfortable with, not by the \nlanguage that we can hide behind and not think about, but by what goes \non every day in this country.\n  A lot of folks in Washington would like us to be cast in what we say. \nWhat we say is what we really are. I think in our hearts we know what \nwe do is what we really are.\n  I have a lot of faith in the U.S. Senate. I have a lot of faith in \nthe people who sit here and serve here, that they will take that time \nand will gather that evidence and look at the United States of America \nand say in the greatest civilization known to man--will we allow this \nto happen here?\n  I believe, even though all the media reports says we will never \noverride the President's veto here, we are way short--well, we may have \nbeen, but I truly believe that my colleagues will study this issue \nwell, will take all the new information that is available and will look \nat where we are in America and what signal we are going to send to this \ngeneration and future generations of Americans about what we will \nbecome.\n  If this is not wrong, I do not know what wrong is. This is wrong, and \nI believe the U.S. Senate will stand up in the next few days and tell \nthe American public, ``We heard you.'' Tell those babies we understand \nnow we are not going to let this happen any more under our watch.\n  I see the Senator from California is here and I asked her a question. \nI will ask it again because she did not answer it the two times \npreviously when I asked, so I will ask one more time.\n  A partial birth abortion is performed when a baby is delivered feet \nfirst, as the Senator from Ohio described, the baby is delivered feet \nfirst through the birth canal. Everything is delivered--arms, \nshoulders, torso, legs, all delivered outside of the womb, outside of \nthe mother completely except for the head. As nurse Brenda Shafer said, \n``A pair of curved scissors, surgical scissors, are then inserted into \nthe base of the skull and the brains removed.''\n  My question to the Senator from California is, what would her \nposition be if, when the shoulders were delivered, that accidentally \nthe head was also delivered; would the woman and her doctor--and I hear \nso often it is the woman and her doctor's right to choose--would the \nwoman and the doctor in that situation where the head is delivered and \nthe baby is completely outside of the womb, would the doctor be \npermitted, then, to kill the baby?\n  I will be happy, then, to yield the floor and await her answer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Florida is here to \ntalk on another matter. Could I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 10 minutes, immediately followed by the Senator from \nFlorida for 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Reserving the right to object, I would like to inquire as \nto the amount of time we have remaining. My understanding is we will go \nto a vote at 5 o'clock.\n  Is that our cutoff time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator, if you would like me to add the \nSenator, following Senator Graham, I am delighted.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. I do not think I will object. I want to see where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). We were scheduled to resume the \npending business at 4:30, with half an hour of debate and then a series \nof votes at 5 o'clock.\n  Granting the Senator's request would delay those times.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will withhold we will see what the \nsituation is. We will be happy to accommodate the Senator from Florida \nif we can.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I renew my request. The Senator spoke for 20 minutes. I \nwould like to speak for 10 minutes. I would be happy to make as part of \nthat request that the Senator from Ohio follow.\n  Is the Senator objecting to my getting 10 minutes?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We are scheduled to go to debate on the bill and votes \nat 5 o'clock. This unanimous consent would push that back, and because \nMembers are scheduled later this evening, they do not want to do \nthat. That is the problem.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. In trying to accommodate everybody, it seems to me--it is \n20 after 4. We go to the bill at 4:30. Then I would ask for the normal \n5 minutes to see where we go.\n  I am going to try this, Mr. President: That we delay going to the \nbill by 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The reason I have been rather insistent is that for many \nhours today my name has been mentioned on the floor perhaps not \ndirectly but ``the Senator from California.'' And every time I go back \nto do business with being ``the Senator from California'' I hear \nanother misstatement on the floor and the repeated question about how I \nfeel about perfectly healthy babies and a perfectly healthy birth being \naborted.\n  Not one United States Senator who is pro-choice believes that there \nshould be an abortion allowed on a perfectly healthy pregnancy in the \nlate term. I repeat that again. It is my position certainly in the late \nterm--this is in concert with Roe v. Wade--that these abortions not \nhappen on a healthy baby. And I want to say to my friend when he keeps \nposing that, he has never given birth. I have had the honor and the \nprivilege to do so twice. One of my babies was born in a breach \nfashion.\n  So when the Senator asks me how I feel about that, I get a little \nupset because the way I felt about that at the time was God help me \nhave a healthy baby. And she was premature, and I prayed every minute \nof the way.\n  So I do not want anyone to come to this Senate floor--and I ask you, \nI plead with you, not to do this anymore--and talk about ``the Senator \nfrom California's position.''\n  I am a grandmother. It is the greatest thing that has ever happened \nto my husband and myself. I prayed for healthy babies, and, no, I do \nnot support the abortion of a healthy pregnancy--not one Senator does--\ndespite the fact that my colleague makes it sound as if we do.\n\n  We could walk hand in hand down this aisle of the U.S. Senate and \npass a bill in 60 seconds that outlawed this procedure except for life \nof the mother and serious adverse health impact. We could be together. \nBut instead we have to face a debate that no doubt will show up on 30-\nsecond commercials.\n  I know that my colleague referred to the President as Mr. Clinton. \nMr. Clinton met with mothers who have this procedure. He said, ``Why \ndidn't he meet with other people on the other side?'' He has talked \nabout this issue. He has looked at this issue. He has come to the \nconclusion that he would definitely sign a bill that made that life and \nhealth exception.\n  I quote from his letter.\n\n       I urge that you vote to uphold my veto of H.R. 1833. My \n     views on this legislation have been widely misrepresented.\n\n  And I might say to the President, they are being misrepresented as we \nspeak by Members on the other side of this issue.\n  He says:\n\n       I am against late-term abortions, and have long opposed \n     them except where necessary to protect the life or health of \n     the mother. As Governor of Arkansas, I signed into law a bill \n     that barred third-trimester abortions with an appropriate \n     exception for life and health. And I would sign a bill to do \n     the same thing at the Federal level, if it was presented to \n     me.\n\n  So here you have a President who has indicated that he would sign a \nbill outlawing this procedure with an exception for life and health. \nBut no. The other side does not want that. They would rather come down \nand demagog the issue.\n  If I might say, I hear about Mr. Cohen's article. Good for Mr. \nCohen. \n\n[[Page S11151]]\n\nHe has taken a lot of different positions on a lot of subjects.\n  How about listening to the women who have gone through this like \nMaureen? Maureen is a 30-year-old Catholic mother of two, and lives in \nMassachusetts. On February 17, 1994 Maureen and her husband were \njoyously awaiting birth of their second child. On that date when she \nwas 5 months pregnant a sonogram determined that her daughter had no \nbrain and was nonviable. Her doctor recommended termination of the \npregnancy.\n  On February 18, 1994, a third-degree sonogram at New England Medical \nCenter in Boston confirmed the diagnosis that the baby had no brain and \nwas nonviable.\n  Maureen and her family sought counsel from their parish priest, \nFather Greg, who supported the decision to terminate the pregnancy.\n  Mr. President, may I have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Maureen found out that her baby had no brain. She is a \npracticing Catholic, and she went to her priest, Father Greg. On the \nrecord he supported her decision to terminate the pregnancy.\n  They named their daughter Dahlia. She had a Catholic funeral and is \nburied at Otis Air Force Base in Cape Cod, MA.\n  And Senators in this Chamber want to insert themselves into that \nfamily, insert themselves into the dialog between her priest, her God, \nand her family?\n  President Clinton will sign a bill that outlaws this procedure with \nan exemption for life and health. Throughout this debate I will bring \nup example after example.\n  And I urge my colleagues. This is not about 30-second commercials. \nThis is about the life of women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We will continue this debate, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Is it time now to go to the bill at hand?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, it would be time to \ngo to the bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes, \nand I would be happy to share that time, half and half.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If there is no objection, I save my 2\\1/2\\ minutes until \nafter the Senator is finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator from California makes a \npoint--again, it is a good one--that the President will sign the bill \nwith the exception for the life and health of the mother. That is what \nthe President said.\n  I have two amendments. One, the health of the mother exception has \nbeen consistently held even though it has been narrowly drawn by many \nState legislatures, the health of the mother exception has been \ninterpreted by courts unanimously as being anything--financial health \nis the health of mother; social interaction, health of the mother; her \nage, health of the mother; maturity; emotional health; mental health; \nphysical health. Yes. It is a limitation without limit. It is no \nlimitation at all. And the Senator from California knows that. More \nimportantly, the President of the United States knows that very well.\n  It is all how to frame the issue. It makes a lot of people feel \ncomfortable that the President really does want to limit these things. \nIt is only these serious health consequences, and that is reasonable \nuntil you understand that health consequences is not a limit on the \nprocedure. It is not a limit on the procedure.\n  So to make a limitation that does not have a limit is just what I \ndescribed before which is someone who wants to be judged by what they \nsay to you that sounds so nice instead of what the reality of what \ntheir words would be which means partial-birth abortions would continue \nto go on in this country without limitation if we passed a bill that \nhad a health limitation. That is not Rick Santorum, the Senator from \nPennsylvania speaking. That is court after court after court after \ncourt interpreting language that you would believe would be rock solid. \nBut with the judges it is not. So I would just say go ahead and \ncontinue to use it, as I am sure you will--that we could agree on this \nrhetoric. But I can guarantee you we cannot agree on this rhetoric. We \ncannot agree on a limitation that is a phony limitation; to a procedure \nthat is infanticide and nothing more.\n  The second thing I would say is you have doctor after doctor who has \nwritten to us and said that this procedure is never medically necessary \nto save the life or health of the mother.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, once more I want to put on the table what the Members \nof the U.S. Senate could agree to at any moment. We would say this \nprocedure cannot be used unless the woman's life is at stake because \nthere is no true life exception in this extreme bill before us, or to \nspare her serious adverse health consequences.\n  And let me just say to my colleague in all due respect--and as \ncollegial as I can be in the moment here--if you are suggesting that \nanyone in this U.S. Senate is talking about financial health of the \nwoman, let me just say it is an absolute outrage if you would think \nthat is what we are talking about. We are talking about infertility for \nlife. We are talking about paralysis. We are talking about bleeding to \ndeath.\n  Vikki Stella, mother of two, was in the third trimester of her \npregnancy when she discovered her son was diagnosed with nine major \nanomalies, including a fluid-filled cranium with no brain tissue at \nall, compacted flattened vertebrae, and skeletal dysplasia. The doctor \ntold her the baby would never live outside the womb. She said, ``The \nonly option that would assure that my daughters would not grow up \nwithout a mother was a highly specialized, surgical abortion procedure \ndeveloped for women with similar difficult conditions. Though we were \ndistraught over losing our son, we knew the procedure was the right \noption . . . and as promised, the surgery preserved my fertility. Our \ndarling son Nicholas was born in December 1995.''\n  Senators in this Chamber would stand up to this woman and tell her, \n``Too bad, even though your doctor said it was necessary to have this \nprocedure so you could have another child; too bad.''\n  You know, I will tell you something. For people who say they want to \nget Government out of the lives of the people, this is extraordinary to \nme. Let us leave these tragic situations to the mother, to the father, \nto the doctor, to the priest, to the rabbi, to God. Let us think \nseriously. If it was your wife, if it was your daughter, and the doctor \nlooked in your eye and said, ``Your wife might die if I do not use this \nprocedure,'' at that moment would you want him or her to use the \nprocedure that would save that life?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11144-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11151-S11158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MARITIME SECURITY ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5396 to Amendment No. 5393\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have been generally supportive of the \npractice of shipping a certain percentage of our U.S. foreign food \nassistance on U.S.-flag ships. I have in the past supported amendments \ndesigned to reform that program to ensure the costs of using the U.S.-\nflag ships are reasonable. But I have not been supportive of proposals \nthat would essentially kill the policy of using U.S.-flag vessels, \nbecause I believe that U.S. maritime fleet ships are important to our \nnational defense.\n  I also believe that when we are providing largess to other countries, \nwe should do all that we can to also support U.S. jobs and U.S. \nindustries. After all, we make sure that U.S. farm commodities are used \nin these food shipments. We do not go to other countries to buy the \nfood to give it away. We use our own farm commodities. As long as costs \nare fair and reasonable, I believe we ought to use U.S. ships to haul a \nshare of this aid.\n  My colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, says that I may be \nundercutting his efforts at reform. But my amendment is the only way to \nhave real reform. What my amendment would do, is take any higher costs \ninvolved in using U.S.-flag ships out of USDA entirely and put it in \nthe Department of Transportation.\n  Senator Grassley's amendment would essentially kill our U.S. maritime \nindustry by sending shipping business to foreign-flag vessels. If, for \nexample, a foreign ship would haul cargo for $18 a ton, Senator \nGrassley's amendment would give that business to a foreign-flag vessel \nif the U.S. ship was going to charge any more than $19.08 a ton. Is \nthat the price at which we will sell out our U.S. maritime industry, \nwhich is so important to military sealift and military security, $1.08 \na ton?\n  Or, if you are using container ships, if the lowest acceptable \nforeign rate, just to take a hypothetical example, is $1,000 a \ncontainer, Senator Grassley's amendment would cut out U.S. ships if \ntheir rate is any higher than $1,060 a container. So for $60 a \ncontainer we would give all that business to a foreign country.\n  I do believe, however, that supporting our U.S. merchant marine is \nproperly a transportation function, rather than an agricultural or food \naid function. Any higher costs of using U.S.-flag ships should not come \nout of the food aid budget but should, instead, come out of the \nDepartment of Transportation budget.\n  I will also point out that the amendment of my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, would still have any higher costs of U.S. ships coming from \nthe agricultural food aid budget. I do not think that is right. I do \nnot think that is real reform.\n  Let us be clear, there have been some gross exaggerations about the \nhigher costs of U.S.-flag ships. But I admit freely there are some \nhigher costs involved, because those U.S. ships must comply with more \nstringent environmental and safety regulations and because the people \nwho work on them are U.S. citizens and they pay U.S. taxes. Those \npeople who work on those ships pay Federal and State and local taxes. \nThey have homes here in communities in our country. They pay property \ntaxes. They support their local schools.\n  If you take the money paid for shipping food aid and give it to a \nforeign-flag vessel and to foreigners operating on those ships, they do \nnot pay any taxes here, they do not support our local schools, they do \nnot raise their kids in America.\n  All in all, the U.S. maritime industry runs a more responsible \noperation than flag-of-convenience operators that may sail under the \nflag of a foreign country with very lax standards. So our costs of \noperation are understandably higher.\n  In any event, then, there are some higher costs in using U.S.-flag \nships. This is called the ocean freight differential. To the extent \nthat USDA pays for this differential, there is some reduction in the \namount of food aid that can be shipped. That is what I want to change. \nMy amendment would simply shift all of any added costs of using U.S.-\nflag ships to the Department of Transportation. There is clear \nprecedent for my amendment. In fact, it would build on a partial shift \nof cargo preference costs to the DOT that we began in 1985.\n  Prior to the 1985 farm bill, 50 percent of U.S.-sponsored food \nshipments were required to be transported on U.S.-flag ships. There was \na court decision that held that this requirement applied to commercial \nsales as well as to food aid. So a compromise was reached in the 1985 \nfarm bill under which 75 percent of food aid--that is the donations and \nconcessional sales of food that we give to people overseas--would be \ntransported on U.S.-flag ships, but that commercial agricultural \nexports would be totally exempt from any cargo preference requirement, \neven if those sales were supported by U.S. export subsidies or \nassistance. So, today, less than 2 percent of our total agricultural \nexports are required to be transported on U.S.-flag ships. No \ncommercial sales are under the requirement at all.\n  Part of that compromise that we reached in 1985 was that the \nDepartment of Transportation would reimburse the Department of \nAgriculture, for any increase in food aid shipping costs caused by that \nchange in the cargo preference requirement from 50 percent to 75 \npercent. So, already the Department of Transportation covers a portion \nof any higher charges for shipping food aid on U.S.-flag vessels.\n  What my amendment would do is shift all cargo preference cost over. \nThe Department of Transportation would reimburse the Department of \nAgriculture for all food aid shipping charges to the extent they exceed \nprevailing world shipping rates. My amendment employs the same \nreimbursement mechanism now used by the Department of Transportation to \nreimburse the Department of Agriculture for a portion of those costs. \nSo my amendment will put the costs of supporting our U.S.-flag merchant \nmarine--which I believe is vitally important to this country--where it \nbelongs, in the Department of Transportation, not the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  As I said, I have always believed, and still do, that it is important \nto support our U.S.-flag merchant marine as a matter of national \nsecurity. Also, because shipping is an important basic U.S. industry, \nwith U.S. jobs at stake, employing U.S. citizens, people who work and \nraise their families here and pay their taxes in this country, I \nbelieve it is important to have a U.S. merchant fleet.\n  We cannot afford to send any more U.S. jobs out of this country. The \nGrassley amendment would do that. It would turn over everything to \nforeign vessels flying a flag of convenience. But that support, I say, \nthat we should provide for our U.S. merchant marine should not diminish \nthe quantity of agricultural commodities that USDA can ship as food \naid. If we are going to give food to hungry people and starving people \naround the world--which we ought\n\n[[Page S11153]]\n\nto do--to the extent that it costs us more to ship it on U.S.-flag \nvessels, that money should not come out of the food aid budget, it \nought to come out of our transportation budget.\n  I tried to offer this amendment several years ago, in 1990. It was \ntabled. Again, I recall my colleague from Iowa moved to table the \nunderlying amendment and brought down that amendment, too. \nUnfortunately, the debate over cargo preference has pitted agricultural \ninterests against maritime interests. That is too bad. In order to meet \nthe stiff challenges from overseas competition in the trade arena, we \nneed more cooperation, not antagonism among our basic American \nindustries.\n  I am proud to represent an agricultural State. I am proud of how much \nwe sell overseas. I am also proud of how much food the citizens of Iowa \ndonate every year abroad. I am also proud of the men and women who go \nto sea in ships. Perhaps it is because of my military background. Maybe \nit is because I spent so much time in the Navy. But I know what a \nlonesome life it can be, and I know how hard they work, and I know how \nthey sacrifice and give up a lot of time from their families. I also \nknow when our country calls on that merchant fleet to ship military \ncargoes to a foreign country, in dangerous waters, they must respond.\n\n  Now, if it is a foreign-flag vessel, we cannot call on it to sail \ninto dangerous areas for military purposes. They can simply say no, we \nare not going to ship your cargo because we believe it is too \ndangerous. So that is why I maintain my strong support for a strong \nU.S.-flag merchant fleet. And I believe as deeply as I believe anything \nthat the funding to support our U.S.-flag merchant fleet should come \nout of the transportation budget, and I will continue to fight for \nthat.\n  That is all my amendment does. Again, I hope that we don't have to \nhave this antagonism between agriculture and the maritime industry. It \nshouldn't be there. We ought to be working together. We ought to be \nworking together for the benefit of more jobs in the U.S., for the \nbenefit of a stronger agriculture in the U.S. and, yes, working \ntogether to make sure that out of our generosity we give the maximum \namount of food aid that we can give to starving people around the \nworld.\n  I believe my amendment will resolve a nettlesome issue that has \nfostered conflict between agriculture and the maritime industry for a \nlong time. My amendment will allow USDA to ship more food aid and to \npurchase more farm commodities for that purpose. And, yes, it will \nsupport a strong maritime industry. I urge my colleagues to support my \namendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The senior Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, everyday, millions of Americans get up, they have \ntheir breakfast, they pack their lunches, they send their kids off to \nschool. In many households, over a majority, both spouses work. These \nare the forgotten Americans, the people who go to work every day. They \nare working harder and harder and taking home less and less money. \nNobody is talking on this bill about that portion of America. That is \nthe America we should be concerned about.\n  So I use that to remind all of my colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats, that we are about to vote to create a new subsidy program, a \ncorporate welfare subsidy program. I say to my Democratic colleagues--\nall of them--how many times do I hear you say that we should end \ncorporate welfare? This is an opportunity to do that, by not voting for \nthis bill and creating a new welfare program.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues who, in the tax bill last year, \nthought it was so necessary to respond to the people's will to \neliminate corporate welfare, that we had in our tax bill probably $25 \nbillion of reduction in corporate welfare that is done through the Tax \nCode of the United States.\n  So I say to my Republican colleagues, you have an opportunity to have \none less corporate welfare program on the books by not voting for this \nbill.\n  In the meantime, we have some amendments. We are about to cast votes \non two of them that I have sponsored and one that Senator Harkin \nsponsors, a second-degree amendment, and I strongly oppose his \namendment.\n  In a few short minutes, I am going to attempt to help my colleagues \nseparate fact from fiction. What I share with my colleagues is not just \nmy opinion. It is either backed by independent sources or is the \nlearned conclusion of those who have spent a great deal of time \nstudying the questions of maritime subsidies.\n  First, let me direct the attention of my colleagues to two lead \neditorials that were included in today's Wall Street Journal on the one \nhand and today's Journal of Commerce on the other, and I placed copies \non your desks. Both the Wall Street Journal and the Journal of Commerce \nexpressed strong opposition to the subsidy bill before the Senate. \nRemember, these are opinions of journals that are the voices of \nbusiness and transportation. They oppose this corporate welfare \nproposal.\n  My colleagues should also know that the Citizens for a Sound Economy, \na grassroots organization representing hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans, are key voting my fair and reasonable rate amendment and my \nantilobbying amendment. Those key votes are used for their Jefferson \naward.\n  We also have Citizens Against Government Waste backing my amendments \nand key voting those as well.\n  We have the National Taxpayers Union using these amendments for their \nannual vote analysis.\n\n  These groups, as well as Americans for Tax Reform, all oppose this \nunderlying legislation, which is a $1 billion corporate welfare subsidy \nbill.\n  Does our national defense, as is purported by the managers of this \nbill, depend upon the 47 U.S.-flag vessels that are asking for a $100 \nmillion subsidy per year? A former Bush administration official, \nAssistant Secretary of Defense Colin McMillan, said the answer to that \nquestion is ``No.'' He said that the issue of U.S. carriers reflagging \nis not a national security issue and, therefore, should be viewed in \nterms of economics. That is an Assistant Secretary in the last \nRepublican administration.\n  Then on the other side of the aisle, most recently Cabinet heads in \nthe Clinton administration studied this issue and made recommendations \nto the President on whether or not to continue subsidies. Every Senator \nhad in his office last week a copy of the Rubin memo to President \nClinton. Again, these are conclusions based upon President Clinton's \nCabinet officials, their conclusions by Democratic officials, and they \nare not my conclusions. They said it amounts to a jobs bill to pay for \nhigh-price seafarers. Those are the conclusions from that memo.\n  Mr. President, as I stated last week, a number of retired admirals \nwho earlier lent their names to an American Security Council letter \nendorsing this legislation--now that they have the benefit of the \nRubin-Clinton memo--support my amendments to this bill and, in fact, \nbelieve further hearings should have been held before we pass such \nlegislation. Again, those are retired admirals, not this Senator from \nIowa.\n  To my colleague from Iowa, for his amendment and my opinion on that \namendment--I suppose I gave that opinion last week, but I owe it to my \ncolleague to state here now for a short period of time, my position.\n  My colleague from Iowa said that he doesn't want to sell out our \nmerchant marines. Nobody wants to do that, but I think there is a \nbigger issue here, and that bigger issue is whether or not, with this \ncorporate welfare subsidy, we will be in the process of selling out the \ntaxpayers.\n  Our No. 1 responsibility is to the taxpayers of America. If my \ncolleague from Iowa succeeds in substituting his amendment for mine, \nall that will be accomplished is that taxpayers will continue to get \nripped off so maritime union welfare and corporate welfare will \ncontinue to be shoveled out with no restraint. And farmers, who are \ntaxpayers as well, will not be able to ship one extra bushel of food \noverseas.\n  Taxpayers get ripped off either way. They get ripped off if the \nAgriculture\n\n[[Page S11154]]\n\nDepartment pays for cargo preference or if the Transportation \nDepartment pays for it. The end result is the same. So I strongly \noppose his amendment.\n  Mr. President, why do we need to adopt, then, my amendment that calls \nfor a fair and reasonable compensation? Fair and reasonable. Who can \nargue with that?\n  That supposedly is the rationale now for all of these rates, but the \nbottom line of it is that the maritime industry defines what is fair \nand reasonable. If we don't adopt this amendment, then these subsidized \ncarriers will collect $100 million per year from this bill and then \nroutinely gouge taxpayers to the tune of $600 million per year.\n  This figure of $600 million per year is established by the Federal \nagencies and by the Office of Management and Budget. It is reported \nevery year in the President's budget, and I placed a copy of this \ninformation in last Friday's Record.\n  Again, $600 million in backdoor cargo preference subsidies is not \nChuck Grassley's estimate, it is the actual figures provided by the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  If we protect taxpayers from price gouging under Buy America laws, \nthen why shouldn't we do likewise under cargo preference laws?\n  So my amendment then, does that. It takes the Buy America market test \nof 6 percent and, like Buy America, says that if a Government agency is \ncharged by a U.S.-flag carrier more than 6 percent what the market \nbears or, in other words, what a foreign flag might offer, then that \nagency can hire the foreign flag.\n\n  For years, we have been assured that taxpayers are protected by \nexisting law that states a bid has to be a fair and reasonable rate, \nbut Congress never defined this term and, instead, left it to the \nMaritime Administration, which cares not for the taxpayers.\n  If you can have the U.S. flags charge 400 percent over a foreign flag \nbid, the Maritime Administration may state that this is a fair and \nreasonable bid and that agency has to accept that bid. It has happened.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator has used the original \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time does the Senator from Colorado want?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would like at least 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield myself 1 minute, and then when I sit down, \nI will yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I remind everybody who says that this is \nnecessary for our national defense, to remember that U.S. News & World \nReport article in 1990 entitled ``Unpatriotic Profits.'' It reported \nhow the Navy was being forced to pay U.S.-flag carriers $70,000 to ship \nwhat could have gone on foreign flags for just $6,000.\n  This was during the Persian Gulf war. It was because our cargo \npreference laws are out of control. My amendment will take care of \nthis.\n  If my amendment does not pass, we will see the same abuses the next \nwar that we face. Nothing in this bill defines fair and reasonable \nrates. My amendment does define what is fair and reasonable in the very \nsame way we have defined it in the Buy America. I yield the rest of my \ntime to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I hope Members, as they vote on this \nmeasure, will keep a couple of things in mind that I think are \ncritical. One is this measure does not attempt to do away with the buy-\nAmerica preferences that have existed in the law. It keeps those. What \nit does do, Mr. President, is define what fair and reasonable is.\n  In the past, literally, the Department of Transportation has looked \nat rates that have been 100 percent, 200 percent, 300 percent, 400 \npercent above what is available on the market and called those \nreasonable and fair. Mr. President, that is simply ludicrous. Charging \ndouble or triple what your competitor charges is not reasonable and \nfair. We do not kid anyone when we allow that sort of thing to go \nahead. It is a scandal on the American taxpayers to have them stuck for \ntwo and three and four times as much what reasonable rates are.\n  The second point I hope Members will look at is this: One of the good \narguments that have been made for those who defend the existing system \nis that, on occasion, what they are comparing is apples and oranges; \nthat is, the higher rates that have been talked about at times--not \nalways, but at times--sometimes have been in circumstances where you \ncould not unload the cargo and it was not an apples-to-apples \ncomparison.\n  The Grassley amendment, very importantly, is defined in such a way so \nthat it allows the Secretary to take into consideration those other \nconditions that may exist. In other words, the Grassley amendment is an \napples-to-apples comparison. It is a fair comparison. It is not an \nunreasonable comparison. It meets directly the arguments in opposition \nthat the opponents of these measures in the past have made.\n  Mr. President, I simply close with this thought. How can we say to \nthe taxpayers of this country that we are looking out for their \ninterests when we allow them to get stuck for two and three times as \nmuch as what the real rate is on these kinds of cargoes? I yield the \nfloor, Mr. President, and urge the adoption of the Grassley amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes forty-eight seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Four minutes forty-eight seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, I would just point out under the \namendment of my colleague from Iowa, money that would go to pay for the \nocean freight differential would still come out of the Agriculture \nbudget, out of food aid. That is what I am basically opposed to, having \nit come out of Agriculture. It is a 6-percent limitation that my \ncolleague has in his amendment, but any higher costs of U.S.-flag ships \nwould still come out of Agriculture. I do not think it ought to. I \nthink the money for the ocean freight differential ought to come out of \nthe Department of Transportation. That is what my amendment does.\n  Again, I hear all of these comparisons of shipping rates. My friend \nfrom Colorado, and of course my esteemed colleague from Iowa, have all \nthese comparisons, but these are based on artificially low foreign \nrates subsidized by foreign governments, or rates for ships that \noperate without having to comply with the operating standards that \napply to U.S.-flag vessels. So these kinds of comparisons may seem \nappealing, but they do not reflect a fair or accurate representation of \nthe factors involved in the rates charged by U.S. ships.\n  For example, our people are paid higher wages, our ships have to \nfollow stronger and stricter environmental standards and our ships have \nto meet stricter working conditions and occupational health and safety \nrequirements. None of these considerations is taken into account by the \namendment of my colleague from Iowa. I keep pointing out that workers \non U.S.-flag ships, U.S. citizens, pay Federal, State and local taxes. \nIn fact, I am informed that existing Federal and State income tax \nrequirements alone nearly double the cost of U.S.-citizen crews to \nU.S.-flag operators. Well, where do they pay those taxes? They pay \nthose taxes here in America.\n  Mr. President, let me also point out that there currently are \nlimitations in place on the rates that U.S.-flag vessels may charge for \nhauling cargo preference shipments. For non-defense cargoes, for \nexample, by law preference is given to U.S.-flag vessels only when such \nvessels are available at ``fair and reasonable rates,'' which are \ndetermined by an OMB-approved method based on detailed cost information \nsubmitted by American flagship operators. If U.S.-flag vessels are not \navailable at fair and reasonable rates, they are not awarded the cargo, \nand foreign vessels may be used.\n  In summary, I again point out that what my amendment seeks to do is \nto shift any higher costs of using U.S.-flag ships out of Agriculture \nto the Department of Transportation where it rightly belongs. I do, \nhowever, strongly support keeping U.S. jobs here in this\n\n[[Page S11155]]\n\ncountry. I strongly support making sure that we support a maritime \nindustry in this country and make sure it is there for us when we need \nit in periods of national emergency. I ask support for my amendment to \nshift those costs to DOT. I yield the floor and the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa yield back his \ntime?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute twenty-three seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 1 minute \nnow reserved for the Senator from Hawaii and 1 minute for the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in June 1992 the Journal of Commerce had \nan editorial in support of this program, this bill. In March 1994, a \nmuch stronger editorial was found in the Journal of Commerce supporting \nthis measure before us. In 1995, the Journal of Commerce was purchased \nby the Economist, a British publication, and now in 1996 we find that \nthe Journal of Commerce is opposed to this measure before us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated May 2, \n1996, from Assistant Secretary of the Navy John W. Douglass supporting \nthis measure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         The Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Research Development \n           and Acquisition,\n                                       Washington DC, May 2, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Seapower Subcommittee, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: During the recent Senate Armed Services \n     Committee Seapower Subcommittee hearing on Navy Surface Ship \n     Programs, you requested a review from the Navy on the pending \n     Maritime Reform and Security Act legislation. I have reviewed \n     this bill, and strongly support the establishment of an \n     active fleet of militarily useful, privately owned, U.S.-\n     flagged vessels for our nation's defense, and provisions that \n     strengthen our vital U.S. maritime industrial base and \n     Merchant Marine.\n       This bill is important in helping the U.S. maintain a \n     strong and responsive defense posture. Through the Emergency \n     Preparedness Program, the Navy will have access to vessels \n     during times of war or national emergency thereby enhancing \n     the readiness of our seagoing forces.\n       I also view the Maritime Reform and Security Act as \n     important legislation in supporting U.S. shipbuilders. First, \n     the bill's preference for including U.S.-built ships and the \n     requirement to notify U.S. shipbuilders of the intent to \n     contract for new construction work should help to promote the \n     stability of shipbuilders supporting the Navy. Second, the \n     vessel eligibility provision setting limits on the age of \n     vessels in the fleet will contribute to new construction \n     orders and maintain a younger, safer fleet. Third, the bill's \n     provisions that facilitate use of Title XI loan guarantees is \n     also important to U.S. shipbuilders.\n       It is paramount that U.S. shipbuilders capture a share of \n     the world shipbuilding market to help sustain the viability \n     of this important industry for the Navy's future and to \n     benefit the Navy by reducing new construction costs. The \n     success of U.S. shipbuilders in commercial markets is \n     inextricably linked to programs such as Title XI.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to provide you with comments \n     on this imporant maritime legislation. A similar letter has \n     been sent, as a courtesy, to Senator Pressler, Chairman of \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. As \n     always, if I can be of any further assistance, please let me \n     know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John W. Douglass.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that a letter \ndated April 9, 1996, from Deputy Secretary of Defense John White, \nsupporting this measure be printed in the Record, along with a letter \nfrom the Secretary of Transportation, the Hon. Federico Pena, \nsupporting this measure.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I understand that the Senate may \n     consider H.R. 1350, the Maritime Security Act, in the very \n     near future. I want to dispel any questions or concerns about \n     the position of the Department of Defense with respect to \n     this legislation. The Department of Defense supports fully \n     H.R. 1350. the establishment of a Maritime Security Force, \n     particularly, will greatly enhance the maintenance of an \n     adequate sealift capability.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment.\n           Sincerely,\n     John White.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              The Secretary of Transportation,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inouye: At your request, I am writing to \n     present the Administration views on Senator Charles E. \n     Grassley's amendments to H.R. 1350, the Maritime Security Act \n     of 1995. The Administration strongly supports Senate passage \n     of H.R. 1350 without amendment when the Senate votes on this \n     bill on September 24, 1996. Early enactment of this \n     legislation is important to national security. The \n     Administration takes no position on the merits of these \n     amendments at this time.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection, from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program, to the submission of this report.\n           Sincerely,\n     Federico Pena.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, although the Harkin measure has much \nmerit, I must advise my colleagues that we have not had a hearing on \nthis measure. If that amendment is made part of the bill, I feel that \nat this lateness it might be the death knell of the measure. So I move \nto table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alaska yield his time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. I was asking for the yeas and nays on the motion of \nthe Senator from Hawaii to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A motion to table is not debatable. It is not \nin order at this point until the Senator from Alaska has used or \nyielded his time. The motion to table is not in order until the Senator \nfrom Alaska has used or yielded his time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That was not the understanding at the time we were going \nto make it. We are going to have one vote on Senator Harkin's amendment \nand then a separate vote on this one. We were going to make the motion \nto table and vote. However the Chair wishes to do it--go back and read \nthe Record--that is not the understanding. In any event, I will take my \nminute on the Grassley amendment, not the Harkin amendment, so we \nunderstand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This amendment would affect the rates for carriers of \nall Government cargoes, not just the rates set for cargo preference on \nagricultural cargoes. I remind my friends from Iowa, both of them, that \nwe put $10 billion into agricultural subsidies a year. We are talking \nabout here in this bill reducing the cost of keeping this merchant \nmarine available for our Department of Defense from $200 million a year \nto $100 million. For 10 years we will get it to $100 million.\n  Senator Grassley's plan is unnecessary. Existing law already allows \nthe military use of foreign-flag vessels if the U.S. carriers' rates \nare excessive or otherwise unreasonable or if they are higher than the \ncharges for transporting like goods for private persons.\n  In terms of cargo preference, the law already provides the rates must \nbe fair and reasonable for cargo preference. As I stated Friday, this \namendment will result in the loss of the majority of the U.S.-flag \nfleet. We need that for national defense.\n  I point out that during the Persian Gulf war, the charge for the \nforeign ships averaged $174 per short ton and for the domestic fleet it \naveraged $122 per short ton. We are preserving a merchant marine fleet \nfor our defense purposes.\n  I move to table the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to table the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, to say that the senior Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Simon, has influenced us all is an understatement. \nOur dress today is a recognition of his influence on all of us and our \ngreat admiration for him personally.\n  I would like to announce that following the vote many of us will \nparticipate in a tribute to Senator Simon. I invite all of our \ncolleagues to join Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Mack, and many of us \nin that tribute. We will not do it now. We will do it later. In the \nmeantime, we will all enjoy wearing these great bow ties.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendments being \noffered by Senator Grassley and to express my concerns about this bill. \nMembers of the 104th Congress have tried their best to eliminate pork-\nbarrel spending and corporate welfare. I believe we have made some \nprogress, but clearly, as this bill demonstrates, we have a long way to \ngo.\n  I support the amendments offered by my colleague from Iowa because \nthis bill is nothing more than a taxpayer subsidy. It authorizes $100 \nmillion per year for the maritime fleet to provide sealift capacity in \ntimes of national emergency. Each vessel in the program would receive \n$2.1 million per year for being enrolled in the program. This does not \ninclude the additional moneys that may be paid in times of war. The CBO \nestimates that the program will cost $782 million in the first 5 years, \nincluding expenditures for the phasing out of the old system.\n  The bill has several problems. First, it does not allow the United \nStates to requisition subsidized U.S. ships in a national emergency. It \nwould allow U.S. flag-carriers to protect specific vessels from \nshipping materials to a war zone. If commercial interests determine \nwhich vessels go and when, we should pay them on an as-needed basis. We \nshouldn't pay for a benefit we don't receive.\n  Second, the bill does not require those seafarers who are in the \nMaritime-Security fleet to serve when called. During the Persian Gulf \nwar, our country had to draw from a pool of retired merchant mariners \nto care for our fleet. That is wrong and it should be changed.\n  Under this program, merchant mariners can earn more money than their \nmilitary counterparts for war-time pay. The bill should be corrected to \nmake merchant-mariners bonuses commensurate with those of the Army, \nNavy, Air Force, and Marines. I have been told of one merchant mariner \nwho was paid thousands of dollars for a few months worth of service \nduring the Persian Gulf war. Most enlisted military officers received \nfar less than that.\n  Finally, the bill must require those carriers who receive a taxpayer \nsubsidy to carry war materials into the war zone. The maritime fleet \nmust not be allowed to drop off war materials to commercially \nconvenient spots. If the taxpayers are paying for this service, then it \nis our duty to ensure that they receive what they are paying for.\n  Mr. President, the defects of the bill are not figments of the \nimagination conjured up by a few budget hawks. The Vice President's \nNational Performance Review recommended that all maritime subsidies be \nended for a savings of $23 billion over a 10-year period. The \nDepartment of Transportation's inspector general concluded that the \nentire Maritime Administration and all of its U.S.-flag subsidies \nshould be terminated. The Office of Management and Budget estimates \nthat international cargo preference laws will cost Federal Government \nagencies an additional $600 million in fiscal year 1996. A November \n1994 GAO report said that cargo-preference policies support at most \n6,000 of the 21,000 mariners in the U.S. merchant marine industry. That \nis an annual cost of $100,000 per seafarer--at taxpayer expense. \nAdditionally, Citizens Against Government Waste, the National Taxpayers \nUnion, and Americans for Tax Reform are opposed to the bill.\n  The Federal debt is more that $5 trillion. Five years ago, the debt \nwas $3.6 trillion. Clearly, Government spending is out of control and \nCongress must place priorities in the way it spends taxpayer dollars. \nMost families live under a budget. Most have a limited amount of \nresources that they must spend on food, clothing, shelter, and the \nlike. And many families have little left over for the extras in life. \nThey don't spend for every whim because they know that they must stay \nwithin their means. Why can't Congress do the same? Why can't Congress \nspend the people's money on core tasks only. Why can't Congress forgo \nthe extras?\n  It will take a colossal effort to control the Government's debt. But \nevery long journey begins with the first step. I urge my colleagues to \ntake that first step and vote against this bill. I thank the chairman \nand ranking member for the opportunity to express my concerns.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are three votes remaining. One is \nthe Grassley amendment. There is a second Grassley amendment, and then \nfinal passage, hopefully, on the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent--this has been cleared--that each of these \nvotes be a 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5393\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to table the Grassley amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Alaska to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Iowa. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may we have order now? We have one more \nvote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5394\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 \nminute for the proponents of the amendment and 1 minute for opponents \nof the amendment, followed by a vote.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my amendment says that H.R. 1350 \nsubsidies, and that is $1 billion in total, cannot be used for campaign \ncontributions, cannot be used for lobbying and cannot be used for so-\ncalled public education. Congress has supported similar restrictions on \ndifferent bills and programs in the past, but we have no such \nrestrictions for this $1 billion subsidy in this bill.\n  It was suggested last week that we provide for this. It could be done \nby a line item. If that is what is wanted, then I suggest to the \nproponents to put that in the bill, but it isn't in the bill.\n  So, consequently, I think we should make sure we don't allow these \nfunds to be back-doored by the Maritime Administration for campaign \ncontributions and for lobbying. Without this restriction, that is not \ncertain.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is a Corrupt Practices Act. As a \nmatter of fact, the $10 billion paid out of agricultural subsidies has \nno similar provision. This amendment is unnecessary. It is a killer \namendment trying to convince Members to vote for amendments so the bill \nwill go back to the House and die.\n  The purpose of this bill is to save $100 million a year and to \ncontinue the program of keeping the merchant marine available for the \nUnited States in time of emergency. It will cost $100 million a year \nfor 10 years under this bill, not $1 billion, as that article on your \ndesks says; $100 million a year for 10 years.\n  I move to table this amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay \non the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, America has relied upon its merchant marine, \nports and maritime industries for both trade and defense since colonial \ndays.\n  Today, we will vote to ensure that America will continue its maritime \ncommunity into the 21st century.\n  Today, we recognize that America as a nation must make an investment \nin its maritime infrastructure.\n  Today, we will vote for a program which is an efficient and flexible \npolicy that will allocate scarce public resources in a responsible \nmanner.\n  This program will also guarantee that our Nation will have trained \nAmericans to crew these vessels as well as the Department of Defense's \npre-positioned and Ready Reserve Fleet.\n  This program will significantly reduce the cost of the Federal \nmaritime operating assistance programs. We are talking about cutting \nthe funding in half.\n  This program will eliminate outdated and unnecessary rules and \nregulations which limits and restricts the ability of U.S. flag vessels \nto compete and modernize their fleets.\n  I want to take just a moment and recognize the hard work of \nCongressman Herb Bateman and Senators Stevens, Inouye, Hollings and \nBreaux.\n  This has been a real team effort. These Members of Congress were \nactively involved in crafting and advancing this legislation. The \njourney for maritime reform started over two decades ago.\n  This particular bill has been on a 9-year legislative trip with over \n50 hearings. Its time has come.\n  I also want to recognize the work of staff who assisted the process: \nRusty Johnston, Jim Schweiter, and Bob Brauer of the House's National \nSecurity Committee; Earl Comstock of Senator Steven's staff; Jim \nSartucci and Carl Bentzel of the Senate's Commerce Committee; and \nMargaret Cummisky of Senator Inouye's staff.\n  The full Senate has devoted nearly two full days for a spirited \ndialogue on this legislation. And, the Senate has considered a wide \nrange of amendments. The bill is ready for vote on final passage.\n  I stand here today on the Senate Floor and proudly ask my colleagues \nto support the Maritime Security Program to guarantee that our Nation \nwill have the nucleus of a modern, militarily useful active commercial \nvessels sailing under the American flag.\n  This vote will ensure that whenever the United States decides to \nproject American forces overseas for either an emergency or national \ndefense, there will be a maritime lifeline. I firmly believe that \nCongress has a duty and responsibility to guarantee that a real and \nviable maritime lifeline is maintained and provided.\n  We are the world's only remaining superpower and we have global \ninterests and responsibilities. A healthy maritime community is \nessential for this role.\n  I stand here today representing a bill that enjoys wide and deep \nbipartisan support. It deserves your support and your vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill for the third \ntime.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S11158]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. My information is, this is the last vote.

Thank you very much \nfor getting this bill passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11151-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11158-S11159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               JAN PAULK\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in the weeks ahead, as the 104th Congress \ncomes to a close, we will be paying tribute to several of our \ncolleagues, from both sides of the aisle, who, for one reason or \nanother, will be leaving the Senate at the end of this year. But it is \nnot only our fellow Members who will be missed.\n  The Senate will soon lose one of its longest-serving staffers, \nsomeone who has become a veritable institution within this institution.\n  I am referring to Jan Paulk, our Director of Interparliamentary \nServices. She has held that position since it was first created in \n1981, and her exemplary performance in that post has defined its role \nin the life and the activities of the Senate.\n  Jan came to the Senate from Russellville, AR, a graduate of the \nUniversity of Arkansas, and joined the staff of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee under its then chairman, William Fulbright.\n  Her background in international matters made her a natural to head up \nour office of Interparliamentary Services.\n  In that capacity, she has been responsible for the administrative, \nfinancial, and protocol aspects of all our interparliamentary \nconferences. She has overseen all of the Senate's delegations traveling \nabroad with leadership authorization.\n  In short, she has been the Senate's combination of travel office and \nDepartment of State, part tour guide, part Chief of Protocol, part \nguardian angel to congressional families overseas.\n  Most Members of the Senate will have their own memories of Jan's \nhelpfulness and thoroughness.\n  When things have gone smoothly for us at an international conference, \nwe knew it was because of her meticulous planning. And when an \nunforeseen problem arose, we knew we could count on her combination of \ntact and toughness to straighten it out.\n  Jan has helped to plan countless visits to the Capitol by heads of \nstate and heads of government.\n  As every Senator knows, these are not merely ceremonial affairs. They \nusually involve extremely serious matters of international commerce and \ndiplomacy.\n  They can advance, or retard, our country's interests abroad, and are \nan important part of the Senate's special constitutional role in our \nNation's foreign policy.\n  To put this tactfully, such visits are not always easy to arrange, \nbut we could always rely on Jan to smooth things out before they could \nget rocky.\n  We all wish Jan well as she retires from the Senate. I know I speak, \nnot only for our colleagues, but for our spouses as well, in wishing \nshe were not leaving us.\n  We will miss her greatly.\n  And some of us will be sure to get her forwarding number in the \nconfident assurance that, when we run into a particularly difficult \nproblem, she will still be ready to lend a hand.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank her, both for Tricia and \nmyself, not just for her years of service, but for her calm in the face \nof crisis, her cheerfulness in the face of gloom, and for the way she \ngave real meaning and spirit to what we call the Senate family.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to say thank you to a woman who \nhas been a good friend of the Senate, a good friend to Linda and me, \nand most importantly a good ambassador for our country, Jan Paulk.\n  Fifteen years ago, when then majority leader Howard Baker created the \nSenate's Office of Interparliamentary Services, he asked Jan to head \nit. She has been doing that job and doing it well ever since. You might \nsay Jan is the Senate's youngest institution.\n  I am sure I speak for all of my colleagues when I say we will miss \nJan's professionalism when she leaves us soon to take on a new \nchallenge as head of Tulane University's new Asia Foreign Leadership \nProgram.\n  Jan grew up in Russellville, AR, population 8,000. She first came to \nWashington as a high school senior. She had won an essay contest at her \nhigh school. First prize was a trip to Washington and $100 in spending \nmoney. She knew the first time she saw Washington that she wanted to \nmake a career here in Government. She did return after college to work \nfor Senator William Fulbright, first as a file clerk and then an \nassistant scheduler. She left Washington briefly to earn a master's \ndegree in theater from Columbia University. To anyone who mistakenly \nsuggests that theater was a successful diversion, Jan is quick to point \nout that there is a lot of theater in politics.\n  Jan returned to the Senate in 1971 as editor for the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and spent 3 years editing the landmark war powers \nhearings.\n  In 1974, she was put in charge of travel and protocol for the \ncommittee, and in 1981, when Senator Baker created the Office of \nInterparliamentary Services to handle those same functions for the \nentire Senate, he asked Jan to head it. As director of \nInterparliamentary Services, Jan has overseen the Senate's official \nforeign travel--a tough job that requires the stamina of an advance \nperson, the poise of an Ambassador.\n  She and her small IPS staff handle every detail, from arranging the \ntransportation to coordinating with host governments to making sure \nSenators understand local customs.\n  Jan's work has taken her to more than 100 countries in every \ncontinent\n\n[[Page S11159]]\n\non Earth where she has represented not only this body but this Nation \nas well. She visited the former Soviet Union in 1975 with Senators \nHubert Humphrey and Hugh Scott, the first time a congressional \ndelegation had ever visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the \nSupreme Soviet.\n  She visited China in 1979 with Senators Frank Church and Jacob \nJavits. She visited the gulf states just before the gulf war, and she \nreturned just after the war while oilfields were still burning. And in \nJune 1994, Jan coordinated the largest ever overseas delegation when 22 \nSenators traveled to Normandy to commemorate the 50th anniversary of D-\nday.\n  One trip I will always remember is the trip to Bosnia last April when \nJan arranged for me and Senators Hatch and Reid to attend functions and \nto visit the land that we had not yet visited following the war. We \nwent to assess progress in implementing the Dayton peace accords. What \npromised from the start to be a difficult trip became immeasurably more \ndifficult the morning we were to leave when the plane carrying \nSecretary Ron Brown and 34 others slammed into the ground in Dubrovnik.\n  Jan's professionalism helped us get through that trip. And in caring \non, we were able to show the world that America's commitment to peace \nin the former Yugoslavia is unwavering.\n\n  Closer to home, she has helped welcome every head of State who has \nvisited the Senate over the last 19 years.\n  In her 27 years in the Senate, Jan Paulk has worked for Democrats and \nshe has worked for Republicans. She has served both with equal \nprofessionalism and skill. Most of all, she has served her Nation, and, \nfor that, we are all grateful. Linda and I and all of our colleagues, I \nknow, wish Jan the very best in her new challenge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11158-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know others will be commenting on this \nlater on, but I was delighted to be one of those who wore a bow tie \nthis afternoon in honor of our great friend and great Senator from the \nState of Illinois. The bow tie has sort of become his symbol, but he \nalso is just one of the finest Senators, one of the finest men that we \nhave serving in the U.S. Senate.\n  I have enjoyed working with him over many years. I have served with \nhim here in the Senate. I have been on committees with him. I have \nfound him to be a Senator who will stand for principle, and sometimes \nthat means standing with Members of the Senate on the other side of the \naisle. He truly will be missed as he goes back to his beloved State of \nIllinois. I am sure he will do many, many productive things in the \nfuture as he has in the past, as Lieutenant Governor of his State.\n  He is a very thoughtful Senator. This was just a little bit of levity \ntoday, as we all wore our bow ties in honor of Paul Simon. But it was a \ngreat symbol of affection that we have for a Senator we have enjoyed so \nmuch, and who we will miss as he goes back to Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11159-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that once the Senate \nreceives from the House the conference report to accompany the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill that the conference report be considered and agreed \nto, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nin connection with the conference report be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to present to the Senate \nthe conference agreement on the VA, HUD, and independent agencies \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1997. I'm especially pleased that \nthis final step in congressional consideration of this measure is \noccurring prior to start of the fiscal year. Furthermore, we anticipate \nthis measure will be separately signed into law and not become part of \nanother continuing resolution, which has become quite a distinction for \na major appropriations bill in this Congress.\n  I would note that it is especially critical that we enact this bill \nimmediately to avoid potential delays in processing of veterans \ndisability compensation and pension checks. In addition, prompt \nenactment is necessary to prevent potential disruption in other \ncritical governmental functions such as the sale and processing of \nFederal flood insurance policies and financing of VA and FHA mortgages.\n  Mr. President, much of the recent attention paid to this bill has \nbeen over disposition of the three major health issues riders added \nduring Senate floor debate: the Domenici-Wellstone mental health parity \nprovision; the Bradley-Frist maternity health care amendment; and the \nspina bifida VA entitlement. While our appropriations conferees can't \ntake credit for it, we are\n\n[[Page S11160]]\n\nnonetheless pleased that at our urging the House and Senate legislative \ncommittees of jurisdiction, on a bipartisan basis, worked out \nagreements on these very substantial policy issues which are \nincorporated in our conference agreement. Moreover, at our urging, each \nof these legislative proposals now have delayed effective dates which \npermit a final legislative review in the next session of Congress, \nprior to implementation.\n  Mr. President, beyond serving as a vehicle for these major health \npolicy provisions, the underlying measure is itself the largest non-\ndefense discretionary appropriations bill, with nearly a third of the \nGovernment-wide total. Its critical role in establishing program levels \nand direction for the environment, housing and community development, \nveterans health programs, and science and technology is the reason why \nCongress and the White House took so long to reconcile our differences \nduring this past year.\n  These are major funding issues which reflect profound policy \ndisagreements. None of us, however, want to repeat the long delays and \nfrustrations we experienced during the past year of being unable to \nenact this critical funding measure. We have attempted to avoid \nreopening past disagreements and controversies which blocked this bill \nlast year.\n  Our effort to facilitate this measure has meant that this bill, in a \nnumber of respects, reflects funding levels and policies which are \ncompromises between very different viewpoints. One example is the \ninclusion of funds at the 1996 enacted level for the Corporation for \nNational and Community Service. I, and many others, continue to have \nstrong reservations about this program, but there is no doubt that \nfailure to fund it would result in a Presidential veto. So despite our \nmisgivings, this conference agreement maintains the current level of \nfunding for this program, which continues to be more than I believe \nwarranted, but less than what is requested by the White House. The \nHouse agreed with this position of the Senate, despite their previous \nopposition to providing any funding for continuing this program.\n\n  With respect to other agencies funded in this bill, the conference \nagreement attempts to balance a wide variety of competing interests \nwithin a very constrained budget allocation.\n  The conference agreement provides $17.013 billion for veterans \nmedical care--an increase of $5 million above the President's request \nand $450 million above the 1996 level. This account received the \nhighest priority in the legislation, and hence the largest increase. \nThe amount provided will ensure that VA will continue to provide care \nto the 2.8 million veterans currently receiving VA medical services.\n  The conference agreement also includes $100 million in 1996 \nsupplemental appropriations for veterans compensations and pensions. If \nthe Senate passes this critical legislation no later than today, \nSeptember 25, these additional funds will ensure that veterans will \nreceive their September checks on time. Delays may result in veterans \nchecks being late.\n  For EPA, a total of $6.7 billion is included--$184 million more than \nthe fiscal year 1996 amount. This includes approximately $2.9 billion \nin funds for the States--of which $1.9 billion is for State revolving \nfunds for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure--fully funded at \nthe President's request level. It also provides the President's full \nrequest of $1.394 billion for Superfund, to ensure site cleanups are \nnot slowed despite the need to reform the program.\n  Despite the very compelling arguments made by some members, the \nconference agreement does not include so-called riders in EPA in view \nof our desire to keep this legislation as free of controversy as \npossible.\n  For FEMA disaster relief, the conference agreement provides $1.32 \nbillion--all of which would become available immediately--to meet the \nneeds arising from hurricanes Fran and Hortense, and other disasters \ncurrently on the books. These funds, in addition to the $3.7 billion in \npreviously appropriated disaster relief funds currently available for \nobligation, obviate the need for a supplemental appropriation for \ndisaster relief at this time.\n  The conference agreement includes a 1-year extension for FEMA's flood \ninsurance program--so that there is no lapse in FEMA's ability to write \nflood insurance policies and carry out the flood mapping program. After \nthe recent hurricane disasters, many homeowners are only too familiar \nwith how critical this program is.\n  For the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the conference \nrecommendation continues the policies and programmatic reforms enacted \nlast year. It was a major disappointment that Congress was unable to \nenact a comprehensive public and assisted housing reform authorization \nbill. This appropriations bill, however, contains temporary extensions \nof provisions needed to halt the ever-increasing cost of housing \nsubsidy commitments and to continue progress in reforming wasteful and \nineffective housing and community development programs. Equally \nimportant, this bill restructures funding of Department of Housing and \nUrban Development to eliminate bureaucratic overlap and promote local \nflexibility and decision making. I hope that the authorizing process \nwill pickup where they left off this year and expeditiously enact these \nreforms as permanent legislative changes.\n\n  Similarly, this appropriations bill contains multifamily housing \nrestructuring proposals which were under consideration by the \nauthorizing committee. We cannot afford to continue the excessive \nsubsidies currently being paid to sustain this inventory of nearly a \nmillion apartments for low-income families. Unless Congress acts to \nreduce the excessive debt of this housing inventory, along with \nimplementing other management improvements, there could be massive \ndefaults and widespread resident displacement.\n  The complexity and difficulty of developing a consensus on these \nissues are substantial. Project owners, including limited and general \npartners, project managers, residents, State housing finance agencies, \nlocal community development organizations, bond holders, and municipal \ngovernments are among those with significant interests in how we \naddress this issue. These interests, however, frequently are divergent \nand competing. Of course, we must also be mindful of the billions of \ntaxpayers dollars previously invested in this multifamily housing \ninventory, and the billions more which are at risk over the next \nseveral years depending on which policies and financing mechanisms we \nselect to deal with these issues.\n  The conference agreement reflects our attempt at finding a reasonable \nbalance between these sometimes conflicting concerns. We cannot afford \ncontinuing to pay excessive subsidies for these multifamily housing \nprojects, even those which provide very good housing for low income \nfamilies. And some portions of this inventory are little more than the \nslums they were intended to replace. The conference recommendation is \nnot a comprehensive solution. It simply is an attempt to deal with \nthese issues in that fraction of the multifamily inventory that have \nsection 8 contracts which expire during fiscal year 1997. We are acting \nsolely because affirmative action is required to prevent defaults and \npotential resident displacement during the fiscal year.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Oregon, chairman of our full \nAppropriations Committee, for his support and assistance during our \nconsideration of this bill. Changes in our budget allocation, made on \nhis recommendation, enabled us to provide funding to reduce the \npotential for displacement of low-income families from currently \nsubsidized housing. With this allocation we were also able to restore \nfunding for the Community Development Block Grants program [CDBG] at \nthe full current fiscal year 1996 funding level of $4.6 billion, and \nnot withhold $300 million from obligation as was proposed in the House-\npassed bill.\n  Mr. President, it is very unfortunate that the Senator from Oregon is \nretiring from the Senate since the funding requirements necessary to \nmaintain subsidized housing are expected to grow even larger over the \nnext several years, and his appreciation of the importance of this \ninvestment will be sorely missed. I would note, however, that with his \nhelp we have been able to begin weaning this inventory of housing from \nits continued dependence on heavy Federal subsidies.\n\n  The conference agreement for NASA totals $13.7 billion, an increase \nof $100\n\n[[Page S11161]]\n\nmillion over the House--and adopts the Senate-passed restoration of \nfunds for the Mission to Planet Earth program to study global climate \nchange. The conference agreement also incorporates buyout legislation \nnecessary to facilitate reductions in staffing without resorting to \nvery disruptive reductions-in-force [RIF's]. Also included is transfer \nauthority, similar to that enacted last year, which provides NASA the \nflexibility to redirect funding within the $2.1 billion total provided \nfor the space station in order to avoid costly delays or schedule \nslips.\n  Mr. President, after making adjustments for the necessary \nreplenishment of the FEMA disaster relief account and for enactment of \nhousing legislative savings, the net increase in actual appropriated \nprogram levels is only $84 million, or just one-tenth of one percent \nover the previous year. While an aggregate freeze, the total reflects \nsome substantial increases offset by commensurate decreases for several \nof our agencies. The biggest increase, $569 million, was provided for \ndiscretionary programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The only \nother agencies to receive significant increases were the Environmental \nProtection Agency, with an $184 million increase, and the National \nScience Foundation which received $50 million more than last year. \nThese increases were offset by cuts of $625 million in HUD, and $200 \nmillion in NASA.\n  Finally, I want to express my appreciation to the Senator from \nMaryland for her assistance and cooperation in putting together this \nbill. We confronted major challenges, not only due to the complexity of \nsome of the programmatic and budgetary issues within our jurisdiction, \nbut also in dealing with some very sensitive policy concerns of a \nlegislative nature. And, as has become an annual concern, we have had \nto deal with daunting budgetary constraints. She has been invaluable in \nguiding this difficult bill through some contentious points in the \nSenate and in conference. Amid the wide ranging issues and concerns we \nhave dealt with in consideration of this bill, she has been steadfast \nin her determination to get our task accomplished. I am very grateful \nfor all her help.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to thank the many staff members who \nalso have made a major contribution to consideration of this bill: \nSally Chadbourne, Catherine Corson, David Bowers, and Liz Blevins on \nthe minority side; and Stephen Kohashi, Carrie Apostolou, Julie \nDammann, Jon Kamarck, and Lashawnda Leftwich on our side.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am happy to join my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from Missouri, to offer for Senate consideration \nthe fiscal year 1997 conference report for the VA-HUD and independent \nagencies appropriations bill. With $84.7 billion in spending--$20.3 \nbillion in mandatory spending and $64.3 in discretionary budget \nauthority, this is one of the largest and most diverse appropriations \nmeasures we must consider.\n  I am particularly pleased by our ability to achieve compromise on \nmany complicated issues as we worked out this agreement with our \ncolleagues in the House. This bill funds a tremendous diversity of \nagencies and programs. It is a challenge every year to develop a \npassable, signable bill that addresses a variety of concerns from all \nMembers of Congress and the American people. By accepting our \ndifferences on many of the issues that plagued the VA-HUD and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill last year, and prohibiting \nenvironmental riders, we have avoided being included in an omnibus \ncontinuing resolution, and Mr. President, to the credit of all \ninvolved, we have a signable bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to second the urging of Chairman Bond \nthat we move forward with this bill immediately. We need to avoid \npotential delays in processing of veterans disability compensation and \npension checks as well as Federal flood insurance policies. Both \nmatters are addressed in supplemental legislation included in the \nfiscal year 1997 VA-HUD appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, as you know, this bill contains funding for a diverse \ngroup of Federal agencies and programs. Yet it also contains three \nimportant health care provisions first proposed by the Senate and \nagreed to by the conference.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of a measure introduced by Senator Daschle to \nextend benefits to children of Vietnam veterans exposed to agent orange \nwho have spina bifida. This will provide needed support for our \nveterans' children and their families. I would note to Senator's \nDaschle's credit, that this provision passed overwhelmingly in the \nSenate, as did the motion to accept it in the House.\n\n  Second, our bill includes Senator Bradley's newborns health \nprovision, which prevents ``drive-through'' baby deliveries. Because of \nthis bill, developed with Senator Frist, insurance companies will no \nlonger be able to force mothers out of the hospital in less than 48 \nhours after delivery. This is an important measure impacting every \nAmerican family.\n  Third, Senators Wellstone and Domenici's mental health provision \nprevents discrimination against people with mental illness. When this \nbill passes, insurance companies that provide coverage for mental \nhealth will have to offer the same lifetime cap as they do for other \nillnesses. We have heard here on the Senate floor stories from Senators \nabout families devastated by insurance discrimination.\n  Mr. President, the three provisions provide real answers to real \nproblems faced by the American public. They are important components of \nthe health care initiatives that this administration has worked so hard \nto carry out.\n  As you can see, this bill is about more than just agencies and \nprograms and budget authority: it is about real people. The bill \nprovides $39.2 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nincluding $17.3 billion for veterans health care, and $20.4 billion for \nveterans benefits. It ensures that promises made are promises kept to \nour Nation's veterans.\n  The bill provides HUD with $19.5 billion, including full funding, at \n$4.6 billion, for community development block grants. This money is \nused to provide real economic opportunities for people trying to help \nthemselves--in places like Baltimore, Houston, and Charleston, SC. It \nfunds the President's request for housing for people with AID's, \nproviding desperately needed housing for people living with AID's.\n  The bill continues a significant FHA multifamily housing mark-to-\nmarket demonstration program. While taking on such an \nambitious authorization effort for reforming the assisted housing \nprogram may be beyond the call of duty for the Appropriations \nCommittee, this provision is the necessary first step toward reducing \nthe excessive debt of the assisted housing inventory while avoiding \nputting families out on the street. This bill creates opportunities for \nthe poor--but not hollow opportunities. Instead it reaffirms proper \noversight of our Nation's housing programs, while avoiding new and \nexpanded liabilities for the taxpayer.\n\n  In addition, the bill continues to streamline the management of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and encourages EPA to prioritize, \nfocusing its resources on those problems that pose the highest risk to \nhuman health and the environment. The EPA is provided $6.7 billion, \nwhich is $185 million more than last year. The money will be used to \nensure that people across this Nation breathe clean air and drink clean \nwater. Unfortunately, due to limited resources, the bill does not \nprovide the President's full request for environmental programs. In \nparticular, I am concerned about reductions in programs like Boston \nHarbor, Montreal Protocol, Climate Change, and the Environmental \nTechnologies Initiative. But we did the best we could with the \nresources we had available.\n  The bill restores the fiscal year 1996 $1 billion recision from the \nFEMA disaster relief fund and makes the funds available immediately. \nThis will help families and communities devastated by hurricanes, \nfloods, and other disasters. This is real help for real people, from \nNorth Carolina to Maryland to California.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill maintains funding for the \nCorporation for Community and National Service at $402.5 million. \nNational service creates an opportunity structure--community service in \nexchange for a college education. It encourages volunteerism and \nrekindles habits of the heart. It fosters the spirit of neighbor \nhelping neighbor that made our country great. National service is about\n\n[[Page S11162]]\n\nreal people offering real help to real communities.\n  This bill also provides additional funding for the consumer agencies, \nincluding $42.5 million for the Consumer Product Safety Commission and \n$2.3 million for the Consumer Information Center. This is $200,000 more \nthan the President's request.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that funding for NASA is $100 million \nbelow the President's request. I am concerned that space programs are \ntaking a beating. Reductions in our space budget and our uncertainty \nabout NASA outyear numbers jeopardize ongoing commitments, as well as \nour ability to fund new and innovative space science programs.\n  Together with the administration, I plan to discuss the future of our \nspace programs at a national space summit, to be held in December. I \nurge my colleagues to join the discussions that will take a critical \nlook at how to maintain our preeminent space program, despite huge \ncutbacks in the overall budget.\n  Fortunately Mission to Planet Earth was spared the cut it took in the \noriginal House bill. Mission to Planet Earth data will be used to help \nprepare our communities to deal with natural disasters, such as the \nrecent Hurricane Fran which negatively affected thousands of people's \nlives. Mission to Planet Earth will also give our fishermen better \ntools to sustain their livelihood and help our farmers decide what and \nwhen to plant their crops.\n  This bill also helps NASA employees and their families. It provides \nNASA employees buyout authority. We expect the buyout authority to \nreduce the impact of downsizing on people's lives. Furthermore, the \nbill protects the jobs for the eastern shore of Maryland at Wallops \nIsland.\n  Mr. President, this bill is about more than just programs and budget \nauthority. This bill streamlines the Federal Government, yet it \nprotects jobs. This bill provides important health benefits for mothers \nand babies, new benefits for veterans, and housing for low-income \nfamilies. It maintains our global scientific leadership, and \nprioritizes our environmental programs. It protects our drinking water \nand teaches our children the art of community service. From children \nborn with spina bifida to the Nobel laureates who help prevent birth \ndefects, this bill provides real help for real people.\n  Mr. President. The diversity or programs funded by this bill reflect \nthe diversity of this country. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport this conference report.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Senator Bond, Congressman Lewis and \nCongressman Stokes for all the hard work they've done to get this bill \nto conference and to keep this bill from ending up in a continuing \nresolution. I would personally like to thank my appropriations staff, \nSally Chadbourne, Catherine Corson, David Bowers, and Liz Blevins, as \nwell as the majority staff, Stephen Kohashi, Carrie Apostolou, and \nLashawnda Leftwich. I would also like to thank the members of my \npersonal office staff and those on Senator Bond's staff who worked so \nhard to help us get through this conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11159-7", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DESIGNATING ROOM S. 131 IN THE CAPITOL AS THE MARK O.

Mr. President, there are a number of reasons we are \ngrateful to see the end of the 104th Congress, but one reason I regret \nthis ending is that it also marks the end of Paul Simon's distinguished \ncareer in Congress.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Paul Simon in both the House \nand in the Senate. I have found him always to be an honest and decent \nman who loves his country very deeply. Perhaps what stands out about \nPaul Simon the most after his bow tie--and I must say we have all \nimproved our looks and image substantially this afternoon by adopting \nhis practice of wearing a bow tie--is his strongly developed sense of \nmoral leadership. His parents were both Lutheran missionaries, his \nfather, I am told, an idealist and his mother a pragmatist who handled \nall the family's expenses. From their combined influence, he grew into \nwhat he described as a pay-as-you-go Democrat.\n  As a young man, Paul Simon did not want to be in government. He \nwanted to keep an eye on it and write about it. In 1948, he bought the \nstruggling Troy, IL, Tribune, and at 19 became the Nation's youngest \nnewspaper editor-publisher. He eventually built that paper into a chain \nof 14 newspapers.\n  He interrupted his journalism career in an Army counterintelligence \nunit monitoring Soviet activities in Eastern Europe from 1951 to 1953. \nWhen he returned to journalism in 1954, he tried unsuccessfully to \nrecruit candidates to run for public office. After hearing ``no'' one \ntoo many times, he finally decided at the age of 25 to run for the \nIllinois State Legislature. That was the beginning of a long and very \ndistinguished career.\n  Paul Simon served four 2-year terms in the Illinois House and two 4-\nyear terms in the Senate. He provided constituents with detailed \nreports on spending long before the passage of the disclosure laws. He \nwas elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1974 and reelected \nfour times. He joined the Senate in 1984. Fortunately for students of \npolitics and for history, the old newspaper reporter in him never \nstopped working. Senator Simon is the author of 14 books and countless \narticles.\n  In 1987, when he announced his candidacy for President, Paul Simon \nsaid, ``I seek the Presidency with a firm sense of who I am, what I \nstand for, and what I can and will do to advance the cause of this \ngreat Nation.''\n  It is that same strong sense of who he is and what he stands for that \nhas made Paul Simon such an invaluable asset to this body and to our \nNation. It was in part the leadership of this pay-as-you-go Democrat \nthat helped this Nation understand that we have a job to do in \nbalancing the budget and that we have to do it the right way, without \nripping apart America's safety net. I, and I know all of my colleagues, \nwill miss Senator Simon's good humor. Unfortunately, I suspect I will \nnot miss his good counsel because I am confident that Senator Simon \nwill continue in his new career to write and to keep us on the right \ntrack, just as he has one way or the other for all of these years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11163-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11163-S11165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, a few minutes ago--actually an hour \nago now--the Senate demonstrated, I think, the kind of cooperation and \ncollegiality that really is in the best tradition of this Senate, when \nMembers on both sides of the aisle, male and female alike, came out \nwearing bow ties as a tribute to my senior Senator, Paul Simon.\n  At the outset, I would like to thank the people who made it possible: \nSenator Connie Mack of Florida, with whom I had conversations regarding \nthe surprise to Paul Simon and who made it possible also for Members on \nthe Republican side of the aisle to have bow ties; to Senator David \nPryor of Arkansas who took the initiative to have the ties made. I had \nto question him why it was that the girls didn't exactly get ties. We \nhad to tie our own bows. But it was all right because the bows are \nreally quite lovely. I know many of us will probably keep these as part \nof our wardrobes permanently. I couldn't help but think, when I saw so \nmany Members of this Senate come out on the floor in their bow ties or \ntheir bows, how very special this institution is in its tribute to a \nvery special Member.\n  First, with regard to the institution. We very often call each other \n``distinguished,'' ``my good friend,'' ``the honorable.'' But there is \nsomething about serving in an institution like this that brings us \ntogether and binds us together, almost like a family, without regard to \nour political affiliation or even our philosophical orientation, maybe \nbecause we spend so many hours together or we work together and we work \nsuch long hours together, a point that is often missed by the general \npublic. But the fact is, because of our coming together in so many \ndifferent endeavors, the Members of this body all have a special regard \nand a special relationship one to the other.\n  I think that regard and that relationship was reflected in the \ntribute to Senator Paul Simon when Members, again on both sides of the \naisle, so willingly took up the bow tie and took up the bow in honor of \nhim and in tribute to what has become his signature--his bow tie.\n  Senator Pryor is on the floor now, and I don't know where he had \nthese made, but they certainly are gorgeous.\n  Senator Pryor and Senator Mack and the other Members, and I must say \nwe had cooperation from just about everybody--the people in the \ncloakroom who made the ties available, the staffer who helped play a \nlittle trick on Paul Simon this afternoon when we sent him a note that \nsaid he had a phone call so he would leave the caucus long enough for \nan announcement to be made about the surprise. Everyone has cooperated \nto make this possible.\n  It was really a great honor to him and a great honor to his service \nto this institution, as well as our State of Illinois and our Nation \nthat this tribute was such a moving one. Even though we were in the \nmiddle of votes, everyone made the point to go up and to speak to \nSenator Simon and to wish him well.\n\n  Paul Simon epitomizes public service. He has always sought to make \ngovernment work for the people. He understands that democratic \ngovernment is not separate and distinct from the people. But it is no \nmore, no less than a mechanism for all of us to come together for our \ncommon good. In a democracy, government is all of us, and Paul Simon \nhas spent a lifetime making government real, making government \nresponsive, making government serve the public interest.\n  He is a genuine public servant, and a public servant who has \nfunctioned consistent with his beliefs and his principles and his own \nethic over the years, whether popular or unpopular, in the good times \nand the bad ones.\n  One can always be certain that Paul Simon's values are never very far \nfrom his votes. He always has been known to care for the less \nfortunate, for those without a voice. His compassion for people has \nhelped make him a conscience for this body and, indeed, for our Nation. \nHe has been a fighter on issues without regard to whether or not they \nmade it on the polls or the pop charts.\n  In fact, he started working for education, for example, before it was \nas high up in the polling as it is today. Education is a passion of \nPaul Simon because he believes that it is an integral part of \nopportunity in preserving the American dream. So he fought for \neducational opportunity, and he has fought to make certain that \nopportunity was extended to all Americans everywhere--handicapped \nAmericans, minority Americans, Americans in the suburbs and the \ncities--wherever in this country. Paul Simon's concern as a small ``d'' \ndemocrat for the people of this country has been unwavering.\n  It is that same concern that drove him to be the chief architect and \nthe\n\n[[Page S11164]]\n\nchief sponsor of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Many \ntimes when I am called on, when I speak to people about the balanced \nbudget amendment, which is an issue that now is very popular--it wasn't \nwhen he first started working on it--I remind people that it was a \nDemocrat, Paul Simon, who championed the balanced budget amendment \nbefore it was popular.\n  He did so because he knows and he believes that we have a duty in our \ngeneration to leave our children more than a legacy of debt. So it is \nessential, again, if we are going to hold on to that American dream, \nthat we have to be responsive to the people, but we have an obligation \nalso to be prudent and not to be profligate in our spending.\n  I heard a story the other day that I think really describes Paul \nSimon, that I think is so typical or so appropriate with regard to \ndescribing Paul Simon. A woman said to me she always liked people who \nliked children and people who liked trees, because those were people \nwho cared about what came after they were gone. If you think about it, \ncaring about children and caring about trees and caring about the \nfuture of America is exactly what has distinguished Paul Simon's \nservice in this Senate and in his public life through the years in the \nState of Illinois.\n  He leaves some awfully big shoes to fill. He likes to point out that \nhe could do for me what no one else can do, and that is make me the \nsenior Senator from Illinois. While I look forward to being the senior \nSenator from this great State, at the same time I recognize that it is \nan awfully tall bill to fill, to live up to the standards and live up \nto the kind of ethic that Paul Simon has always represented.\n\n  He has been a public servant of the first order. He started having \ntown meetings in our State and, quite frankly--he has had a couple \nthousand of them--it is going to take me a little while to catch up \nwith the number of townhall meetings that Paul Simon had in the State. \nHe also had townhall meetings here. In fact, when I came to the Senate \nand joined him with the every-Thursday townhall meetings in which we \nspeak to the people who drop by on the issues, this was an innovation \nby Paul Simon that, frankly, was absolutely consistent with his \nreaching out, with his spreading the gospel of democracy to the people \nwho came to visit their Capitol.\n  So, in closing, Mr. President, I would like to say that it is \naltogether appropriate that Paul Simon comes from and represents the \nState of Illinois. Our State has been long known as ``the land of \nLincoln,'' and we are very proud of that. Illinois' greatest citizen \nmade a monumental contribution to our country in very difficult times, \nbut I think it is absolutely consistent with his legacy that our State \nhas been served by a giant in the nature and of the name of Paul Simon.\n  He follows in the best Illinois tradition: someone who is committed \nto keeping the United States of America the greatest country in the \nworld, someone who has devoted the full measure of his talent and his \nenergy to his State and to his country.\n  So it is with great love and affection that I wish him well in his \nretirement, as I am sure that my colleagues do as they demonstrated on \nthis floor this afternoon.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, for the eloquent statement \nshe has made about our departing colleague, the honorable Paul Simon, \nthe senior Senator from her State.\n  I also want to thank, Mr. President, our distinguished colleague, the \njunior Senator from Illinois, for the role that she has played in \nmaking this so-called bow tie day in honor of Paul Simon, not only a \nreality, but I think certainly, Mr. President, a success.\n  I must say, I have been asked several times during the course of the \nafternoon--because I think I have gotten a little bit too much \nattention or credit for this, and I should not get any--but I was \nsitting at an airport some months ago, visiting with my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Florida, Senator Connie Mack, and I do not \nknow exactly how we started talking about Paul Simon of Illinois, but \nsomething came up, and Connie Mack said to me, he said, ``You know, we \nought to do something to honor Paul Simon. What a grand person. What a \ndistinguished American. What an opportunity we have had to serve with \nthis man, Paul Simon.''\n  We started thinking out loud, sitting in the airport, waiting for the \nplane. And the plane did not come, and it did not come, so we had idea \nafter idea. Finally, Connie Mack said, ``You know what we ought to do? \nWe all ought to, before Paul Simon leaves the Senate, we ought to wear \na bow tie in his honor because it is such a symbol of this great man.'' \nSo I said, ``Connie Mack, you have come upon a great idea.'' I raced to \nthe telephone and called my friend in Little Rock, Mr. Bill Humble, and \nI said, ``Bill, can your tie plant make us up 100 bow ties?'' He said, \n``We'll be glad to.''\n  And so with that, and then with the help, the wonderful help of \nSenator Carol Moseley-Braun, who helped arrange the disbursing of the \nties today, and keeping this a secret, even almost from all of the Paul \nSimon staff, and almost Mrs. Simon, Jeanne Simon--I did notice she was \nhere today to see the thunderous applause, the thunderous ovation that \nher husband, Paul Simon, received by his colleagues, I would say about \n95 percent of those colleagues wearing a bow tie to pay tribute to our \ncolleague. So it has been a nice day. It was a nice way to express our \naffection and our respect for Paul Simon of Illinois. I have always \nadmired him.\n  I have admired him from afar when he was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, when he was doing so much with children's issues, when \nhe was championing the cause of education in our society, when he was \nconcerned about the breakdown of the family unit, which he was talking \nto us about, as Senator Moynihan was talking to us about decades ago, \nabout this breakdown, and the perseverance with which he approached \neach and every issue that he undertook. And I am so grateful that I \nhave had the privilege of not only sitting alongside this man, but also \nliterally sitting behind Senator Paul Simon's desk for these numbers of \nyears.\n  Mr. President, it is time for those of us who are departing, like my \ncolleague and wonderful friend from Wyoming, Senator Simpson, who I \ncame to the Senate with in 1979, it is time now, speaking of desks, for \nus to clean out our desks and take those humble belongings that we have \nin these desks home with us or wherever we might go, and to inscribe \nour name as occupant of the desk.\n  Many in our country might not know the history of these beautiful \nSenate desks in the Senate Chamber, but I hope all Americans will know \nthat each Senator who occupies a particular desk will have his or her \nname inscribed in that desk for posterity and for all future \ngenerations to know.\n  Finally, Mr. President, back to our friend, Senator Simon, if I were \nspeaking to a political science class--and I think come the next \nsemester at the University of Arkansas I might be speaking to one or \ntwo of those classes--if I am ever asked the question by one of those \npolitical science students as to how to pattern their life into \nbecoming a politician, and a public servant, ultimately a public \nofficial, I think I would say to that class that you have to look no \nfurther than the life, the personal life and the political life, of \nPaul Simon of Illinois, because I think with his life he has made a \nstatement, just like we on the floor today made a statement by wearing \na Paul Simon bow tie.\n  Paul Simon has made a statement for the last three decades that I \nthink will be an inspiration to all who believe in this system of \ngovernment and to all who believe that we can make this system of \ngovernment better.\n  A lot of people have so-called ``lost faith'' with our system of \ngovernment, with politicians and with Washington, and what have you. \nBut I think I would say this--and I am proud that my colleague from \nIllinois is here, my colleague from Wyoming, and our new colleague from \nTennessee, and the distinguished occupant of the Chair from Idaho--I \nwould just say that I think\n\n[[Page S11165]]\n\nthat Paul Simon, perhaps as much as any Senator that I have ever had \nthe privilege of serving with, has humanized government. He has \nhumanized politics. And he has humanized politicians. I think he has \ndone it with grace. He has done it with vision. And he has done it I \nthink with joy, because that joy exudes from Paul Simon. The happiness \nof his profession, the happiness of his work, I think will live long \nafter Paul Simon has left these Chambers of the U.S. Senate.\n  So, Mr. President, with that, we say thank you, Paul Simon, thank you \nfor being our friend, thank you for being truly a great U.S. Senator \nand a great Member of this body and a great friend of us all. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I, too, will join in the great remarks \nabout my friend Paul Simon and thank the Senator, soon-to-be senior \nSenator from Illinois. My time as senior Senator has been so fleeting \nthat I am hardly able to recall it because I served as the junior \nSenator to Malcolm Wallop, my friend from Wyoming. So enjoy the term \nindeed, I say to my colleague from Illinois. Do it well.\n  And to my friend, Senator Pryor, who came here with me--and he and \nhis wife Barbara have become very dear and special friends of ours--he \nis a most genial, generous, kind man, and a friend to his friends. If \nthey rallied him in time of need, it would only be because in his life \nand her life they have done just exactly that to all around them.\n  With regard to Paul Simon, you have to understand that I met Paul \nwhen we were State legislators together in 1971. There was a conference \non outstanding State legislators, and here were Paul Simon and myself, \nhe of the Illinois Legislature, me of the Wyoming Legislature, honored. \nThey had two from each State. I was one; Paul was one. The first day I \nmet him, I had a bow tie on because Paul and I had to at least know how \nto tie our own bow ties. There are people in here today that have no \nconcept of how to tie a bow tie. In fact, some of them have difficulty \nwith even a mechanical tie is my experience seeing it today. But we \nlaughed about that over the years.\n\n  But we are not in any way doing anything but paying tribute to this \nman who, with all the accolades we have heard, they are all true--\nhonest, direct, thoughtful, steady. I know. I served with him. He \nserved on my subcommittee on immigration, refugee policy, always \nattentive, always asking, always, always having a query and inquiring \nand saying, ``Well, why is this? What is the purpose of this?''\n  And so, indeed, he and Jeanne, we wish them Godspeed. We will see \nmore of them as we go on to snatch more of our own lives for ourselves \nrather than in this place and leave those tasks to our brothers and \nsisters and knowing what is required of them and both of us ready to \nmove on to other things.\n  I could not have had a finer colleague, whether it was working on the \nissues of fraudulent marriage--Paul handled that while I was chairman--\nor the balanced budget. We all know the things he does. We all know who \nhe is. That is why we did this tribute today. No one else will have a \ntribute like that in the U.S. Senate--how we would honor one of our \ncolleagues in any way as we did today and see the look on his face and \nthe delight and that smile that is so very special. He knew that and we \nknew that. I thought how appropriate to honor him in that way. None of \nus will ever receive such a wonderful accolade, with whimsy, humor, and \ngood spirit. I commend all those who brought that to pass.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11163-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               JAN PAULK\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

My wife and I wish her well. Indeed, \nshe is a very wonderful woman. There is much more for her to do, and \nshe will do it. I am very pleased for her about her new task.

Mr. President, I rise today as a physician concerned about \nwomen, concerned about women's health, concerned about safe medical \npractices. I rise to strongly support the ban on partial-birth \nabortions. My colleagues in this Chamber already know my position that \nthis procedure called a partial-birth abortion is both medically \nunnecessary and unnecessarily brutal and inhumane.\n  Mr. President, every baby deserves to be treated with respect, with \ndignity and with compassion. This procedure, which has been banned in a \nbipartisan, in a historic way by the U.S. Senate and by the House of \nRepresentatives, very deeply offends our sensibilities as human beings.\n  I need to make very clear that those of us who oppose this very \nspecific, very explicitly defined procedure care very deeply about \nwomen and about the horrific situations they sometimes face, but how \ncan we answer to our children, to our families, to our constituents \nback home and to ourselves if we continue to allow babies to be aborted \nthrough this partial-birth abortion procedure, especially--and I think \nin some of the remarks earlier today it was made clear--especially in \nlight that this procedure, this specific, well-defined procedure is \nmedically unnecessary.\n  As the Senate's only physician, the only physician in this body, as \nthe only board-certified surgeon in this body, I feel compelled to \naddress the issue surrounding the medical misinformation that is laid \non our desks, that you hear on the floor of this body, that you read in \nthe newspaper each day.\n\n  There are really three medical myths that each of us in preparing to \nvote 2 days from now must address. There are medical myths that \nsurround potential harm to the mother, to affecting the welfare of the \nmother, and they are as follows:\n  Myth No. 1: We have heard it said in this body that this is an \naccepted and safe medical procedure, often necessary to save the \nreproductive health and/or life of the mother. I have talked to \nphysicians who perform emergency and elective late-term abortions, both \nin Tennessee and around the country. Many of them had not heard of this \nspecific procedure, but all of them, after hearing it--and I went back \nto the original papers, which I will share--all of them that I talked \nto, condemned it as medically unnecessary--meaning there are in those \nvery rare situations alternative types of therapy--or even dangerous, \ndangerous, to the health of the mother. In every case of severe fetal \nabnormality or medical emergency, there are other alternative \nprocedures that will preserve the life of the mother and the mother's \nreproductive health.\n  Dr. Hern, the author of a textbook entitled ``Abortion Practice,'' \nwhich is a widely accepted text on abortion, disputed the claim that \nthis is a safe procedure in an interview with the American Medical \nNews. He cited, for example, concerns about turning the fetus into a \nbreach position--which is part of this procedure--turning the baby \naround, which can cause placental abruption, or separation of the \nplacenta, and amniotic fluid embolism.\n  In an effort to combat much of the medical and scientific \nmisinformation surrounding this issue, a number of physicians and \nspecialists and medical spokespeople have gotten together, formed a \ncoalition to address some of the medical errors, the medical \nmisinformation, that have been put forward. Dr. C. Everett Koop, a \nformer Surgeon\n\n[[Page S11166]]\n\nGeneral is a member of this coalition. He has also stated that this \nprocedure, in his clinical experience, ``is not a medical necessity for \nthe mother.''\n  I hesitate to go into the procedure, but, again, as a physician, what \nI turn to is the procedure itself as defined in the medical literature. \nSo I turn to a presentation called Dilation and Extraction for Late \nSecond Trimester Abortion, written and presented by Dr. Martin Haskell, \npresented at the National Abortion Federation risk management seminar, \nSeptember 13, 1992. This is the actual paper that was presented. As \nwith any medical paper, there is an introduction, a background, a \npatient selection, a description of the patient operation. Without \ngoing into the entire description of the operation, let me quote from \nthis medical presentation presented at a medical scientific meeting.\n\n       While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix and \n     applying traction to the shoulders with the fingers of the \n     left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt carved \n     Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand [the Metzenbaum \n     scissors are scissors about that size, typically used in \n     surgery.] He carefully advances the tip carved down along the \n     spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact \n     the base of the skull with the tip of his middle finger.\n       Reassessing proper placement of the closed scissors tip and \n     safe elevation of the cervix, the surgeon then forces the \n     scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen \n     magnum. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the \n     scissors to enlarge the opening.\n       The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction \n     catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents. \n     With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the \n     fetus, removing it completely from the patient.\n       The surgeon finally removes the placenta with forceps and \n     scrapes the uterine walls with a large Evans and a 14 mm \n     suction curette. The procedure ends.\n\n  I share this because I have other descriptions, and I have seen the \ngraphics. And I always wonder. ``What filter does this go through \nbefore it gets to the floor of the U.S. Senate, or to the House, or to \nthe newspaper?'' And these are the exact words used in the oral \npresentation at a medical meeting of this procedure by one of its \nproponents.\n  Myth No. 2: This procedure is only performed in cases of severe fetal \nabnormality when the fetus is already dead, or will die immediately \nafter birth.\n  Mr. President, this falsehood has been repeated again and again and \nagain. It has been used as one of the principal defenses of the veto \nhanded down by President Clinton. But the record clearly shows that \nthis is false. Dr. Martin Haskell, one of the best known practitioners \nof this procedure, this partial birth method, told American Medical \nNews that:\n\n       Eighty percent of his partial-birth abortions were done for \n     ``purely elective reasons.''\n\n  Another doctor testified before Congress that he has performed \npartial-birth abortions on late term babies simply because they had a \n``cleft lip.''\n  Myth No. 3: The fetus is already dead or insensitive to pain during \nthis procedure, which I just described, because of the anesthesia \nadministered to the mother.\n  Of all the misconceptions of this debate this has some of the most \ntroubling implications for women's health. Some of the documents \ndistributed to this body have stated ``The fetus dies of an overdose of \nanesthesia given to the mother intravenously.''\n  Mr. President, this is not true. If it were true, then women who \nundergo elective operations during pregnancy--even life-saving \nprocedures done under anesthesia--would probably avoid it because of \nfear of danger to that fetus. And it is wrong I think to scare women to \nendanger their health in order to defend an unnecessary procedure.\n  Let me go back to the paper again, the medical scientific paper, \nbecause I forgot to mention that in closing of the paper, in the \nsummary, the last paragraph on page 33, which says:\n\n       In conclusion, dilation and extraction--the partial birth \n     procedure I just described--is an alternative method for \n     achieving late second trimester abortions to 26 weeks. It can \n     be used in the third trimester.\n\n  So even the author says it is an alternative method. This procedure \nis medically unnecessary.\n  I have heard from a number of my fellow colleagues who have been \noutraged at the blatant misinformation campaign that has come forward.\n  The American Society of Anesthesiologists has issued repeated \nstatements contradicting the argument of fetal death or coma due to \nanesthesia given to the mother.\n  Mr. President, I know that this issue does stir up a lot of emotion. \nBut I think we do need to be careful with the facts. The facts are this \nprocedure is indefensible from a medical standpoint. There is never an \ninstance where it is medically necessary in order to save the life of \nthe mother or her reproductive health.\n  I know a number of my colleagues oppose this bill not because they \nsupport the procedure but on the grounds that they fear further and \nfurther Government intervention into the practice of medicine. And I \ntoo have a fear of excessive Federal Government intervention into that \npractice of medicine. But I do think there comes a time when \nindividuals, a few individuals on the fringe, force us to draw a line \nto protect innocent human life from the sort of brutality which I just \ndescribed to you out of the literature. And I truly feel, Mr. \nPresident, that this is one of those times.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I rise briefly to extend my best regards to \nSenator Bill Cohen as he leaves this body after 18 years in the \ndistinguished service.\n  I have had the good fortune of serving with Senator Cohen on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee for the entire 18 years, and have also \nserved with him on the Subcommittee of Oversight of Government \nManagement on that committee. Sometimes he was the chairman and other \ntimes I was the chairman during this 18-year period. But in either case \nwe were always able to work together and I think make a real difference \nin the management of our Federal programs.\n  Several pieces of legislation stand out for me when I think back over \nour years of working together: First and foremost would be the \nCompensation in Contracting Act which Senator Cohen and I cosponsored \nand got enacted back in 1984. There is a current estimate that perhaps \n$40 to $50 billion in savings resulted from that law. That was a great \npiece of work that he had such an instrumental role in.\n  Then we worked on lobbying reform which has cleaned up our broken \nlobbying disclosure laws and has resulted in the registration of at \nleast twice as many lobbyists and the disclosure of almost five times \nas much money being spent on lobbying activities than we knew of prior \nto this law being passed.\n  We have reauthorized the independent counsel law three times since it \nwas first enacted in 1978.\n  We have struggled with many key issues, including maintaining the \nindependence of the office but continuing to retain important checks. \nIt is far from a perfect law but it has been worth the effort.\n\n  The list of joint efforts is long: Social Security Disability Reform \nAct of 1984; several reauthorizations of the Office of Government \nEthics; oversight hearings on Wedtech; the FAA; Federal courthouse \nconstruction; Federal debarment practices; overloading; security; \nsubcontractor kickbacks; hurry-up spending on medical labs; the United \nStates Synfuels Corporation. We touched on almost every department of \nthe Federal Government.\n  We have taken testimony from a broad cross-section of witnesses from \nhackers to slackers, from crooks to saints, auditors, parents, \nscientists, whistleblowers, meat inspectors, doctors, lawyers, and \nengineers. We have had witnesses behind screens, witnesses with \ndistorted voices, and witnesses giving testimony by phone over a \nspeaker. We have had hearings with all the press, and we have had \nhearings with no press. We have had hearings where everything worked, \nand we have had hearings where nothing seemed to work. We have had \ntestimony that was funny, testimony that was tragic. We have addressed \nissues where the solutions were obvious and achievable, and where the \nanswers were elusive.\n\n[[Page S11167]]\n\n  But, Mr. President, Senator Cohen and I on this little subcommittee \nhave lived through the thick and the thin of congressional life. \nSenator Cohen has done it with integrity, with intelligence, with \nhumor, and with elan, and sometimes with some poetry.\n  He served the people of Maine and the people of this Nation with \ndistinction. The Senate will be a lesser place when he leaves, and I \nwill miss him as a friend and as a colleague. And we wish him nothing \nbut the greatest happiness because he surely deserves it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to \nDean Schofield from Pierre, SD. Dean is retiring this month after \nserving 35 years with the South Dakota Department of Transportation. \nDean's tireless dedication to our State has been exemplary.\n  Dean's career began at the Department in 1961. His career steadily \nadvanced over the years, from an assistant engineer to deputy secretary \nof the Department, the position he held when he announced his \nretirement.\n  Mr. President, during my 22 years in Congress, I have often relied on \nDean's insight and suggestions as I've worked to promote South Dakota's \ntransportation system. Indeed, Dean has always kept me and my staff \naware of South Dakota's transportation priorities.\n  For example, I recall last year when Dean testified before a Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee hearing on rail \nservice. Dean has also lent his expertise on highway and air service \nissues. His knowledge and contributions have been invaluable.\n  I congratulate Dean upon his retirement and offer my good wishes to \nboth he and his wife, Delcie. Dean leaves behind big shoes to fill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of an executive \nproclamation by the Governor of the State of South Dakota honoring Dean \nbe printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the proclamation was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n             Executive Proclamation, State of South Dakota\n\n       Whereas, Jerald D. (Dean) Schofield, a graduate of Pierre \n     High School, with a degree in Civil Engineering from South \n     Dakota State University, started his career with the \n     Department of Transportation on January 9, 1961 in Pierre as \n     an Assistant Engineer, advancing to Project Engineer in 1968, \n     Assistant Secondary Roads Engineer in 1973, Construction \n     Program Engineer in 1974, Office Administrator of Planning \n     and Programs in 1980, Director of the Division of Planning in \n     1986, and Deputy Secretary in 1989, the position he held \n     until his retirement; and\n       Whereas, Dean has been recognized by his peers in national \n     and regional organizations by being selected to serve on many \n     committees as well as being selected as Secretary-Treasurer \n     of the Western Association of State Highway & Transportation \n     Officials (WASHTO); and\n       Whereas, Dean was deeply involved in development the Rural \n     States' position and assisting in the passage of ISTEA, as \n     well as many other Federal issues--his work (as often was the \n     case) was accomplished in the background where he \n     meticulously provided essential support information and was \n     always willing and able to fill in on short notice; and\n       Whereas, Dean has been instrumental in developing the \n     Department's Computerized Needs Data Book, the 5-Year \n     Construction Program with its project prioritization system \n     based on needs; the annual Strategic Plan and the legislative \n     program; and\n       Whereas, Dean served on many Department, as well as several \n     statewide and special Governor's Task Forces; and\n       Whereas, Dean brings a special, although quiet, skill to \n     every area he encounters and has always encouraged other \n     employees and has been a mentor and a model by his leadership \n     and example of superior work ethic and commitment to family, \n     profession, church and community; and\n       Whereas, Dean, through his knowledge, judgment, openness, \n     integrity, thoroughness and organizational skills, has earned \n     the respect of everyone he has dealt with, both within and \n     outside the DOT, including legislators, county commissioners, \n     governors, congressmen, landowners, fellow employees and \n     ordinary highway users; and\n       Whereas, Dean has been voted, by unofficial poll, to be the \n     Department's most considerate and genuinely caring employee \n     and one who will be sorely missed by his many friends and co-\n     workers; and\n       Whereas, after 35 years and 8 months of exemplary service \n     to the state of South Dakota and the SDDOT, it is now time \n     for Dean to retire to his home in Pierre with Delcie, his \n     wife of 32 years, to devote his time to traveling, carpentry, \n     gardening, attending athletic events, and enjoying his 3 \n     children, Darrell, Darla, and Davis, and 5 grandchildren, \n     Brittanie, Matthew, Nathan, Taylor, and Kaitlyn, and it is \n     fitting and proper as Governor to recognize the many \n     accomplishments of this outstanding South Dakotan:\n       Now, therefore, I, William J.

Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues \nto join me in congratulating Nellie Norton Schnell of Fayette, MO, who \nwill celebrate her 100th birthday this Friday, September 27, 1996. She \nis a truly remarkable individual. Nellie has witnessed many of the \nevents that have shaped our Nation into the greatest the world has ever \nknown. The longevity of her life has meant much more, however, to the \nmany relatives and friends whose lives she has touched over the last \n100 years.\n\n  Nellie Norton Schnell's celebration of 100 years of life is a \ntestament to me and all Missourians. Despite being visually and hearing \nimpaired, Nellie organized and planned her own birthday celebration to \ntake place this Friday at her grand-daughter's home in Boonville, MO. \nHer achievements are significant and deserve to be saluted and \nrecognized. I would like to join her many friends and relatives in \nwishing her health and happiness in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11167-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11167-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11167-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11167-S11168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:56 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1281.

A bill to amend chapter 71 of title V, United States Code, \nto prohibit the use of Federal funds for certain Federal employee labor \norganization activities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                      UNION ACTIVITIES LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation that would affect every American \ntaxpayer. This measure would prohibit Federal funds\n\n[[Page S11170]]\n\nfrom being used to pay Federal employees while working on union \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, I was shocked by a recent Government Accounting Office \n[GAO] report to Congress concerning union activities at the Social \nSecurity Administration [SSA]. I understand that Federal employees have \nthe right to be represented by a union. However, I completely disagree \nthat the American taxpayer should foot the bill for this \nrepresentation.\n  The results of the GAO report are astounding and very disturbing. The \nGAO reported that over 413,000 hours were spent by Federal employees \nlast year on union activities at the SSA. This cost the American \ntaxpayers approximately $12.6 million in salaries and expenses. This \ndoes not even count the amount of time management spent answering union \nconcerns. The cost involved for management to respond may be double the \nnearly $13 million we spent on the union representatives. The GAO \nidentified 1,800 SSA employees who are authorized by the union to spend \ntime on SSA union activities; I repeat, Mr. President, 1,800 Federal \nemployees, paid by the U.S. Government to do union work. Currently, 146 \nof those representatives are considered to be full-time. In other \nwords, 146 Federal employees are spending 100 percent of their time at \nthe Social Security Administration working on union activities, not \nserving Social Security beneficiaries and the taxpayer, but doing full-\ntime union work. These figures are for just one agency. In 1993, \nPresident Clinton issued Executive Order 12871, which requires agencies \nto involve labor organizations as full ``partners'' with management \nin identifying problems and creating solutions. In the time that this \nExecutive order has been in effect, the cost to the American taxpayer \nfor union activity at SSA alone has more than doubled. Further, Federal \nemployees who are performing union work full-time has jumped from 80 to \n146. There are still some 1,654 additional SSA employees working part-\ntime on union activities. Mr. President, this is outrageous.\n\n  As I stated, these figures are only for the SSA. I have, therefore, \nrequested that the GAO prepare a similar report to the one conducted at \nSSA, which would address union activity within the entire Federal \nGovernment. It is my feeling that the aggregate numbers will be equally \nas staggering and shocking as those found at SSA.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of legislation, authored by my good \nfriend, Senator Faircloth, which would prohibit using money from the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds for union activities at SSA \nand the Department of Health and Human Services. However, I think we \nshould go even further. No Federal money should be used to subsidize \nunion work within any Government agency. Our Government workers should \nbe attending to the business for which they were hired while on the \nAmerican taxpayer's time. The union representatives at Federal agencies \nwere not hired to do the work of the unions. They were hired to perform \nspecific duties pertaining to the official business of the Federal \nagency that employs them.\n  The legislation I am introducing would ensure that union activities \nat the Federal level are not financed by the already heavily burdened \nAmerican taxpayer. Mr. President, let the unions pay the salaries and \nexpenses of those who perform union work; and let our tax money be used \nto do the work of the American people.\n  The able Majority Leader, Senator Lott, Senators Faircloth, Helms, \nand Kassebaum are original cosponsors. I invite my other colleagues to \njoin us in support of this important measure to correct an absolute \nmisuse of Federal funds.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the GAO report regarding union \nactivities at the Social Security Administration be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Union Activity at the Social Security Administration\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am pleased \n     to be here today to discuss the time spent on union \n     activities at the Social Security Administration (SSA). Union \n     activities generally include representing employees in \n     complaints against management, bargaining over changes in \n     working conditions and the application of personnel policies, \n     and negotiating union contracts with management. The federal \n     government pays its employees' salaries and expenses for the \n     portion of time they are allowed to spend on union \n     activities; it also provides other support such as space, \n     supplies, equipment, and some travel expenses.\\1\\ Federal \n     union members generally cannot bargain over wages and cannot \n     strike, and federal employees are not required to join unions \n     and pay union dues in order to be represented by the union.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Given the budget constraints facing federal agencies, the \n     Subcommittee expressed concern about the amount of time and \n     expenses devoted to union activities and paid for by the \n     federal government. The Subcommittee expressed particular \n     concern about SSA unions regarding the amount of money paid \n     for union activities out of the Social Security trust funds.\n       As requested, I will focus my remarks on the history of \n     union involvement in the federal government, the statutory \n     basis for the federal government to pay employee salaries and \n     expenses for union activities, and the amount of time spent \n     on and costs associated with union activities at SSA and how \n     the agency accounts for it. The Subcommittee also asked us to \n     comment on how the amount of time and money spent at SSA on \n     union activities compares with what is spent at other large \n     federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     (VA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and how it \n     compares with the amount spent by the U.S. Postal Service, \n     which operates more like a private-sector company. As \n     requested, we have also provided information on union \n     activities in the private sector.\n       In response to your request, we began our work at SSA in \n     August 1995. To develop this information, we interviewed \n     management and union officials in SSA headquarters and 4 of \n     SSA's 10 regional offices. We also reviewed union contracts, \n     payroll records, and time-reporting forms. To determine the \n     amount of time spent on union activities, we reviewed yearly \n     reports of time spent on union activities and verified the \n     time reported by reviewing source documents at one region and \n     selected headquarters components. We supplemented our field \n     work with telephone calls to three additional SSA regions to \n     verify that similar time reporting procedures were used.\n       We also met with union and management officials at VA, IRS, \n     and the Postal Service to compare their union time and costs \n     with SSA's. VA does not operate a national union time-\n     reporting system and therefore could not provide data on \n     union activities. Consequently, we are not providing any \n     information concerning VA. At IRS and the Postal Service, we \n     obtained available information on union activity from \n     headquarters and selected field facilities but did not verify \n     its accuracy. We also discussed the role and function of \n     unions in the federal government with the Office of Personnel \n     Management (OPM) and discussed the private-sector use of \n     official time for union activities with labor-relations \n     experts at various trade associations, colleges, and \n     universities. We also reviewed a 1992 Bureau of National \n     Affairs publication that summarized trends in labor/\n     management contracts for private industry. Finally, to \n     determine the types of contract provisions that exist in \n     private industry with regard to the use of official time, we \n     reviewed ten contracts on file at the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics.\n       In summary, federal labor/management relations were \n     formalized by executive order in the early 1960s.\\2\\ In 1962, \n     an executive order permitted federal agencies to grant \n     official time for certain meetings between management and \n     union representatives, at the discretion of the agency. The \n     management control prevalent when the first executive order \n     was issued has evolved over time, and today unions operating \n     at federal government agencies have significant involvement \n     in operational and management decisions. The use of official \n     time, which is authorized paid time off from assigned duties \n     for union activities, has become a routine method of union \n     operation in the federal government. OPM officials told us \n     that currently no governmentwide requirement exists to \n     capture or report the amount of official time charged to \n     union activities. They further noted that managers and \n     employees would spend time interacting on personnel and \n     working condition matters even if there were no unions \n     operating at agencies.\n       We determined that over the last 6 years, the time spent on \n     union activities at SSA has grown from 254,000 to at least \n     413,000 hours, at a cost to SSA's trust funds of $12.6 \n     million in 1995 alone. That is, SSA currently pays the \n     equivalent of the salaries and expenses of about 200 SSA \n     employees to represent the interests of the approximately \n     52,000 employees represented by unions at SSA. This cost \n     represents a portion of the $5.5 billion SSA incurred in \n     administrative expenses for fiscal year 1995.\n       In addition, SSA has reported to the Congress that the \n     number of full-time union representatives, those devoting 75 \n     percent or more of their time to union activities, grew from \n     80 to 145 between 1993 and 1995. We found, however, that the \n     reporting system for collecting such data does not adequately \n     track the number of union representatives charging time to \n     union activities or the actual time spent. Consequently, we \n     conducted a limited verification of the hours spent on union \n     activities reported by SSA and found\n\n[[Page S11171]]\n\n     that time spent on union activities was underreported. While \n     SSA is currently developing a new system to more accurately \n     track the time spent on union activities, it plans to \n     implement this system to replace only the automated reporting \n     system for union representatives in the field offices and \n     teleservice centers. SSA is not planning to improve the less \n     accurate manual time-reporting system for its other \n     components.\n       Under the terms of the current SSA union contract \n     negotiated in 1993, the selection of union representatives \n     and the amount of time they spend on union activities are \n     determined by the union without the consent of local \n     managers. We found that over 1,800 designated union \n     representatives in SSA are authorized to spend time on union \n     activities, although most of the time spent is by SSA's 146 \n     full-time representatives. Some SSA field managers told us \n     that their having no involvement in decisions about how much \n     time is spent by individuals and who the individuals are \n     causes problems in managing the day-to-day activities of \n     their operations. Union representatives, on the other hand, \n     told us that the time they use is necessary to fully \n     represent the interests of their coworkers.\n       SSA reported that it paid for 404,000 hours for union \n     activities in fiscal year 1995, as compared with 442,000 \n     hours reported by IRS in fiscal year 1994, the most recent \n     information available. The Postal Service reported that 1.7 \n     million hours spent on union activities in fiscal year 1995 \n     related to grievances. This Postal Service estimate does not \n     include substantial additional time spent on other types of \n     union activities and paid for by either the unions or the \n     Postal Service.\n       With regard to union activity in private industry, some \n     employers pay some or all of the salaries and expenses of \n     union representatives, as the federal government does, while \n     others do not.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Labor unions are groups of employees organized to bargain \n     with employers over such issues as wages, hours, benefits, \n     and working conditions. The current federal labor/management \n     program differs from nonfederal programs in three important \n     ways: (1) federal unions bargain on a limited number of \n     issues--bargaining over pay and other economic benefits is \n     generally prohibited,\\1\\ (2) strikes and lockouts are \n     prohibited, and (3) federal employees cannot be compelled \n     to join, or pay dues to, the unions that represent them. \n     At SSA, employees are represented by three unions: the \n     American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which \n     represents over 95 percent of SSA employees who are \n     represented by a union; the National Treasury Employees \n     Union (NTEU); and the National Federation of Federal \n     Employees (NFFE). Of SSA's 65,000 employees, about 52,000 \n     nonsupervisory employees are represented by the unions, \n     and about 47 percent of those represented are dues-paying \n     union members. Union operations at SSA are governed by a \n     national AFGE contract and six other union contracts with \n     individual NTEU and NFFE components.\n       At the other federal organizations we visited, five unions \n     had national collective bargaining agreements--four at the \n     Postal Service and one at IRS. There were 751,000 employees \n     represented by unions at the Postal Service and 97,000 at the \n     IRS. Although other unions without national collective \n     bargaining agreements represented Postal Service employees, \n     the number of employees represented by these unions is less \n     than one percent of all represented employees.\n       There are two main categories of official time, or \n     government paid time spent on union activities, at SSA. The \n     category known as ``bank time'' in field offices, and \n     equivalent categories of official time in other components, \n     refers to time that is negotiated and limited by SSA \n     contracts with its unions. Bank time includes time spent on \n     union- or employee-initiated grievances (complaints regarding \n     any matter related to employment) as well as on union-\n     initiated activities, such as training or representational \n     duties. The category known as ``nonbank time'' in field \n     offices, and equivalent categories in other components, \n     generally refers to time spent on management-initiated \n     activities; bargaining over changes to work assignments and \n     working conditions (such as disallowed leave, employee work \n     space, and equipment); management-initiated grievances; and \n     any other time not specifically designated as bank time.\n\n\n          history of union activity in the federal government\n\n       In 1912, the Lloyd-LaFollette Act established the right of \n     postal employees to join a union and set a precedent for \n     other federal employees to join unions. The government did \n     little to provide agencies with guidance on labor relations \n     until the early 1960s.\n       In 1962, President Kennedy issued Executive Order 10988, \n     establishing in the executive branch a framework for federal \n     agencies to bargain with unions over working conditions and \n     personnel practices. The order established a decentralized \n     labor/management program under which each agency had \n     discretion in interpreting the order, deciding individual \n     agency policy, and settling its own contract disputes and \n     grievances.\n       In 1969, President Nixon issued Executive Order 11491, \n     which established a process for resolving labor disputes in \n     the executive branch by forming the Federal Labor Relations \n     Council to prescribe regulations and arbitrate grievances. \n     This order clarified language to expressly permit bargaining \n     on operational issues for employees adversely affected by \n     organizational realignments or technological changes.\n       In 1970, the Postal Reorganization Act brought postal labor \n     relations under a structure similar to that applicable to \n     companies in the private sector. Collective bargaining for \n     wages, hours, and working conditions was authorized subject \n     to regulation by the National Labor Relations Board. Like \n     other federal employees, postal employees could not be \n     compelled to join or pay dues to a union and could not \n     strike.\n       The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 provided a statutory \n     basis for the current federal labor/management relations \n     program and set up an independent body, the Federal Labor \n     Relations Authority (FLRA), to administer the program. The \n     act expanded the scope of collective bargaining--the process \n     under which union representatives and management bargain over \n     working conditions--to allow routine negotiation of some \n     operational issues, such as the use of technology and the \n     means for conducting agency operations.\n       In 1993, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12871, \n     which articulated a new vision of labor/management relations, \n     called ``Partnership.'' Partnership required agencies to \n     involve labor organizations as full partners with management \n     in identifying problems and crafting solutions to better \n     fulfill the agency mission. It also expanded the scope of \n     bargainable issues. This new arrangement was intended to end \n     the sometimes adversarial relationship between federal unions \n     and management and to help facilitate implementation of \n     National Performance Review initiatives, which were intended \n     to improve public service and reduce cost of government.\n\n\n           basis for paying salaries of union representatives\n\n       In 1962, Executive Order 10988 permitted federal agencies \n     to grant official time, which is authorized paid time off \n     from assigned government duties, for meetings between \n     management and union representatives for contract \n     negotiation, at the discretion of the agency. In 1971, \n     Executive Order 11491 was amended to prohibit the use of \n     official time for contract negotiation unless the agency \n     and union agreed to certain arrangements. Specifically, \n     the agency could authorize either (1) up to 40 hours of \n     official time for negotiation during regular working hours \n     or (2) up to one-half the time actually spent in \n     negotiations. Over the next 4 years, a series of Federal \n     Labor Relations Council decisions and regulations \n     continued to liberalize the use of official time by \n     allowing negotiations for the use of official time for \n     other purposes.\n       The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 authorized official \n     time for federal agency union representatives in negotiating \n     a collective bargaining agreement. \\4\\ The act also permitted \n     agencies and unions to negotiate whether union \n     representatives would be granted official time in connection \n     with other labor/management activities, as long as the \n     official time was deemed reasonable, necessary, and in the \n     public interest. The act continued to permit agencies to \n     provide unions with routine services and facilities at agency \n     expense. The act prohibited the use of official time for \n     internal union business, such as solicitation of members.\n\n\n           TIME SPENT ON AND COST OF UNION ACTIVITIES AT SSA\n\n       SSA has a national system for reporting time spent on union \n     activities by union representatives. This system is separate \n     from the agency's time and attendance and workload reporting \n     systems. Under this system, union representatives generally \n     fill out and submit forms to their supervisors to account for \n     union time. The hours reported on these forms are then \n     periodically aggregated and submitted to SSA headquarters for \n     totaling. This time-reporting system consists of two \n     component systems that cover roughly an equal number of \n     employees. The first is an automated system that captures \n     time reported by union representatives working in field \n     offices, which are the primary point of public contact with \n     SSA, and at teleservice centers, where calls to SSA's \n     national 800 number are answered. The second component is a \n     manual system used to capture time spent by union \n     representatives at SSA headquarters, as well as at Program \n     Service Centers, the Office of Hearings and Appeals, and \n     other components. Neither system is designed to capture \n     either time spent by management on union-related matters or \n     the number or names of individuals charging union time.\n       We conducted a limited verification of time captured in \n     SSA's national reporting system at one SSA region and several \n     headquarters components. By tracing source documents for \n     union representatives' time to reported totals in the system, \n     we discovered additional time not captured by the two \n     systems. These gaps occurred primarily in the manual system \n     and resulted from inaccurate reporting from the source \n     documents, overlooked reports for some union representatives, \n     and uncounted reports for some organizational units during \n     certain reporting periods. We also verified that similar \n     procedures were being used at three other regions, which \n     could result in similar underreporting at these locations.\n       The overall time spent on union activities has grown \n     steadily from 254,000 hours in 1990 to over 413,000 in 1995. \n     This is the equivalent\n\n[[Page S11172]]\n\n     of paying the salaries and other expenses of about 200 SSA \n     employees to represent the 52,000 employees in the bargaining \n     unit in 1995. SSA reported 254,000 hours of official time \n     devoted to union activities in 1990, 269,000 in 1991, 272,000 \n     in 1992, 314,000 in 1993, 297,000 in 1994, and 404,000 in \n     1995.\n       Because of limitations in SSA's reporting system, it is not \n     possible to estimate actual time spent agencywide for any \n     reporting period. Although it is likely that the actual time \n     spent agencywide exceeds our estimates, our verification \n     sample was not large enough to be statistically valid, so it \n     cannot be extrapolated to all of SSA.\n       To determine what contributed to the increase in time spent \n     on union activities, we developed information on the \n     categories of time used.\n       SSA is currently developing a new system to better track \n     and account for time spent on union activities in its field \n     offices and teleservice centers. SSA says the purpose of this \n     system is to provide management and the union with a more \n     accurate and up-to-date accounting of time spent and the \n     number of employees working on union activities and to ensure \n     that time expended on certain activities does not exceed time \n     allotted to the unions by the contracts. SSA, however, has no \n     current plans to apply this new system to headquarters, the \n     Program Service Centers, the Office of Hearings and Appeals, \n     or other components using the manual system and did not \n     explain why the agency made this decision.\n       SSA has no system for routinely calculating and reporting \n     the cost of union activity, although it does provide annual \n     estimates of the expenses for union activities to the \n     Congress.\n       In order to determine the accuracy of these estimates, we \n     tried to construct our own estimate of union-related costs. \n     Because the salaries of union representatives make up most of \n     the cost, we asked SSA for a list of current representatives \n     and the time they spend on union activities. SSA estimated \n     that there were about 1,600 union representatives, but the \n     lists they maintained were outdated and incomplete. We \n     identified about 1,800 union representatives who are \n     currently authorized by the union to spend time on SSA union \n     activities. SSA has also reported to the Congress that the \n     number of full-time representatives--those spending 75 \n     percent or more of their time on union activities--grew from \n     80 to 145 between fiscal years 1993 and 1995. We identified \n     145 current full-time representatives. The average annual \n     salary in 1995 for the 146 full-time representatives was \n     $41,970. In 1996, their salaries ranged from $23,092 to \n     $81,217.\n       We estimate that the total cost to SSA for union activities \n     of all representatives was about $12.6 million in 1995. We \n     calculated the 1995 personnel cost to be $11.4 million by \n     multiplying the average hourly salary of union \n     representatives (about $27.64, including benefits) by the \n     413,000 hours we estimated the representatives spent on union \n     activities.\n       The remaining $1.2 million in total SSA costs for union \n     activities includes related travel expenses; SSA's share of \n     arbitration costs; and support costs, such as supplies, \n     office space, and telephone use. More specifically, in \n     accordance with the union contracts, SSA pays for travel \n     related to contract negotiations and grievance cases. In \n     addition, it pays the travel and per-diem costs of all union \n     representatives, whenever meetings are held at management's \n     initiative. Union representation at major SSA initiatives, \n     such as the reengineering of its disability programs, the \n     National Partnership Council, and Partnership training, has \n     added to travel and per-diem costs. In 1995, SSA estimated \n     that it spent about $600,000 on travel-related expenses for \n     union representatives. Union representatives told us that the \n     union pays travel costs for union-sponsored training, \n     internal union activities, and some local travel.\n       Under the national contract agreements, arbitration fees \n     and related expenses are shared equally between the union and \n     SSA. SSA reported that its share of arbitration costs was \n     $54,000 for the 38 cases heard in 1995.\n       SSA also incurs other costs for telephones, computers, fax \n     machines, furniture, space and supplies used by union \n     representatives. In 1995, SSA estimated this cost at \n     $500,000.\n       Regarding the amount of dues collected from union members, \n     we determined that about $4.8 million was collected in 1995, \n     mainly through payroll deduction. The unions use these funds \n     for their internal expenses, which include the cost of \n     lodging and transportation for union-provided training; the \n     union's share of grievance costs; miscellaneous furniture, \n     supplies, and equipment for some union offices; the salaries \n     of the AFGE local president and his staff, who represent SSA \n     headquarters employees; and a share of national union \n     expenses.\n       The recent advent of Partnership activities in SSA will \n     likely increase the time spent on union activities. The \n     executive order on Partnership directs agencies to involve \n     unions as the representatives of employees to work as full \n     partners with management to design and implement changes \n     necessary to reform government. Partnership activities at SSA \n     are just starting, and we found that these limited activities \n     are not routinely designated by SSA in its union time-\n     reporting system. It is possible that time spent on \n     Partnership activities is currently being reported in other \n     activity categories. Consequently, as Partnership activities \n     increase, we would expect the time devoted to them to also \n     increase. However, this will be evident only if agency time-\n     reporting systems adequately designate this time. It should \n     be noted that many public and private organizations without \n     unions are involving employees in quality management \n     initiatives similar to Partnership activities.\n\n\n              ssa management and union views on union time\n\n       SSA managers and union officials and representatives have \n     offered their views about the use of official time for union \n     activities. SSA managers, both individually and through their \n     managers' associations, have expressed concern to us and to \n     the Congress about limitations in their ability to \n     effectively manage their operations and control the use of \n     time spent by their employees under the current union/\n     management arrangement. By contract, the assignment of union \n     representatives and the amount of time they spend on union \n     activities are determined by the union without the consent of \n     local management.\n       Of the 31 field managers we interviewed, 21 said that it is \n     more difficult to manage day-to-day office functions because \n     they have little or no control over when and how union \n     activities are conducted. They said that they have trouble \n     maintaining adequate staffing levels in the office to serve \n     walk-in traffic, answer the telephones, and handle routine \n     office workloads. Additionally, 18 expressed concern about \n     the amount of time they spend responding to union requests \n     for information regarding bargaining and grievances. We did \n     not verify the accuracy of any of the field managers' \n     statements. We tried to quantify the time spent by managers \n     on union related activities, but SSA had no time reporting \n     system to track it. However, managers would be spending some \n     of their time interacting with employees about similar issues \n     even if there were no unions.\n       Nine out of the 15 union officials and representatives we \n     talked to felt that it was counterproductive in the \n     Partnership era to track time spent on union activities. They \n     believe that union representation is an important function \n     that is authorized by a negotiated agreement with SSA that \n     authorizes them to represent the interests of their \n     coworkers. They consider the amount of time currently \n     allocated for their activities as appropriate and believe \n     that more attention should be paid to the value of their \n     efforts than to the time it takes to conduct them.\n\n\ncomparison of time spent and cost of union activity at irs, the postal \n                            service and ssa\n\n       The Postal Service and IRS provided data to us on time \n     spent on union activities in their agencies. Postal Service \n     records show that during fiscal year 1995, union \n     representatives at the Postal Service reported spending 1.7 \n     million hours of official time on grievance processing and \n     handling in the early stages. This number does not include \n     substantial amounts of official time spent on employee \n     involvement programs similar to SSA's Partnership activities, \n     which are paid for by the Postal Service. Neither does this \n     number include official time spent on activities such as \n     employee involvement training and ULP charges.\n       IRS records showed that their union representatives \n     reported spending 442,000 hours on union activities in fiscal \n     year 1994, the most recent year for which data are available. \n     We did not attempt to verify these estimates. In fiscal year \n     1995, the Postal Service reported spending $29 million in \n     basic pay on grievance processing and handling for the 1.7 \n     million hours. IRS did not develop cost data for union \n     operations.\n\n\n               who pays union costs in private industry?\n\n       Union operations in private industry vary widely. In \n     addition to bargaining over working conditions as SSA unions \n     do, unions in private industry bargain over wages, hours, and \n     benefits. In discussions with National Labor Relations Board \n     officials, we were told that some private-sector firms do not \n     pay their employees' salaries for the time they spend \n     performing union activities, and other firms pay for some or \n     all of the time. For example, during our review of 10 \n     contracts, we found that 7 provided for company employees, \n     acting as union representatives, to perform certain union \n     functions in addition to their company duties, at the expense \n     of the employer. In a 1992 publication that summarized basic \n     patterns in private industry union contracts, the Bureau of \n     National Affairs (BNA) reported that over 50 percent of the \n     400 labor contracts it analyzed guaranteed pay to employees \n     engaged in union activity on company time. It also reported \n     that 22 percent of the contracts specifically prohibit \n     conducting union activities on company time.\n       Private-sector employers negotiate company time with pay \n     for union representatives to handle grievances more \n     frequently than they do for contract negotiations. Of the \n     contracts reviewed by BNA, 53 percent guaranteed pay for \n     union representatives to present, investigate, or handle \n     grievances. This practice was reported occurring twice as \n     often in manufacturing as in nonmanufacturing businesses. BNA \n     reported that only 10 percent of the contracts guaranteed pay \n     for employees to negotiate contracts.\n       Forty-one percent of the private-sector contracts \n     guaranteeing employees pay when they conduct union activities \n     on company time place restrictions on representatives. BNA \n     reported that in 19 percent of the cases with such pay \n     guarantees, management limited the amount of hours that it \n     would pay\n\n[[Page S11173]]\n\n     for. Our review of 10 private-sector contracts submitted to \n     the Bureau of Labor Statistics found one negotiated contract \n     under which employees were limited to 6 hours a day of \n     company time for union representation and another under which \n     they were limited to 8 hours per week of company time for \n     processing grievances.\n\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       SSA, like other federal agencies and some private firms, \n     pays for approved time spent by their employees on union \n     activities. SSA has a special fiduciary responsibility to \n     effectively manage and maintain the integrity of the Social \n     Security trust funds from which most of these expenses are \n     paid. In a time of shrinking budgets and personnel resources, \n     it is especially important for SSA, as well as other \n     agencies, to evaluate how resources are being spent and to \n     have reliable monitoring systems that facilitate this \n     evaluation.\n       To ensure accurate tracking of time spent on union \n     activities and the staff conducting these activities, SSA has \n     developed and is testing a new time-reporting system for its \n     field offices and teleservice centers. We agree that these \n     are valuable goals for a time-reporting system and believe \n     that it should be implemented agencywide, including at \n     headquarters, Program Service Centers, the Office of Hearings \n     and Appeals, and other components currently using the less \n     reliable manual reporting system. With an improved agencywide \n     system, SSA management should have better information on \n     where its resources are being spent.\n       Mr. Chairman, this concludes my formal remarks. I would be \n     happy to answer any question from you or other members of the \n     Subcommittee. Thank you.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The U.S. Postal Service generally does not pay the \n     salaries and expenses of full-time union representatives. \n     Instead, salaries and expenses are covered by union dues.

A bill to amend the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 \nto prohibit the placement of members of the United States Armed Forces \nunder the command, direction, or control of the United Nations, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n   the united nations participation act of 1945 amendment act of 1996\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for several months, I have tried \nto get a straight answer from the administration on the legal \njustification for the deployment of U.S. troops under United Nations' \ncommand in Macedonia. While the soldiers have a mission, I do not \nbelieve they have a clear, legal mandate.\n  The question of our involvement in Macedonia was first brought to my \nattention by Ron Ray, a constituent of mine who was representing \nMichael New. Apparently, Michael New asked his commanding officer to \nprovide some explanation as to why an American Army specialist was \nbeing asked to wear a U.N. uniform and deploy to Macedonia under the \nU.N. flag.\n  In a recent hearing with Ambassador Madeleine Albright, usually one \nof the more plain spoken members of the President's foreign policy \nteam, we reviewed the procedures for deploying American troops under \nthe United Nation's flag. She offered the view that while there were \nclear guidelines defining chapter VII deployments, using chapter VI to \njustify a mission had evolved as a matter of U.N. custom and tradition.\n  Since 1948, 27 peace operations have been authorized by the United \nNations Security Council. In addition to being authorized by a specific \nchapter of the United Nations Charter, U.S. troop deployments must be \nauthorized consistent with U.S. legal requirements spelled out in the \nUnited Nations Participation Act.\n  In July 1993, President Clinton wrote the Congress stating, ``U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 795 established the UNPROFOR Macedonia \nmission under a chapter VI of the U.N. Charter and UNPROFOR Macedonia \nis a peacekeeping force under chapter VI of the Charter.'' But this \nassertion is not substantiated by the record of resolutions and reports \npassed by the United Nations.\n  Between 1991 and the end of 1995, the United Nations passed 97 \nSecurity Council resolutions related to the former Yugoslavia. In \naddition, 13 reports were issued by the U.N. Secretary General relative \nto the mandate of the UNPROFOR Macedonia operation. None of these \nresolutions or reports mention a chapter VI mandate for Macedonia. In \nfact, there are 27 resolutions which specifically refer to UNPROFOR, \nwhich includes Macedonia, as chapter VII. It is worth pointing to just \none of\n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\nthese resolutions which states that the United Nations Security Council \nwas ``Determined to ensure the security of UNPROFOR and its freedom of \nmovement for all its missions (i.e., Macedonia) and to these ends was \nacting under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.''\n  In spite of the record, the administration continues to insist that \nMacedonia is a chapter VI operation. When I asked them to document this \ndetermination, I was provided the following guidance by the Acting \nAssistant Secretary of State:\n\n       The U.N. Charter authority underlying the mandate of a U.N. \n     peace operation depends on an interpretation of the relevant \n     resolutions of the U.N. Security Council. As a matter of \n     tradition, the Security Council explicitly refers to a \n     ``Chapter VII'' when it authorizes an enforcement operation \n     under that Chapter. The absence of a reference to Chapter VII \n     in a resolution authorizing or establishing a peacekeeping \n     operation thus indicates that the operation is not considered \n     by the Security Council to be an enforcement operation. \n     Neither does the Security Council refer explicitly to \n     ``Chapter VI'' in its resolutions pertaining to peacekeeping \n     operations. This practice evolved over time as a means for \n     the Security Council to develop practical responses to \n     problems without unnecessarily invoking the full panoply of \n     provisions regarding the use of force under Chapter VII, and \n     without triggering other Charter provisions that might impede \n     Member States on the Security Council if Chapter VI were \n     referenced.\n\n  In essence what this explanation means is U.S. troops can be deployed \nin harm's way as a matter of U.N. tradition rather than U.S. law. It \nmeans U.S. soldiers are deployed in a combat zone with an absence of \nreference to the actual legal mandate because the U.N. Security Council \ndoes not want to refer explicitly to chapter VI due to a reluctance to \ninconvenience member states on the Security Council.\n  Mr. President, let me try to add a little clarity to just what the \nActing Assistant Secretary means when stating the administration does \nnot want to invoke a ``panoply of provisions regarding the use of \nforce.'' In simple English, when a chapter VII mission is authorized by \nthe U.N., U.S. law requires the operation to be approved by the \nCongress. In simple terms, the State Department is using a chapter VI \ndesignation to avoid having to come to the Congress to justify the \nfinancial and military burden the United States has assumed in \nMacedonia.\n  When the State Department calls a panoply of provisions problem, I \ncall surrendering U.S. interests to U.N. command. This is not the first \ntime Congress has been circumvented. I had hoped the administration had \nlearned from our experience in Somalia. I had hoped the tragic loss of \nlife would help the President understand the value and importance of a \nfull congressional debate and approval of the merits of deploying \nAmerican soldiers overseas into hostile conditions. Apparently, the \nlesson is lost on this administration. When the U.N. calls, we send our \nyoung men and women to serve.\n  Mr. President, I have taken the time to review the circumstances of \nour military involvement in Macedonia, in order to explain why I am \nintroducing legislation today which assures U.S. troops will not serve \nunder U.N. commanders and will not be forced to wear a U.N. uniform. \nOur soldiers sign up to serve and pledge allegiance to their Nation--\nnot the United Nations. This bill will protect them as they fulfill \nboth their oath and responsibilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Robb and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2107. A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment--most-favored-nation treatment--to the products of Mongolia; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            mongolia most-favored-nation status legislation\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs to introduce S. 2107, a bill to \nauthorize the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment--formerly known \nas most-favored-nation status--to the products of Mongolia. I am \npleased to be joined by the subcommittee's ranking minority member, \nSenator Robb, and Senator McCain as original cosponsors.\n  Mongolia has undergone a series of remarkable and dramatic changes \nover the last few years. Sandwiched between the former Soviet Union and \nChina, it was one of the first countries in the world to become \nCommunist after the Russian revolution. After 70 years of Communist \nrule, though, the Mongolian people recently have made great progress in \nestablishing a democratic political system and creating a free-market \neconomy. Just this year, the country held its third election under its \nnew constitution, resulting in a parliamentary majority for the \ncoalition of democratic opposition parties. Rather than attempt to \nmaintain its hold on power, the former government peaceably--and \ncommendably--transferred power to the new government.\n  Mongolia has demonstrated a strong desire to build a friendly and \ncooperative relationship with the United States on trade and related \nmatters since its turn toward democracy. We concluded a bilateral trade \ntreaty with that country in 1991, and a bilateral investment treaty in \n1994. Mongolia has received nondiscriminatory trading status since \n1991, and has been found to be in full compliance with the freedom of \nemigration requirements under title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. In \naddition, it has acceded to the Agreement Establishing the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Mr. President, Mongolia has clearly demonstrated that it is fully \ndeserving of joining the ranks of those countries to which we extend \nnondiscriminatory trade status. The extension of that status would not \nonly serve to commend the Mongolians on their fine progress, but would \nalso enable the United States to avail itself of all its rights under \nthe WTO with respect to Mongolia.\n\n  I have another, more personal, reason for being interested in MFN \nstatus for Mongolia. Mongolia and my home State of Wyoming are sister \nstates; a strong relationship between the two has developed over the \npast 3 years. Several Mongolian Provincial Governors have visited the \nState, and the two governments have established partnerships in \neducation and agriculture. Like Wyoming, Mongolia is a high plateau \nwith high mountains on the northwest border, where many of the \ninhabitants make their living by raising livestock. I am pleased to see \nthe development of this mutually beneficial relationship, and am sure \nthat the extension of nondiscriminatory trade status will serve to \nstrengthen it further.\n  Mr. President, Congressman Bereuter has introduced similar \nlegislation in the House. While we both realize that it is probably too \nlate in the legislative year to move this bill forward before we \nadjourn sine die, we hope that introducing the bill now will serve as a \nstarting point to move forward with this important measure early in the \nnext Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that Mongolia--\n       (1) has received most-favored-nation treatment since 1991 \n     and has been found to be in full compliance with the freedom \n     of emigration requirements under title IV of the Trade Act of \n     1974;\n       (2) has since ending its nearly 70 years of dependence on \n     the former Soviet Union, made remarkable progress in \n     establishing a democratic political system and creating a \n     free-market economic system;\n       (3) has recently held its third election under its new \n     constitution, resulting in a parliamentary majority for the \n     coalition of democratic opposition parties and a peaceable \n     transfer of power to the new government;\n       (4) has concluded a bilateral trade treaty with the United \n     States in 1991, and a bilateral investment treaty in 1994;\n       (5) has acceded to the Agreement Establishing the World \n     Trade Organization;\n       (6) has demonstrated a strong desire to build a friendly \n     and cooperative relationship with the United States on trade \n     matters; and\n       (7) the extension of unconditional most-favored-nation \n     treatment to the products of Mongolia would enable the United \n     States to avail itself of all rights under the World Trade \n     Organization with respect to Mongolia.\n\n     SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE IV OF THE TRADE \n                   ACT OF 1974 TO MONGOLIA.\n\n       (a) Presidential Determinations and Extensions of \n     Nondiscriminatory Treatment.--Notwithstanding any provision \n     of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et \n     seq.), the President may--\n       (1) determine that such title should no longer apply to \n     Mongolia; and\n\n[[Page S11175]]\n\n       (2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with \n     respect to Mongolia, proclaim the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) \n     to the products of that country.\n       (b) Termination of Application of Title IV.--On or after \n     the effective date of the extension under subsection (a)(2) \n     of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products on Mongolia, \n     title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 shall cease to apply to \n     that country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Biden, Mr. Breaux, \n        Mr. Coats, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Ford, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Lott, Mr. Mack, Mr. McConnell, \n        Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Pressler, and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 2108. A bill to clarify Federal law with respect to assisted \nsuicide, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n              THE ASSISTED SUICIDE FUNDING RESTRICTION ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, \nSenator Ashcroft, to introduce a piece of legislation. We understand \nthat it is late in the session, but we have just completed work on the \nlegislation, and we hope that introducing it now and reintroducing it \nin the next Congress will allow us to make some progress toward \nenacting this bill.\n  There are 15 original cosponsors besides myself and Senator Ashcroft: \nSenators Biden, Breaux, Coats, DeWine, Faircloth, Ford, Grassley, \nHatfield, Inhofe, Lott, Mack, McConnell, Murkowski, Pressler, and \nThurmond.\n  This is obviously a bipartisan group of Senators who are today \nintroducing this legislation. I will describe it briefly, and then I \nwill ask my colleague, Senator Ashcroft from Missouri, with whom I am \npleased to introduce this today, to add to that description.\n  Our legislation is called the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction \nAct. That is a rather long name, but simply stated, what this bill \nensures is that Federal tax dollars will not be used to pay for \nassisting in suicide.\n  We are in a circumstance in this country where only one State--the \nState of Oregon--has legalized physician-assisted suicides. The State \nhas every right to do that. And Oregon is now engaged in the courts in \na challenge of its law. When and if the court challenge is dismissed \nand it becomes law in Oregon--as is expected based on an earlier Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals decision--the folks who run the Medicaid \nProgram in Oregon indicate that the State fully intends to use its \nMedicaid dollars to pay for physician-assisted suicides.\n  Some of us here in Congress believe that we ought not to in any way \ncountenance the use of Federal dollars in the furtherance of physician-\nassisted suicides. We are not telling the States what their policies \nought to be with respect to whether physician-assisted suicides should \nbe allowed. Most States have already made that judgment and decided \nthat assisted suicide is not appropriate. But to a State that has said \nit intends to use Federal dollars to further their State policy \nallowing assisted suicide, we say no. That is not what we would expect \nFederal dollars, especially Federal health care dollars, to be used \nfor. We would expect Federal health care dollars to be used to advance \nthe health of patients and the delivery of medicine to those in this \ncountry who need it--not to advance Federal payment for those who would \nelect physician-assisted suicide.\n  Some might say, ``Well, why do you have to legislate on this?'' I say \nto them, if we do not, when the courts resolve the legal questions with \nrespect to the Oregon law, we likely will immediately be using Federal \ndollars to pay for physician-assisted suicide in that State, regardless \nof whether Congress and the public want them to or not. The officials \nin that State have indicated that will be the case. So with this \nlegislation we say we think it is inappropriate from a public policy \nstandpoint and we would not want scarce Federal dollars used for that \npurpose.\n  I would like to describe what this legislation is not because it is \nas important as describing what it is.\n  This legislation does not limit the withholding of, or the withdrawal \nof, medical treatment, or of nutrition, or hydration from terminally-\nill patients who have decided they do not want their lives sustained by \nmedical technology. Most people and States recognize that there are \nethical, moral, and legal distinctions between actively taking steps to \nend a patient's life and withholding or withdrawing treatment in order \nto allow a patient to die naturally. Again, this legislation \nspecifically states that we are not interfering with the ability of \npatients and their families to end or withdrawal treatment.\n  This legislation also does not prohibit Federal funding for any care \nor service that is intended to alleviate a patient's pain or \ndiscomfort, even if the use of this pain control ultimately hastens the \npatient's death. I think we would all agree that we should make the \nutmost effort to ensure that terminally ill patients do not spend their \nfinal days in pain and suffering, and this legislation does not hinder \nthat.\n\n  Finally, this legislation does not prohibit a State from using its \nown dollars to assist in suicide. If a State decides that it wants to \nallow and pay for physician-assisted suicide as a matter of policy, it \ncan use its own money to further that aim. This bill simply says we do \nnot want Federal dollars used for that purpose.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the issue of assisted suicide is an \nenormously emotional one. All of us in this country have read the news \naccounts of a doctor who is actively involved in assisting in his \npatients' suicides and of those who have taken him to court saying he \nhas violated their State law. People have very strongly held opinions \nabout this subject because issues of life and death reach to the inner \ncore of people's moral beliefs. But regardless of one's personal views \nabout assisted suicide, there is little disagreement on the broader \nquestion of whether we ought to use Federal health care dollars to pay \nfor physician-assisted suicide.\n  In fact, a national survey earlier this year found that 83 percent of \nthe American people believe that tax dollars should not be used for \nassisted suicide. I believe this legislation should and will have wide \nsupport. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National \nRight to Life Committee have both endorsed the bill. The American \nMedical Association and the American Nurses Association have position \nstatements opposing assisted suicide. President Clinton has also \nindicated his opposition to assisted suicide, and Senator Ashcroft and \nI hope that our colleagues will join us as cosponsors of this \nlegislation. We hope to advance this legislation in the intervening \ndays, and also, if necessary, to reintroduce it early in the next \nsession to see if we can get the Congress to enact this legislation \nsoon.\n  Let me again sum up what this bill would and would not do, along with \nwhy it is necessary. Mr. President, this legislation will prohibit \nFederal funds from being used for the costs associated with assisted \nsuicide.\n  Let me say again that I am pleased to work with my colleague, Senator \nAshcroft of Missouri, who I know feels strongly about this issue as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will prohibit Federal funds from \nbeing used for the costs associated with assisted suicide.\n  I understand that the decisions that confront individuals and their \nfamilies when a terminal illness strikes are among the most difficult a \nfamily will ever have to make. At times like this, each of us must rely \non our own religious beliefs and conscience to guide us. But regardless \nof one's personal views about assisted suicide, I do not believe that \ntaxpayers should be forced to pay for this controversial practice. The \nmajority of taxpayers I have talked to do not want their tax money used \nto assist in suicides. In fact, when asked in a poll in May of this \nyear whether tax dollars should be spent for assisting suicide, 83 \npercent of taxpayers feel tax money should not be spent for this \npurpose.\n  The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act prevents any Federal \nfunding from being used for any item or service which is intended to \ncause, or assist in causing, the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing \nof any individual. The programs covered under this bill include \nMedicare, Medicaid, the military health care system, Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits [FEHB] plans, Public Health Service programs, programs \nfor the disabled, and the Indian Health Service.\n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\n  This bill does make some important exceptions. First, let me make \nclear that this bill does not limit the withholding or withdrawal of \nmedical treatment or of nutrition or hydration from terminally ill \npatients who have decided that they do not want their lives sustained \nby medical technology. Most people and States recognize that there are \nethical, moral, and legal distinctions between actively taking steps to \nend a patient's life and withholding or withdrawing treatment in order \nto allow a patient to die naturally. Every State now has a law in place \ngoverning a patient's right to lay out in advance, through an advanced \ndirective, living will, or some other means, his or her wishes related \nto medical care at the end of life. Again, this bill would not \ninterfere with the ability of patients and their families to make clear \nand carry out their wishes regarding the withholding or withdrawal of \nmedical care that is prolonging the patient's life.\n  This bill also makes clear that it does not prevent Federal funding \nfor any care or service that is intended to alleviate a patient's pain \nor discomfort, even if the use of this pain control ultimately hastens \nthe patient's death. Large doses of medication are often needed to \neffectively reduce a terminally ill patient's pain, and this medication \nmay increase the patient's risk of death. I think we all would agree \nthat the utmost effort should be made to ensure that terminally ill \npatients do not spend their final days in pain and suffering.\n  Finally, while I think Federal dollars ought not be used to assist a \nsuicide, this bill does not prohibit a State from using its own dollars \nfor this purpose. However, I do not think taxpayers from other States, \nwho have determined that physician-assisted suicide should be illegal, \nshould be forced to pay for this practice through the use of Federal \ntax dollars.\n  I realize that the legality of assisted suicide has historically been \na State issue. Thirty-five States, including my State of North Dakota, \nhave laws prohibiting assisted suicide and at least eight other States \nconsider this practice to be illegal under common law. Only one State, \nOregon, has a law legalizing assisted suicide.\n  However, two circumstances have changed that now make this an issue \nof Federal concern. First, Federal courts are already handing down \ndecisions that will have enormous consequences on our public policy \nregarding assisted suicide. Second, we are on the brink of a situation \nwhere Federal Medicaid dollars may soon be used to reimburse physicians \nwho help their patients die. Should this occur, Congress will not have \nconsidered this issue. I believe it was never Congress' intention for \nMedicaid or other Federal dollars to be used to assist in suicide, and \nI hope we will take action soon to stop this practice before it starts. \nIf Congress does not act, a few States, or a few judges, may very well \nmake this decision for us.\n  In two separate cases this year, Compassion in Dying versus State of \nWashington and Quill versus Vacco, the Federal Ninth and Second Circuit \nCourts of Appeal, respectively, have struck down Washington and New \nYork State statutes outlawing assisted suicide. In the Compassion in \nDying case, the ninth circuit held that the ``right to die'' is \nconstitutionally recognized and that Washington State's law prohibiting \nphysicians from prescribing life-ending medication therefore violates \nthe ``due process'' clause of the 14th amendment for terminally ill \nadults who wish to end their life. In Quill versus Vacco, the second \ncircuit also found that a State law prohibiting physician-assisted \nsuicide violates the Constitution, but it did not agree with the ninth \ncircuit's reasoning that such a law violates the due process clause. \nRather, the second circuit held that the New York State law was \nunconstitutional because it violates the ``equal protection'' clause of \nthe Constitution. The Supreme Court could decide to take up one or both \nof these cases as early as next year.\n  Ironically, in a third case, Lee versus Oregon, a Federal district \ncourt judge also used the ``equal protection'' clause as the basis for \nhis decision--but he ruled that Oregon's 1994 law allowing assisted \nsuicide for the terminally ill violates the Constitution, and the judge \nenjoined the implementation of Oregon's law. However, this decision has \nbeen appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has already \naffirmed a constitutional ``right to die.'' The ninth circuit's \ndecision, which is expected to overturn the district court and lift the \ninjunction against Oregon's law, could be handed down any day. The \nState's Medicaid director has already stated that, when the injunction \nagainst Oregon's law is lifted, Oregon will use Medicaid dollars to pay \nfor the costs associated with a physician assisting in suicide.\n  I hope you agree with me and the vast majority of Americans who \noppose using scarce Federal dollars to pay for assisted suicide. I \ninvite you to join me, Senator Ashcroft and 15 of our colleagues in \nthis effort by cosponsoring the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction \nAct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, let me begin by commending my colleague \nform North Dakota for his excellent remarks, and his clear explanation \nof this important concept that I believe the American people would have \nus do. And, after all, we come to this body as servants of the people. \nThe people are overwhelmingly aware of this issue, and the vast \nmajority of American citizens do not believe that tax dollars should be \nused in the conduct of medicine in such a way as to take lives rather \nthan to save them.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota and those who have joined us \nin cosponsoring this particular measure.\n  Mr. President, President Jefferson wrote in words that are now \ninscribed on the Jefferson Memorial that the ``care and protection of \nhuman life, and not its destruction'' are the only legitimate \nobjectives of good government. Thomas Jefferson believed that our \nrights were God-given and that life was an inalienable right.\n  In this spirit and understanding, I join today with Senator Dorgan in \nsponsoring the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act. It is a modest \nand timely response to a challenge to our legal system and a challenge \nto the moral character of this country. What this bill says simply is \nthat Federal tax dollars shall not be used to pay for and promote \nassisted suicide, or euthanasia.\n  This bill is urgently needed to preserve the intent of the Founding \nFathers and the integrity of Federal programs as they now exist and \nserve the elderly and seriously ill in America--programs which were \nintended to support life and to enhance human life, not to promote its \ndestruction.\n  Government's role in this culture should be to call us to our highest \nand best. I do not believe Government has a role in hastening Americans \nto their graves.\n  Our court system is in the process now of litigating serious issues \nin this respect, and, as a result, we find ourselves with the need for \nthis kind of clarifying legislation dramatized. This bill is intended \nto prevent the morally contemptible injustice of taking money from an \nAmerican citizen and then using that money to kill another American \ncitizen through assisted suicide.\n  This is a bill which is very narrowly focused. It is clearly \ntargeted. It only affects Federal funding for actions whose direct \npurpose is to cause or assist in causing suicide--actions that are \nclearly condemned as unethical by the American Medical Association and \nalso illegal in the vast majority of our States. Again, this bill \nsimply prohibits any Federal funding for medical actions that assist \nsuicide.\n  This bill is needed because, in March, the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals contradicted the positions of 49 States, when it found a \n``Federal constitutional right'' to physician-assisted suicide in a \ncase involving Washington State law. Similarly, the State of Oregon \npassed Measure 16, the first law in America to authorize the dispensing \nof drugs to terminally ill patients to assist in their suicide.\n  Although a Federal court in Oregon struck down the law that Oregon \nhad enacted, the case is being appealed to that same ninth circuit, \nwhich has already signaled that it believes in a right, a \nconstitutional right, to assisted suicide.\n  Oregon's Medicaid director and the chairman of Oregon's Health \nServices\n\n[[Page S11177]]\n\nCommission have both said that whenever the ninth circuit allows the \nOregon law to go into effect, that the federally funded Medicaid \nProgram in Oregon will begin paying for assisted suicide with Federal \ntaxpayers' funds. According to Oregon's authorities, the procedure \nwould be listed on Medicaid reimbursement forms under the grotesque \neuphemism of ``comfort care.''\n  That is a rather startling, almost Orwellian label to put on assisted \nsuicide. I would think if I were going over an insurance policy and \nsomeone said, ``Do you want to be covered for comfort care,'' I would \nsay, ``Oh, yes, throw in the comfort care.'' But comfort care turns out \nto be a phrase that is destined to be used for assisted suicide, and I \ndo not believe it is intended by this Congress or previous Congresses, \nor in the law of the United States, that tax dollars from Federal \nresources be used to support that kind of ``comfort care.''\n  The problem is greatly magnified when we consider that Oregon will be \ndrawing down Federal taxpayers' funds to help pay for such assisted \nsuicides. Neither Medicaid nor Medicare nor any other Federal health \nprogram has explicit language to prohibit the use of Federal funds to \ndispense lethal drugs for suicide, primarily because nobody in the \nhistory of these programs felt that we would be appropriating money or \ncreating a program to provide for suicide. We felt we were providing \nfor individuals, developing therapeutic approaches to health problems, \nnot providing for something that the American Medical Association would \nsay was unethical and inappropriate, and which would shock the \nconscience of most Americans.\n  When Oregon's ninth circuit reinstates measure 16, Federal funds will \nbe used for comfort care, a.k.a.--also known as--assisted suicide. As a \nresult, I think it is important for us to step up and to define and to \nplace into law the kinds of restrictions which I think we felt were \nimplied in all of our activities prior to this time. We would be \nderelict in our duty if we were now to ignore this problem and allow a \nfew officials, either in a Federal circuit or in a specific State, to \ndecide that the taxpayers of all other States and jurisdictions would \nhave to help subsidize a practice which they have never authorized and \nthat millions find to be morally abhorrent.\n  It is crystal clear that the American people do not want their tax \ndollars spent on dispensing toxic drugs with the sole intent to assist \nsuicide. Recently, a Wirthlin Poll showed 83 percent of the public \nopposed such use of Federal funds. Even the voters of Oregon, who \nnarrowly approved Measure 16 by a vote of 51 to 49 percent, did not \nconsider the question of public funding. Voters of two other west coast \nStates, California and Washington, soundly defeated similar initiatives \nto legalize assisted suicide. Since November of 1994, when Oregon \npassed its law, 15 other States have considered and rejected bills to \nlegalize assisted suicide. Of course, the Federal funding question has \nnever been placed before the people in a ballot initiative.\n\n  I would like to say a few words about the way this legislation is \ncrafted. It is very carefully limited, and it is very modest. It does \nnot in any way forbid a State to legalize assisted suicide. If a State \nlike Oregon chooses to do so, the Federal Government does not choose to \nintrude under this bill, or even forbid the State to provide its own \nfunds.\n  If the State were to provide for assisted suicide and were to fund \nthat with State dollars, in spite of the fact that is not my idea of \ngood State government, it would be allowed under this bill. This bill \nsimply would prevent Federal funds and Federal programs from being \ndrawn into and providing support for and promoting assisted suicide. \nAfter the passage of this bill, States may choose to legalize or even \nfund assisted suicide. They simply could not choose to draw down \nFederal funds to promote or develop that program.\n  The bill also does not attempt to resolve the constitutional issue \nthat is on its way to the Supreme Court, that issue being whether there \nis a right to assisted suicide or euthanasia. Nor would this \nlegislation be affected by what the Supreme Court might do when it \ndecides that issue. Congress would still have the right to prevent \nFederal funding of such a practice, even if the Supreme Court found \nthat there was a constitutional right to assisted suicide.\n  It is also important to understand what this bill does not cover. As \nits rule of construction clearly provides, it does not affect abortion. \nIt does not affect complex issues, such as the withholding or \nwithdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, even of nutrition and \nhydration. Nor does this bill affect the disbursing of large doses of \nmorphine or other pain killers to ease the pain of individuals with \nterminal illnesses, even though the administration of such drugs does, \nin some cases, carry the risk of hastening death as a side effect. The \nadministration of pain killers is a long-acknowledged, legally accepted \npractice in all 50 States--and is ethically accepted by the medical \nprofession and even pro-life and religious organizations as well.\n  What we are dealing with here is the Federal funding of actions whose \ndirect purpose is to cause or assist in causing the suicide of a \npatient.\n  I am pleased that in spite of the fact the Democrats and Republicans \nmay disagree on how to reform Federal programs like Medicaid and \nMedicare, there are things on which we do agree. One thing we should be \nable to agree on is the measure in this bill. Of course, our agreement \nis reflected in the cosponsorship of this measure by individuals on \nboth sides of the aisle. These Federal programs should provide a means \nto care for and to protect our citizens, not become vehicles for the \ndestruction of our citizens, especially as a result of Federal funding.\n  I would like to close by quoting the hallmark of Jeffersonian \nprinciples embodied in the Declaration of Independence:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n  I therefore urge all my colleagues to support this bill, an effort to \nuphold congressional responsibility, to defend the foremost of our \nunalienable rights, the right that citizens have to life.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n\n  S. 2109. A bill to provide a 1-year delay in the imposition of \npenalties on small businesses failing to make electronic fund transfers \nof business taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                       SMALL BUSINESS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould waive for 1-year penalties on small businesses that fail to pay \ntheir taxes to the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] electronically.\n  In July of this year, millions of small business owners received a \nletter from the IRS announcing that, beginning January 1, 1997, \nbusiness tax payments would have to be made via electronic funds \ntransfer. This letter sent shock waves through the small business \ncommunity in South Dakota. The letter was vague and provided little \ninformation on how the new deposit requirement would work.\n  In meetings, letters, and phone calls, South Dakotans have posed many \nquestions to me that the IRS letter did not answer: ``How much will \nthis cost my business?''; ``Will I have to purchase new equipment to \nmake these electronic transfers?''; and ``Will the IRS be taking the \nmoney directly out of my account?''\n  As you may recall, this new requirement was adopted as part of a \npackage of revenue offsets for the North American Free-Trade Agreement.\n  The Treasury Department was directed to draw up regulations phasing \nin the requirement, which will raise money by eliminating the float \nbanks accrue on the delay between the time they receive tax deposits \nfrom businesses and the time they transfer this money to the Treasury.\n  All businesses with $47 million or more in annual payroll taxes are \nalready required to pay by electronic funds transfer. The new, lower \nthreshold is estimated to bring 1.3 million small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses into the program for the first time.\n  As a result of protests registered by many small businesses, the IRS \ndecided to delay for 6 months the 10 percent penalty on firms failing \nto begin making deposits electronically by January 1, 1997. Not \nsatisfied with this step, Congress recently passed an outright 6 month \ndelay in the electronic filing requirement as part of the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act of 1996.\n\n[[Page S11178]]\n\n  I strongly supported this amendment. However, I believe that these \n1.3 million businesses should be given further time to comply without \nthe threat of financial penalties. Electronic funds transfer may well \nprove to be the most efficient system of payment for all concerned, \nincluding small businesses. Once they learn the advantages of the new \nsystem, these firms may well come to prefer it to the existing one, \nwhich requires a special kind of coupon and a lot of paperwork. But \nthis is a new procedure, and many small employers are not sure what it \nwill entail. That is why I believe we should enact a temporary waiver \nof penalties.\n  The bill I am introducing today would suspend penalties for \nnoncompliance for 1 year, until July 1, 1998. I believe this step is \nnecessary to provide time for small businesses to be properly educated \nabout the easiest, least burdensome, and most cost-efficient way to \ncomply. In my view, whenever possible the IRS should avoid taking an \nadversarial approach toward the small business community, and, for that \nmatter, any taxpayers. At every opportunity, the IRS should seek to \nhelp taxpayers comply with their obligations. I believe that, by \nremoving the threat of penalties for a short while longer, this \nlegislation will help the IRS fulfill this important part of its \nmission.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2109\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WAIVER OF PENALTY ON SMALL BUSINESSES FAILING TO \n                   MAKE ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS OF TAXES.\n\n       No penalty shall be imposed under the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 solely by reason of a failure by a person to use the \n     electronic fund transfer system established under section \n     6302(h) of such Code if--\n       (1) such person is a member of a class of taxpayers first \n     required to use such system on or after July 1, 1997, and\n       (2) such failure occurs during the 1-year period beginning \n     on July 1, 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 2110. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nspecial rules for certain gratuitous transfers of employer securities \nfor the benefit of employees; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I today am introducing legislation that \nwould take a small but significant step toward improving the \nproductivity of American businesses and workers. My bill would permit \ncertain employee stock ownership plans [ESOP's] to be beneficiaries of \ncharitable remainder trusts under estate tax law.\n  We have all heard stories about closely held companies being sold and \nbroken up in order to raise cash to pay a large estate tax bill to the \nInternal Revenue Service. Not infrequently, a company that has been \nbuilt over a period of decades is dismantled, cutting adrift employees \nwith years of service.\n  My bill would provide a way for an owner of a nonpublicly traded \ncompany to benefit company employees without having the estate tax \nstand in the way. It would permit the owner under certain circumstances \nto donate his or her shares to the company's ESOP through the use of a \ncharitable/ESOP remainder trust. If carried out in accordance with the \nrestrictions set forth in the bill, the transfer would be eligible for \nan estate tax deduction. By being transferred to an ESOP, the stock \nwould be allocated directly to company employees.\n  The legislation includes a number of safeguards against abuse. First, \nstock transferred to an ESOP in this fashion could not be used to \nbenefit any ESOP participant who was related to the decedent or who \nowned more than 5 percent of the company. This safeguard is aimed at \nensuring that no estate tax deduction would be available where the \ntransfer benefited the decedent's family members or the company's major \nstockholders. Second, the bill would require that the transferred stock \nbe allocated to ESOP participants over time. This would provide an \nincentive for employees to continue to build the business. It would \nalso prevent the creation of instant windfalls for employees that could \nencourage them to terminate employment.\n  Any owner of a non-publicly traded company would be free to take \nadvantage of this legislation to preserve a business beyond his or her \ndeath. I believe that quite a few family and closely held businesses \nwill find the legislation of interest, as these firms tend to be run by \npeople who take an interest in their employees and would like to see \ntheir companies make a continuing contribution to their communities. I \nsalute these entrepreneurs and propose this modest legislation in an \neffort to help them realize that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2110\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the act commonly known as the Navajo-Hopi \nLand Settlement Act of 1974, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Indian Affairs.\n\n\n         THE NAVAJO-HOPI LAND SETTLEMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to make certain \namendments to the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974 in order to \nbring the relocation process to an orderly conclusion within 5 years. \nThis legislation will phase out the Navajo-Hopi relocation program by \nSeptember 30, 2001, and at that time transfer any remaining \nresponsibilities to the Secretary of the Interior. This legislation \nwill provide a time certain for eligible Navajo and Hopi individuals to \napply for and receive relocation benefits and after that time the \nFederal Government will no longer be obligated to provide replacement \nhousing for such individual. Under this legislation, the funds that \nwould have been used to provide replacement housing to such individual \nwill be kept in trust by the Secretary for distribution to the \nindividual or their heirs.\n  Mr. President, the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974 was \nenacted to resolve longstanding disputes that have divided the Navajo \nand Hopi Indian Tribes for more than a century. The origins of this \ndispute can be traced directly to the creation of the 1882 reservation \nfor the Hopi Tribe and the creation of the 1934 Navajo Reservation. At \nthe times these reservations were established there were Navajo \nfamilies residing within the lands set aside for the Hopi Tribe and \nHopi families residing on lands set aside for the Navajo Nation. \nTensions between the two tribes continued to heighten until in 1958 \nCongress, in an effort to resolve this dispute, passed legislation that \nauthorized the tribes to file suit in Federal court to quiet title to \nthe 1882 reservation and to their respective claims and rights. That \nlegislation has given rise to more than 35 years of continuous \nlitigation between the tribes in an effort to resolve their respective \nrights and claims to the land.\n  In 1974, Congress enacted the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act which \nestablished Navajo and Hopi negotiating teams under the auspices of a \nFederal mediator to negotiate a settlement to the 1882 reservation land \ndispute. The act also authorized the tribes to file suit in Federal \ncourt to quiet title to the 1934 reservation and to file any\n\n[[Page S11180]]\n\nclaims for damages arising out of the dispute against each other or the \nUnited States. The act also established a three member Navajo-Hopi \nIndian Relocation Commission to oversee the relocation of members of \nthe Navajo Nation who were residing on lands partitioned to the Hopi \nTribe and members of the Hopi Tribe who were residing on lands \npartitioned to the Navajo Nation. Since its establishment, the \nrelocation program has proven to be an extremely difficult and \ncontentious process.\n  When this program was first established, it was estimated that the \ncost of relocation would be roughly $40 million to provide relocation \nbenefits to approximately 6,000 Navajos estimated to be eligible for \nrelocation. These figures woefully underestimated the number of \nfamilies impacted by relocation and the tremendous delays that have \nplagued this program. To date, the United States has expended over $350 \nmillion to relocate more than 11,000 Navajo and Hopi tribal members. \nThere remain over 640 eligible families who have never received \nrelocation benefits and an additional 50 to 100 families who have never \napplied for relocation benefits. In addition, there are over 130 \neligibility appeals still pending. The funding for this settlement has \nexceeded the original cost estimates by more than 900 percent.\n\n  Mr. President, we cannot continue to fund this program with no end in \nsight. I am convinced that our current Federal budgetary pressures \nrequire us to ensure that the Navajo-Hopi relocation housing program is \nbrought to an orderly and certain conclusion. It is for that reason \nthat I am introducing the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act Amendments of \n1996. This legislation will phase out the Navajo-Hopi Indian relocation \nprogram by September 30, 2001, and transfer the remaining \nresponsibilities under the act to the Secretary of the Interior. Under \nthe bill, the relocation commissioner shall transfer to the Secretary \nsuch funds as are necessary to construct replacement homes for any \neligible head of household who has left the Hopi partitioned land but \nhas not received a replacement home by September 30, 2001.

The Commissioner must provide a final notice, by \n     mail and/or publication, to anyone who may have a right to an \n     eligibility determination within 30 days from the enactment \n     of the amendments and all requests for such determinations \n     must be filed within 180 days from the date of such notice.\n       A new subsection (j) is added to this section of the Act to \n     authorize the Commissioner to contract for services and \n     employ personnel in order to provide for eligibility \n     determinations and appeals. Upon request, the Director of the \n     Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of the \n     Interior shall provide a qualified hearing officer to the \n     Commissioner to assist in hearings to review eligibility \n     determinations.\n       A new subsection (k) is added to this section of the Act to \n     provide for a final and expedited appeal of any final \n     eligibility determinations by the Office to the Circuit Court \n     of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. All such appeals shall be \n     filed within 30 days of the final action by the Office and \n     the Court shall complete its review within 60 days after \n     receipt of the certified record from the Office. All such \n     appeals shall be reviewed on the basis of the certified \n     record and any denial of eligibility which is supported by \n     substantial evidence shall be affirmed.\n       Paragraph (11) redesignates section 16 (25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 640d-15) as section 10 and retitles it ``Payment of Fair \n     Rental Value for Use of Lands''.\n       Paragraph (12) redesignates section 17 (25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 640d-16) as section 11 and retitles it ``Statutory \n     Construction''.\n       Paragraph (13) redesignates section 18 (25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 640d-17) as section 12 and retitles it ``Actions for \n     Accounting, Fair Value of Grazing, and Claims for Damages to \n     Land''.\n       Paragraph (14) redesignates section 19 (25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 640d-18) as section 14 and retitles it ``Reduction in \n     Livestock with Joint Use''.\n       Paragraph (15) redesignates section 20 (25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 640d-19) as section 15 and retitles it ``Perpetual Use \n     of Cliff Springs for Religious Ceremonial Uses; Piping of \n     Water for Use by Residents''.\n       Paragraph (16) redesignates section 21 (25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 640d-20) as section 16 and retitles it ``Use and Right \n     of Access to Religious Shrines on Reservation of Other \n     Tribe''.\n       Paragraph (17) redesignates section 22 (25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 640d-21) as section 17 and retitles it ``Exclusion of \n     Payments from Certain Federal Determination of Income''.\n       Paragraph (18) redesignates section 23 (25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 640d-22) as section 18 and retitles it ``Authorization \n     for Exchange of Reservation Lands''.\n       Paragraph (19) redesignates section 24 (25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 640d-23) as section 19 and retitles it ``Severability of \n     Provisions''.\n       Paragraph (20) redesignates section 25 (25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 640d-24) as section 20 and amends this section in \n     subsection (a) by providing authorizations for appropriations \n     of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1998 \n     through 2002.

A bill to increase funding for child care under the \ntemporary assistance for needy families program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n            the working families' child care assistance act\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Working \nFamilies' Child Care Assistance Act'' to help the many working families \nwho face great struggles to find affordable, good-quality child care.\n  Mr. President, we no longer live in an era when one parent generally \nstays at home full time to take care of the children. Today, 60 percent \nof women with children younger than six are in the labor force. The \nresult is that approximately 7 million children of working parents are \ncared for each month by someone other than a parent. And most of these \nchildren spend 30 hours or more each week in child care, according to \nthe National Research Council.\n  New research also confirms that our current social reality has placed \nenormous strains on working families' budgets because many families \nmust pay for child care. According to a new study of 100 child care \ncenters entitled ``Cost, Quality, and Child Outcomes in Child Care \nCenters,'' families spend an average of $4,940 per year to provide \nservices for each enrolled child. Annual child care costs of this size \nrepresent a whopping 28 percent of $17,481, which is the yearly income \nof an average family in the bottom two-fifths of the income scale.\n  But even for families who can afford the cost of child care, in some \ncommunities child care continues to be hard to obtain at any cost. Mr. \nPresident, in 1994, 36 States reported State child care assistance \nwaiting lists, according to the children's defense fund. Eight States \nhad at least 10,000 children waiting for assistance. Georgia's list was \nthe longest with 41,000, while in Texas the list had 36,000 names and a \nwait of about 2 years. In Massachusetts, the statewide waiting list \ncontains the names of 4,000 working families. Additionally, a 1995 U.S. \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO] study found that shortages of child \ncare for infants, sick children, children with special needs, and \nschool-age children before and after school pose difficulties for many \nfamilies.\n  I believe the child care situation may worsen because of a provision \nwhich I did not support in the recently passed welfare reform bill \nwhich cuts the title XX social services block grant by 15 percent. Many \nStates currently use this funding to pay for child care for working \nfamilies; unfortunately, this cut will result in even more families \nneeding child care assistance.\n  Mr. President, it is time to provide help to working families to \nafford quality child care. My bill would double the funding through the \nchild care development block grant, increasing child care funding by $1 \nbillion per year. This would result in more than 5,000 families in \nMassachusetts alone receiving child care help.\n  Working parents face an extraordinary uphill battle in trying to make \nends meet and cover the high cost of child care. Well over half the \nwomen in the work force are parents of preschool children, and they \nneed access to affordable, quality child care they can trust. This bill \nprovides real help to working families and hopefully will send a strong \nsignal that their work and their efforts to provide reliable child care \nfor their children is valued and supported.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2114. A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to ensure that all \ndogs and cats used by research facilities are obtained legally, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n               the pet safety and protection act of 1996\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pet \nSafety and Protection Act of 1996, a bill to amend the Animal Welfare \nAct to ensure that all dogs and cats used by research facilities are \nobtained legally.\n  Medical research is an invaluable weapon in the battle against \ndisease. New drugs and surgical techniques offer promise in the fight \nagainst AIDS, cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and a host of other \nlife-threatening illnesses. Orthopedic surgeons are making tremendous \nprogress in designing new and improved joint-replacement materials for \npatients. Emergency medical techniques, such as CPR, have saved \nthousands of lives since they were developed.\n  What do these advancements in medicine have in common? Animal \nresearch helped make them possible. Animal research ensures that drugs \nand surgical techniques, which benefit millions of\n\n[[Page S11186]]\n\npeople every day, are safe and effective. Animal research is of great \nimportance to our future, but there is growing evidence that, in some \ninstances, research is being carried out using family pets that have \nbeen fraudulently obtained from the owners who love them.\n  The concern that has prompted me to introduce the Pet Safety and \nProtection Act of 1996 does not relate to whether animals should or \nshould not be used in medical research. Rather, this bill provides a \nsensible solution to the growing problem of stray and stolen pets being \nsold to research facilities. It addresses problems caused by unethical \nClass B ``random source'' animal dealers. The Pet Safety and Protection \nAct of 1996 will safeguard family pets while allowing essential \nresearch to continue in an environment free from deception and abuse.\n  According to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \n[APHIS], there are 4,325 licensed animal dealers in the United States. \nAbout 1,100 of these dealers are licensed by APHIS as Class B ``random \nsource'' animal dealers. This means that these dealers do not breed the \nanimals themselves, but obtain their dogs and cats from other sources.\n  Unfortunately, there is significant evidence to conclude that many \nClass B ``random source'' dealers are profiteering through theft or by \ndeceptively acquiring animals. For example, in 1995, 50 class B dealers \nsupplied 24,000 of the 89,000 dogs used for research. APHIS \ninvestigations of these dealers found that up to 50 percent engaged in \nfraudulent record-keeping practices. In other words, up to 11,000 of \nthe dogs sold to medical facilities in 1995 may have been obtained \nthrough pet theft, falsified records, and other unscrupulous \ntechniques.\n  The provisions of current law are impossible to enforce effectively. \nIn response to evidence of repeated violations of Federal law by Class \nB ``random source'' dealers, I have introduced the Pet Safety and \nProtection Act of 1996. This legislation will ensure that dogs and cats \nused by research facilities are obtained from legitimate sources.\n  The problem of pet theft should not be left unchecked. Dr. Robert \nWhitney, former director of the Office of Animal Care and Use at the \nNational Institutes of Health recently declared that, ``The continued \nexistence of these virtually unregulatable Class B dealers erodes the \npublic confidence in our commitment to appropriate procurement, care, \nand use of animals in the important research to better the health of \nboth humans and animals.'' it is in the interests of consumers, pet \nowners, and researchers alike, to see that animals used for research \npurposes are obtained legitimately and treated with respect.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 2116. A bill to facilitate efficient investments and financing of \ninfrastructure projects and new job creation through the establishment \nof a National Infrastructure Development Corporatoin, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday that I hope, at the very least, will draw attention to the \ninteresting possibilities of how private capital might be joined with \npublic funding of our Nation's infrastructure. The bill is designed to \nfacilitate investment in, and the financing of, infrastructure \nprojects--which generate good-paying jobs--through the creation of a \nself-sustaining entity, the National Infrastructure Development \nCorporation.\n  In 1991, I sponsored the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct [ISTEA]. One provision called for the establishment of an \nInfrastructure Investment Commission. Public investments in \ninfrastructure have been declining, and so the Commission was charged \nwith looking at ways to encourage the investment of private capital. \nThe Commission was chaired by Daniel V. Flanagan, Jr. Under his able \ndirection, the Commission released a report early in 1993. I found it \ntruly compelling, and I look forward to revisiting the Commission's \nrecommendations as we prepare for ISTEA II. In short, we would do well \nto listen to Mr. Flanagan, again, as we reauthorize our vitally \nimportant transportation infrastructure policies in the 105th Congress. \nThere will be hearings, of course, and we look forward to testimony \nfrom the Commission as to its recommendations. I would like to point \nout that our colleague, Senator Hutchison from Texas, served as a \nmember of the Commission; and I certainly look forward to working with \nher as the Environment and Public Works Committee takes up this most \nimportant matter next year.\n  I would like to note that significant infrastructure investment \nactivity by U.S. pension funds is occurring daily overseas, \nparticularly in Asia and Latin America. A good part of this has been \nprompted by the evolution of the independent power generation spawned \nby the action of our Congress in creating such entities as part of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992. As a result, we now have a project finance \nindustry in existence in this country assisting those American funds in \nsuch infrastructure investment overseas. Also, current policies of the \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation, the Export Import Bank, and \nthe World Bank, encourage this type of overseas investment through \ncredit enhancements, political risk insurance, and so forth.\n  The problem in the United States is that we have never provided such \ncredit enhancement disciplines in our own infrastructure network. \nClearly, there is significant political risk for the entrepreneur, the \narchitect, the engineer, and even the community group that seeks to \ndevelop improvements and novel and innovative ways of paying for such \nservices. The Commission's report suggests a ``growing of the pie'' \napproach to leverage some of our public funds by encouraging such \nprivate investment, and suggests that leverage ratios of approximately \n10 to 18 times the public funds involved are attainable.\n\n  Recommendations of the Commission and Mr. Flanagan, who has testified \nseveral times before Congress on this subject, are incorporated in this \nlegislation. For example, it suggests various insurance initiatives, \nparticularly in the area of development risk, as well as other \ninnovative procedures, including the reinsurance of long term revenue \nstreams that would allow new economic activity to ensure either in the \nconstruction of new or rehabilitation of existing facilities.\n  I commend my colleagues in the House of Representatives, particularly \nthe Democratic leadership there, for introducing this measure in that \nbody earlier this year. To me this is a bipartisan effort and we \nwelcome the support of our Republican colleagues. This legislation, the \nNational Infrastructure Development Act of 1996, is by no means the \nfinal word on this subject. But I do recommend it to all of my \ncolleagues for their examination and hope it proves sufficient to \nstimulate their interest in this ingenious approach to such an exciting \nmatter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11169-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 296--RELATIVE TO DISABLED SENATE EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. FORD submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I submit a resolution \ndesignating the week of November 3, 1996 as National Shaken Baby \nSyndrome Awareness Week. America's children are its most priceless and \nirreplaceable resource, and I am proud to lend them my voice in the \nU.S. Senate. Today, I speak for America's children as I urge my \ncolleagues to consider this important resolution.\n  Shaking a baby causes serious brain injury. A baby's head accounts \nfor one-fourth of its weight and is supported by weak and \nunderdeveloped neck muscles. When a baby is shaken, it causes the brain \nto rock back and forth, hitting the skull with great force. This can \ncause the brain to bleed, bruise, or swell, resulting in the \npossibility of blindness, deafness, paralysis, epilepsy, cerebral \npalsy, and developmental disability. In many cases, this can also lead \nto death.\n  Brandon and Teddy are two very special little boys from my home State \nof Minnesota. They are survivors of a common and deadly form of child \nabuse that is often committed out of simple ignorance. Brandon and \nTeddy were violently shaken by their birth mothers out of frustration. \nThis type of abuse and its resulting injuries are known as shaken baby \nsyndrome or SBS.\n  Brandon and Teddy are survivors, but they will bear the scars of \ntheir abuse for the rest of their lives. Both boys have been adopted \nand are receiving expert care from a committed and loving family. \nBrandon is 6 years old and is stricken with a permanent brain injury. \nHe has a seizure disorder, shunts in his head, and a permanent blind \nspot as a result of being shaken. Brandon receives special education \nservices and learns very slowly. Teddy is 4 years old and does not \nspeak. His brain injury impacts his problem-solving capability and his \neducation is a long and tedious process. Teddy will probably never be \nable to live independent of a care-giver.\n  Brandon and Teddy's injuries were entirely preventable. A study by \nthe Ohio Research Institute on Child Abuse Prevention indicates that 25 \nto 50 percent of adults do not know that shaking a baby is dangerous. \nEducation of adult and teenage child care providers is the key to \npreventing the tragic consequences of SBS. According to studies by the \nU.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, SBS is so lethal that \nover 20 percent of its victims die from the resulting injuries. These \ninjuries may account for over 10 percent of all physical child abuse \ndeaths in the United States.\n\n  On November 10, 1996, the first National Conference on Shaken Baby \nSyndrome will convene in Salt Lake City, UT. At this conference a \ncoalition of families, doctors, law enforcement people, and child \nprotection officials will gather to discuss the issues surrounding SBS. \nThese committed individuals will work to educate medical professionals \nabout the symptoms of SBS, push for more severe penalties for \nperpetrators, and teach all segments of the public that it's never OK \nto shake a baby.\n  Mr. President this resolution emphasizes the importance of this \nhistoric conference. It is my hope that the Senate will continue its \ncommitment to the health and safety of America's children by supporting \nthis resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of supporting agencies be \nlisted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Organizations by State Supporting Shaken Baby Syndrome Resolution\n\n     AL--Alabama Children's Trust Fund\n     AK--Rural Community Action Program\n     AR--Arkansas Child Abuse Prevention\n     AZ--National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse: AZ \n         Chpt.\n     CA--Office of Child Abuse Prevention\n     CO--Pueblo City-County Health Dept.\n     CT--Wheeler Clinic, Plainville, CT\n     DE--Delawareans United to Prevent Child Abuse\n     FL--Florida Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse\n     GA--Georgia Council on Child Abuse, Inc.\n     HI--Prevent Child Abuse Hawaii\n     ID--Idaho Children Services Bureau\n     IN--Indiana Chapter NCPCA\n     IA--Iowa Chapter NCPCA\n     KS--Child Abuse Prevention Coalition\n     KY--Kentucky Council on Child Abuse, Inc.\n     LA--Louisina Council on Child Abuse\n     ME--Maine Dept. of Maternal and Child Health\n     MD--Mt.

In establishing such tolerance, the Secretary \n     shall rely on data sufficient to demonstrate that a proposed \n     tolerance is safe based on similar food safety criteria used \n     by the Secretary to establish tolerances for applications for \n     new animals drugs filed under subsection (b)(1). The \n     Secretary may consider and rely on data submitted by the drug \n     manufacturer, including data submitted to appropriate \n     regulatory authorities in any country where the new animal \n     drug is lawfully used or data available from a relevant \n     international organization, to the extent such data are not \n     inconsistent with the criteria used by the Secretary to \n     establish a tolerance for applications for new animal drugs \n     filed under subsection (b)(1). For purposes of this \n     paragraph, `relevant international organization' means the \n     Codex Alimenterius Commission or other international \n     organization deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The \n     Secretary may, under procedures specified by regulation, \n     revoke a tolerance established under this paragraph if \n     information demonstrates that the use of the new animal drug \n     under actual use conditions results in food being imported \n     into the United States with residues exceeding the tolerance \n     or if scientific evidence shows the tolerance to be \n     unsafe.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. VETERINARY FEED DIRECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Section 503.--Section 503(f)(1)(A) (21 U.S.C. \n     353(f)(1)(A)) is amended by inserting after ``other than \n     man'' the following: ``, other than a veterinary feed \n     directive drug intended for use in animal feed or an animal \n     feed bearing or containing a veterinary feed directive \n     drug,''.\n       (b) section 504.--The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     is amended by inserting after section 503 the following:\n\n\n                   ``veterinary feed directive drugs\n\n       ``Sec. 504.

Mr. President, one of the Members of Congress who \nhas contributed significantly more than most of us is Congressman Tony \nHall.\n  His emphasis on helping people in need has sharpened the conscience \nof many policymakers, though it has not sharpened it enough.\n  He has provided leadership in areas that most Members of Congress \nignore, such as Eritrea.\n  Recently he went to North Korea, and he testified before the \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  It is a remarkable insight into the leadership that is needed in \nregard to the tense situation in Korea.\n  Nowhere do we have as many troops facing each other as we do between \nNorth Korea and South Korea and that problem is compounded by the fact \nthat there is no communication between the two countries.\n  Mr President, I ask that Congressman Hall's remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n             Testimony of U.S. Representative Tony P. Hall\n\n       Good morning. I want to thank you for inviting me to \n     testify today, Mr. Chairman, and to thank both you and \n     Senator Robb for the focus you are bringing to the United \n     States' relationship with North Korea.\n       I am convinced that our increasing contacts with North \n     Korea can only benefit America's interests--and make the job \n     of the 37,000 American troops stationed along the border with \n     South Korea easier. And I am hopeful that our contacts also \n     will help the people of North Korea who have suffered in \n     their decades-long isolation, and are hurting badly today.\n       Our humanitarian work, our progress in dismantling North \n     Korea's nuclear reactor and on missile technology controls, \n     and the unprecedented joint investigation by U.S. and North \n     Korean soldiers into the fate of missing servicemen--all of \n     these mark a dramatic turn-around in a relationship that is \n     in its fifth decade of military tension.\n       I believe our nation owes special thanks for these changes \n     to former President Jimmy Carter, whose personal diplomacy \n     laid the groundwork for peace two years ago. Senator Paul \n     Simon, who with Senator Frank Murkowski travelled to North \n     Korea at a crucial moment, and who has championed ideas that \n     hold great promise for the future of both countries, also \n     deserves recognition for his work. We ought to build on their \n     success in seizing this historic opportunity.\n\n\n                      north korea's food shortage\n\n       The hunger and malnutrition that I saw in North Korea is \n     different than famines I've seen in my visits to other \n     countries. This is the only country I can remember where \n     grown children are shorter than their parents. The stunting \n     is severe, especially when you compare North Koreans to their \n     siblings and cousins in South Korea. And North Korea is the \n     only place I've seen where parents and grandparents are \n     giving their rations to their children in a desperate effort \n     to protect them.\n       Today in North Korea, people are somehow surviving on \n     rations of little more than 600 calories a day--just seven \n     ounces of grain. That's not two bowls of rice, too much to \n     die on, but not enough to live on and function. They are \n     scrambling to supplement that starvation diet, but clearly \n     having little success.\n       Nutritional standards say sedentary workers need about \n     2,000 calories a day to maintain their body weight--but \n     people in North Korea cannot be sedentary. In two weeks, the \n     harvest will be brought in with the aid of few animals and \n     fewer machines. And if there is to be any hope for next \n     year's harvest, the back-breaking work of rebuilding broken \n     irrigation systems, roads, and other infrastructure must be \n     completed.\n       Adults have lost an average of 30 pounds since January, \n     according to Western aid workers I talked to there. According \n     to our Ambassador to South Korea, James Laney, a North Korean \n     soldier who defected to South Korea in mid-August weighed \n     just 92 pounds. And there are many more measures of the \n     extent of the suffering in North Korea in both the \n     intelligence and in the unclassified reports of U.N. \n     agencies, the International Red Cross, and charities that \n     have visited North Korea.\n       For me, two things stand out in all of these measurements:\n       First, the bodies of most of the North Koreans that I saw \n     are exhausted. Simply surviving this winter will be a \n     tremendous physical challenge that many of them will not be \n     able to meet.\n       Second, North Korea's land appears equally worn out. Food \n     grows on any patch of land available--atop the rice paddy \n     walls, along the shoulders of roads, in rivers' floodplains, \n     on the slopes of steep hills. Land is not permitted to lie \n     fallow, there is no investment in fertilizer and pesticides, \n     deforestation leads to soil erosion that ruins once-\n     productive land--and sorry yields are the result of it all.\n       North Korea's granaries were last full in 1992--but however \n     self-inflicted the long-term problems may be, the country was \n     overwhelmed by the worst natural disaster in its history last \n     year. And this year, another severe flood struck the \n     breadbasket provinces that produce 60 percent of North \n     Korea's grain.\n\n\n                            what is missing\n\n       What struck me most was not what I saw--but what was \n     missing. There is an eerie silence in the capital, and in the \n     villages that we visited in more than 20 hours on the road. \n     You don't hear roosters crowing, and the air seems empty of \n     birds--even of gulls in the seaside city of Haeju. You don't \n     see cats, or rats, or cows or goats--or much sign of other \n     animal life. Occasionally, in people's homes I saw dogs, but \n     not a single puppy. According to some aid workers, the sight \n     of a pregnant woman is increasingly rare, and a new maternity \n     hospital never has more than 25 of its 250 beds filled. \n     Certainly we saw no fat people--or anybody that bore much \n     resemblance to their healthier siblings and cousins in South \n     Korea.\n       Soldiers--and we saw a lot of individual soldiers \n     throughout the capital and countryside--have the same hollow-\n     cheeked look as civilians, and their uniforms hang very \n     loosely on them. That may be the best evidence that most of \n     North Korea's military isn't getting much more to eat than \n     the rest of the people.\n       All of this added up to a nagging sense that we simply \n     cannot know what is happening in North Korea. Aid workers \n     speak in hushed tones when talk turns to what is happening in \n     the mountains that make up 80 percent of North Korea. They \n     can barely help the 1.5 million children and flood victims \n     covered by the U.N.'s appeal for humanitarian aid; the \n     remaining 20 million people are on their own.\n       Two American demographers, Nicholas Eberstadt of the \n     American Enterprise Institute and Judith Banister, of the \n     U.S. Census Bureau, have done statistical analysis of North \n     Korea's population--and with your permission, Mr. Chairman, I \n     would like to submit a letter for the record that Mr. \n     Eberstadt is preparing. The gist of their finding is that \n     half a million people are ``missing.'' That is either (1) a \n     statistical blip; or (2) a sign of severe changes in the \n     birth and death rates. We cannot know which is true, but I \n     believe the possibility of something that would affect \n     500,000 people deserves our concern.\n\n\n                       north korea's own efforts\n\n       I also want to comment briefly on the efforts that North \n     Korea is making to ease suffering in its country. Its rations \n     system now feeds the majority of the population, and by all \n     accounts, it is meticulously fair. Ration cards measure out \n     to three decimal points. A U.N. report issued Sept. 9 notes \n     that sometimes there is not enough food to distribute the \n     second of two monthly rations, but people do seem to share \n     equally in the food available.\n       The system also appears to be exceptionally efficient. The \n     first U.S. flag ship to visit\n\n[[Page S11193]]\n\n     North Korea since the war arrived on Wednesday, Aug. 21--and \n     the rice and cornmeal it carried already was being \n     distributed when I visited two rural provinces on Thursday, \n     Aug. 22.\n       Other North Korean efforts are more troubling, however. \n     According to Monday's report, some 30 to 90 percent of the \n     nation's livestock have been turned over to individuals for \n     tending or slaughtering; and local provinces have gotten a \n     green-light to barter their timber and other resources for \n     food (primarily with China)--increasing deforestation and \n     reducing the fuel available this winter.\n\n\n                          the july 1996 flood\n\n       So far, North Korea's suffering is largely caused by the \n     1995 disaster--a massive, 100-year flood that bore striking \n     similarities to our own Midwest flood of just three years \n     ago. People already bombarded with admonitions to ``work \n     harder, eat less'' have high hopes that the 1996 harvest will \n     be good.\n       It won't be.\n       United Nations experts who travelled to the region I saw \n     just after I left reported this week that much of the \n     country's breadbasket region--which produces 60 percent of \n     its grain, and which I visited last month--was under water \n     for five days in July. Rainfall was 3-5 times normal, \n     overwhelming irrigation canals and bursting dams. To put the \n     torrential rains into some perspective, it was twice what \n     North Carolina and Virginia endured in Hurricane Fran's \n     aftermath--and it lasted five times longer. And the rains \n     came at a crucial time in crop development--stunting the \n     growth of corn, and robbing rice stalks of their nutritional \n     kernels.\n       Along just one 500-mile irrigation network, there were 369 \n     breaks. A report issued by the International Red Cross, \n     UNICEF, and several U.N. agencies puts the likely crop losses \n     in the half-million acres irrigated by this system at $300 \n     million. And broken sea dykes added to this misery, washing \n     salt water over land and poisoning it for this year and \n     probably several more.\n\n\n                           international aid\n\n       The international community is lending a hand--but only \n     barely. China, Japan and the U.S. each have donated some $6 \n     million to the current appeal. South Korea has given $3 \n     million, and promises far more if North Korea agrees to peace \n     talks that President Clinton and President Kim proposed in \n     April.\n       With the notable exception of Sweden, though, the response \n     of most European nations has been nothing less than a ``let \n     'em starve'' pittance that shames the reputation of European \n     people. I spoke with the director of U.S. AID, Brian Atwood, \n     about this--and he plans to raise the matter with his \n     European Community counterpart in October.\n       In all, just over half of the United Nations' current \n     emergency appeal has been filled. It last until March 1997, \n     but the food-for-work projects to rebuild irrigation systems \n     and other infrastructure must begin immediately after the \n     harvest in order to stave off another disaster in 1997.\n       NGOs are doing their best to respond, but they are hampered \n     by restrictions on South Korean individuals--many who have \n     family ties to the North--and by North Korea's petulant \n     insistence that NGOs bring food, and not just people. Without \n     eyewitness accounts, without reporting by independent \n     journalists, NGOs simply cannot raise the money they need to \n     fund their operations. U.S. organizations like World Vision \n     and Mercy Corps are doing their best to help, and the U.S. \n     government should lend its weight to their efforts.\n       In every disaster, NGOs are the first to respond--the \n     people who work with the most vulnerable groups, and who \n     stick around long enough to do the long-term work needed. \n     Governments--including the U.S. Government--need to do more. \n     But it will be the work of private citizens, and the \n     organizations they support, that will make or break North \n     Korea's recovery. This is my strong conviction, and I raised \n     it with both North and South Korean leaders.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Despite the seemingly endless stream of bad news about \n     North Korea, I remain hopeful. My talks with North Korea's \n     leaders were productive, and I am convinced that good-faith \n     efforts by the U.S. and other nations will produce more good-\n     faith efforts by North Korea. It is not a quick process, but \n     it is one whose pace is increasing, and it is our best hope \n     for lending momentum to the progressive factions inside North \n     Korea.\n       I am hopeful for one other reason: a UNICEF project that \n     represents an historic joint effort by North and South Korea. \n     Like all UNICEF projects, the Oral Rehydration Salts plant \n     will be a Godsend to children. The packets of gluocse and \n     salt that this plant will manufacture are used around the \n     world as a circuit-breaker in the spiral of disease and \n     death. If you care about suffering children, and had just \n     three wishes, Oral Rehydration Salts would be one of those \n     wishes.\n       North Korea was self-sufficient in producing this life-\n     saving product--until the flood swept away its building and \n     equipment in 1995. It has since donated a building for the \n     plant to UNICEF and brought it up to World Health \n     Organization standards--but UNICEF still lacked the money \n     needed to equip the plant.\n       Until this week.\n       When I met South Korea's Foreign Minister, Gong Ro Myung en \n     route home, I raised this urgent need with him. At the time, \n     my hopes that South Korea would help were pretty low. But \n     despite the loss of seats in Parliament that ensued after \n     South Korea's donation of humanitarian aid ended in insults \n     by North Korea; and despite public outrage recently \n     reinvigorated by violent clashes between students and police, \n     Minister Gong carried my request to President Kim Young Sam. \n     And despite President Kim's difficult position as the \n     country's first democratically elected leader--he pledged the \n     money needed to finish this project.\n       His is an example that should inspire political leaders \n     here, and in other capitals. I hope it will mark a \n     determination by charities and private individuals to \n     overcome the challenges of helping people in North Koreaa as \n     well.\n\n\n                           missing servicemen\n\n       Finally, I cannot close without expressing my serious \n     concern about the persistent trickle of rumors that missing \n     American servicemen have been sighted in North Korea. I \n     personally raised questions about a pilot shot down during \n     the Korean War, and conveyed the resolve of Americans to help \n     the families of missing servicemen learn the answers to their \n     question.\n       I know that this Committee's Chairman, along with Senators \n     John Kerry, Nancy Kassebaum, Hank Brown, and Chuck Robb have \n     devoted considerable attention to these questions, as has \n     Senator John McCain. Several of my House colleagues also have \n     worked hard on these issues--especially Congressmen Bill \n     Richardson, Pete Peterson and Lane Evans. I am convinced that \n     this persistent attention, and the ability of Americans in \n     military service today to work on the ground in North Korea, \n     offer the best hope possible.\n       Four decades of isolation have not produced answers about \n     servicemen missing since the Korean War. I believe it is time \n     to try a new strategy; and I hope that North Korea's new \n     openness is the silver lining in the black cloud of the \n     terrible suffering the North Korean people are enduring.\n       Again, thank you for holding this hearing, and for inviting \n     me to testify.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11192-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO AL SMITH\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \nicon of Kentucky journalism. For over 20 years, Al Smith has been part \nof what he calls ``front-porch, cracker-barrel kind of discussion'' on \nKentucky radio. But part of that career, and part of a Kentucky \ntradition, has ended with his announcement of retirement.\n  Albert P. Smith, Jr., was born in Sarasota, FL, but has lived in \nKentucky since 1958. When Al was 15, he entered the American Legion's \nhigh school oratorical contest. Living with his parents and \ngrandparents in Hendersonville, TN, he received coaching for the \ncontest from his grandmother and won the top national prize, a $4,000 \ncollege scholarship. He then traveled to New England, the Midwest and \nthe South giving the speech in cities throughout the region. It was on \nthis trip that Al sharpened his speaking skills.\n  In the mid 1960's, Al bought a 10 percent interest in the \nRussellville News-Democrat and Leader. That interest eventually grew to \nhis ownership of six weekly newspapers. In 1974, while Al was editor of \nthe News-Democrat, he became a household name as host of the radio \nprogram, ``Comment on Kentucky.'' Once a week, he would drive 180 miles \nto host the show. The man who hired Al to do that job, O. Leonard \nPress, told the Lexington Herald-Leader, ``I can't imagine the Kentucky \nlandscape without Al.''\n  Al is still host and producer of ``Comment on Kentucky,'' Kentucky \nEducational Television's longest-running show. But last month, Al \nretired from his job as host of ``PrimeLine with Al Smith'' which is \nbroadcast statewide via radio. He never planned to retire from the \nshow; but recent health problems have necessitated a change in his busy \nlifestyle. His regular listeners will miss him greatly.\n  But perhaps Al's biggest fan is his wife of 29 years, Martha Helen. \nIn an interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader, Martha Helen said of \nAl, ``I still believe Al is the most interesting person I ever met.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Al Smith for his \ndedication to Kentucky journalism and I wish him great happiness in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11193-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11193-S11194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECENT EVENTS IN INDONESIA\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, like many Senators I have been \nconcerned about human rights in Indonesia and East Timor for many \nyears. I was therefore pleased when the Clinton administration \nindicated on July 25 that it had added armored personnel carriers to \nthe list of military equipment\n\n[[Page S11194]]\n\nit will not sell to Indonesia until there is significant improvement in \nrespect for human rights. The administration's policy already \nprohibited the sale of small arms and crowd control equipment.\n  Two days after the United States reaffirmed and expanded its policy, \nan Indonesian paramilitary group stormed and destroyed the headquarters \nof the Indonesian Democratic Party to eject supporters of the leading \nopposition leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri. Party members had occupied \nthe building to protest the forced replacement of Ms. Megawati as party \nchair in June. The breakup of the protest sparked days of rioting in \nwhich at least 5 people were killed, 149 were injured, and dozens \ndisappeared.\n  In the months after the riot, the Suharto government has cracked down \non opposition groups, arresting more than 200 members of labor, human \nrights, and political organizations. Some individuals have reportedly \nbeen tortured in detention.\n  Under pressure from Congress, the administration agreed to delay the \nsale of F-16 fighter jets to Indonesia in response to the crackdown. In \na letter I wrote urging the administration not to proceed with this \nsale, I noted that providing military equipment to a government that \nengages in a pattern of human rights violations is contrary to section \n502(B) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and that the Indonesian \nGovernment clearly fits this description. I urged the administration \nnot to proceed with the sale until the Indonesian Government ``provides \na full accounting of the individuals who have been detained and the \ncharges against them, assurances that they are not being subjected to \nmistreatment and that they have access to lawyers and their families, \nand that people detained for their political views have been \nreleased.''\n  I was therefore disturbed to learn weeks later that administration \nofficials, having delayed the sale of F-16's on account of the human \nrights situation, were saying publicly that the sale would proceed ``as \nearly as January.'' This undercut an opportunity to send a strong \nsignal to a regime that has quashed political dissent consistently and \nwhose actions since July reveal a disregard for the principals of \ndemocracy that the United States seeks to promote around the world. The \nadministration should make clear, both privately and publicly, that \nthis sale will not proceed until the Indonesian Government complies \nwith international human rights standards.\n  Indeed, I urge the administration to condemn all human rights \nviolations in Indonesia. Abuses continue to occur throughout the \ncountry and in East Timor. On November 12, East Timorese will honor the \nvictims of the 1991 massacre of more than 200 people by Indonesian \ntroops at Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili, East Timor. A long-standing \npattern of violations by the Indonesian military persists on that \nisland, and the anniversary of the massacre at Santa Cruz presents an \nopportunity for the United States to urge the Indonesian Government to \nwithdraw its troops from East Timor.\n  To that end, I urge the administration to actively support the \nefforts of Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo to promote dialog and bring peace \nto East Timor, and to support the United Nations talks on East Timor's \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Pell, \nwho has been a long-standing champion of human rights in East Timor, \nvisited that island in May and issued a report of his trip. In that \nreport, he describes a meeting with clergy in East Timor, who told him \nabout some of the abuses they had witnessed. I ask that these excerpts \nfrom his report be printed in the Record.\n  The excerpts follow:\n\n   Excerpts of Trip Report of Senator Claiborne Pell on His Visit to \n               Indonesia and East Timor in May-June 1996\n\n       I had hoped to meet with the Bishop of East Timor, Msgr. \n     Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo. Bishop Belo is widely admired for \n     his forthright objections to Indonesian human rights abuses \n     and is a vital leader of his people. Regrettably, he was away \n     from East Timor during my visit, though we were able to talk \n     by phone.\n       I was able to meet with eleven priests from a variety of \n     East Timorese parishes in what was by far the most fruitful \n     and dramatic meeting of my trip . . . these priests gradually \n     and fearlessly opened up to me and told me what they had seen \n     and heard in their parishes over the last 20 years.\n       They spoke of military harassment of the Church that varies \n     from obstructing their ability to meet with their \n     parishioners to trying to create mistrust among the people of \n     the Church . . .\n       None of the priests had been present at the 1991 massacre \n     but one told us, with great emotion, of his experiences, that \n     day and in the months afterwards. His home is near the Santa \n     Cruz cemetery where the massacre occurred. He had heard the \n     shots that morning, but thought at first they were the \n     rumblings of a storm. When he went out later, he heard from \n     people what had happened and he went to the cemetery and \n     tried to give last rites to those who were dying or were \n     dead. The military would not let him approach and tried to \n     make him leave. He stayed anyway and soon saw three large \n     military trucks approach and be loaded with corpses. Then he \n     saw other trucks come that were filled with water and he \n     watched them spray the blood off the ground where the \n     killings had taken place.\n       The wounded were all taken to military hospitals, he said. \n     He then proceeded, without prompting, to confirm the stories \n     I had read and been told earlier, that no one was allowed to \n     visit these wounded in the hospitals, not even the priests. \n     Again he was unable to give last rites to the dying. He \n     estimated that in the month following the massacre as many \n     people died in the hospitals, either from poor treatment or \n     from torture, as had been killed in the cemetery. He told of \n     hearing eyewitness accounts of mass graves holding as many as \n     100 corpses in one pit. He said the month following the \n     massacre came to be known as ``The Second Massacre.'' . . . \n     Emotions around the room continued to rise, both for those \n     telling the stories and those of us listening to them. I was \n     struck by the knowledge that 5 years previously this group \n     would have risked the sudden intrusion of armed officials, as \n     the priests systematically contradicted everything the \n     Indonesian government officials in Jakarta and Dili had said \n     . . .\n\n  Mr. President, we owe Senator Pell our gratitude for his defense of \nhuman rights in East Timor. I want to again urge the administration to \nuse its influence with the Suharto government to permit the supporters \nof democracy to associate and speak freely, and to stop the violations \nof human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11193-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11194-S11195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I hope that in the process of being \nabsorbed in the crises around the world, we do not forget the North \nKorean situation.\n  It is the one place on the face of the Earth where more troops are \nfacing each other than any other, and it is a place where there is \nvirtually no communication between the two Governments, North Korea and \nSouth Korea.\n  Let me add that I appreciate the responsible role that my colleague, \nSenator Frank Murkowski, took on the recent amendment offered by \nSenator Lieberman.\n  It is easy to do things that are popular, and Frank Murkowski won no \nvotes in Alaska with his stand. But he did the responsible and right \nthing for the people of Alaska and this Nation and of the world, and I \napplaud him for it. It is no accident that he has been to North Korea \nand has greater understanding of that situation than many Members of \nthe Senate.\n  Not too long ago, Ambassador James Laney, the U.S. Ambassador to \nSouth Korea, made a speech in which he said that the leaders of North \nKorea ``are driven not by arrogance, but by insecurity.'' I tend to \nbelieve that is accurate. And we have to fashion a face-saving way of \nmaneuvering them to become more responsible members of the world \ncommunity.\n  Ambassador Laney also said in commenting on the situation: ``For our \npart we do not need to act strong because we are strong.''\n  I believe in the soundness in what he has said.\n  I urge members of the State Department and of the administration not \nto put the North Korea matter on the back burner, but to continue to \nfocus on it, and try to bring about greater communication. If the four-\npower talks that have been suggested do not become reality, then at the \nvery least, we ought to be inviting parliamentarians from both North \nKorea and South Korea to meet informally in the United States with each \nother and with others in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11195-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11195-S11196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE TERUYAS\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to share with my colleagues \nin the Senate, a very special story about an immigrant family. This \narticle was written by Mr. Don Chapman, and appeared in the Wednesday, \nSeptember 4, 1996, issue of the Midweek.\n  This story is of three young men, whose parents traveled 4,800 miles \nto begin a new life in the Hawaiian Islands. The name of the sons were, \nAlbert, Herman and Wallace. The Teruya brothers were extraordinary \nyoung men. Like most immigrants, they worked long hours with low wages, \nbut they had great faith in our country. With their meager earnings, \nthey first opened a small restaurant, Times Grill at 635 Kapiolani \nBoulevard, offering 24-hour service. I have had the privilege of \nknowing these brothers for over 50 years.\n  After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Herman and Wallace volunteered to \nserve in the U.S. Army. They served with the most decorated infantry \nregiment of World War II--the 442d Regimental Combat Team. Sgt. Herman \nTeruya, while charging up an Italian hill occupied by crack German \nsoldiers made the supreme sacrifice. His valor is legendary in our \nregiment. After the war, Wallace returned to Honolulu to resume his \nactivities that began before the war.\n  Together, the remaining brothers decided to take the big step and \nestablished a supermarket; it was called Times Supermarket. Today, 47 \nyears later, Times Supermarket is the largest supermarket chain in the \nState of Hawaii. It is a household name.\n  We must keep in mind that we are all descendants of immigrants. This \nis the success story of the Teruya family, where the values of hard \nwork and sacrifice have enabled them to live the American dream.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this special story of the Teruya brothers \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                              The Teruyas\n\n                            (By Don Chapman)\n\n       This is why people have always come to America, and why a \n     teeming mass still strains to reach our shores. This is the \n     American Dream, equal parts sweat and sacrifice, and if \n     you're lucky a place in the sun and chickenskin on the Fourth \n     of July.\n       It's about immigrant kids starting out dirt-poor on a \n     plantation, taking a chance in the big city, working long and \n     hard, living frugally and saving, serving their country in \n     war even as their peers are rounded up into concentration \n     camps, losing a brother in that war and then making his \n     dream come alive.\n       It is timeless Americana. And it is the true story of the \n     Teruyas of Times Supermarkets, which today operates 13 stores \n     on Oahu and employs nearly 1,000 people.\n\n[[Page S11196]]\n\n       ``It's hard to imagine taking that risk, leaving your home \n     to go to a foreign country to look for opportunities,'' says \n     Wayne Teruya, who 2 years ago took over the company that his \n     father and uncle founded in 1949. ``But that's what my \n     grandparents did. They came from Okinawa to work on the \n     plantations.''\n       The Teruyas have been trying bold, new things ever since. \n     The first Times, for instance, was the first retail store in \n     Hawaii to offer air-conditioning (1949). The Liliha store was \n     the first to be integrated into a condominium complex (1975). \n     The Waialae store was the first to use a bar-code scanner at \n     the checkout counter (1979). Today, Times is the leader in \n     supermarket pharmacies.\n       The Times story really begins with Albert Teruya, Wayne's \n     uncle. Seeing no opportunity to improve his bleak life on the \n     Wailea plantation, he left Maui in 1929 at the age of 15 and \n     caught a steamer to Honolulu. Two years later, his brother \n     Wallace joined him.\n       ``They started out working in restaurants,'' Wayne says.\n       The Great Depression was on, and one benefit of restaurant \n     work was that it provided room and board plus wages. The \n     brothers worked 14 hours a day, but the enthusiasm of youth \n     fueled by a dream of something better kept them going. In \n     1936, they pooled their savings and bought the lunch counter \n     at a downtown drug store for $600 and named it the T \n     Lunchroom.\n       Three years later, in partnership with their cousin, Kame \n     Uehara, with whom Albert had first lived in Honolulu, they \n     opened Times Grill at 635 Kapiolani Boulevard, offering 24-\n     hour service.\n       Albert says the name Times, which they took with them to \n     the grocery business, expresses the company's progressive \n     attitude: ``Keeping up with the times.''\n       Two other reasons they chose that name 57 years ago: Times \n     was easily pronounced by non-English speaking immigrants and \n     it fit easily on a small sign.\n       Two years later, Pearl Harbor was attacked. Wallace and \n     another brother, Herman, put their dreams on hold and \n     enlisted in the 442nd. In Italy, Sgt. Herman Teruya gave the \n     ultimate sacrifice. While charging an enemy position, the \n     young infantryman was killed.\n       Wallace returned from the war with Herman's dream still \n     alive.\n       ``My uncle Herman had been interested in opening up a \n     grocery store,'' says Wayne Teruya, son of Wallace. ``My \n     father and uncle decided to pursue that route. They thought \n     there was more opportunity in the grocery business. The \n     restaurant business is long hours, even after-hours, and \n     there's bars and drinking involved. So they decided to try \n     the supermarket business. They got involved in different \n     aspects of the business, working for suppliers, working for \n     another supermarket, learning all the aspects of the grocery \n     business so when they opened their own business, they had a \n     broad perspective of all the different departments.''\n       Selling groceries is far different today than it was when \n     Albert and Wallace first opened the doors in 1949.\n       ``In those days you didn't have too many choices, but in \n     today's marketplace you have too many choices,'' Teruya says \n     with a laugh, then turns serious. ``It's not only the other \n     supermarkets, but Longs, Walmart, K-Mart, as well as the \n     Costcos and convenience stores. We know you have your choice \n     of going anyplace. We know you don't have to come to Times \n     Supermarket to do your shopping. It's not just that you have \n     to eat so you come to our store. We have to deserve your \n     business.\n       ``We're still struggling with the Costcos and Sam's Clubs. \n     The impact of them is that many of our customers go [to \n     discount markets] for their big bulk buys. If they're having \n     a big party, they may decide to go there. So our effort is \n     still to give good customer service and give them good \n     reasons to come into our store.''\n       One innovation that sets Times apart is its pharmacies. \n     ``We have the opportunity in the supermarket industry in the \n     state of Hawaii to be the front-runners,'' Teruya says. ``All \n     but two of our 13 stores have pharmacies. Safeway only has \n     three. Star has two.\n       ``Pharmacy is one of the departments that makes us \n     different among the supermarkets, and one where we're not \n     really challenged. Longs, a regular drug store, is our major \n     competition. With Payless out of the market now, as far as \n     chain pharmacies in Hawaii, it's Longs and Times \n     Supermarkets.''\n       Teruya adds that with the Baby Boomer generation turning \n     50--as he will next year--and becoming senior citizens, a \n     period in human lives that often requires more medical \n     attention and more medicines, Times' pharmacies are in a \n     position to both take advantage of that demographic situation \n     and to help customers: ``If they have diabetes, for example, \n     you can suggest to them food products that will help them in \n     their diet to control the diabetes. We're working on programs \n     where we can give advice on diet needs which crosses over to \n     our foods. Drug cost is a small component of a person's \n     overall health care cost, so if we can do a better job in the \n     pharmacy, the overall medical cost can come down.''\n       Teruya says Times is working on the other innovations in \n     the tradition of Albert and Wallace, but doesn't want to tip \n     his hand just yet.\n       As he looks forward, Teruya glances in the rearview mirror \n     of life. He considers the risks taken by his immigrant \n     grandparents and the hard work of his industrious father and \n     uncle: ``Yes, it does make you feel good to come from people \n     like that. And I feel a responsibility to continue it.''\n       Sometimes when you look in that rearview mirror, some \n     objects appear larger than life. It must be that way for the \n     Teruyas.\n       In 1947, Wallace, Albert and Kame sold Times Grill--to a \n     former employer at the Kewalo Inn who had just returned from \n     a California internment camp--and began methodically learning \n     the grocery business. Wallace worked in Amfac's grocery \n     warehouse and at Tom, Dick and Harry's market on Kapahulu. \n     Albert worked at Sears, where he learned how a big company \n     operates and about customer service.\n       On April 29, 1949, with the help of friends and family who \n     helped stock shelves, they opened the first Times \n     Supermarket, the McCully store at 1772 South King Street.\n       That first store was small by today's standards, but it was \n     modern, well-stocked and air-conditioned. And, says Teruya, \n     it featured Albert and Wallace's basic philosophies that \n     continue to guide the company: ``High-quality merchandise, \n     competitive prices, excellent service. And the customer is \n     always right.''\n       ``My father was more customer relations, my uncle was more \n     administration, looking at the overall operation,'' says \n     Wayne Teruya. ``They were a good balance.''\n       They still are, even in their 80's.\n       ``They've never really retired,'' Teruya says. They still \n     come into the office every day, still visit the stores. \n     You'll never get the business out of their blood.''\n       Their tradition of innovation remains a part of the \n     company.\n       ``We always try to do that, we're always looking for new \n     ways of doing things,'' says Teruya. ``But we're not afraid \n     to copy a good idea, either. If we see something that our \n     competitors are doing and it's working, then yeah, we'll \n     follow.''\n       He recalls that when his father took his wife, Ethel, and \n     their four children on vacation to the Mainland, part of the \n     itinerary was always checking out supermarkets.\n       ``My father would drive and no matter where we were going, \n     if we passed a market, he'd pull into the parking lot. \n     Sometimes we all went in, sometimes we stayed in the car, and \n     he'd go in to see if he could get any new ideas. He's still \n     curious to see what things are working.''\n       Wayne, 49, was 2 when the first Times opened. He has no \n     recollection of that big day in family history, but has \n     plenty of other memories of growing up around groceries:\n       ``I remember running around in our McCully store as a \n     little kid, going upstairs, visiting the offices. The store \n     was closed on Sundays, but a lot of times my father would go \n     to the store on Sunday and take us along and we'd work, \n     either stocking shelves or pulling out merchandise.''\n       He is the second of four children--older brother Raymond is \n     chairman of the Times board. Wayne's first real job was a bag \n     boy at Times:\n       ``I must have been 14-15. I had fun bagging groceries. Then \n     after a few summers, I trained to be a cashier, which I \n     really enjoyed--that's where you get the direct contact with \n     the customers. We always tried to see who could pull in the \n     biggest loads (ring up the most sales). And those were not \n     the automatic scanning days like now. We punched those big \n     NCR (National Cash Register) machines with rows and rows of \n     keys.''\n       Was it tougher being the son and nephew of the bosses?\n       ``I don't think so,'' Teruya says. ``The problem is I was \n     never sure of how good of a job I was doing because maybe \n     people didn't want to tell me I was doing something wrong \n     because of who I was. But hopefully I never did anything \n     wrong.''\n       He graduated from Mid-Pacific Institute and the University \n     of Hawaii, where he majored in accounting.\n       ``I worked for a CPA firm just for a little while at the \n     end of my college years and right after I graduated,'' he \n     says. ``But then I had the opportunity to get into the Times \n     accounting department.''\n       He rose to vice president of sales and executive vice \n     president before being named president and CEO two years ago.\n       It was during his UH years that he met his wife, Sharon. \n     They are the parents of three sons: Weston, 19, a sophomore \n     at Pomona University in California; Wade, a high school \n     senior and Wyatt, a high school sophomore.\n       So far, Wade is the only third-generation son who has \n     expressed any interest in the grocery biz.\n       ``If they ever get interested, fine,'' Teruya says. ``I \n     don't want to push them into the business. My father didn't \n     push us into the business. I worked part-time and after a \n     while I decided it was fun.''\n       He met Sharon, he says, ``at a beach party at Ala Moana. \n     Nowadays, it's kind of spooky down there at night; I'd never \n     want my kids doing that. But it was love at first sight--for \n     me, not for her. I had to chase her for a while. But we just \n     had our 25th anniversary.''\n       His advice for staying together long enough to celebrate a \n     silver anniversary: ``Don't get upset when you have fights. \n     You have to expect to have disagreements. And you have to \n     discuss each other's point of views, so you understand where \n     you're both coming from. And just stick in there because \n     you'll have your ups and downs.''\n       That sounds a lot like his business philosophy, \n     too.\n     \n                               ____________________\n     \n     \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11195-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S11197]]\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DIANA LEWIS\n\n   Mr. WARNER. Mr, President, I rise today to extend my warmest \ncongratulations to Diana Lewis of Charlottesville, VA, on her selection \nas the 1996 Private Sector Employee of the Year by the General Council \nof Industries for the Blind and the National Industries for the Blind. \nShe will be honored at their Annual Training Conference on October 8, \n1996.\n  Ms. Lewis was born with congenital cataracts. She underwent several \neye operations as a young child, which delayed her entry into school. \nHowever, her desire to succeed did not waiver. She attended Romney \nSchool for the Blind in West Virginia but left school early to marry, \nbecome a homemaker, and eventually became the mother of two sons.\n  Ten years ago, Ms. Lewis moved to the Commonwealth and soon faced the \nchallenge of finding her first job. As a single parent with two young \nsons, Ms. Lewis turned to the Virginia Industries for the Blind [VIB], \na division of the Virginia Department for the Visually Handicapped \n[VDVH], for employment and training opportunities. She quickly \ndemonstrated her desire to succeed by mastering many sewing operations, \nbecoming an accomplished seamstress.\n  During her employment at the Virginia Industries for the Blind, Ms. \nLewis earned her general education diploma [GED] and continued her \neducation to become a certified nursing assistant. She joined \nWestminster Canterbury of the Blue Ridge in Charlottesville a year ago, \nand is currently employed as a certified nursing assistant in the \nskilled care unit. As a nursing assistant, Ms. Lewis tends to elderly \nresidents who require constant care. Ms. Lewis hopes to one day become \na physical therapist.\n  Ms. Lewis' drive and dedication to overcome adversity makes her an \nexample for all of us. I am pleased to join Ms. Lewis and her family \nand friends in wishing her much success in all of her future endeavors. \nMs. Lewis is an outstanding representative of the blind community in \nVirginia, and I ask you to please join me in congratulating her as the \n1996 Private Sector Employee of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11197-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SHUT DOWN THE U.S. ARMS BAZAAR\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the finest editorials I have \nread in recent months appeared in the Chicago Tribune, titled ``Shut \nDown the U.S. Arms Bazaar.''\n  It is contrary to the security of the interest of the United States \nthat we are the No. 1 arms merchant in the world. Not only are we the \nNo. 1 arms merchant, but we subsidize what ultimately can prove harmful \nto our security.\n  And it is not only a threat to our security.\n  When I visit a place like Angola and see so many children going about \nwith one leg missing or two legs missing and know that this has been \ncaused, in part, by land mines built in the United States, or financed \nby the United States, I am troubled.\n  Again and again, we are in a situation where we find American weapons \nused against our troops. That should teach us something, but it doesn't \nseem to.\n  This is one editorial that every Member of the Senate and every staff \nmember should read.\n  I ask that the editorial be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                       [From the Chicago Tribune]\n\n                     Shut Down the U.S. Arms Bazaar\n\n       President Clinton spoke eloquently and probably expressed \n     the view of most citizens when, accepting the Democratic \n     Party's nomination in Chicago last month, he pledged that \n     U.S. foreign policy would be one that ``advances the values \n     of our American community in the community of nations.''\n       Here's a place to start, Mr. President: End the outdated \n     and outrageously dangerous policy of encouraging sales of \n     American weapons abroad, particularly to countries in the \n     developing world, unless there is a compelling U.S. security \n     interest to be defended.\n       What American value is represented by the fact that the \n     U.S. remains the largest exporter of weapons in a post-Cold \n     War world in which there is no monolithic enemy to be \n     contained?\n       Although Russia made the news in recent days by \n     outstripping the U.S. in sales of arms to Third World \n     governments in 1995, a careful reading of the report showed \n     that this was an artifact of one transaction: a $6 billion \n     sale of fighter jets to China.\n       Otherwise, however, Uncle Sam is boss of the arms bazaar, \n     with contracts for about half of all arms sales worldwide. \n     Year in and year out, America sells more weapons to the Third \n     World than any other country.\n       Certainly these developing lands could put their scarce \n     financial resources to better use, namely to build or improve \n     schools, hospitals, sanitation and transportation systems.\n       Aha, you say! If the U.S. stops selling these arms abroad, \n     someone else--Russia, France, Italy, Germany, Britain, the \n     Czech Republic, even--will rush in and snatch up the \n     lucrative contracts.\n       So what? Of the 50 armed conflicts in this decade--mostly \n     vile ethnic, religious or tribal rivalries, guerrilla \n     uprisings and petty territorial disputes--45 were fought with \n     weapons stamped ``Made in the USA.''\n       Should weapons sales be our ambassador of democracy? Is \n     increasing the efficiency of armed combatants, without regard \n     to vital U.S. interests, a value we choose to represent \n     America abroad?\n       Even espousing a traditional sense of national security, \n     the U.S. can dominate the international arms market, \n     according to Sarah Walkling, a senior analyst with the Arms \n     Control Association. That's because NATO, the western \n     military alliance that is the backbone of American national \n     security and includes this nation's dearest allies, is the \n     largest market for U.S. arms, consuming 43 percent of \n     American weapons sales abroad at a cost of $3.9 billion. NATO \n     will continue to be the biggest client for American \n     weapons, which is a fine thing for all concerned.\n       But now Chile wants U.S. F-16 jet-fighters. With no \n     international threat to the region, to what purpose would \n     those top-of-the-line attack craft be put? Only to act upon \n     territorial ambitions and border disputes and to spark a \n     wasteful hemispheric arms race.\n       And then there's Indonesia. Indonesia is in the midst of a \n     crude crackdown on political dissent that is the antithesis \n     of values America wants to promote. Should Indonesia get the \n     F-16s it wants? Certainly not.\n       Although Clinton pledged a values-driven foreign policy, a \n     Presidential Decision Directive he signed last year pushes \n     arms sales abroad to ``enhance the ability of the U.S. \n     defense industrial base, to meet U.S. defense requirements \n     and to maintain long-term military technological superiority \n     at lower costs.''\n       That, in the words of William Hartung, a senior fellow of \n     the World Policy Institute at the New School for Social \n     Research, is nothing but welfare for big arms manufacturers \n     and weapons dealers.\n       In order to help American firms get to a bigger share of \n     the world arms market, the U.S. government spent $7.6 \n     billion--in 1995 alone--in subsidies, grants, guaranteed \n     loans and cash payments, and in the use of government \n     personnel to promote products and overseas air shows, Hartung \n     says.\n       The argument that these arms sales abroad protect jobs at \n     home is no longer necessarily true, since many new purchasers \n     now demand, as part of the contract, the right to produce \n     these expensive weapons on their turf. Thus, Hartung says, \n     the biggest production line for the F-16 is no longer in the \n     U.S. but in Turkey.\n       Even more sinister is the concept of ``blowback.''\n       During the Cold War, a powerful argument for arms sales \n     abroad was to allow the United States leverage over foreign \n     powers and to give us inside knowledge about another power's \n     arsenal--to ``know what we're up against.'' Today, all bets \n     are off, and what American troops have come up against is the \n     finest American weapons wielded by opposition troops--in \n     Panama, in Iran, in Iraq, in Haiti, in Somalia and, to a \n     smaller extent, in Bosnia.\n       America cannot control its weapons once sold. Allies whose \n     national security interests coincide with ours deserve our \n     trust and have earned the right to purchase American-made \n     weapons.\n       But weapons sales motivated solely by a market opportunity \n     merely fuel conflict--conflict that may require America to \n     step in later with its diplomatic and military muscle.\n       There is no profit in that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11197-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11197-S11200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AD-HOC HEARING ON TOBACCO\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on September 11th, I co-chaired \nwith Senator Kennedy an ad-hoc hearing on the problem of teen smoking. \nWe were joined by Senators Harkin, Wellstone, Bingaman and Simon. \nRegrettably, we were forced to hold an ad-hoc hearing on this pressing \npublic health issue because the Republican leadership refused to hold a \nregular hearing, despite our many pleas.\n  We held this hearing to listen to real people tell us about the \naddictiveness of nicotine and their support for the President Clinton's \nFDA proposal to cut teen smoking in half. Unlike one of the other \nPresidential candidates, we know that nicotine is addictive. And we \nknow that the FDA should regulate it and protect our children.\n  We also made it clear that we will reject half hearted compromise \nlegislative proposals which do not protect our children from the \ntobacco companies.\n\n[[Page S11198]]\n\n  Essentially, we will oppose any compromise legislation that does \nprotect FDA's ability to safeguard our kids or the public health. Our \nfirst priority in any legislative settlement should be to save our \nchildren from future nicotine addiction.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton deserves credit for being the first \nPresident in recent history to take on the tobacco companies. He has an \nexcellent record of protecting our children.\n  However, this Congress' record on tobacco and children is shameful.\n  On January 3, 1995, a new Republican majority took over Congress. \nThey publicly pushed their Contract with America. But privately, they \npursued another contract--a contract of silence with the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  Since the Republicans took over Congress, more than 660,000 people \nhave died from smoking and over 1.7 million of our children have begun \nsmoking.\n  What has been this Congress' response to this public health epidemic? \nPure silence.\n  In one fell swoop--gone were the House hearings where the CEO's swore \nunder oath that nicotine was not addictive. And gone were the Senate \nhearings on the dangers of secondhand smoke and the health care \nbenefits of increasing the tobacco tax.\n  It took President Clinton's bold FDA policy to break the silence. And \nwe need to make more noise--to stop our children from ever becoming \nhooked. We need to fight the biggest cause of preventable death in \nAmerica--tobacco use. Because like AIDS, silence equals death when it \ncomes to tobacco.\n  At the hearing, we heard from several witnesses who have first-hand \nknowledge of the dangers of tobacco addiction. We heard from Justin \nHoover, a 12-year-old boy from West Des Moines, IA who told us how he \nsmoked his first cigarette at the age of 6, and was addicted to tobacco \nwhen he was 9. He told us how easy it was for him to obtain cigarettes, \noften by stealing them. He told us how difficult it has been for him to \ntry and break his addiction, despite the best efforts of his mother, \nteachers, and his DARE officer, Jody Hayes, who accompanied Justin at \nthe hearing.\n  Officer Hayes said that the level of smoking among teens is the worst \nthat he has seen. He also told us that tobacco is clearly a gateway \ndrug that can lead to marijuana and cocaine use. He strongly admonished \nus that ``we have to stop drug use where it starts, and that is with \ntobacco.''\n  We also heard from Minnesota Attorney General ``Skip'' Humphrey who \ntold us of his concerns of proposed Federal legislation to resolve all \nlitigation and regulation affecting the tobacco industry. He noted that \nit is essential that tobacco ``like every other product Americans eat, \ndrink or ingest, be placed under the on-going jurisdiction of an \nappropriate Federal agency, such as the FDA.''\n\n  We listened to the testimony of Dr. Ian Uydess, who worked as a \nresearch scientist for Philip Morris for over 10 years. He told us how \nwell informed the tobacco industry has been regarding the health \neffects and addictive quality of tobacco. He said that the major \ntobacco companies could have used this information to develop a safer \nproduct, but they chose not to do so.\n  We also heard from Morton Downey, Jr., the former talk-show host \nwhose symbol was the smoking cigarette butt. As he has contracted lung \ncancer, he now asks forgiveness from the young people he may have \ninfluenced to smoke.\n  Alan Landers, a former Winston model, told us of the pain caused by \ntwo lung operations. He gave riveting testimony on the addictiveness of \ntobacco. He told us that he was smoking the night before he was to have \nlung surgery because he could not quit. He now tours high schools \nwarning children of the dangers of smoking.\n  Janet Sackman, another former cigarette model, bravely testified how \nwhen she was 17, she was told by an agent that if she wanted the look \nto get ahead in the business, she should start smoking. She developed \ncancer of the larynx and now struggles to speak.\n  Mr. President, these people are a testament to the tragedy of tobacco \naddiction in this country. And they all have two things in common. They \nstarted smoking before they were 18 and they all have cancer. These \nexamples demonstrate why the President's proposal to protect our \nchildren is so crucial.\n  Mr. President, after I complete my statement, I am going to ask that \nthe statements of the participating in ad-hoc hearing be placed in the \nrecord. Over the next 3 days I will insert the testimony of the \nwitnesses from each of the three panels. I hope that all of my \ncolleagues, from both chambers and both sides of the aisle will read \nthese compelling statements. Regrettably, this will be the only hearing \nrecord on tobacco issues this Congress, despite the constant \nrevelations in the press about industry documents outlining the dangers \nof smoking.\n  I only hope that the next Congress' record on protecting our children \nis not as shameful.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the statements of the Senators attending \nthis ad-hoc hearing be printed in the Record.\n  The statements follow:\n\n                Statement by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg\n\n       First, I would like to thank Senator Kennedy for co-\n     chairing this hearing with me and all of the other Senators \n     who are participating. I would also like to welcome and thank \n     all of the witnesses for being here at today's ad-hoc hearing \n     on teen smoking.\n       We are here to show our support for the FDA proposal to cut \n     teen smoking in half. Unlike one of the Presidential \n     candidates, we know that nicotine is addictive. And we know \n     that the FDA should regulate it and protect our children.\n       Today, we are also here to say that we will reject half \n     hearted compromise legislative proposals that do not protect \n     our children.\n       We will oppose any compromise legislation that does protect \n     FDA's ability to safeguard our kids or the public health. Our \n     first priority in any settlement should be to save our \n     children from future nicotine addiction.\n       President Clinton deserves credit for being the first \n     President in recent history to take on the tobacco companies. \n     He has an excellent record of protecting our children.\n       On the other side of Pennsylvania avenue, however, this \n     Congress' record on tobacco and children is shameful.\n       On January 3, 1995, a new Republican majority took over \n     Congress. They publicly pushed their Contract with America. \n     But privately, they pursued another contract--a contract of \n     silence with the tobacco companies.\n       Since the Republicans took over Congress, 660,488 people \n     have died from smoking and 1,764,000 children began smoking.\n       What has been this Congress' response to this public health \n     epidemic? Pure silence!\n       In one fell swoop--gone were the House hearings where the \n     CEOs swore under oath that nicotine was not addictive. And \n     gone were the Senate hearings on the dangers of secondhand \n     smoke and the health care benefits of increasing the tobacco \n     tax.\n       It took President Clinton's bold FDA policy to break the \n     silence. And we are here to make more noise--to stop our \n     children from ever becoming hooked. We are here to fight the \n     biggest cause of preventable death in America--tobacco use. \n     Because like AIDS, silence equals death when it comes to \n     tobacco.\n       Today, we will hear from people who know firsthand about \n     the dangers of smoking. We will hear from a 12 year old child \n     who is addicted to cigarettes and his DARE officer. We will \n     hear from a former Philip Morris research scientist who will \n     tell us that the tobacco industry knew full well that \n     nicotine was addictive and manipulated it to hook smokers. We \n     will hear form Minnesota Attorney General ``Skip'' Humphrey \n     who is taking on the tobacco industry in court on behalf of \n     our children.\n       Before we proceed, I wanted to let the participants know \n     that there will not be an official hearing transcript for \n     this proceeding but I will insert all written statements into \n     the Congressional record so your stories will become part of \n     the official record of the Senate. I hope my colleagues from \n     both sides of the aisle and both chambers, will read your \n     testimony and work with us to save our children.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 Statement of Senator Edward M. Kennedy\n\n       Twenty-nine years ago today, on September 11, 1967, my \n     brother, Senator Robert Kennedy addressed the World \n     Conference on Smoking and Health. Representatives of thirty-\n     four nations had gathered in New York to talk about ways to \n     stop mounting death rates from cigarette smoking.\n       He spoke to his audience about the difficulty of convincing \n     people--young persons, in particular--that smoking can kill \n     them. He emphasized grim statistics of premature death and \n     illness caused by smoking. He said that cigarettes would have \n     been banned years ago--were it not for the economic power of \n     the tobacco industry.\n       Limiting cigarette advertising was at the top of his list \n     of strategies to discourage young men and women from \n     beginning to smoke. At that time, the industry was spending \n     $300 million a year to attract new smokers.\n       Since then, the amount the industry spends on advertising \n     has soared to $6 billion a year. Much of this advertising is \n     targeted at youth, with images that promise popularity and \n     success for those who smoke. Children are particularly \n     vulnerable to this sort\n\n[[Page S11199]]\n\n     of advertising. The Joe Camel campaign was cynically targeted \n     directly at youth. Profits rolled in, and Camel's market \n     share among youth soared from 0.5% to 32.8%.\n       The industry targets youth because it knows that almost all \n     smokers begin before they reach the age of 18. If you make it \n     to 18 without smoking, it's very unlikely you'll ever smoke. \n     The average smoker begins at 13--and becomes a daily smoker \n     by 14 and a half.\n       For over 30 years, using its relentless political power, \n     the tobacco industry has managed to avoid needed federal \n     regulation of their product. it has been said that tobacco is \n     the least regulated of any legal product.\n       Now, at last, President Clinton has had the courage to \n     insist on real steps to reduce youth access to tobacco and \n     tobacco advertising aimed at youth. His goal is to cut teen \n     smoking in half over the next seven years.\n       President Clinton's proposal comes at a crucial time for \n     America's youth. Not only has smoking been rising steadily \n     among adolescents since 1992, but drug use, especially use of \n     marijuana, is also rising among this same group.\n       Clearly, tobacco is a gateway drug. If we reduce tobacco \n     use, we will reduce other drug use too. According to a 1994 \n     report by the National Center on Addiction and Substance \n     Abuse at Columbia University, children who smoke cigarettes \n     are 12 times more likely to use marijuana and 19 times more \n     likely to use cocaine.\n       Our hearing today is intended to deal with these important \n     issues. It speaks volumes that the Republican Congress is \n     unwilling to hold a hearing like this. But we hope they will \n     pay attention to the facts we will hear.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    Statement of Senator Tom Harkin\n\n       I want to join my colleagues in thanking all of the \n     witnesses who have given their time to be with us today, and \n     I want to add a special welcome to our witnesses here from \n     West Des Moines, Iowa--Justin Hoover and Officer Jody Hayes--\n     who I will be introducing in just a moment.\n       All of us are here because we all agree--we need to protect \n     our children from tobacco--and we need to do it now.\n       For too long, young people have been getting an unfiltered \n     message from the tobacco industry. Smoking is cool. Smoking \n     is harmless. Smoking will make you look older and more \n     attractive.\n       Today, the tobacco industry pours over $6 billion a year \n     into advertising their products and promoting that message. \n     And often they are zeroing in on our kids--through magazine \n     ads, billboards, sporting events, and, of course, the \n     ubiquitous Joe Camel.\n       We know what these tobacco advertising campaigns are all \n     about. They are deliberately designed to keep people smoking, \n     but more importantly, to attract a new generation to the \n     smoking habit. In fact, according to a study published in the \n     Journal of the American Medical Association, Joe Camel is \n     just as recognizable to six-year old as Mickey Mouse.\n       But the industry hasn't stopped with Joe Camel. Joe and his \n     competitors have started merchandising ``clubs'' in which you \n     can smoke your way to all sorts of gifts. A 1992 Gallup \n     survey found that about half of adolescents smokers and one \n     quarter of non-smokers owned at least one tobacco industry \n     promotional item.\n       The motivations of these tobacco companies is clear. \n     They'll do anything to make a buck. But I can't understand \n     irresponsible statements made by some of our elected \n     officials regarding tobacco.\n       Some in Congress have compared tobacco to milk or to \n     chicken soup. What kind of message does that send to our \n     kids?\n       There is a difference. Milk builds. Tobacco destroys. \n     Chicken soup heals. Tobacco kills.\n       The only message that our children should hear about \n     tobacco is the truth. Smoking is a killer. Smoking is \n     addictive. Smoking stinks. It's a deadly habit that will make \n     kids less attractive and less fit. That message needs to come \n     through loud and clear so children like Justin are never \n     tempted in the first place.\n       That message needs to start at home. Parents need to let \n     their children know about the dangers of tobacco. But the \n     message shouldn't end in the home. All of us can be partners \n     with families in the fight against tobacco.\n       We need to make much more difficult for children to get \n     their hands on tobacco in the first place.\n       Kids shouldn't be able to walk into a convenience store and \n     purchase cigarettes . . . or buy them out of a vending \n     machine . . . or even be tempted to steal cigarettes left in \n     the open in self-service displays.\n       President Clinton has put forth a responsible plan. The \n     President's plan is the right thing to do. It will help \n     families keep tobacco out of the hands of their children. And \n     I strongly support it.\n       But I believe we can do more to protect kids from tobacco \n     and strengthen families. That's why I have introduced common \n     sense legislation to eliminate the tax deductibility of \n     tobacco advertising. Today, American taxpayers are forced to \n     cough up nearly $2 billion a year to subsidize the tobacco \n     industry. That's not right and we ought to stop it.\n       Again, I want to welcome Justin Hoover and Jody Hayes. \n     Justin is 12 years old and is from West Des Moines Iowa. He \n     smoked his first cigarette when he was 6-years old.\n       He is going to tell us how and why he started smoking, how \n     he has tried to quit, and how easy it is for him to obtain \n     cigarettes.\n       I also want to welcome Officer Jody Hayes who is a \n     Community Relations Officer for the West Des Moines Police \n     Department. He is a D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance \n     Education) officer and works with students from pre-school to \n     high school. He is on the front lines in the fight against \n     drug abuse.\n       And he has seen first hand how easy it is for young \n     children to gain access to tobacco and how vulnerable they \n     are to the industry's message that smoking is cool.\n       Officer Hayes, I want to thank you for not only being here \n     today, but for the work you do day in and day out to protect \n     our kids and help them stick to the right path. I just can't \n     understand why some in Congress want to cut funds for the \n     D.A.R.E. program and stop people like you from doing the \n     great work you do.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Senator Jeff Bingaman\n\n       I am pleased to be a part of this Ad-Hoc hearing on tobacco \n     issues and in particular the health effects of tobacco use. \n     As many of you know, I have been a strong advocate of taking \n     a tough stand on the issue of federal regulation of tobacco \n     products. Since 1989, I have been working to require the Food \n     and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate the manufacture and \n     sale of tobacco products. I was very proud last year when \n     Congress approved my legislation banning cigarette vending \n     machines in federal buildings on most federal property, and \n     very pleased earlier this year when the General Services \n     Administration (GSA) ordered the removal of the machines.\n       For many years, I also have been working to ban tobacco \n     vending machines on Federal property that are accessible to \n     children. Clearly, something is not working when, every day, \n     more than 3,000 children and teenagers start smoking and \n     1,000 of them will die from tobacco related illness. In New \n     Mexico, nearly one-third of the state's teenagers smoke. \n     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     New Mexico has a teenage smoking rate of 32.6 percent--only \n     eight other states have higher rates. It is difficult to \n     prevent children from buying cigarettes when they are readily \n     accessible from vending machines. If we expect states, \n     localities, schools, parents, and even the tobacco industry \n     itself to help protect our children from tobacco, then we in \n     the federal government should lead the effort.\n       It is time for a new course of action. I am very pleased \n     that President Clinton is expanding the Federal role in \n     fighting teen smoking. This initiative to reduce tobacco use \n     by children recognizes the responsibility that the federal \n     government should take to protect our children from tobacco \n     use.\n       Finally, 10 years ago as a senior member of the Armed \n     Services Committee, I first introduced legislation aimed at \n     discouraging tobacco use in the military by raising the \n     prices of tobacco products in military commissaries to local \n     prevailing prices. Cigarettes are much cheaper in \n     commissaries and exchanges than they are in the civilian \n     market. In August this year, the Department of Defense (DoD) \n     ordered the sale of tobacco products found in commissaries \n     and exchanges to be sold at local prevailing prices. I am \n     pleased to see that the DoD now agrees that we need to stop \n     sending mixed signals to military personnel about the \n     importance of healthy lifestyles while at the same time \n     deeply discounting tobacco products in military stores.\n       I commend my colleagues here today for keeping this very \n     important issue alive during this Congress and for leading \n     the effort to continue to address the types of laws and \n     policies that will protect our children from tobacco.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             Statement of U.S. Representative Marty Meehan\n\n       I want to thank Senators Ted Kennedy and Frank Lautenberg \n     for allowing me to submit my testimony before this ad hoc \n     committee hearing on tobacco. I appreciate the opportunity to \n     participate in this important, if unofficial, event.\n       The new majority, in both the House and Senate chambers, \n     does not believe that the epidemic of youth smoking is an \n     important enough issue to merit an official hearing. Only \n     through the leadership of Senators Kennedy and Lautenberg is \n     today's ad hoc hearing possible. I commend them both for \n     organizing this event.\n       Nicotine addiction and subsequent tobacco related illnesses \n     are the leading cause of preventable death in the United \n     States. Each year, more than 400,000 smokers prematurely die \n     due to tobacco related illnesses. The ranks of smokers, \n     however, are replenished by our nation's children.\n       Tobacco companies have long targeted and marketed their \n     wares towards America's kids. RJ Reynolds' Joe Camel campaign \n     is only the latest in a string of strategies the tobacco \n     industry has employed to entice young people. The industry is \n     forced to target children because adults, in the face of \n     overwhelming medical and scientific evidence, are not \n     impressionable enough to start using a product that, if used \n     as directed, will kill them.\n       The tobacco industry is committed to pushing cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco product. In fact, each year the industry \n     spends more than $6 billion on advertising and marketing in \n     the United States. This massive advertising is successful for \n     the industry. Eighty-six percent of underage smokers buy the \n     three most heavily advertised\n\n[[Page S11200]]\n\n     brands--Marlboros, Camels and Newports. Moreover, ninety-one \n     percent of six year-olds identify Joe Camel as a symbol of \n     smoking.\n       As a result, 3,000 children a day, convinced through a \n     combination of peer pressure, advertising and popular \n     culture, start smoking. 1,000 of these youngsters will \n     ultimately die from tobacco related illnesses.\n       President Clinton has taken a historic move in directing \n     the Food and Drug Administration to enact the first-ever \n     program to protect children from tobacco. The FDA has \n     concluded that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are delivery \n     devices for nicotine, a drug that causes addition and other \n     significant pharmacological effects.\n       The FDA's regulations, which are intended to reduce \n     underage tobacco use by fifty percent over the next seven \n     years, include long overdue restrictions on advertising and \n     marketing, along with an industry sponsored tobacco control \n     campaign.\n       I strongly support President Clinton's heroic leadership on \n     this most important issue. Unfortunately, the tobacco \n     industry has many allies here on Capitol Hill who will \n     most likely launch an effort to derail the FDA's \n     regulations.\n       According to recent reports, the tobacco industry, in just \n     the first six months on 1996, has spent more than $15 million \n     lobbying Congress, the White House and federal agencies. \n     Moreover, campaign donations, both soft and hard, are up \n     dramatically, as the industry prepares to launch a most \n     expensive offense against federal efforts to control youth \n     tobacco use.\n       While the industry may have the financial wherewithal to \n     spend millions of dollars to influence legislators and \n     advertise their misleading messages, public opinion seems to \n     have permanently shifted against Big Tobacco. Through \n     internal documents and the brave testimony of former \n     employees, two of who are here today, decades of duplicity on \n     behalf of the Big Tobacco have been exposed and etched into \n     the collective consciousness of the American people.\n       Those of us in Congress who support President Clinton's \n     actions on tobacco have a responsibility to not only herald \n     these regulations but also hold the line against industry \n     efforts to water them down. Today's hearing should reinforce \n     the idea that the FDA's regulations, and jurisdiction, is \n     necessary to protect future generations of American children. \n     Once again, I applaud the leadership of Senators Kennedy and \n     Lautenberg on this issue and I look forward to working with \n     both of them in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11197-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSALUTE TO ``ODYSSEY OF THE MIND'' PARTICIPANTS FROM BETHEL, CONNECTICUT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngroup of remarkable young people from my home State of Connecticut. For \nthe past 4 years, students from Bethel, a small, rural community in \nConnecticut, have participated in an international problem-solving \ncompetition called Odyssey of the Mind. This competition gives children \nin grades kindergarten through 12 the opportunity to develop their \nproblem-solving and team-building skills by challenging students to \ndevelop unique ways to solve one of five long-term problems. A team \nspends countless hours together to develop and perfect a unique \nsolution to the problem set before them. Their efforts are judged in a \nstate competition and the winning team is asked to represent their \nstate or country at the Odyssey of the Mind World Finals.\n  Earlier this year, two groups of students from Bethel, CT, won first \nplace in their respective categories at Connecticut's Odyssey of the \nMind State Finals and traveled to Iowa to represent the State of \nConnecticut at the Odyssey of the Mind World Finals.\n  Connecticut is very proud of Rosa Alison, David Berv, Ian Stebinger, \nAmanda Kaletsky, Amanda Sherman and Grace Menzies, who made up a team \nthat won a gold medal in the Connecticut Odyssey of the Mind \nCompetition 3 years in a row. I would also like to salute the hard work \nand dedication of Joshua Gewirtz, Elizabeth Cowan, Matt Voloshin, Jane \nBallerini, Peter Geloso, Kerrlee Hunter and Paula Rashkow who also \nrepresented Connecticut at the Odyssey of the Mind Finals this year. In \naddition, I congratulate the student's coaches for a job well done.\n  Clearly, these young students are fine examples of what can be \naccomplished when people put aside their differences and work together \ntoward a common goal. Their creativity, hard work, perseverance and \nwillingness to take risks remind us that Yankee ingenuity is still \nalive in Connecticut. I salute these young people and am confident that \nwe will all be hearing more about these exceptional students in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11200-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMEMORATION OF LAWSUIT ABUSE AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I want to acknowledge a \ngroup of citizens in West Virginia who are speaking out on the issue of \nlawsuit abuse in an effort to serve the public.\n  In many areas of West Virginia, local citizens have volunteered their \ntime to start Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse groups and to initiate \npublic awareness campaigns in their areas about what they see as the \nproblems of lawsuit abuse.\n  The CALA groups focus on education. These citizens are speaking out \nabout an issue that has statewide and national implications. The costs \nof lawsuits can include higher costs for consumer products, higher \nmedical expenses, higher taxes, and fewer jobs due to lost business \nexpansion and forgone product development.\n  Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse has a straightforward goal. They want \nto help the public prevent unnecessary lawsuits that do more harm than \ngood.\n  West Virginians are not the type of people to walk away from a \nproblem. When we see something that's clearly wrong, we work to make \npeople aware of it, and we try to make it right. CALA members believe \nthat they have the opportunity to reform our laws so that the legal \nsystem is more fair, more effective, and more sensible to serve \neveryone's interests.\n  These nonprofit groups have raised local funds to run educational \nmedia announcements and are speaking to local organizations and citizen \ngroups across the State to raise public awareness on the lawsuit abuse \nissue.\n  While the local groups have thousands of supporters, there are also a \nfew individuals who should be recognized for their leadership and for \ndedicating countless volunteer hours. These individuals are: Tom \nHarriman of Kingwood, founding chairman of CALA of northern West \nVirginia; Jim Thomas of Charleston and Jack Klim of Huntington, \ncofounders and spokespersons of CALA of southern West Virginia; and Ken \nLowe of Shepherdstown, founding chairman of CALA of eastern West \nVirginia.\n  Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse groups have declared September 22 \nthrough September 28, 1996, to be Lawsuit Abuse Awareness Week in West \nVirginia. I want to commend all of the individuals who are involved in \nCitizens Against Lawsuit Abuse for their dedication and commitment to \nthis important citizen education project.\n  As someone who has been a leader in the battle of product liability \nreform, I continue to hope for the kind of education, dialog, and \nconsensus-building clearly needed to address problems in our legal \nprocess that hurt consumers, victims, and the private sector. I \nencourage CALA to continue raising these issues and promoting solutions \nthat ensure justice and improve the legal system. West Virginia and the \ncountry as a whole need informed, educated, and dedicated citizens to \nhelp elected officials address serious issues and achieve reforms when \nnecessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11200-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11200-S11201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       POSTAL SERVICE IN GEORGIA\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as we complete the \nappropriations process for fiscal year 1997, I would like to take this \nopportunity to make my colleagues aware of the unacceptable manner in \nwhich the Postal Service has operated in a matter involving an address \nchange request in my home State of Georgia.\n  Mr. President, for 25 years, residents of an area informally known as \nCenterville, GA, located in Gwinnett County, have been trying to work \nwith the Postal Service for a facility that is closer to their homes, \nand an address that reflects the location in which they live. Although \nthese Georgians reside in Gwinnett County, their address is dictated by \nthe Postal Service is Lithonia, GA--a town that is approximately 15 \nmiles away, and is located in a different county.\n  Not only are those citizens having problems with their mail delivery, \nsuch as stolen and misdelivered mail, their address designations has \ncreated great confusion in dealing with everyday household issues such \nas emergency service, insurance, property taxes, sales taxes and parcel \ndelivery. Even small matters, such as ordering a take-out pizza, often \nresult in unnecessary confusion and inconvenience when giving \naddresses. In addition, a round trip\n\n[[Page S11201]]\n\nto the post office to pick up certified mail or parcels is more than a \n30 minute round trip for these people--metro-Atlanta traffic \nnotwithstanding.\n  Instead of recognizing the problems that the Postal Service's address \ndesignation was causing for these residents and trying to work out a \nmutually agreeable solution, the Postal Service has treated the \nrequests of these residents in a manner unbecoming of an agency of the \nUnited States, and has acted in complete disregard for principle. In \nthe name of efficient delivery of mail, the Postal Service has \nsteadfastly refused the repeated requests of these residents to move \ntheir routes to a facility in Snellvile, GA, which is located less than \n3 miles from their homes. Postal Service representatives have even gone \nas far as to attack the motives of the residents requesting this \nchange.\n  Mr. President, to give you an idea of the overwhelming community \ncommitment to a change of address, approximately 5,000 Gwinnett County \nresidents have been assigned a Lithonia address by the Postal Service, \nand my office received a petition from 4,024 of these residents \nrequesting an address change.\n  When this matter first came to my attention, our office in \nconjunction with Congressman John  Linder made several inquiries to the \nPostal Service, and at each point received conflicting responses. As we \ndelved further into the matter, we learned that the Postal Service had \nnot been completely open and honest in its responses.\n\n  Postal representatives have also refused to honor an offer to set up \ntemporary postal facilities if a location could be found rent-free for \n2 years. There appears to be some confusion among postal \nrepresentatives on the exact details of the offer.\n  We understand and appreciate the Postal Service's mission of timely \nand efficient delivery of our mail, but this does not override the fact \nthat the Postal Service is an agency of the U.S. Government and is \nsubject to abide by the principles of government by the people and for \nthe people as is outlined in our Constitution.\n  After almost a year of negotiations, the Postal Service has now made \nan offer to the residents to change the last line of their address to \nAnnistown, GA, and to provide them with a new Zip Code. However, the \nZip Code change has yet to be approved. Although this does not solve \nthe problem of the proximity of a postal facility, it will help them in \ndealing with the difficulties that their address was creating. I \ntherefore urge the swift approval of this Zip Code change by the Postal \nService.\n  At a town meeting held to discuss the proposal, the Postal Service \nrefused to officially attend to answer questions that the community had \nabout the proposed change. However, after the meeting, we learned that \nPostal Service employees secretly attended the meeting and took notes.\n  Mr. President, it is my opinion that this type of behavior is \ncompletely inappropriate for the employees of an agency of the U.S. \nGovernment. The Postal Service had every opportunity to make its \nargument in a public forum, and chose not to do so.\n  This is the second entanglement I have had with the Postal Service \nwhere I have found their behavior to be an abomination to the citizens \nof our country. If the Postal Service continues to operate in such a \nmanner, we must consider the need for further congressional \noversight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11200-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING OPERATION SAIL\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues for \nagreeing to the passage of S. 773, the Animal Drug Availability Act. \nThis legislation is designed to address the severe shortage of new \ndrugs for the treatment of animals. The bill will modernize clinical \ntesting requirements and make them more predictable and will improve \nthe efficiency and timeliness of the Food and Drug Administration's \n[FDA] review of new animal drug applications, while at the same time \nensuring that new animal drugs are safe for animals and humans and are \neffective.\n  The Senate's passage of this legislation is a testament to what can \nbe accomplished when the FDA, the regulated industry, and Congress \nrecognize a problem--in this case, the lack of new drugs for treating \nanimals--and work together in good faith to craft and enact creative, \nreasonable solutions to that problem. Dr. Steve Sundlof, the director \nof the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, and his staff deserve \ngreat credit for their dedication to meaningful animal drug law and \nregulation reform in this Congress.\n  I wish especially to thank each of the Members who has cosponsored \nand worked with me for the passage of this legislation. Without their \neffort and dedication to seeing this bill through the legislative \nprocess, we would not have succeeded in passing this bill today. Our \nformer majority leader, Senator Dole, and Senators Lugar, Pryor, \nPressler, Gregg, Gorton, Coats, Jeffords, Frist, Harkin, Craig, Inhofe, \nGrassley, McConnell, Kyl, Santorum, Heflin, Bond, Kerrey, Bennett, \nHelms, Hutchison, Lott, Bumpers, Mack, Ashcroft, Cochran, Roth, Warner, \nFord, Kempthorne, Robb, Nickles, Stevens, Abraham, Daschle, Grams, \nConrad, Burns, Moseley-Braun, Dorgan, Baucus, and Hatch each deserve \ngreat credit for their active support for this legislation.\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           S. 773, The Animal Drug Availability Act--Summary\n\n       The Animal Drug Availability Act, S. 773, was introduced on \n     May 5, 1995, by Senator Kassebaum. It was approved by the \n     Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources on March 28, \n     1996, as part of S. 1744, the FDA Performance and \n     Accountability Act, and now has a total of 43 bipartisan \n     Senate cosponsors. Subsequently, S. 773 was refined in close \n     collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), \n     and the amendment in the nature to S. 773 reflects these \n     refinements.\n       S. 773 is designed to address the serious lack of drugs for \n     treating animals by modernizing and making more predictable \n     the FDA's requirements for new animal drug testing and \n     improving the efficiency and timeliness of FDA's review of \n     new animal drug applications, without compromising either \n     human or animal safety or product effectiveness.\n       These reforms include:\n       1. Determination of effectiveness: The legislation would \n     clarify the discretionary authority of the FDA to rely on one \n     adequate and well-controlled investigation for the \n     determination of the effectiveness of an animal drug. The \n     study or studies could, but would no longer automatically be \n     presumed to, require field investigation(s).\n       2. Combination drugs: The legislation clarifies that when \n     an already approved animal drugs are used in combination with \n     one another, the FDA may approve the combination drug as long \n     as none of the drugs in combination exceeds its established \n     tolerance or none of the drugs interferes with the working of \n     another of the drugs.\n       3. Collaborative protocol design: The legislation provides \n     for a collaborative protocol design process. The FDA is \n     required to meet with individuals intending to investigate or \n     investigating new animal drugs to mutually decide on the \n     appropriate protocol for the clinical investigation. If the \n     FDA decides that more than one field investigation will be \n     necessary, the FDA must set forth its scientific \n     justification for that decision.\n       4. Drugs for minor uses and species: The legislation \n     directs the Secretary to propose legislative or regulatory \n     options for facilitating the approval of animal drugs for \n     minor species and minor uses.\n       5. Drug tolerance setting: The legislation clarifies that \n     the FDA may approve animal drugs which will not exceed the \n     tolerance set for that drug, as opposed to requiring the \n     manufacturer to determine an optimal dose for the drug.\n       6. Tolerance for unapproved drugs: The legislation provides \n     the Secretary new authority to set tolerances for new animal \n     drugs that are not approved in the U.S. but are used in \n     animals imported for consumption in this country.\n       7. Veterainary feed directive drugs: The legislation \n     establishes a new category of animal drugs--``veterinary feed \n     directive drugs.'' This is a category of drugs between \n     prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs. The bill \n     establishes a number of requirements to ensure that these \n     drugs can be tracked and that they are used appropriately.\n       8. Feed mill licensing: The legislation establishes a new \n     requirement for the licensing of feed mills that are \n     manufacturing feeds containing animal drugs to ensure \n     conformity with good manufacturing practices and for other \n     reasons.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Animal Drug \nAvailability Act (S. 773) is before the full Senate for consideration \ntoday.\n  As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I recognize the need \nfor reform of the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] animal drug \napproval process. Producers and manufactures of animal drugs have been \nconcerned with the lengthy time required to gain FDA approval of animal \ndrugs as well as the lack of new drug options available to treat \nlivestock and poultry.\n  The legislation before us today is a consensus bill that is \nacceptable to FDA, agricultural procedures, pharmaceutical and animal \nhealth organizations and has garnered bipartisan support in the Senate. \nI had written to Senator Kassebaum recently urging prompt action on \nthis legislation and thank her for her efforts to move this bill \nforward.\n  The bill before us today will provide FDA with greater flexibility to \ndetermine when animal drugs are effective for intended uses; streamline \napproval of combination animal drugs when the drugs have been \npreviously approved separately for the same species and conditions of \nuse; provide FDA with greater flexibility in whether field \ninvestigations are necessary to prove efficacy; and require \npresubmission conferences to help FDA and drug manufacturers to reach \nagreement on testing requirements before a drug application is \nsubmitted to FDA. In addition, the bill streamlines the drug \napplication licenses for feed mills, permits FDA to set import \ntolerances for drugs used in other countries, and includes a veterinary \nfeed directive provision which will make new therapeutic animal drugs \naccessible in feed form.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the demise of \none very important piece of legislation--the 1996 FDA reform bill--and \nwhat I hope will be the success of another--the animal drug \navailability reform bill. These bills represent important Republican \npriorities: American patients and consumers, innovation in medicine and \nconsumer products, and a smaller role for the Federal Government.\n  Republicans put forth an FDA reform bill, supported in the Labor \nCommittee by three of our Democratic colleagues, that puts the needs of \nour citizens first. Our goal in developing this legislation was clearly \nto expedite the bureaucratic review process at the Food and Drug \nAdministration, while still recognizing their role in ensuring the \nsafety of products such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and food \nadditives being introduced into domestic and international commerce.\n  In the Labor Committee, our discussions focused on the \nreprioritization of Agency resources and attitudes in order to achieve \nthis goal. And while some have characterized these provisions as \nextreme, I believe that it is important to recognize that a number of \nprovisions in the bill that our chairman, the senior Senator from \nKansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] assembled simply recodify current law--albeit \nnot current practice--by the FDA.\n  In addition, this legislation contained a number of incremental \nimprovements to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. While I will freely \nadmit that many of these provisions do not go as far as the changes \nthat I advocate, I recognize the balance that Senator Kassebaum was \nattempting to strike; that is why I voted in favor of this legislation \nin Committee. I also would like to mention the spirit of the \nnegotiations that I observed Senator Kassebaum engaged in with our \nDemocratic colleagues and the administration. I thought her approach to \nthis important issue was eminently fair, balanced, and accommodating.\n  Mr. President, FDA reform is not a new idea. Like so many of the \nissues we take on, discussion and debate about FDA reform has been \ngoing on for many years. For example, the Edwards Commission was \nestablished by charter in 1989 and authorized by then Secretary of \nHealth and Human Service Dr. Louis Sullivan. This task force was formed \nin response to a growing perception that FDA was in crisis. Serious \nquestions had been raised about the agency's ability to do its job.\n  After a year of public testimony and study, they published a report \nin May, 1991--a detailed analysis of the FDA's inner workings. The \nreport concluded that the FDA was an agency in crisis. A large part of \nthe report focused on internal structure, organization and management; \nthe report recommended individual center adopt mission statements and \nthat paper work flow studies be conducted agencywide. As a result of \nthe report, Congress gave FDA substantially more money and staff--but I \nthink that we all now understand that simply providing the FDA more \nresources does not solve the problems they have at the Agency.\n  Mr. President, I originally had high hopes for FDA reform this \nCongress. On March 16, 1995, in a speech at an environmental facility \nin Virginia announcing phase II of the Reinventing Government \ninitiative, the President even acknowledged that FDA reform was a vital \nissue. In RE-GO II, the administration issued specific recommendations \nfor the reform of the FDA to be achieved through legislative and \nregulatory changes. However, I was concerned by the quotation used from \nthe President's rhetoric on the first page of the follow up white \npaper: ``The Food and Drug Administration has made American drugs and \nmedical devices the envy of the world and in demaind all over the \nworld.''\n  I believe that it is this sort of perception that has gotten us to \nthe point where we are today: a regulatory system that no longer has \nclear boundaries or delineated goals, is anticompetitive, and has an \nattitude that we must function as ``the FDA to the\n\n[[Page S11206]]\n\nworld.'' Former Commissioner Dr. Charles Edwards put it more \nappropriately when he said that, ``The mission of the FDA is consumer \nprotection. Unfortunately, the FDA has tended to confuse its mission \nwith the power to promote what it deems to be appropriate personal and \nprofessional behavior.'' No matter--the administration's white paper of \nreforms proved to be more of a red herring than anything else.\n  The FDA has demonstrated a lack of investment on their part in the \nprivate sectors' efforts to bring cutting edge medicine to American \npatients. Businesses do not engage in activities lightly, especially \nsmall business making substantial investments in their own future. The \nFDA has also indicated an unwillingness to let scientists determine the \nstandard of science, to let doctors freely practice medicine, and to \nallow patients to be informed about their range of options.\n  To the FDA, it all seems to be about money. The authorized user \nfees--or taxes placed on the backs of companies working to provide \ninnovative health care solutions--in the Administration's budget \nrequest continue to grow. The Administration also continues to annually \nrequest two unauthorized user fees: one would levy a new tax on medical \ndevice manufacturers and another would be an important inspection fee. \nIncreasing taxes will not solve the problems that persist at the Food \nand Drug Administration.\n  Peter Barton Hutt, former FDA General Counsel, summed this up well in \na speech before the Utah International Medical Device Congress in 1993. \nHe stated, ``User fees is a false issue. If we do not change the \nphilosophy of the FDA reviewers about the criteria for approving either \nSection 510(k) notifications or PMA applications, we can triple the \nnumber of people in the FDA and not get one additional application \napproved.'' It is these sort of changes in philosophy, as well as \ncorrections to the fiscal priorities, that we are seeking at the FDA \nthrough our reform efforts. But, unfortunately, Congress cannot \nlegislate attitude.\n  I also remain unconvinced that new user fees would ever be sunset, \neven if the application backlog is cleared. I think the discussion we \nwill soon begin in regard to the renegotiation of PDUFA will be \nrevealing on this count. I also have yet to see any proposal that would \nrefund user fees to any company if the product review was not completed \nwithin the statutory timeline--this is an agency that wants to function \nlike a business without regard to the rules of business--``Get what you \npay for.'' I don't see why businesses should be expected to tolerate \nthis.\n  In recent years, there also seems to have been a marked shift from \nproduct approval to enforcement at FDA. While there is no clear cut \ncause for this sea change, the intimidation that has resulted from \nthese actions is great. There is, of course, no way to accurately \nmeasure the chilling effect this may be having on relevant industries. \nBut this police state mentality has spilled over into the appropriate \nregulation of product safety.\n  Companies are terrified that they will be made the victim of a public \ncampaign in the media. The FDA is reputed for its role in propagating \nwidespread fear of retaliation against any company that would cooperate \nwith Congress in its examination of the FDA's mission and regulatory \npractices. We have found that a number of individuals and companies \nfear retribution in the form of delayed FDA product reviews and \nregulatory discrimination if they should criticize the agency. This \nfear has led to hesitancy on the part of potential witnesses to provide \ncommittees with the testimony that they need in order to make an \ninformed judgment on the policies and practices of the agency.\n  Commissioner Kessler has argued that the industry perceives issues to \nbe something other than what they actually are, such as the Reference \nList being viewed as a ``black list.'' While we appreciated the \nassurances made to the Labor Committee by the Commissioner that such \nfears are unfounded, I have yet to learn what affirmative steps the FDA \nhas taken to reassure those regulated by the agency that they may feel \ncompletely comfortable exercising their right to speak freely to the \nCongress, without threat of retribution or retaliation from the agency. \nI have to wonder how many stories continue to go untold, how many \nproblems go unexplored, how many questions remain unanswered.\n  However, Mr. President, I am pleased to note that a couple of FDA-\nrelated problems have been resolved this Congress. One dealt with the \nuntenable restrictions placed on U.S. manufacturers regarding their \nability to export products approved for use in other countries, but not \nyet approved for domestic commerce. Working closely with my colleague \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, we engaged in a lengthy dialog with ranking \nminority member of the Labor Committee, Mr. Kennedy. The result was \npassage of reform of sections 801 and 802 of the Federal Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act, provisions which govern the import and export of FDA-\nregulated products. Subsequently, these provisions were signed into \nlaw, a major victory for U.S. manufacturers who are no longer obligated \nto build factories and send jobs and investment capital overseas.\n  A second major issue that was partially resolved dealt with the \nridiculously unscientific Delaney Clause. Countless experts and \nvirtually every former Commissioner have stated the fact that a ``zero \nrisk'' standard is not only unscientific, but virtually immeasurable. \nAs analytical examinations have improved, science has been able to \ndetect ever-shrinking amounts of trace chemicals in our food supply--\nexcellent science means that minute, formerly undetectable amounts of \npesticides and chemicals can be detected, and even though they pose no \nthreat over a human lifetime, would be banned under the unrealistic \nDelaney scheme. Fortunately, this Congress had the bipartisan wisdom to \ninstitute a realistic, scientifically based standard in place of the \nDelaney Clause as it related to the regulation of pesticides. Congress \nrecognized that in this day and age ``zero risk'' would come close to \nmeaning ``zero food.'' The Delaney reform signed into law takes us out \nof the realm of the theory of a health treat, and into a food safety \nrealm that balances health considerations with an abundant, affordable \nfood supply.\n\n  And, Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will add this animal drug \nreform compromise to the list of items we have accomplished this \nCongress. I understand from my colleague from Kansas that this \nlegislation is the result of a real effort on the part of the FDA, the \nrelevant industry, and her staff. I also understand that the House has \ntaken action on this matter, so there is a realistic chance for these \nprovisions to become law--the type of all that we can all feel good \nabout, a law that balances consumer safety with an appropriate level of \nFederal regulation.\n  I also hope that we will have an opportunity to clear the way for one \nother related measure before Congress adjourns--the biomaterials bill \nthat Senators Gorton, Lieberman, and McCain have been championing for \nmany months. This legislation, which provides reasonable relief to the \nsuppliers of critical raw materials. This relief is necessary to ensure \nthat life-sustaining and life-enhancing devices will remain readily \navailable to American patients.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying that the discussion of \nFDA reform will continue into the next Congress. This is a high \npriority for many of us, as it is such a high priority for American \npatients and consumers on a daily basis. We will continue to work hard \nto define an appropriate role for the Federal Government--for the FDA--\nin the lives of our citizens.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to that we are today seeing \nSenate passage of this important legislation. I especially want to \nthank Senator Kassebaum for her efforts in working out the details of \nthis consensus bill and in arranging for its passage as a freestanding \nmeasure. I also want to thank Senator Kennedy for his cooperation and \nefforts in clearing the bill for passage.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the legislation. It has \nbeen very gratifying to have been a part of the process of reaching \nagreement on the provisions of this bill among representatives of the \nanimal drug industry, livestock and poultry producer organizations, \nconsumers and the Food and Drug Administration. In particular, I would \nlike to commend Dr. Stephen Sundlof, Director of the Center for \nVeterinary Medicine at FDA for his hard\n\n[[Page S11207]]\n\nwork and cooperation in reaching consensus on this bill. This has been \nan exemplary effort in reaching a common-sense balance between the need \nfor adequate regulation and the practical realities of livestock and \npoultry production.\n  The bill does not in any way weaken the protections for human health \ncontained in current law pertaining to animal drugs. The bill does, \nhowever, streamline the animal drug approval process, primarily by \nremoving unnecessary and duplicative testing and investigation \nrequirements found in current law. By reducing unnecessary requirements \nin the approval process, the approval of new animal drugs will become \nless costly and time consuming. That is very important, since the \nlivestock and poultry industries are facing a near crisis caused by the \nlack of approved new drugs. For example, there has been only one new \ndrug approved for use in swine since 1990, and that drug cannot be \nmarketed as a practical matter until this legislation passes.\n  The bill also contains a much needed resolution of the problems \nassociated with veterinary oversight in dispensing of drugs for use in \nlivestock and poultry feeds.\n  This legislation is a huge step forward in improving FDA's animal \ndrug approval process and a real victory for livestock and poultry \nproducers, consumers and producers of animal drugs.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be deemed read a third time and passed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statement relating \nto the bill appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5401) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 773), as amended, was deemed read for a third time and \npassed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 773\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

IMPORT TOLERANCES.\n\n       Section 512(a) (21 U.S.C. 360b(a)) is amended by adding the \n     following new paragraph at the end:\n       ``(6) For purposes of section 402(a)(2)(D), a use or \n     intended use of a new animal drug shall not be deemed unsafe \n     under this section if the Secretary establishes a tolerance \n     for such drug and any edible portion of any animal imported \n     into the United States does not contain residues exceeding \n     such tolerance. In establishing such tolerance, the Secretary \n     shall rely on data sufficient to demonstrate that a proposed \n     tolerance is safe based on similar food safety criteria used \n     by the Secretary to establish tolerances for applications for \n     new animal drugs filed under subsection (b)(1). The Secretary \n     may consider and rely on data submitted by the drug \n     manufacturer, including data submitted to appropriate \n     regulatory authorities in any country where the new animal \n     drug is lawfully used or data available from a relevant \n     international organization, to the extent such data are not \n     inconsistent with the criteria used by the Secretary to \n     establish a tolerance for applications for new animal drugs \n     filed under subsection (b)(1). For purposes of this \n     paragraph, `relevant international organization' means the \n     Codex Alimenterius Commission or other international \n     organization deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The \n     Secretary may, under procedures specified by regulation, \n     revoke a tolerance established under this paragraph if \n     information demonstrates that the use of the new animal drug \n     under actual use conditions results in food being imported \n     into the United States with residues exceeding the tolerance \n     or if scientific evidence shows the tolerance to be \n     unsafe.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. VETERINARY FEED DIRECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Section 503.--Section 503(f)(1)(A) (21 U.S.C. \n     353(f)(1)(A)) is amended by inserting after ``other than \n     man'' the following: ``, other than a veterinary feed \n     directive drug intended for use in animal feed or an animal \n     feed bearing or containing a veterinary feed directive \n     drug,''.\n       (b) Section 504.--The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     is amended by inserting after section 503 the following:\n\n\n                   ``veterinary feed directive drugs\n\n       ``Sec. 504.

or\n       ``(ii) that the applicant has made changes that would cause \n     the application to contain any untrue statements of material \n     fact or that would affect the safety or effectiveness of the \n     animal feeds manufactured at the facility unless the \n     applicant has supplemented the application by filing with the \n     Secretary adequate information respecting all such changes \n     and unless there is in effect an approval of the supplemental \n     application.\n\n     If the Secretary (or in the Secretary's absence the officer \n     acting as the Secretary) finds that there is an imminent \n     hazard to the health of humans or of the animals for which \n     such animal feed is intended, the Secretary may suspend the \n     license immediately, and give the applicant prompt notice of \n     the action and afford the applicant the opportunity for an \n     expedited hearing under this subsection; but the authority \n     conferred by this sentence shall not be delegated.\n       ``(B) The Secretary may also, after due notice and \n     opportunity for hearing to the applicant, revoke a license to \n     manufacture animal feed under this subsection if the \n     Secretary finds--\n       ``(i) that the applicant has failed to establish a system \n     for maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or \n     deliberately failed to maintain such records or to make \n     required reports in accordance with a regulation or order \n     under paragraph (5)(A) of this subsection or section \n     504(a)(3)(A), or the applicant has refused to permit access \n     to, or copying or verification of, such records as required \n     by subparagraph (B) of such paragraph or section \n     504(a)(3)(B);\n       ``(ii) that on the basis of new information before the \n     Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the \n     Secretary when such license was issued, the methods used in, \n     or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, \n     processing, packing, and holding of such animal feed are \n     inadequate to assure and preserve the identity, strength, \n     quality, and purity of the new animal drug therein, and were \n     not made adequate within a reasonable time after receipt of \n     written notice from the Secretary, specifying the matter \n     complained of;\n       ``(iii) that on the basis of new information before the \n     Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the \n     Secretary when such license was issued, the labeling of any \n     animal feeds, based on a fair evaluation of all material \n     facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not \n     corrected within a reasonable time after receipt of written \n     notice from the Secretary specifying the matter complained \n     of; or\n       ``(iv) that on the basis of new information before the \n     Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the \n     Secretary when such license was issued, the facility has \n     manufactured, processed, packed, or held animal feed bearing \n     or containing a new animal drug adulterated under section \n     501(a)(6) and the facility did not discontinue the \n     manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of such animal \n     feed within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice \n     from the Secretary specifying the matter complained of.\n       ``(C) The Secretary may also revoke a license to \n     manufacture animal feeds under this subsection if an \n     applicant gives notice to the Secretary of intention to \n     discontinue the manufacture of all animal feed covered under \n     this subsection and waives an opportunity for a hearing on \n     the matter.\n       ``(D) Any order under this paragraph shall state the \n     findings upon which it is based.\n       ``(5) When a license to manufacture animal feeds bearing or \n     containing new animal drugs has been issued--\n       ``(A) the applicant shall establish and maintain such \n     records, and make such reports to the Secretary, or (at the \n     option of the Secretary) to the appropriate person or persons \n     holding an approved application filed under subsection (b), \n     as the Secretary may by general regulation, or by order with \n     respect to such application, prescribe on the basis of a \n     finding that such records and reports are necessary in order \n     to enable the Secretary to determine, or facilitate a \n     determination, whether there is or may be ground for invoking \n     subsection (e) or paragraph (4); and\n       ``(B) every person required under this subsection to \n     maintain records, and every person in charge or custody \n     thereof, shall, upon request of an officer or employee \n     designated by the Secretary, permit such officer or employee \n     at all reasonable times to have access to and copy and verify \n     such records.\n       ``(6) To the extent consistent with the public health, the \n     Secretary may promulgate regulations for exempting from the \n     operation of this subsection facilities that manufacture, \n     process, pack, or hold animal feeds bearing or containing new \n     animal drugs.''.\n       (c) Transitional Provision.--A person engaged in the \n     manufacture of animal feeds bearing or containing new animal \n     drugs who holds at least one approved medicated feed \n     application for an animal feed bearing or containing new \n     animal drugs, the manufacture of which was not otherwise \n     exempt from the requirement for an approved medicated feed \n     application on the date of the enactment of this Act, shall \n     be deemed to hold a license for the manufacturing site \n     identified in the approved medicated feed application. The \n     revocation of license provisions of section 512(m)(4) of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by this Act, \n     shall apply to such licenses. Such license shall expire \n     within 18 months from the date of enactment of this Act \n     unless the person submits to the Secretary a completed \n     license application for the manufacturing site accompanied by \n     a copy of an approved medicated feed application for such \n     site, which license application shall be deemed to be \n     approved upon receipt by the Secretary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/24/senate-section/article/S11204-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
