Mr. President, yesterday was so-called Junior Tuesday, \nwhere there were a lot of Presidential primaries in our country. It is \none more step in this public discussion that happens every even \nnumbered year under the Constitution in our country whereby the \nAmerican people make choices about their future.\n  It is interesting to watch the political system this year because the \ndiscussion and debate in our political system is fascinating and \ninteresting to me and, I think, millions of others. There is one area \nespecially that has me confused. We have, at the same time, candidates \nfor public office who will tell us that this country is in terrible \nshape, America is in deep trouble, the Congress cannot do anything \nright, and America is going down the wrong road. We have other \ncandidates who say that the solution to at least one of our problems is \nto build a fence between the United States and Mexico to keep \nimmigrants out.\n\n  I scratch my head and wonder, why would we want to build a fence to \nkeep people out? Why do people want to come? Because this is a \nwonderful place, a remarkable country, a country full of hope and \nopportunity, a country many others look to as a beacon of hope in the \nworld. So what is the disconnection here? Why is it that one group of \npeople say it is an awful place, this country is going to hell in a \nhandbasket, and other people say we have too many people who want to \ncome here, so let us build fences to keep them out?\n  I could make the case as a politician, find a lectern and an audience \nand go on the stump and tell people about America: There are 23,000 \nmurders a year, and we are the murder capital of the world. The United \nStates consumes 50 percent of the world's cocaine. There are 110,000 \nrapes in a year, and there are a million violent aggravated assaults in \na year. Ten million people are looking for work, 25 million are on food \nstamps, and 40 million people are living in poverty. There will be a \nmillion and a quarter babies born this year without a father present at \nthe birth, and 900,000 of those babies will never in their lifetimes \nlearn the identity of their fathers.\n  I can talk about the challenges and the troubles in this country. We \nentertain ourselves with everybody's dysfunctional behavior. We, every \nday and every way, on television and elsewhere, hold it up to the light \non Oprah and Phil and Geraldo and Ricki, all of those programs, and \nsay, ``Is this not ugly?'' ``Is this not awful?'' Yes, it is ugly. But \nit is the exception. So it becomes entertainment, entertaining people \nwith other people's dysfunctional behavior.\n\n[[Page S1538]]\n\n This country is much, much more than any of that. The crime, the \npoverty, and the unemployment are challenges we have to respond to in \nthis country. But this is a country that got through a civil war and \nunited on the other side. This is a country that survived a depression \nand got through on the other side. This is a country that defeated \nHitler and cured polio and put a man on the Moon. This is a country \nwith remarkable resources and remarkable will.\n  The question is, How do we as a country and as a government--a \nrepresentative government as called for in our Constitution--together \ncreate the things and do the things necessary to advance our country's \ninterests and make it a stronger, better country for everybody in the \nfuture? We have a chorus of people who tell us that the solution is \njust get rid of Government. The problem is our Government.\n\n  We have done a lot of good things in this country together. I worry \nabout a country where we treat as a public sport an effort to \nessentially try to denigrate our institutions. I worry about a \ndemocracy where there is not respect for the institution of government, \nbecause government is all of us. The people rule this place. Nobody but \nthe people rule this Senate, because the people determine who serves \nhere. Those they want out will very soon be out; those they want to \nretain, who they believe fight for the right public policies and the \nright kind of future for this country, will stay.\n  There is an enormous capacity for good in all of us, to do the right \nthing for this country's future, if we decide to concentrate not on \nwhat is wrong with these institutions, but decide to make sure these \ninstitutions work to create real solutions to the real problems \nconfronting the American people.\n  Some would say the answer is just term limits. If we can impose term \nlimits and get all these evil, venal people out of these institutions \nand move all the knowledge out the door with them, then we have \nsomething that is good for America. In fact, I saw all these folks who \ncome to the floor of the Senate this year. I saw people who served here \n20 and 30 years march to the floor of the Senate and vote for term \nlimits. They did not believe in term limits; not for a minute. They \nfelt politically, I suppose, it is the thing to do. Make sure those who \nhave experience are told, ``You cannot serve anymore.'' I would not \ntrade one Bob Dole for 75 freshman Republicans in the House, just \nbecause I think the people here with the experience and the people who \nare here who understand the value of doing the right things through \nthis institution of government, an institution that is all of ours, are \nthe people who are finally going to advance this country's interests, \nnot Democrat or Republican, but just Americans, working together to \nsolve problems.\n  What are the problems in this country? They are legion. There are a \nlot of them. Personal security issues--we must deal with crime and do \nit in the right way. Values--diminished standards and values in this \ncountry are of concern. We must deal with that in the families, the \nneighborhoods, and the communities all across this country.\n  I want to talk today about the centerfold of what ought to be the \ndebate in 1996. That is the economy and jobs. We have a circumstance in \nthis country that is described well, I think, by two pieces in the \nWashington Post 2 weeks apart. First, ``Labor Cost Rise in '95 was \nLowest on Record.'' Blue collar workers, this says, had benefits or \nlabor costs increasing 2.5 percent. That is not even the rate of \ninflation, just under the rate of inflation. So, workers down at the \nbottom of this country--the people who work, manufacture, and produce--\nare not quite keeping up with inflation. Two weeks later, ``CEO's at \nMajor Corporations Got a 23 Percent Raise Last Year.'' Average salary? \n$4 million. Some of them got raises while they downsized and \nstreamlined and cut out 10,000, 20,000, or 40,000 jobs to be more \ncompetitive.\n\n  What does that mean, being more competitive? It means they are global \nenterprises. They do not sing the National Anthem. They do not say the \nPledge of Allegiance. What they want is profit for their stockholders, \nand they want to do that any way they can. If that means hiring people \nwho work for 12 cents a day, 12 hours a day, even if they are 12 years \nold, in some foreign country to make tennis shoes, rugs, or shirts, and \nthen ship the product to Pittsburgh, Fargo, or Denver and sell them, if \nthat spells profit, that is just fine for those interests because it is \nin their economic interests, but it is not in this country's interest.\n  The center of the economic debate in this country is how do we \nprovide the incentives to keep good jobs here in this country and \nprevent jobs from leaving? Now, we have a trade deficit that I am not \ngoing to talk about at great length. Pat Buchanan is out there and that \nlit the fuse on the debate. On part of it he is right, and on part of \nit he is wrong. The debate ought to be this: We ought not in this \ncountry create circumstances where we tell enterprises, ``If you move \nyour jobs and your plant overseas we will make a bargain with you. Your \nFederal Government will give you a tax break.''\n  Can you think of anyone in the U.S. Senate who would decide to go out \nand hold a town meeting or announce for election and decide, ``My \nhypothesis is this: I am going to decide to run on this proposition. I \nbelieve that we ought to provide a tax cut or a tax loophole or a tax \nbreak for manufacturing firms who close their businesses in the United \nStates and move them overseas.'' How many votes do you think that \npolitician would get? They would get booed out of every single room in \nthis country and should be booed out of every single room in this \ncountry.\n  Do you know something? That provision now exists in our Tax Code, and \nwe had a vote on it last October. I tried to get that provision \nrepealed, saying we should no longer have an insidious provision in our \nTax Code that pays companies to move their workers overseas--pays \ncompanies to shut down their manufacturing plant in our country and \nmove their jobs overseas. Do you know how many people voted against my \nproposal to close that insidious loophole? Fifty-two. Fifty-two people \nsaid, ``We believe we ought to keep that tax loophole.''\n\n  The old advice in medicine, to save the party you stop the bleeding. \nIf we are going to start talking about jobs--and we ought to be; that \nought to be the central issue in this Chamber--we ought to start with \nstep one. Every person in this Chamber ought to stand up on this \nquestion, and I will give them the opportunity a dozen times if it \ntakes it this year, because we will vote on this proposition again and \nagain and again: Do you believe we ought to have a provision in our Tax \nCode that says shut your plants down here, move your jobs overseas, and \nwe will reward you, we will give you a big fat tax break worth billions \nof dollars. That is going to be closed this year, one way or another. \nThis Senate is going to vote, and the vote is going to be different \nthan the 52 votes against me last October. I believe we ought to do \nthat as a first step--shut down that insidious tax provision.\n  The second step we ought to do is take the advice of the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Senator Bingaman, and many others who worked on the high-\nwage task force, and start providing incentives to those who create \ngood jobs in this country. Stop the hemorrhaging of jobs out of this \ncountry and start rewarding and providing incentives for those who \ncreate jobs in this country. We can talk forever about all the other \nancillary issues, but what is important to the American family is this: \n60 percent of them sit down for dinner these days and around the dinner \ntable talk about their lot in life. What they discover is that they are \nworking harder and, after 20 years, have less income. After 20 years, \nthey have lost income when you adjust for inflation.\n  That is not the American dream. The American dream is to work harder \nand do better and hope your kids do better than that. But we now have \nan economic circumstance where the largest enterprises in our country \nand in the world have decided they want to produce where it is cheap \nand sell into established markets, which means American jobs leave. We \nhave to decide as a Congress and as a country what it is we are going \nto do to rebuild once more an infrastructure of good manufacturing jobs \nin America.\n  I have said before and I will say it again until people are tired of \nit, you cannot measure America's economic strength by what we consume. \nThe people at the Federal Reserve Board with\n\n[[Page S1539]]\n\nthick glasses, living in concrete bunkers, every month they measure \nwhat we consume. They think heart attacks are a source of national \nstrength and an earthquake is a source of national economic enterprise. \nHurricane Andrew added one-half of 1 percent to the gross domestic \nproduct in our country. That is true. That is the way the Federal \nReserve Board measures economic progress, what do they consume. They \ndocument what we consume, not the damage. That is not what economic \nhealth is.\n\n  Economic health in this country will be measured by what we produce. \nDo you have a vibrant, working manufacturing sector that is competitive \nand produces in a way that is competitive with the rest of the world, \nand also produces good jobs with good income for American workers? If \nyou do not have that, nothing else much matters to those families who \nare having dinner and losing money and talking about their lot in life, \nknowing that their wages are going down, their job is less secure, they \nhave fewer benefits, and they know that the future for their children \nis less bright than that which they face.\n  That is why Senator Bingaman and others--all of us have worked \ntogether to try to create a circumstance where we can begin to debate \nin this Chamber the center of the economic debate in the country: How \ndo you create and retain good jobs in America? There is not any way \nthat we ought to lose on the international economic stage. We just \nshould not.\n  I grew up in a town of 300 people, which is probably the case with \nmany Members of the Senate. It was a small town. When I walked to \nschool I knew I came from the country that was the biggest, the best, \nand the strongest. We could beat anybody in the world at anything and \nwe could do it with one hand tied behind our back.\n  Our competitors are shrewd, tough, international competitors. The \nworld has changed. We cannot countenance unfair trade. We cannot \ncountenance dumping in our markets. We cannot countenance economic \nenterprises that decide they want to produce where it is cheap to \nproduce and sell back to our established market, even if it means fewer \nAmerican jobs.\n  We must decide to stand up for the economic interests of this \ncountry. It is not to say we ought to build a wall to keep things out. \nIt is to say, whether we are talking about the Japanese trade surplus \nwith us or our deficit with them, that we insist you buy more from us. \nIf you have a $50 billion trade surplus with us, or we a deficit with \nyou, then we insist you buy more from us because that is what \ntranslates into more American jobs. Our failure to do that consigns us \nto a future of lower standards of living because of these trade \ndeficits, and that is not something I am prepared to accept. It is not \nsomething I believe my constituents are prepared to accept.\n  It is something we can alter, we can change, if we, in this Chamber, \nfinally get rid of all these distractions and get to the center of the \neconomic debate: What about good jobs in America's future? How do we \ncreate them and how do we keep them? And can we take the first baby \nstep by deciding, all of us, that we will finally and completely close \nthe insidious loophole in our Tax Code that actually rewards companies \nto move jobs overseas, and then begin to take other steps to say we \nwant to, in addition to stopping jobs going overseas with juicy tax \nbreaks, we want to provide incentives that will help create new jobs, \ngood jobs, good paying jobs in this country? And that represents part \nof the work that we have done in the Democratic caucus, especially with \nthe task force headed by Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think we all ought to listen to the \nSenator from North Dakota. I think the Senator from North Dakota laid \nit out very well and if we listen to what he says and the direction he \nwants to go, he has within him the American dream. It was instilled in \nhim as a boy. He could be my son. That's the difference in age. I hope \nI have instilled into my son that he has that opportunity.\n  But, Mr. President, our Nation's economy is strong and it is growing. \nHome ownership, when you read the records, is at its highest rate in 15 \nyears. Mr. President 7.8 million new jobs have been created in the last \n3 years. And the administration's 1993 economic plan has cut the \ndeficit nearly in half. However, for the first time--and I underscore \nfirst time--in our country's history, productivity is surging but real \nwages for workers are declining. That is unacceptable. That is just \nunacceptable, that productivity is surging and real wages for workers \nare declining.\n  The majority of Americans are working longer and harder, as my friend \nfrom North Dakota said, without the promise of higher wages or job \nsecurity from their employers.\n  The days of having one parent at home with the child, or children, \nare becoming a distant memory for many, many families in this country. \nAmerican working families need both parents' incomes now, in order to \nmake ends meet. The number of two-worker families rose by more than 20 \npercent in the 1980's and more than 7 million workers--think about \nthis--7 million workers are holding more than one job. At least two. \nThe largest increase in population of working spouses was among \nfamilies earning the least money.\n  There is no question the standard of living of American working \nfamilies is declining. Workers have invested their hard work, their \ntime--and let me underscore--loyalty to the company they work for, and \nemployment in the companies, and are being repaid with layoffs, \ndownsizing, and relocation by these same employers.\n  The American dream is fast becoming a distant vision for many \nAmerican working families.\n  Society is changing with the growth in technology. Computers are \nreplacing jobs that were once done by hand. We need to change the \noutlook for the American work force by adjusting our education and \ntraining opportunities to reflect the needs of the marketplace.\n  We can no longer view the development of a skilled work force \nseparately from development of the business community. By adjusting to \nthe needs of the business community we can provide our workers with \ngood jobs at real wages. Government cannot solve this problem alone.\n  Let me give an example. In my home State of Kentucky the business \ncommunity, the educational community and local leaders are working \ntogether through school-to-work, and work force development programs, \nto create jobs for the future. We are creating high-technology jobs at \nhigh-technology wages. This is a partnership: Education, partnership \nwith business; partnership with government.\n  Government cannot be all things to all people but it can be an honest \npartner.\n  Kentucky has taken the approach that students not entering college \nshould have both a high school diploma and certified skills, enabling \nthem to enter the work force at a living wage.\n  So, Mr. President, in order to prepare our work force of the future \nwe must maintain the tools such as school-to-work that have succeeded \nin places like my State of Kentucky. The President has requested that \nfunding for school-to-work be restored and I think it should be in the \nnext continuing resolution. I ask my colleagues to support this add-\nback, which will assist 27 States in building statewide school-to-work \ntransition systems.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Dorgan. I feel their report addresses issues that are \nforemost in the minds of American families.\n  I read the other day a statement, I do not know who to attribute it \nto, but I\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\nam going to repeat it. ``A cut in education never heals.''\n  A cut in education never heals, and in there lies our responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Kentucky for \nthat eloquent statement about the problem, and also the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his eloquent statement about the extent of the problem \nand our efforts to find at least some partial solutions to the problem.\n  As both of my colleagues have said this morning, there are millions \nof American working families that are scrambling to pay the bills each \nmonth. They are working longer hours. They are taking home less money \nin real spendable money. Yet what they are having to pay for education \nand for health care is going up, and many of these same families are \nafraid of being laid off from their jobs.\n  So we do have a problem and the problem is twofold. The problem is \nthat our economy has grown too slowly in the last couple of decades. \nAnd, second, the people who are doing the work in our economy, whether \nthey are working for large companies or small companies or nonprofit \norganizations--the people who are really doing the work in our economy \nare getting a smaller part of the benefit from the work that they do \nand from the profit that is being realized.\n  Last spring I went to our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and \nurged that he set up a working group of Senators to explore options for \ndealing with this problem of stagnant wages. This is not, I should say, \na recent problem. This is a problem that has been with us, now, since \n1973. I think all economists would agree that it is a new era in our \nNation's economy.\n  Senator Daschle, of course, agreed. He was enthusiastic about the \nidea and appointed me to chair that group. We turned out a report \nentitled ``Scrambling To Pay the Bills, Building Allies for America's \nWorking Families.'' Mr. President, I think this report summarizes very \nwell the recommendations that we found and that we came up with that we \nbelieve seriously address the problem in a variety of areas. What I \nwant to do this morning is to first describe the problem in some detail \nbut then go on and describe at least the broad outlines of the \nrecommendations that we have made.\n  Many people deserve credit for participating in the preparation of \nour report. My own chief of staff, Patrick Von Bargen, took a lead role \nin it; Virginia White and Steve Clemons in my office deserves special \nthanks, as well as Paul Brown, with the Democratic Policy Committee, \nand many other Senators and staff people here in the Democratic side of \nthe Senate.\n  I also want to thank all the experts that we consulted with, many of \nwhom made major contributions to what we were doing.\n  First, let me talk about the problem. The economy in this country is \ngrowing too slowly. It has been growing too slowly for at least 2 \ndecades now. This issue, as I said before, has been recognized by \neconomists. But I believe the best summary of the problem was made by \nJeffrey Madrick in a recent book that he published called ``The End of \nAffluence.'' That book has in it a chart which I have reproduced here \nso we can make the point very readily.\n  It points out that the long-term annual rate of growth in this \ncountry from 1870 until 1973 averaged 3.4 percent. That is a good rate \nof growth, and it was one that is discounted for inflation. That is a \nrate of growth that we had been able to maintain--at least that average \nrate of growth--through wars, through depressions, and through a whole \nvariety of economic circumstances.\n  Since 1973, the rate of growth has slowed. That slowing of the rate \nof growth is a major part of the problem that we face. There has not \nbeen enough investment in productive capacity in the country. There has \nnot been enough job creation, nor good-paying, high-wage jobs in the \ncountry. So the rate of growth of our economy has slowed to 2.3 percent \nduring the period from 1973 until the present. That slowing of the rate \nof growth is a serious issue that we are trying to address with some of \nthese recommendations.\n  The second serious issue that we are trying to address is that the \npeople who are doing the work in this economy are sharing less in the \nbenefits from the growth that is occurring. Again, we have some charts \nto try to make the point.\n\n  The first of these charts is a chart that shows what has happened to \nreal hourly earnings between 1967 and 1995. These hourly earnings, as \nyou can see, for a period from about 1967 to perhaps 1976 were going up \nand were reasonably high. Since the early 1970's, or the mid-1970's, \nthey have been dropping. Clearly we are in a situation today where we \nare almost back--not quite, but almost back--to the same real hourly \nearnings that people in this country were realizing in 1967. This shows \npart of the problem that American working families are struggling with.\n  Let me show another chart. This is the drop in real average income. \nIt is a slightly different measure, but, again, it makes the very same \npoint. This chart shows that from 1978 until 1995 there has been almost \na continuous decline in real average income for American workers.\n  The next chart shows the share of workers that have pension coverage \nin the country. By ``pension coverage'' I am not talking about just \nSocial Security. I am talking about a pension in addition to Social \nSecurity. In the period from 1979 to 1989--that is just the 10-year \nperiod--you can see a dramatic dropoff in the total number or the total \npercentage of workers with pension coverage which dropped from 50 \npercent in 1979 to 43 percent in 1989. When you break that down \naccording to the level of education of workers, you can see a much more \ndramatic impact on people who have not had the education. For those \nwith less than a high school diploma, the number of those workers with \npension coverage was 44 percent in 1979. It dropped to 28 percent in \n1989.\n  The next chart is full-time male workers with health insurance. We \nspend a lot of time around here talking about health insurance coverage \nand the importance of that. Again, taking the period from 1979--this \nchart goes from 1979 to 1992--it shows that the total figures are that \n87.3 percent of full-time male workers had health insurance in 1979. \nThat 87.3 percent dropped to 70 percent by 1992.\n  Again, just to show the way that breaks out by education level, for \npeople with less than a high school diploma, 87.7 percent of those \npeople had some type of health insurance in 1979. That had dropped in \n1987 to 53.8 percent, a mere 14 years later.\n  The next chart shows the job insecurity in the 1970's and 1980's. \nThis is a very interesting chart, in my view, because it shows what is \nhappening to a lot of families. This shows the percentage of workers \nthat are age 24 to 58 who changed employers at least four times during \nthe decade. That is a lot of change. In the 1970's, you can see that \nsomething around 13 percent of all workers aged 24 to 58 had to change \njobs four times in that decade. When you look in the 1980's, that \nnumber, the percentage of workers who had to change jobs four times, \ndoubled and is nearly at 30 percent. This is twice as many workers \nchanged employers at least four times during the 1980's as changed \nemployers during the 1970's.\n\n  The final one of these charts that I want to show on the problem is \ntrying to point out what is called ``the mean time to financial \nfailure.'' By ``financial failure,'' we essentially mean if a person \nloses their job, how long will it be until they have exhausted their \nfinancial resources? This is broken down by fifths, or quintiles, \naccording to family income. For the lowest fifth of all families as far \nas their income level, of course, they have no time. If they lose their \njob, they are facing financial failure immediately. For the second \nfifth, it is half of 1 month until they face financial failure; the \nmiddle fifth, 3.6 months; the fourth fifth, 4.66; and even the top \nfifth is only a little over 18 months from financial failure. On \naverage--that is this final column--it is 3.64 months from loss of job \nto total financial failure for American families.\n  Mr. President, I think this makes the case that there is a problem. \nThis is not a manufactured problem. This is not a rhetorical problem. \nThis is a real life problem that many working Americans are faced with.\n\n[[Page S1541]]\n\n  The debate, unfortunately, about this problem has not been \nparticularly productive. The debate which the public hears on the issue \nsort of veers from those who are surprised to discover that there is a \nproblem on the one hand to those who recognize that there is a problem \nbut have no plan to deal with it other than giving speeches, attacking \ncorporate management, or attacking foreign companies or foreign \ncountries for unfair trade practices.\n  There is no set of proposals that has been put forward so far in the \npublic debate to try to come to grips with this very real problem. What \nwe tried to do in the report that I referred to earlier was to come up \nwith that set of recommendations and get this debate on to a serious \nplain.\n  In putting these recommendations together, we have tried to move the \ndebate past the blame game and name calling and on to thoughtful \nconsideration and policy options.\n  First, what can we do to stimulate the growth, going back to the \nfirst chart I referred to. And second, what can we do to ensure that \nAmerica's working families fairly benefit from the growth that does \noccur? In the report that I referred to, we have some 80 specific \nrecommendations. I am sure that no single Senator supports each, but \neach is a proposal that deserves to be seriously considered on its \nmerits. I hope that this debate we are beginning now will result in \nthat.\n  Let me describe the three broad areas in which we have made \nrecommendations. First, we have made recommendations to encourage \nbusinesses to become better allies of American families, because they \nhave a tremendous impact. And that is in this column here on the left.\n  Second, we have made some recommendations to make financial markets \nbetter allies for America's working families, and that is the center \ncolumn.\n  And third, we have made recommendations on how Government can become \na better ally for America's working families. Let me just describe \nbriefly the major recommendations in each area.\n  Businesses, how do we help businesses to be better allies with \nAmerica's working families? We concluded fairly early in our discussion \nthat the present corporate income tax is a jumble of complexity that \ndoes not serve the best interests of any of us. In our view, we should \nrepeal the present corporate income tax and replace it with something \nlike the business activities tax that was proposed by Senators Boren \nand Danforth in the last Congress. We believe that would be a major \nimprovement in many respects.\n  Let me cite some of the ways that would improve the situation. First, \nit would eliminate the existing preference in the tax law for debt over \nequity.\n  Second, it would incentivize investment in this country rather than \noverseas, an issue that the Senator from North Dakota spoke about \nseveral times.\n  Third, it would apply the tax as other countries apply their taxes, \non imports and not on exports, so that it would encourage more exports \nand it would see to it that imports coming into this country pay their \nfair share of tax.\n\n  Fourth, it would impose the tax more equitably across all types of \nfirms than the present income tax does.\n  Fifth, it would dramatically simplify the Federal corporate tax.\n  And finally, it would allow us to reduce by half the payroll taxes \nthat are paid by businesses. That is a very major expense to U.S. \nbusiness today, and the shift to a business activities tax would allow \nus to dramatically reduce the payroll tax. We would make up any lost \nrevenue to the Social Security trust fund from revenue that we received \nthrough the business activities tax. But we believe that would be a \nmajor step forward.\n  One other major advantage to adopting this proposed business \nactivities tax is it would allow us to give better tax treatment to \ncorporations that invest in their workers and invest in America. We \ndesignated such businesses as ``A-Corps,'' suggesting that they were \nallied with America's working families, and we provide that the \nbusiness activities tax would be imposed at two different rates, one \nrate for any business with receipts over $100,000, which does not \nqualify as an A-Corp, a second rate for a business that does self-\nqualify as an A-Corp.\n  Let me briefly describe what we intend as the criteria for \ndetermining qualifications as an A-Corp. To qualify as an A-Corp and \nthereby qualify for a lower tax rate, a business would self-certify \nthat it is, first of all, investing in its workers, that it is \ninvesting in pensions and profit sharing, investing in training and \neducation, investing in their health care, making some contribution to \nhelp them acquire health coverage; second, that they are investing in \nplant and equipment in the United States, and that a reasonable \nproportion of their new employment created for meeting the demands of \nthis market is in fact made and produced here in this country; third, \nthat they are doing at least 50 percent of their research and \ndevelopment in this country.\n  Then there are several other items. Let me mention one. We do have a \nprovision in there indicating that there should be some multiple of the \ncompensation of top management as compared to the salary of the lowest \npaid worker. Now, this is controversial, Mr. President, and I do not \nknow that the specifics of what we recommended will be embraced by \neverybody, but I think it is an issue that needs to be discussed.\n  What we basically said was that to qualify as an A-Corp, a company \nwould demonstrate that the compensation of its top executives did not \nexceed the salary of the lowest paid full-time worker by more than 50 \ntimes. That may not be the right figure. I will tell you how we arrived \nat that. It is somewhat arbitrary. We basically said that if you are \npaying the lowest paid worker in your company, say, $15,000, which I \nthink may be a low figure for most corporations, but if you are paying \nthe lowest paid worker $15,000, if you want to pay your top CEO 50 \ntimes that, you can pay him $750,000 a year. That did not seem like an \nunreasonably low number to me at the time we were putting the report \ntogether. Since then, the new information out makes me doubt whether \nthat is the right number. As the Senator from North Dakota referred to \nit, this article in the Washington Post of March 5 says CEO's at major \ncorporations got a 23 percent raise in 1995. It says that the average \ncompensation for chief executives of major companies is now $4.37 \nmillion. Obviously, 50 times the lowest paid worker does not get you up \nto $4.37 million. So maybe it should not be 50 times. Maybe it should \nbe 100 times. At some point, however, I do think it is appropriate for \nthe taxpayers of this country to say we want to give the best tax \ntreatment to corporations that have some sense of equity and some \nreasonable commitment to help their own workers and do not just pay top \nexecutives exorbitant salaries at the same time that they are refusing \nto share any of the profit with the people who are doing the work down \nin the trenches. So that is another part of the issue which needs to be \ndiscussed.\n\n  Let me go on to the second column in our earlier chart which was how \ndo we make financial markets become allies of working families as well?\n  The concept here is very simple. Much of the action that corporate \nmanagement has to take these days which adversely affects the workers \nin that corporation is brought about by pressures imposed from \nfinancial markets. There is a constant pressure to look at the short-\nterm profitability of the company. There is an inability to invest \nadequately in research and development, an inability to invest \nadequately in investments of various kinds that will have a long-term \npayoff. So what we are trying to do is to get something in the law to \ndiscourage the short-term focus and encourage the long-term focus.\n  So what we have done here is to come up with some recommendations to \nreduce the financial market pressure for short-term decisionmaking, to \nreduce financial market pressure for short-term speculation in \nsecurities by imposing a security transfer excise tax on sale of \nsecurities that occurs within 2 years of the purchase of the securities \nat issue.\n  That is the recommendation. This excise tax, this transfer tax would \nbe similar to the ones that are now imposed in Japan and Switzerland, \nin Sweden, in Hong Kong, in Taiwan, and various other countries, with \none\n\n[[Page S1542]]\n\nmajor exception, that the tax goes away at the end of 2 years.\n  We are not discouraging investment in securities. We are discouraging \nspeculation in short-term trading in the securities. In our view, the \ncountry will be benefited, working families will be benefited, \ncorporate management will be benefited if the owners of the \ncorporations have a community of interests with the corporate \nmanagement and want to help them by focusing more on the long term.\n  We would use the revenue from the transfer tax on short-term \nspeculation to create an A fund to create long-term investments in \nworking families. The A fund would be dedicated, first, to funding \ndeductions for higher education and work-skill training. Those higher \neducation deductions--that is the $10,000 deduction the President has \ntalked about--would be used, the resources would be used, to fund a tax \ncredit for dependent children. They would be used to fund programs to \naccomplish work force training, school-to-work, efforts to achieve \neducation goals, technology research and development, and export \npromotion. All of these activities, we believe, do help promote more \njob creation and more high-wage job creation in this country.\n  We also recommend a whole range of proposals to reform the securities \nregulation and accounting area to promote greater attention to long-\nterm investment and performance of business by those who do invest in \ncorporations.\n  Finally, one of these areas I want to talk about just briefly, Mr. \nPresident, is the issue of how we make Government a better ally of \nAmerica's working families. We propose, as part of this overall package \nof recommendations, to reduce the tax burden on working families in \nseveral very specific ways--to cut in half the payroll tax paid by \nemployees.\n  I referred earlier to the fact that the adoption of the business \nactivities tax would allow us to cut in half the payroll tax paid by \nemployers. We believe we should also cut in half and can also cut in \nhalf the portion of the payroll tax paid by employees. I point out to \npeople that this is not a small item. Something over 70 percent of all \ntaxpayers in this country pay more tax under the payroll tax than they \ndo under the income tax. We are suggesting that the payroll tax, which \nis the biggest tax burden on most working Americans today, be reduced \nin half.\n  Second, we are recommending that we reduce individual income tax by \nincreasing the standard deduction very substantially.\n  Third, we are suggesting--and I referred to this before--we permit \nthe deduction of up to $10,000 for investment in postsecondary \neducation and training--this is the President's proposal--and that we \nprovide a $500 tax credit--a $500 tax credit--for each dependent child. \nWe believe that all of these actions can be taken. All of them will \nbenefit working families.\n\n  In addition to that, we can use some of the funds raised by the shift \nto the business activities tax and by the establishment of the A fund \nthat will be established with the use of revenues from the securities \ntransfer tax to increase efforts to improve education and training. We \nwould support skill standards and academic standards for students. We \nwould support school-to-work transition. We would support more work \nforce training.\n  Let me finally say that Government, we also believe, needs to be a \nbetter ally for the self-employed worker and for small business. As \npart of what we recommend here, we would reduce in half the self-\nemployment workers' payroll tax, which is presently 12.4 percent. We \nreduce that to 6.2 percent. We would exempt all small businesses with \nless than $100,000 in annual receipts from Federal business tax. \nCorporate tax returns today indicate that there are about 24 million \npeople filing some type of corporate tax return.\n  With this change, with this single change of exempting all businesses \nwith less than $100,000 in annual receipts, we would reduce the number \nof people who have to file a business return from 24 million down to 9 \nmillion. So there are 15 million businesses that today file business \nreturns that will be exempt from filing such a return or paying a \nbusiness tax after this set of recommendations are adopted.\n  Mr. President, let me just step back from the specific \nrecommendations. I have gone through some of the major ones. I have not \ntried to give an exhaustive description of all of the recommendations \nin our report. But the important goal is to begin this national debate. \nThe important goal is to recognize the centrality of this issue of how \nwe stimulate economic growth and to recognize that we all benefit from \nthose Americans who do the work in this country, we share in the \nbenefits from the growth that occurs.\n  It is not enough to continue to give speeches about the problem. It \nis not enough to continue to ignore the problem. In my opinion, Mr. \nPresident, those of us in the Government need to participate in a very \nreal and important debate at this time in our Nation's history.\n  Our report ``Scrambling to Pay the Bills'' is an effort to move that \ndebate forward and to get us down to some concrete steps that can be \ntaken to help working families in America to do better in the years \nahead. I hope very much that the report has that effect. I hope very \nmuch that the report does stimulate this debate. I hope that, during \nthe remaining days and weeks and months of this Congress, we can get \noff of some of the things that, unfortunately, take up too much of our \ntime here.\n\n  Today, I understand we are going to spend a substantial amount of \ntime debating the Whitewater Committee again. We debated the Cuban \nshootdown yesterday. We have a whole range of things that we debate \naround here that are not directly impacting upon the welfare of the \npeople we are sent here to represent.\n  These recommendations try to bring that debate back to the issues \nthat matter to people in our home States. I hope very much that we will \nseriously debate these issues between now and the end of this Congress. \nI hope very much that we can adopt some of the recommendations in here \nso that we begin providing some relief to those who are in fact doing \nthe work in this country.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, when I left here in early February for \nthe Senate's recess, I was exasperated. Nothing productive seemed to be \nhappening here in Washington, DC. Budget stalemates had become an \naccepted way of life, rather than words to bring Members of Congress to \nwork together to reach agreements. The battles of last year all seemed \nto end in stalemates. And worse, even the air in the District of \nColumbia seemed charged with negativity and mean-spirited rhetoric.\n\n  Today, however, I feel invigorated. My trip home to Washington State \nin early February was hardly relaxing, but it was extremely productive. \nToday, I want to take a moment to share with my colleagues why I feel a \nrenewed sense of optimism and why I am ready to take on new challenges.\n  Mr. President, like many who work with our young people today, I have \nbecome increasingly concerned about what is or, more importantly, what \nis not happening for our youth today. I have spent my life working with \nyoung people as a mother, as a preschool teacher, as a school board \nmember, as a Girl Scout leader, as a PTA member, as a State senator, \nand today as a U.S. Senator.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that young people today are becoming \nincreasingly disillusioned with their\n\n[[Page S1543]]\n\nworld. They feel that they have no chance--more and more of them know \ncollege is out of reach; many people feel unconnected to what is taught \nin our elementary and secondary schools; far too many have no support \nfrom family at home. Increasingly, I hear our young people from all \nwalks of life, from 4.0 students to gang members, say, ``I don't think \nadults care about me today.''\n  Indeed, the statistics about our young people are very disturbing. \nAlmost half of Washington State children fail to read at a basic level \nof competence. The number of young people in my State who are \nincarcerated is increasing. One in sixteen girls in Washington become \nteen parents. That, by the way, is a higher rate than many other \ndeveloped nations.\n  It is important to note there are some encouraging signs. The health \nof Washington State children, whether measured by infant mortality \nrates or child mortality rates or access to prenatal care, is an area \nof improvement.\n  But as I have participated in and listened to the debates and \ndirection of this Congress from welfare reform to Medicaid to \neducation, I have become increasingly concerned that our young people \nare right. Adults do not care about them. Children seem to have been \nrelegated to the bottom of the priority pile at the exact time they are \nfeeling so left out and alone. It is time to change direction for our \nyoung people.\n  Over this last recess, I set out to find what adults need to do to \nmake this Nation a better place for our children to grow up in. I was \ndetermined to stay away from partisan battles and inflammatory debates. \nI wanted to engage people in a conversation about children. I wanted to \nfind goals that we could all agree on.\n  On that basis, I traveled back and forth across my State for 2 weeks \nand invited people of all ages and backgrounds to join me in a \nconversation about Washington children. In four cities around the \nState, people came out in cold and heavy rain to a community center, to \na church, a school, or a college auditorium and they talked, not just \nfor a few minutes, but for 3\\1/2\\ hours. They talked about their own \nkids or the kid next door or their older or younger brothers or \nsisters.\n  We began each of these meetings with a short presentation of some \nobjective local data about how kids are doing, followed by a panel \ndiscussion between local people who work with kids, followed by \nbreakout discussions to come up with things we could agree to do.\n  We covered three aspects in a child's life: Health, education, and \nmembership in community. People talked about how children have to be \nhealthy so they can learn. They spoke of how children needed a relevant \neducation to face a complex economy. They discussed how we must let \nyoung people know we care about them and how only then will young \npeople feel the sense of civic responsibility and pride we all need \nthem to feel.\n  As I said, this was a conversation, and I had one rule: Nobody leaves \nthe room without participating. So we heard answers to one central \nquestion: What can we all agree to do for our children?\n  People brought many different voices and perspectives to these \nconversations. The groups heard from mothers and fathers. We heard from \nstudents, as well as kids who dropped out of school. We heard the \nvoices of business leaders and child care workers. We heard from \nveterans, youth mentors, teachers, and police officers. We heard from \nRepublicans and Democrats and Independents. We heard thoughts from our \nsenior citizens and our seniors in high school. We heard about \nindividual people or government services or business or charitable \nprograms which make a real difference for our kids. We heard about kids \nwho did not get help, who fell through the cracks or who had such a \nhard time there was hardly a way to start helping them.\n\n  We did not just hear about children and young people, we heard from \nthem. Young people on our panels told us how they do not see evidence \nthat adults care about them or their future. They talked about \nsucceeding in school and not realizing any benefit from it. They talked \nabout failing in school because it did not seem relevant or \nchallenging. They spoke of adults designing programs for them but not \nwith them. They spoke from their hearts about the lack of trust and \nfear that exists between them and the adults that they meet in stores \nand on the streets.\n  Overwhelmingly, they wanted to break down the walls of mistrust. The \none word I heard over and over was ``respect.'' They want real respect, \nnot just the kind kids get from joining a gang. And they want an adult \nworld that cares about them so they can build up their respect for \nadults.\n  At every one of our meetings, we heard the voices of young people as \npanelists, as group facilitators, or as group participants. Too many \ndiscussions about children from the school board meeting to the State \nhouse to the floor of the U.S. Senate happen without real participation \nby young people. Who better to include on matters concerning laws and \npolicies affecting our children?\n  And what did all these different people with their divergent, \nindependent, unique American voices, and opinions agree to do? Well, we \nare still writing down all the specifics, but I want to give you a few \nof the common themes that we heard.\n  On the topic of children's health, we heard from people committed to \nimmunizing more children or to creating more child care slots in their \nlocal community. They agreed to meet with other citizens to build local \nawareness and to tap local resources for these needs. There was a \nstrong consensus everywhere that as adults, we have a responsibility to \ncare for our children and to ensure that they have adequate quality \nhealth care.\n  On education, we heard from children who wanted to participate in \nactivities and learning experiences after school but who did not have \nthe $35 sign-up fee for the program. They wanted to work off the fee or \nto earn good grades so that they could participate.\n  Over and over, I heard that we must make our education system \nrelevant for tomorrow. Young people want curricula in classes that will \ngive them the skills for the job market and focus them for the world \nthey are entering.\n\n  On involving young people in the community, we heard from business \nleaders who want to increase their investment in the citizenship of \nyoung people. They agreed to donate time for their workers to help \nchildren do job shadowing or give kids a place to fit in.\n  There was a strong feeling from both young people and adults that \nevery one of us must begin to take more time to be involved with each \nother in our neighborhoods and in our communities.\n  In addition to what people wanted to do, there were some trends I \nnoticed that I want to share with you.\n  First, people agreed to have a polite discourse. One reason young \npeople say today that they have a hard time getting along is that they \nsay they have no role models. We disagree all the time in the Senate. \nWe have genuine differences of opinion, and we express them freely. \nWell, I will tell you right now, we do it too freely. We need to find \nwhere we agree. All we talk about are the differences. We have to talk \nabout the shared beliefs as well. We need to set a better example for \nAmerican children and young people and be better role models ourselves.\n  Second, people seemed to leave their cynicism at home and brought \nwith them a sense of hope. This happened even though we heard some \nbleak news about children's health, about how they are doing in school, \nand how they are doing in home and on the streets.\n  People heard that too many children still suffer from preventable \nhealth problems. Too many students cannot read or end up dropping out \nof school. Too many young people see no alternative to violence. Too \nmany have no hope of ever being employed. But despite the bad news, and \nsome good, the people at these meetings never got cynical or depressed; \nit just made them want to work harder.\n  Third, I noticed that people felt the children were too important not \nto talk about and to learn about and to work for. People said children \nare too important to scrimp on. They want us to find somewhere else to \nsave our money. They agreed that communities are the best place to \nsolve most problems for kids, but said you have to involve kids to get \ngood solutions. They agreed the Federal Government should guarantee the \nminimums for all kids and should encourage local action.\n\n[[Page S1544]]\n\n Above all, the young people and all participants agreed we should work \nmore on children's issues and less on other things.\n\n  During these meetings, I promised to put people's ideas up on the \nwalls of my office so every lobbyist who comes in can see what the \npeople of Washington really care about. As people got ready to leave at \nthe end of the evening, I asked them each to take one idea back to \ntheir local neighborhood or their community and make it happen.\n  The posters from these meetings are in the mail to my office in the \nRussell Building, and they contain very specific ideas. I encourage all \nof you to come by my office next week and read what people have to say.\n  I think you will find, as I have, that it is time to put our young \npeople at the top of our priority list. It is time to find a way at \nevery level to focus our schools on preparing all of our children, not \njust a few, for tomorrow. You will see, as I have, that people from all \nwalks of life understand as adults we have a responsibility to give our \nchildren a strong start in life. There is much we can and much we must \ndo to make this happen in our country today.\n  Not too long ago, at a hearing in Washington, DC, I heard a \nbusinessman talk about what he saw in our country today. So often we \nhear that Government should act more like a business. He said that any \nbusiness that wants to be here in the future invests in their most \nimportant resources. He said America is acting like a business that \ndoes not plan to have a future.\n  I agree. It is like we are having a fire sale in our country. \nChildren are our growth capital. They are our new physical plant. They \nare our inventory.\n  We cannot stop investing in kids now and hope to have any future in \nthis country. This is the strong and loud message I heard from people \nall over my State, from all political stripes, from all ages, and all \nwalks of life.\n  I was listening, and I will be working over the next months and years \nto put children back at the top of our Nation's agenda. I hope we can \nwork together as adults to make that happen. Our children are worth it, \nour communities are worth it, and our country is worth it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we had reserved 30 minutes this morning \nfor our freshman focus to talk about some of those things that are of \ngreat importance to American families, to talk about the economy, to \ntalk about jobs, to talk about increasing wages and returns to American \nfamilies.\n  I would like to start with three areas that I think are important, \neven though it is not directly involved. One has to do with how we get \nfacts out, so that we can make decisions based on facts. Another is \njust to comment a little on the broader question of whether we want \nmore Government in our lives, more Government in business, or whether \nwe want to release the private sector to be able to create jobs and, \nfinally, to talk a little bit about the facts as related to the idea \nput forth by the President that ``this is the best economy in 30 \nyears.'' The facts do not substantiate that.\n  First, let me say that it is almost a paradox, it seems to me, where \nwe have the technical ability in this country for everyone who is \ninterested in the world, for that matter, to know precisely what is \ngoing on every day and to know it at the time it goes on. Compare that, \nfor example, to the ability to know what happened in your Government 50 \nyears ago or 100 years ago when people in Wyoming did not know what the \nCongress had done for 3 weeks or a month--maybe they did not care. But \nnow we have the facilities to do that. We know that if Gorbachev stands \nup on a tank somewhere, we see it the instant it happens. We have the \nability to know that. Yet, we find ourselves, I think, in a time where \nmost people are less able to sort out the information and bring it down \nto facts than we have had for a very long time.\n  What is happening, of course, is that the political arena is filled \nwith spinning and posturing and seeking to make things look different \nthan they are. I understand that, and it is not the unique province of \nanyone. But I am not sure that we can really sustain a Government of \nthe people and by the people and for the people, unless the people have \nsome facts. Part of that is our responsibility, of course. We have to \nsort through the stuff and come out with facts. But I have to tell you, \nMr. President, that I guess I have never seen a time like there is now, \nwhere you hear something in the media, you hear something from the \nWhite House, or you hear something from this place and say, gee, I \nwonder if that is the case.\n  Second, let me talk a little bit about the idea of increasing the \neconomy and the growth. I think there is not a person in here who would \nnot be for that. I think it is interesting, and it just happens that my \nfriend from New Mexico just spoke a few moments ago about his \nperception about how to do it. It clearly defines the greater debate \nthat goes on in this country and that goes on in the U.S. Senate--that \nis, do you seek to get more and more Government involved? Do you have a \ntax arrangement where you tell people what they can do and encourage \nthem to do it and get more regulation? Or do you, in fact, seek to \nrelease the private sector so that the economy can grow? Could you \nagree with the notion that the role of Government generally is to \nprovide an environment in which the private sector can prosper? That is \nthe great debate that goes on.\n\n  The Senator talked about bringing this debate back in. Let me remind \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle that that has been the debate \nfor a year. We have been talking about balancing the budget. Why? So \nyou can reduce interest rates and increase the economy. We have talked \nabout regulatory reform. Why? So that businesses can prosper and you \ncan create jobs--good jobs, so that there is some growth in take home \npay. That has been the debate.\n  Unfortunately, my friends have objected to everything that we have \ntried to do. They objected to regulatory reform, and the White House \nthreatened to veto it. They objected to a balanced budget amendment, \nand they threatened to veto it at the White House. Tax relief and \ncapital gains, so that people can invest, so you can do something with \nyour farm when you sell it and pass it on to your kids and create a \nstronger economy. So the option will be--and that is fine, it is a \nlegitimate discussion. Do you want more Government, or do you want to \nrelease the business sector so it can create these kinds of things?\n  Third, let me talk very briefly about the economy and the differences \nin views on that. The President has indicated in his State of the Union \nand at other times that this is the best economy in 30 years. Well, let \nus take a look at it. During 1995, the economy grew at 1.4-percent \nannual growth rate. In the previous decade, it grew at about 3.5 \npercent. In the last quarter of last year, it was .9-percent growth \nrate.\n  The economy has been weaker every year than it was the last year of \nthe previous administration. It is not a matter of blaming. That is \njust fact. The growth recovery in terms of jobs. We have talked about 8 \nmillion jobs. If you break it down into hours and part-time jobs, it \ncomes out to be less than half of that. For the same period in the \n1980's, it created 8 million jobs.\n\n  So this has not been a time of growth, a time of economic prosperity; \nparticularly, it has not been for families. The stock market is doing \npretty good. That is fine. Those are corporate profits. But the problem \nis, I think, you find when you have to pay your stockholders, of \ncourse, in order to get the money to operate, you have a cost of \nregulation that is exorbitant and going higher, and you are squeezed in \nthe end. But who gets squeezed? The workers. Furthermore, you do not \nhave a growth rate that is traditionally where we have been, and you do \nnot have competition for jobs. Salaries do not go up because \ncompetition causes salaries to go up.\n  We have to be honest about where we are. The fact is, it is not the \nbest time in 30 years. It is not even as good a time as we had 5 years \nago. More importantly, what do we do about it to get families into a \nposition where salaries reflect a growing economy, or where families \ncan have more of their own money to spend on their own kids'\n\n[[Page S1545]]\n\neducation and spend it as they choose? That is what it is all about. \nThat is what this debate is about. That is what a balanced budget is \nabout--to be financially and fiscally responsible, and also to reduce \nthe interest rates so that the economy will grow.\n  That is what tax relief is about--middle class tax relief, which the \nPresident promised when he ran. He has never delivered. That is what \n$500 per child is about, so it goes to families. That is what \nregulatory relief is about. It is not a matter of regulation and \nspecifics. It is a matter of being able to grow an economy where there \nare jobs and prosperity. That is what our agenda is about, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The final argument, of course, will be that basic argument of do you \nfollow the suggestion that says it is the Government's task to regulate \nthese, and let us get more government, more regulation and more \ninvolved? Or do we release this dynamic private sector to create jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1544-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WHERE AMERICA IS GOING\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and my friend from \nWyoming for his leadership on this freshman focus, a time where \nfreshman Members of the Senate have an opportunity to get up and talk \nabout issues of importance to the country from a perspective of those \nof us who are relatively new in this body. I think he is right on \ntarget to talk about the issue of the economy and where this country is \ngoing.\n  We have a President who is running around the country talking about \nhow this is the healthiest economy that we have seen and we are doing \ngreat and everything is fine. It actually reminds me of another \nPresident in an election year 4 years ago, who was going around the \ncountry trying to convince the American public that the economy was \nfine and everything is great and this is a healthy economy and we are \nmoving forward. The American public, frankly, did not buy it.\n\n  The reaction was very simple: What country is he living in? What \ncountry is he leading? Does he not have any understanding of what is \nactually going on in the economy, what we are dealing with here, that \nin fact the statistics show that, out of recessionary years, this \neconomy is the slowest growing economy since the 1950's? This is not a \nrobust economy.\n  The Senator from Wyoming was right on target as to why this is not a \ngrowing economy. It is the same reason that the previous President had \nproblems saying it was a growing economy, and that is because this \nPresident and the previous President raised taxes on the American \npublic. They took more money out of their pocket and sent it here to \nWashington. It had a real effect on their take-home pay and had a real \neffect on their ability to be able to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies. That has a ripple effect through the economy, from consumer \nconfidence and their willingness to consume to the real issue of just \npaying bills.\n  I think we may be seeing a repeat here. I know many of us who are in \nthis Chamber now were here as Senators or Representatives during the \n1993 Budget Act, when President Clinton went out and said we have to \nraise taxes and we said this is going to have an effect. It is the same \ntype of tax increase that was put forward in 1990. Many Republicans--I \nwas in the House at the time--many Republicans fought it and said \nPresident Bush at that time was making a mistake; it would hurt the \neconomy and drag the whole economy down and this country down. A lot of \nus believed it would bring the President down. It did.\n  Then 1993 comes around and President Clinton did not learn from the \nmistakes of President Bush and pushed forward through another tax \nincrease--and, I might add, more entitlement programs, more regulation, \nmore on people's backs. Many of us said, ``Learn your lesson from 1990. \nThat is not going to help the economy. That is not, in the long run, \ngoing to balance this budget.'' He said, ``No, we have to do it.'' They \ndid it.\n  As a result, coming out of this recession in the early 1990's, we \nhave had one of the slowest recoveries in history. Job growth, yes. We \nhave had jobs. But I think if you talk to most of the people, the kind \nof jobs being created are not the kind of jobs that will support a \nfamily. You hear Members on both sides of the aisle talking about that. \nThe reason is oppressive regulation, oppressive taxation.\n\n  Almost 25 percent of the income of the average family in America goes \njust to pay taxes to Washington, DC. That is a peace-time high. By the \nway, I like to compare that to what it was back in 1950 when the \naverage American family--same family, average-income family--did not \npay almost 25 percent of their taxes to the Federal Government; they \npaid 2 percent of their income to the Federal Government in taxes. Now \nit is almost 25 percent.\n  Do we wonder why people feel squeezed, why they do not feel they have \nthe opportunities to provide for a family anymore, why both husband and \nwife have to work? If you are a single parent, what do you do? You work \ntwo jobs and you struggle to provide for your children.\n  What we do here is what they did 3 years ago: Put even more taxes on \nthe American public. We believe that is not the answer. We have stood \nup this year and said the answer is not to take the American public for \nmore, not to regulate the American public more, but to put Government \non a diet so we can allow the folks back home to take a little bit more \nout of their paycheck for their own use, not Government use.\n  So we proposed this irresponsible thing. People got on the floor and \nsaid this was such an irresponsible thing to let people keep more of \ntheir own money to help provide for their families. As the song goes, \n``That's my story and I'm sticking to it.'' My story is that American \nfamilies should keep more of their money.\n  We are going to continue to push for a tax cut for American families. \nWe will continue to push for a tax cut to create growth and opportunity \nin capital gains and helping small business people, because creating \njobs is the real answer here. Creating good quality jobs is the real \nanswer here. Growth is the answer--not further taxation, but liberating \npeople. Money should go out and be invested in capital resources so we \ncan create more high-quality jobs in this country. We will continue to \npush for that.\n  We will continue to push for regulatory reform so Government does not \nstifle the creativity of Americans by regimenting them into some model \nthat we believe in Washington, DC, is the best for everyone. We are \ngoing to go out and do the things that are necessary to make this \ncountry prosperous and moving forward.\n  I just hope that the President will come to the realization that \ntightening the belt here in Washington ever so slightly--and frankly, \nthat is all we are talking about in this balanced budget--tightening \nthe belt here in Washington so we can give just a little bit more to \nworking families is not cruel. It may be cruel to some bureaucrats in \ntown, but it is not cruel to American families. It is not cruel to \nAmericans who want good-paying jobs, outside in the private sector, not \njust here in Washington.\n\n  I am hopeful we can somehow come to an agreement that this is not the \nhealthiest economy, that the spin doctors of the campaign of 1996 for \nthe President are not going to win the day to try to convince the \nAmerican public what they know is not true, that this economy is \nbooming and healthy and the best it has ever been. We should get down \nto trying to address the real economic insecurity that American workers \nhave, the real problems of raising families in this country, and do \nsomething about it on a bipartisan basis in this Congress.\n  I am hopeful we can do that. We should be able to do that. I am \nlooking forward to the opportunity to make that happen. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the period for morning business be extended by 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1545-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1545-S1546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this has been a very enlightening morning \nlistening to both Democrats and Republicans refuting this myth that \nseems to\n\n[[Page S1546]]\n\nbe floating around the country that we are enjoying this great economic \ntime when, in fact, the indicators show just the opposite.\n  I happened to be presiding when the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Bingaman, observed that people who are doing the work \nin America are getting less and more rapidly plummeting down to the \npoint where we were in 1967 in terms of real income or purchasing power \nfor the American people. Also we can observe that it is worse than \nmight be indicated by family income because we increasingly have \nmultifamily members working in America. When I was quite young, it was \nsomewhat unheard of. It was not a way of life in America. Nonetheless, \nthe real purchasing power is going down.\n  I do not like to point fingers as to why this is happening, but I \nthink, Mr. President, when you look at the policies that were adopted \nby the current President of the United States, Bill Clinton, it is \nfour-tiered. It is increased spending, increased taxes, increased \nborrowing, and increased regulations. I do not very often quote a very \ndistinguished talk radio show host but I remember the other day he \nsaid, ``If you really want to be competitive with the Japanese, export \nour regulations to Japan and we will be competitive.'' I think there is \na lot of truth to that.\n\n  Some people may have forgotten that back in the first year of the \nClinton administration, in 1993, there was a tax increase that was \ncharacterized by Democrats and Republicans alike, and I specifically \nrecall the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee characterizing that \ntax increase as the largest single tax increase in the history of \npublic finance in America or anyplace in the world. That was a very \nlarge tax increase.\n  I recall, also, when the chief adviser to the President, prior to \nbeing sworn in for her duties, made the observation that there is no \nrelationship between the level of taxation in a country and the \neconomic activity, and further went on to say what we need in this \ncountry in addition to the taxes we currently have is a value-added tax \nto be comparable to that in other industrialized nations that would \nimmediately increase revenues $400 billion.\n  I suggest this is where this administration has gone wrong, because \nthe problem we are having in America is not that we are taxed too \nlittle, but we are taxed too much.\n  I, the other day, on the 9th of January, witnessed the birth of a \ncharming little man by the name of James Edward Rapert, in \nFayetteville, AR. At that time I looked at this very small baby, where \nI was actually there in the room during the delivery of that small \nchild in Arkansas, and I realized that innocent child, who had not done \nanything wrong on his own, inherits a share of the national debt of \n$18,000 that that one individual will have to pay off during his \nlifetime. That individual did not do anything to cause this.\n  Also, I noticed if we do not change this trend that has been \ncontinued by the current administration, that that small child, James \nEdward Rapert, will have to pay 82 percent of his lifetime income just \nto support the debt. That is how we have gotten to the point where we \nare now, where we have to do something about it.\n  There was a man who came to this country by the name of Alexis de \nTocqueville many years ago. He actually came here to study our prison \nsystem, and when he got here he was so impressed by the freedom in this \ncountry and by the wealth of this Nation that he wrote a book. The \nfinal paragraph of that book said: Once the people of this country find \nthey can vote themselves money out of the public trust, the system will \nfail. And that is exactly where we are today, right on the brink of \nhaving a system that will fail. The economy is not good today.\n  One more thing I want to say before yielding the floor, back to this \ntax thing, is the President has opposed a budget balancing amendment to \nthe Constitution. He actually campaigned on a budget balancing \namendment to the Constitution. Also, he vetoed the Balanced Budget Act. \nWhen he vetoed that Balanced Budget Act he was saying that we do not \nwant to live in the confines where we will be able to eliminate the \ndeficit in 7 years.\n  That particular act also included some tax relief. There was a lot of \ncriticism I heard from conservative Republicans all across the country: \nWe do not care about tax relief until we balance the budget. What they \ndo not realize is all we were trying to do is correct a mistake that \nwas made in this country back in 1993 when we passed the largest single \ntax increase in the history of public finance in America or anyplace \nelse in the world. If anyone was not for that tax increase, then they \nshould be for tax relief.\n  I think it is incumbent upon us, and certainly those in the freshman \nclass, who are new here to the U.S. Senate, to have an absolute \ncommitment to giving tax relief, to giving families more of the \nexpendable income that they work so hard for. That is our commitment. \nIt is not just for those of us who are around today but the new \ngenerations that are coming up, the James Edward Raperts. Incidentally, \nthat happened to be my grandson.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition and in memory \nof one of America's most beloved country personalities, Minnie Pearl, \nwho died Monday night at the age of 83. Minnie Pearl was born Sarah \nOphelia Colley, in Centerville, TN, the daughter of a prosperous \nsawmill owner and lumber dealer. As a student at Nashville's Ward-\nBelmont Finishing School in the middle of the Great Depression, not \nmany would have thought Sarah Colley had the background to believably \nportray Minnie Pearl, that man-hunting spinster from Grinder's Switch, \nTN. But her down home country comedy act, old-fashioned dresses, and a \nwide-brimmed hat with a price tag still dangling, found a place in the \nhearts of millions of Americans.\n  Today, the State of Tennessee and the entire country mourn the loss \nof a truly outstanding and inspirational American.\n  After completing her drama education at Ward-Belmont, where I should \nadd that she was a student with my mother, Sarah Colley traveled \nthroughout the rural South for 6 years, putting together amateur \ntheatricals for churches and civic groups. During that time she met \nvarious country folk who formed the foundation for the character of \nMinnie Pearl, as well as Minnie's friends and neighbors from fictional \nGrinder's Switch. The name Minnie Pearl was actually a combination of \nSara Colley's favorite country names.\n  When she returned to Tennessee in 1940, the story-telling character \nof Minnie Pearl had fully developed, and WSM radio in Nashville asked \nher to audition for the Grand Ole Opry. A week after her audition, \nMinnie Pearl made her debut on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry and was \nan immediate hit. Before her second performance the next weekend, Miss \nMinnie had been asked to become a regular member of the Grand Ole Opry \ncast.\n  In the 50 years since she burst onto the stage, Minnie Pearl traveled \nwith country music legend Roy Acuff, entertained troops in World War \nII, and was featured on NBC-TV's ``This Is Your Life.'' She recorded \nnumerous albums, continued her frequent appearances at the Grand Ole \nOpry, and appeared as a regular on the nationally syndicated television \nprogram, ``Hee Haw.'' In 1975 she became the first person elected to \nthe Country Music Hall of Fame for comedy work, and she has been \nhonored by the Academy of Country Music with its Pioneer Award.\n\n  Unlike her country counterpart, Sarah Colley caught her man, Henry \nCannon, and was married to him for more than 40 years, until her death \nthis week. As active members of the Brentwood United Methodist Church \njust outside of Nashville, Sarah and Henry Cannon have been actively \ninvolved in charitable and community affairs all over this country. \nSarah Cannon worked tirelessly for many causes, including the \nChildren's Hospital, the American Cancer Society, and so many others. \nFor her hard work for the Cancer Society, and in recognition of her\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\npersonal struggle against breast cancer, Sarah Cannon was awarded the \nAmerican Cancer Society's 1987 National Courage Award.\n  The Cancer Center at Centennial Medical Center, where she died this \nweek, was named for her--the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center. That same \nyear, she received the Roy Acuff Humanitarian Award for Community \nService. The Nashville Network also created the Minnie Pearl Award in \nher honor, which is an annual community service award given to members \nof the country music industry for their dedication and commitment to \ntheir community.\n  As I traveled across the State of Tennessee, so many entertainers and \nso many artists would come forward and recount stories about how they, \nwhen they first came to Nashville to break in but when nobody knew \nthem, would be pulled over to the side by this legendary figure, Minnie \nPearl, and Minnie Pearl would give them those words of encouragement \nand inspiration to plug ahead.\n  Mr. President, I knew Minnie Pearl personally because my father was \nher family physician for about 35 years. Whether she was in character \nas Minnie Pearl or whether she was simply living in her own private \nlife, or whether she was encouraging aspiring young artists upon their \narriving in Nashville, Sarah Cannon touched the hearts and souls of all \nwith whom she came into contact. It was her warm smile, her folksy \nhumor, her words of encouragement, her tales, and most of all her \nfamous ``How-dee'' greeting--these will all be missed by those whom \nMinnie Pearl had entertained for years.\n  Her kind and loving character will be missed by those across the \nState of Tennessee and across this country. Mr. President, today I \nthank Minnie Pearl and Sarah Cannon for all that ``they'' have given to \ntheir community, to their State, and to their country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1546-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MINNIE PEARL\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to recognize the passing this \nweek of a great entertainer and citizen, Sarah Ophelia Colley Cannon. \nMrs. Cannon, better known as Minnie Pearl, was a tribute to the \nentertainment industry and to our community. She graced the stage of \nthe Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, TN, with her animated humor for 51 \nyears. Who could forget the stories of Grinders Switch, her straw hat \nwith the $1.98 price tag still attached, and her well-known and beloved \n``How-dee!''\n  Minnie Pearl made many contributions off-stage as well. She was a \nhumanitarian who contributed much to her community. Many of her efforts \nwere focused on fighting cancer. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan \npresented Mrs. Cannon with the American Cancer Society's Courage Award. \nIn 1991, the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center at Centennial Medical Center in \nNashville was dedicated in her name. I know that I join all Tennesseans \nand all Americans in saying that Sarah Cannon and Minnie Pearl will be \nsadly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1547-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO DONALD DOWD OF WEST SPRINGFIELD\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

This award honors individuals for their outstanding \ncontributions to their communities and it honors President Kennedy's \ngreat love for his Irish heritage and his belief that ``each one of us \ncan make a difference and all of us must try.''\n  Few have done more for their community or for Massachusetts than Don \nDowd. Don is currently vice president and Northeast manager of \ngovernment affairs for the Coca-Cola Co. He also serves as a member of \nthe Board of Directors of the New England Council, the Adopt-A-Student \nProgram for Cathedral High School in Boston, the Armed Services YMCA in \nCharlestown, and the board of trustees of the Eastern States Exposition \nin West Springfield. Don's commitment to his community and our \nCommonwealth is further exemplified by his work with the Massachusetts \nChapter of the Special Olympics and his work with the New England \nGovernors' Conference.\n  Don eminently deserves this year's Irishman of the Year Award. \nMassachusetts is proud of Don's outstanding leadership, and we are \nproud of his friendship as well. I commend him for his many \nachievements, and I wish him continued success in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1547-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1547-S1550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADVANCE NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Section 220 applies to covered \ncongressional employees and employing offices the rights, protections, \nand responsibilities established under chapter 71 of title V, United \nStates Code, related to Federal service labor-management relations.\n  Section 304 requires this notice to be printed in the Congressional \nRecord; therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the notice be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the notice was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \nExtension of Rights, Protections and Responsibilities Under Chapter 71 \n   of Title 5, United States Code, Relating to Federal Service Labor-\n                          Management Relations\n\n\n                 ADVANCE NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n       Summary: The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     (``Board'') invites comments from employing offices, covered \n     employees and other interested persons on matters arising in \n     the issuance of regulations under section 220 (d) and (e) of \n     the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     ``Act'') Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3.\n       The provisions of section 220 are generally effective \n     October 1, 1996. 2 U.S.C. section 1351. Section 220(d) of the \n     Act directs the Board to issue regulations to implement \n     section 220. The Act further provides that, as to covered \n     employees of certain specified employing offices, the rights \n     and protections of section 220 will be effective on the \n     effective date of Board regulations authorized under section \n     220(e). 2 U.S.C. section 1351(f). Section 304 of the CAA \n     prescribes the procedure applicable to the issuance of \n     substantive regulations by the Board.\n       The Board issues this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (ANPR) to solicit comments from interested individuals and \n     groups in order to encourage and obtain participation and \n     information as early as possible in the development of \n     regulations. In particular, the Board invites and encourages \n     commentors to address certain specific matters and to submit \n     reporting background information and rationale as to what the \n     regulatory guidance should be before proposed rules are \n     promulgated under section 220 of the Act. In addition to \n     receiving written comments, the Office will consult with \n     interested parties in order to further its understanding \n     of the need for and content of appropriate regulatory \n     guidance.\n       Dates: Interested parties may submit comments within 30 \n     days after the date of publication of this Advance Notice in \n     the Congressional Record.\n       Addresses: Submit written comments (an original and 10 \n     copies) to the Chair of the Board of Directors, Office of \n     Compliance, Room LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 Second \n     Street, S.E., Washington, DC 20540-1999. Those wishing to \n     receive notification of receipt of comments are requested to \n     include a self-addressed, stamped post card. Comments may \n     also be transmitted by facsimile (``FAX'') machine to (202) \n     426-1913. This is not a toll-free call. Copies of comments \n     submitted by the public will be available for review at the \n     Law Library Reading Room, Room LM-201, Law Library of \n     Congress, James Madison Memorial Building, Washington, DC, \n     Monday through Friday, between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and \n     4:00 p.m.\n       For Further Information Contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance at (202) 724-9250. This notice is also \n     available in the following formats: large print, braille, \n     audio tape, and electronic file on computer disk. Requests \n     for this notice in an alternative format should be made to \n     Mr. Russell Jackson, Director, Service Department, Office of \n     the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, 202-224-\n     2705.\n\n                               Background\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 applies the \n     rights and protections of eleven federal labor and employment \n     law statutes to covered Congressional employees\n\n[[Page S1548]]\n\n     and employing offices. The Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance established under the CAA invites comments \n     before promulgating proposed rules under section 220 of that \n     Act, the section which applies to covered Congressional \n     employees and employing offices the rights, protections and \n     responsibilities established under chapter 71 of title 5, \n     United States Code, relating to Federal service labor-\n     management relations (``chapter 71'').\n       Section 220(d) authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 220 and further states that such \n     regulations ``shall be the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Federal Labor Relations Authority \n     [``FLRA''] to implement . . . [the referenced statutory \n     provisions] . . . except to the extent that the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section; or . . . as the Board deems \n     necessary to avoid a conflict of interest or appearance of a \n     conflict of interest.''\n       Section 220(e) further authorizes the Board to issue \n     regulations ``on the manner and extent to which the \n     requirements and exemptions of chapter 71 . . . should \n     apply'' to covered employees who are employed in offices \n     listed in paragraph 2 of that subsection and provides that \n     such regulations shall, ``to the greatest extent practicable, \n     be consistent with the provisions and purposes of chapter 71 \n     . . . and of this Act, and shall be the same as substantive \n     regulations issued by the [FLRA] under such chapter, except . \n     . . [for good cause] . . . and that the Board shall exclude \n     from coverage under [section 220] any covered employees who \n     are employed in offices listed in paragraph (2) [of section \n     220(e)] if the Board determines that such exclusion is \n     required because of (i) a conflict of interest or appearance \n     of a conflict of interest; or (ii) Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities.''\n       The provisions of section 220 are effective October 1, \n     1996, except that, ``[w]ith respect to the offices listed in \n     subsection (e)(2), to the covered employees of such offices, \n     and to representatives of such employees, [the provisions of \n     section 220] shall be effective on the effective date of \n     regulations under subsection (e).''\n       In order to promulgate regulations that properly fulfill \n     the directions and intent of these statutory provisions, the \n     Board needs comprehensive information and comment on a wide \n     range of matters and issues. The Board has determined that, \n     before publishing proposed regulations for notice and \n     comment, it will provide all interested parties and persons \n     with this opportunity to submit comments, with supporting \n     data, authorities and argument, as to the content of and \n     bases for any proposed regulations. The Board wishes to \n     emphasize, as it did in the development of the regulations \n     issued to implement sections 202, 203, 204 and 205 of the \n     CAA, that commentors who propose a modification of the \n     regulations promulgated by the FLRA, based upon an assertion \n     of ``good cause,'' should provide specific and detailed \n     information and rationale necessary to meet the statutory \n     requirements for good cause to depart from the FLRA's \n     regulations. It is not enough for commentors simply to \n     propose a revision to the FLRA's regulations or to request \n     guidance on an issue, rather, if commentors desire a change \n     in the FLRA's regulations, commentors must explain the legal \n     and factual basis for the suggested change. Similarly, \n     commentors are urged to provide information with sufficient \n     specificity and detail to support (1) any proposed \n     modification of the FLRA's regulations based upon an asserted \n     conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest, \n     (2) any claim that the manner and extent of the application \n     of the requirements and exemptions of chapter 71 should \n     differ for certain employees or covered employing offices, or \n     (3) exclusion of any covered employees from coverage of \n     section 220 because of an asserted conflict of interest or \n     appearance thereof, or because of Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities. The Board must have these explanations and \n     information if it is to be able to evaluate proposed \n     regulations and make proposed regulatory changes. Failure to \n     provide such information and authorities will greatly impede, \n     if not prevent, adoption of proposals by commentors.\n       So that it may make more fully informed decisions regarding \n     the promulgation and issuance of regulations, in addition to \n     inviting and encouraging comments on all relevant matters, \n     the Board specifically requests comments on the following \n     issues:\n\n  I. Regulations Promulgated by the Federal labor Relations Authority\n\n       As noted above, except as otherwise specified, section 220 \n     (d) and (e) of the CAA, among other things, directs the Board \n     to issue regulations that are ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Federal Labor Relations \n     Authority to implement the [applicable] statutory \n     provisions'' (emphasis added).\n       The Board has reviewed the body of regulations promulgated \n     by the FLRA and published at 5 C.F.R. sections 2411-2416 \n     (Subchapter B), 2420-2430 (Subchapter C), and 2470-2472 \n     (Subchapter D), as amended, effective March 15, 1996 (See \n     Vol. 60 Federal Register 67288, December 29, 1995) Subchapter \n     B of the FLRA regulations treats the implementation and \n     applicability of the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy \n     Act and the Sunshine Act in the FLRA's processes; internal \n     matters including delegations of authority, FLRA employee \n     conduct and anti-discrimination policies; and procedural \n     issues such as ex parte communications and subpoenas of FLRA \n     personnel. As the regulations contained in Subchapter B of \n     the FLRA's regulations do not appear to have been \n     ``promulgated to implement the statutory provisions'' applied \n     by section 220, it is the Board's preliminary view that \n     they should not be proposed for adoption under the CAA.\n       With respect to the rest of the FLRA's regulations, section \n     2420.1, ``Purpose and scope'', states in pertinent part that \n     ``the regulations contained in this subchapter [Subchapter C \n     relating to the FLRA and the General Counsel of the FLRA] are \n     designed to implement the provisions of chapter 71 . . . They \n     prescribe the procedures, basic principles or criteria under \n     which the [FLRA] or the General Counsel of the [FLRA], as \n     applicable, will'' carry out their functions, resolve issues \n     and otherwise administer chapter 71. Section 2470.1 in turn \n     provides that the ``regulations contained in this Subchapter \n     [D] are intended to implement the provisions of section 7119 \n     of title 5 . . . They prescribe procedures and methods which \n     the Federal Service Impasses Panel may utilize in the \n     resolution of negotiation impasses . . .'' Thus, a review of \n     Subchapters C and D reveals that certain of the regulations \n     relate to processes that implement chapter 71, while others \n     relate to principles or criteria for making decisions that \n     implement chapter 71. Thus, with respect to all of these \n     provisions, there is a question as to which, if any, are \n     ``substantive regulations'' within the meaning of section \n     220(d) and (e) of the Act.\n       When promulgating regulations to implement section 203 of \n     the CAA, the Board noted that, under principles of \n     administrative law, a distinction is generally made between \n     ``substantive'' regulations and ``interpretive'' regulations \n     or guidelines. ``Substantive'' regulations are issued by a \n     regulatory body pursuant to statutory authority and implement \n     the underlying statute. Such rules have the force and effect \n     of law. The Board also notes that the term ``substantive,'' \n     when describing regulations, might be used to distinguish \n     such regulations from those that are ``procedural'' in nature \n     or content. In this regard, section 304 of the CAA sets forth \n     the procedures applicable to the issuance of ``substantive'' \n     regulations. In contrast, section 303 of the CAA sets forth \n     different procedures for the issuance of ``procedural \n     rules.'' Both sections 303 and 304 require adherence to the \n     principles and procedures set forth in section 553 of title \n     5, United States Code, and provide for the publication of a \n     general notice of proposed rulemaking in accordance with \n     section 553(b) of title 5, United States Code (to be \n     published in the Congressional Record instead of the Federal \n     Register) and a comment period of at least 30 days. In light \n     of these statutory provisions, the use of the phrase \n     ``substance regulations,'' in the context of sections 220 and \n     304 of the CAA, could be intended to further distinguish such \n     regulations from the purely procedural regulations to be \n     issued under section 303 of the Act.\n       The Board invites comment on the meaning of the term \n     ``substantive regulations'' under sections 220 and 304 of the \n     CAA.\n       The Board further invites comment on which of the \n     regulations promulgated by the FLRA should be considered \n     substantive regulations within the meaning of section 220 of \n     the CAA, and specifically invites comment on whether, and if \n     so, to what extent the Board should propose the adoption of \n     the regulations set forth in 5 C.F.R. sections 2411-2416.\n\n II. Modifications of FLRA Regulations under Section 220(d) of the CAA\n\n       As noted above, section 220(d) provides that the Board \n     shall issue regulations that are the same as substantive \n     regulations of the FLRA ``except to the extent that the Board \n     may determine, for good cause shown and stated together with \n     the regulations, that a modification of such regulations \n     would be more effective for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections under this section'' (emphasis added). \n     Section 220(d) also provides that the Board may modify \n     the FLRA's substantive regulations ``as the Board deems \n     necessary to avoid a conflict of interest or appearance of \n     a conflict of interest.'' Thus, there is an issue as to \n     what modifications, if any, should be made to the FLRA's \n     regulations pursuant to these authorities.\n       Commentors who, based upon an assertion of ``good cause,'' \n     propose modifications of any identified substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the FLRA should state, with \n     specificity and detail, how such modifications would be \n     ``more effective'' for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections applied under the CAA. Commentors are reminded \n     that proposed modifications for good cause must meet the \n     statutory requirements quoted above; commentors are also \n     reminded that any proposed modifications in regulations \n     should be supported by appropriate legal and factual \n     materials.\n       Similarly, the Board further requests commentors to \n     identify, where applicable, why a proposed modification of \n     the FLRA regulations is necessary to avoid a conflict of \n     interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest. In this \n     regard, commentors should not only fully and specifically \n     describe the\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\n     conflict of interest or appearance thereof that they believe \n     would exist were the pertinent FLRA regulations not modified, \n     but also explain the necessity for avoiding the asserted \n     conflict or appearance of conflict and how any proposed \n     modification would avoid the identified concerns. Indeed, \n     commentors should explain how they interpret this statutory \n     provision and, in doing so, identify the interpretive \n     materials upon which they are relying.\n       In addition, the Board requests that commentors identify \n     any provisions within Subchapters C and D of the FLRA's \n     regulations which, although promulgated to implement chapter \n     71, were not in the commentors' view promulgated to implement \n     a statutory provision of chapter 71 that was incorporated by \n     section 220 into the CAA or are otherwise inconsistent with \n     the provisions of the CAA. Also, commentors are requested to \n     suggest technical changes in nomenclature or other matters \n     that may be deemed appropriate.\n       The Board invites comment on whether and to what extent it \n     should, pursuant to section 220(d) of the CAA, modify the \n     substantive regulations promulgated by the FLRA.\n\n              III. Questions arising under section 220(e)\n\n A. The Manner and Extent of the Application of Chapter 71 to Specific \n                               Employees\n\n       Section 220(e)(1) provides that the ``Board shall issue \n     regulations pursuant to section 304 on the manner and extent \n     to which the requirements and exemptions of chapter 71 . . . \n     should apply to covered employees who are employed in offices \n     listed in paragraph (2).'' Section 220(e) further states that \n     the ``regulations shall, to the greatest extent practicable, \n     be consistent with the provisions and purposes of chapter 71 \n     and shall be the same as substantive regulations issued by \n     the [FLRA] under such chapter,'' except for ``good cause.'' \n     The offices referred to in section 220(e)(2) include:\n       (A) the personal office of any Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of any Senator;\n       (B) a standing, select, special, permanent, temporary, or \n     other committee of the Senate or other committee of the \n     Senate or House of Representatives, or a joint committee of \n     Congress;\n       (C) the Office of the vice President (as President of the \n     Senate), the Office of the President pro tempore of the \n     Senate, the Office of the Majority Leader of the Senate, the \n     Office of the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Office of \n     the Majority Whip of the Senate, the Office of the Minority \n     Whip of the Senate, the Conference of the Majority of the \n     Senate, the Conference of the Minority of the Senate, the \n     Office of the Secretary of the Conference of the Majority of \n     the Senate, the Office of the Secretary of the Conference of \n     the Minority of the Senate, the Office of the Secretary for \n     the Majority of the Senate, the Office of the Secretary for \n     the Minority of the Senate, the Majority Policy Committee of \n     the Senate, the Minority Policy Committee of the Senate, \n     and the following offices within the Office of the \n     Secretary of the Senate: Offices of the Parliamentarian, \n     Bill Clerk, Legislative Clerk, Journal Clerk, Executive \n     Clerk, Enrolling Clerk, Official Reporters of Debate, \n     Daily Digest, Printing Services, Captioning Services, and \n     Senate Chief Counsel for Employment.\n       (D) the Office of the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Office of the Majority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives, the Office of the Minority Leader \n     of the House of Representatives, the Offices of the Chief \n     Deputy Majority Whips, the Offices of the Chief Deputy \n     Minority Whips and the following offices within the Office of \n     the Clerk of the House of Representatives: Offices of \n     Legislative Operations, Official Reporters of Debate, \n     Official Reporters to Committees, Printing Services, and \n     Legislative Information;\n       (E) the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the Senate, \n     the Office of the Senate Legal Counsel, the Office of the \n     Legislative Counsel of the House of Representatives, the \n     Office of the General Counsel of the House of \n     Representatives, the Office of the Parliamentarian of the \n     House of Representatives, and the Office of the Law Revision \n     Counsel;\n       (F) the offices of the caucus or party organization;\n       (G) the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of \n     Technology Assessment, and the Office of Compliance; and\n       (H) such other offices that perform comparable functions \n     which are identified under regulations of the Board.\n\n     These statutory provisions raise a number of interpretive and \n     factual questions that must be considered in the rulemaking \n     process.\n       Although section 220(e)(1)(A) directs that any regulations \n     issued by the Board on the manner and extent of application \n     of chapter 71's requirements and exemptions shall generally \n     be the same as the FLRA's substantive regulations, the \n     regulations promulgated by the FLRA only generally govern the \n     manner in which chapter 71 is implemented. The specific \n     application of both the requirements of chapter 71 and the \n     exemptions delineated in sections 7103 and 7112 of that \n     chapter has been developed through the case precedents of the \n     FLRA and the courts; the FLRA regulations generally do not \n     set forth, with any specificity, the manner and extent of the \n     application of chapter 71's requirements and exemptions. An \n     initial question arises as to whether and to what extent the \n     regulations promulgated by the FLRA should be modified for \n     application to covered employees of the offices identified in \n     section 220(e)(2) so as to specify in greater detail the \n     manner and the extent of chapter 71's application. In \n     addressing this question, commentors are reminded that any \n     suggested modifications of the FLRA's regulations should be \n     supported with a detailed explanation of the factual and \n     legal reasons that demonstrate how such modification would \n     meet the ``good cause'' standard of the CAA (see Section II, \n     supra.).\n       In addition, the Board notes that section 220(e) further \n     requires that any regulations issued on the manner and extent \n     of chapter 71's application to employees in the referenced \n     offices shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be \n     consistent with the provisions and purposes of chapter 71. In \n     the latter regard, Section 7101 of chapter 71 sets forth the \n     following ``Findings and purpose''.\n       (a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) experience in both private and public employment \n     indicates that the statutory protection of the right of \n     employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate \n     through labor organizations of their own choosing in \n     decisions which affect them--\n       (A) safeguards the public interest,\n       (B) contributes to the effective conduct of public \n     business, and\n       (C) facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of \n     disputes between employees and their employers involving \n     conditions of employment; and\n       (2) the public interest demands the highest standards of \n     employee performance and the continued development and \n     implementation of modern and progressive work practices to \n     facilitate and improve employee performance and the efficient \n     accomplishment of the operations of the Government Therefore, \n     labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil \n     service are in the public interest.\n       (b) It is the purpose of this chapter to prescribe certain \n     rights and obligations of the employees of the Federal \n     Government and to establish procedures which are designed to \n     meet the special requirements and needs of the Government. \n     The provisions of this chapter should be interpreted in a \n     manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and \n     efficient Government.\n\n     There thus is immediately a question whether and to what \n     extent these findings and purposes apply in interpreting \n     section 220 of the CAA, and, if these findings and purposes \n     do not apply, the question arises as to how the Board should \n     define the phrase ``provisions and purposes of chapter 71.''\n       The Board invites comment on whether and to what extent it \n     should, pursuant to section 220(e)(1)(A), modify the \n     regulations promulgated by the FLRA for application to \n     covered employees of the offices identified in section \n     220(e)(2). Commentors are reminded that any suggested \n     modifications of the FLRA's regulations should be supported \n     with a detailed explanation of the factual and legal reasons \n     that demonstrate how such modification would meet the ``good \n     cause'' standard of the CAA, as well as an explanation of how \n     such proposed modifications are ``to the greatest extent \n     practicable consistent with the provisions and purposes of \n     chapter 71.''\n       The Board further invites comment on what regulations \n     should be issued under section 220(e)(1)(A) concerning the \n     manner and extent to which the requirements and exemptions of \n     chapter 71 should apply to covered employees who are employed \n     in the offices identified in section 220(e)(2). Commentors \n     are requested to state on what basis they believe the Board \n     has authority to issue such regulations, and to set forth \n     fully and precisely the content of and necessity for any \n     proposed regulations, as well as an explanation of how any \n     such proposed regulations are ``to the greatest extent \n     practicable consistent with the provisions and purposes of \n     chapter 71.''\n\n                       B. Exclusion from Coverage\n\n       Section 220(e)(1)(B) provides ``that the Board shall \n     exclude from coverage [under section 220] any covered \n     employees who are employed in offices listed in paragraph (2) \n     if the Board determines that such exclusion is required \n     because of--\n       (i) a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of \n     interest; or\n       (ii) Congress' constitutional responsibilities.''\n\n     The referenced offices are set forth above. The Board seeks \n     comment on several questions.\n       Under section 7103 of chapter 71, managerial and \n     supervisory employees are excluded by law from coverage under \n     section 220 of the CAA, and, pursuant to section 7112, other \n     individuals such as confidential employees, employees engaged \n     in personnel work, certain employees who conduct internal \n     investigations and employees engaged in intelligence or \n     national security work are precluded from inclusion in \n     bargaining units. In addition, section 7120 of chapter 71 \n     provides that chapter 71 ``does not authorize participation \n     in the management of a labor organization or acting as a \n     representative of a labor organization by an employee if the \n     participation or activity would result in a conflict or \n     apparent conflict of interest or would otherwise be \n     incompatible with law or with the official duties of the \n     employee.'' The issue presented is which additional \n     employees, if any, shall be excluded from coverage under \n     section 220 based upon factors other than those already set \n     forth under the provisions of chapter 71, as applied by the \n     CAA.\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\n     The Board reiterates that any proposed exclusion should \n     be supported with detailed and precise information and \n     rationale sufficient to establish that exclusion is \n     warranted under section 220(e)(1(B) of the Act. For \n     example, commentors should provide comprehensive and \n     specific descriptions of job functions and \n     responsibilities that they believe require exclusion of \n     covered employees from coverage and explain precisely why \n     the participation in an employee organization of an \n     individual who had such tasks and responsibilities would \n     interfere with Congress' constitutional responsibilities \n     or present a conflict of interest. In the absence of such \n     information and rationale, it will be difficult for the \n     Board to determine whether covered employees in the \n     specified offices should be excluded from enjoying the \n     rights and protections of section 220, except as otherwise \n     required by law or provided under any regulations issued \n     pursuant to section 220(e)(1)(A).\n       The Board invites comment on the following specific \n     questions:\n       1. What are the constitutional responsibilities of Congress \n     that would require exclusion of employees from coverage under \n     section 220 of the CAA? Similarly, what would constitute a \n     conflict of interest or appearance of conflict that would \n     require exclusion of employees from coverage under section \n     220 of the CAA?\n       2. Should determinations as to exclusion from coverage \n     under section 220 be made on an office-wide basis or should \n     they be based on performance of specified duties and \n     functions in the referenced office?\n       3. In each individual office referenced in section \n     220(e)(2), what are the particular duties and functions of \n     the specific positions that shall be excluded from coverage? \n     What is the legal basis under the CAA for exclusion?\n       4. What exclusions, if any, are required under paragraph \n     220(e)(2)(H)? What are the ``comparable functions'' of any \n     office so identified? What are the bases for exclusion of the \n     specified office or of covered employees in the offices?\n\n     The Board reiterates that, in answering these questions, \n     commentors should provide detailed legal and factual support \n     for their proposals. Generalities and conclusory assertions \n     will not suffice. Detailed information and authorities that \n     address specific duties and functions of employees and \n     offices, in rigorous and complete detail, are necessary to \n     enable the Board to make appropriate determinations pursuant \n     to the CAA's mandate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1547-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GOODBYE TO THE HUNTSVILLE NEWS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Huntsville, AL's morning newspaper, the \nHuntsville News, will publish its last edition on Friday, March 15, \n1996. The News was founded 32 years ago by local business people as a \nweekly, but became a daily paper within only a few months. In 1968, it \nwas sold by the owners to Advance Publications, which also owns \nHuntsville's afternoon paper, the Huntsville Times.\n  The Huntsville News published its first edition on January 8, 1964. \nIt introduced itself to its Rocket City readers with the headline: \n``New Communications Capsule Blasts Off.'' The original owners were \nJames Cleary, a Huntsville attorney; John Higdon, the former manager of \na local television station; and Thomas A. Barr, an electrical engineer. \nThe paper was printed on its own press, an offset press which was one \nof the most modern in the business. Less than 2 months after it began \npublishing, it went to a twice-weekly schedule, and in August 1964, it \nbecame a 6-day daily, publishing every day except Sunday.\n  Stoney Jackson was the first editor of the News. At one time, he was \na contestant on ``The $64,000 Question'' television quiz show, and \nbecame famous when he revealed cheating on the famous game show. Other \neditors were Sid Thomas, Hollice Smith, Dave Langford, Tom Lankford, \nand Lee Woodward, who has been editor since 1977. Ironically, Woodward, \nwho first came to work for the paper in 1972, had already planned his \nretirement for this March before the announcement about the News.\n  Before he joined the News, Woodward, a native of Arab, AL, had worked \nfor the Huntsville Times, the News Courier, Alabama Courier, and \nLimestone Democrat, all three newspapers published in Athens, where he \ngrew up. He had also worked at the Gadsden Times. He is now serving as \npresident of the Alabama Press Association and has been on the Alabama \nNewspaper Advertising Service Board of Directors. Altogether, he has \nenjoyed 42 years in the newspaper business.\n  I want to congratulate everyone who has been involved with the \npublication of the Huntsville News over the last 32 years, particularly \nthe current editor, Lee Woodward, who has performed superbly in an \nexceedingly difficult position. The newspaper has been an authoritative \nsource of information and insight into the issues and news of the day, \nand its loss is an extremely sad one for the Huntsville area. Its sharp \nwriting, lucid clarity, and professional objectivity each morning will \nbe sorely missed by its many readers. It has performed its mission well \nand leaves a tremendous journalistic legacy to the citizens of this \nvibrant area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1550-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MAYOR RALPH SEARS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, long-time Montevallo, AL mayor Ralph Sears \npassed away on February 14, 1996 at the age of 73. A native of \nNebraska, the young World War II veteran had come to Montevallo in 1948 \nto teach broadcasting courses at Alabama College, now the University of \nMontevallo. It was said that he had a golden voice, and he originally \nwas lured to the south to teach a year or so and then move on. \nThankfully for Montevallo, he never got around to moving on. Instead, \nhe went on to serve for 16 years as a member of the city council and \nthen for 24 years as mayor.\n  During his nearly half-century in his adopted city, Ralph Sears and \nhis wife, Marcia, raised three children; opened radio station WBYE, \nlocated between Calera and Montevallo; and bought and published two \nweekly newspapers, one of which was the Shelby County Reporter.\n  As mayor, he came to be seen as an uncommon friend to his \nconstituents. He accomplished things which had a direct impact on their \ndaily lives. He saw that tall horse-and-buggy curbs and crumbling \nsidewalks were replaced by lower curbs, handicap ramps, flowering trees \nin planters, and litter cans. He oversaw the building of a 40-acre park \nwith ball fields, playgrounds, picnic tables, walking trail, gazebo, \nrecreation building, and Scout hut. He worked with black citizens to \ndevise a district voting system that assured their representation on \nthe council years before a Federal court decision ordered municipal \ngovernments to take such action. Mayor Sears was also credited with \nconstructing a sewage treatment plant and modern fire station.\n  He spent some fairly exciting times in the Pacific theatre during \nWorld War II. He served in Tokyo and in the Philippines with General \nDouglas MacArther. He and Marcia would customarily travel around the \nworld, to wherever news was breaking or about to break. They celebrated \nAlaska's statehood in Juneau; visited South Africa on the brink of \nrevolution in 1986; and saw the other side of the Iron Curtain before \nglasnost turned it into rust.\n  Mayor Sears was active in the World Council of Mayors; past chairman \nof the Shelby County Mayors Association; and president of the \nMontevallo Rotary Club, Chamber of Commerce, and board of Shelby Youth \nServices.\n  Ralph Sears was truly an institution in Montevallo; he was involved \nin the city's educational, religious, news media, and, of course, its \ngoverning bodies. He was a gentleman's gentleman who believed deeply in \nthe principles set forth in the U.S. Constitution. He was an honest, \nfair, and moral person--a progressive and a visionary who believed the \nAmerican way was the right way.\n  At the time of his death, one of the projects he was working on was \nthe establishment of a section of Montevallo as an Alabama Village. The \nState and the University of Montevallo are trying to create a community \nsimilar to Jamestown in Williamsburg, VA, and the city has committed \nfunds to buy 115 acres for the project. Hopefully, this village will \nsome day stand as a monument to his life and work.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to the Sears family in the wake of \nits tremendous loss. His legacy is one that will last for many, many \ndecades into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1550-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1550-S1551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO CIVIC LEADER HARRY MOORE RHETT, JR.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Harry Moore Rhett, Jr., a long-time \ncommunity leader and member of one of Huntsville, Alabama's most \nprominent families, died on February 3, 1996 at his antebellum home in \nHuntsville.\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\n  During his long career, Rhett served as chairman of the city of \nHuntsville Gas Utility Board; chairman of the city of Huntsville Water \nUtility Board; chairman of the Huntsville Hospital Foundation; chairman \nof the Randolph School Board of Trustees; and chairman of the board of \ngovernors of the Heritage Club.\n  In addition, he had served as president of the Huntsville-Madison \nCounty Chamber of Commerce; the Huntsville Rotary Club; the Huntsville \nIndustrial Expansion Committee; and the Twickenham Historic \nPreservation District Association. He was chairman of the board of \ncontrol of Huntsville Hospital; the Madison County Board of Registrars; \nand the Marshall Space Flight Center Community Advisory Committee.\n  It is difficult to imagine any citizen serving his community with \nmore energy, pride, and dedication than did Harry Rhett, Jr. His \ndevotion to his community was total and unwavering.\n  As an avid athlete, hunter, and sportsman, he was the founder and \nmaster of the Mooreland Hunt, a local fox-hunting group. He was a \ngraduate of Culver Military Academy; Washington and Lee University; and \nHarvard University business school. He served as an army officer in \nEurope during World War II.\n  Harry Rhett, Jr. was one of those rare individuals who truly embodied \nthe unique ideals upon which our country was founded. He achieved great \nfinancial and personal success, yet served with humility and a spirit \nof generosity. His efforts and work contributed significantly to the \ntremendous growth of the Huntsville area during his life-time.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to the Rhett family in the wake of \nits tremendous loss. I hope they, like most citizens of this area, will \nfind solace in continuing to enjoy the fruits of Harry's labor, which \nare all around them, for many, many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1550-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING THE EATONS FOR CELEBRATING THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, these are trying times for the family in \nAmerica. Unfortunately, too many broken homes have become part of our \nnational culture. It is tragic that nearly half of all couples married \ntoday will see their union dissolve into divorce. The effects of \ndivorce on families and particularly the children of broken families \nare devastating. In such an era, I believe it is both instructive and \nimportant to honor those who have taken the commitment of ``til death \nus do part'' seriously and have successfully demonstrated the timeless \nprinciples of love, honor, and fidelity, to build a strong family. \nThese qualities make our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor the Ernest and \nMargie Eaton of Clinton, MO, who on March 3 celebrated their 50th \nwedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we \ncan celebrate a similar milestone. Ernest and Margie's commitment to \nthe principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and \nrecognized. I wish them and their family all the best as they celebrate \nthis substantial marker on their journey together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1551-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Federal debt now exceeds $5 trillion. \nTwenty years ago, in 1976, the Federal debt stood at $629 billion, \nafter 200 years of America's existence, including two world wars. After \nall of that, the total Federal debt, I repeat, was $629 billion.\n  Then the big spenders really went to work and the interest on the \ndebt really began to take off--and, presto, during the past 20 years \nthe Federal debt has soared into the stratosphere, increasing by more \nthan $4 trillion in 2 decades--from 1976 to 1996.\n  So, Mr. President, as of the close of business yesterday, March 5, \n1996, the Federal debt stood--down-to-the-penny--at \n$5,016,462,295,493.85. On a per capita basis, every man, woman, and \nchild in America owes $19,040.91 as his or her share of that debt.\n  This enormous debt is a festering, escalating burden on all citizens \nand especially it is jeopardizing the liberty of our children and \ngrandchildren. As Jefferson once warned, ``to preserve [our] \nindependence, we must not let our leaders load us with perpetual debt. \nWe must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and \nservitude.'' Isn't it about time that Congress heeded the wise words of \nthe author of the Declaration of Independence?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1551-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MS. BARBARA BALDWIN\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, last week Rhode Islanders learned some sad \nnews. We learned that one of our community's leading and most respected \nactivists is leaving our State for a new position in Tennessee. We will \nmiss Barbara Baldwin, the Executive Director of Planned Parenthood of \nRhode Island for the last 9 years, when she leaves Rhode Island at the \nend of May.\n  It is often said that everyone in Rhode Island knows everyone else in \nRhode Island. That's almost true--we are a small State and it is \nrelatively easy to get to know people who become active in the State \nand in their communities. But Barbara made an immediate mark on Rhode \nIsland when she arrived here in 1987. And since then she had led \nPlanned Parenthood with dignity, serenity, courage, and energy. She is \ntotally dedicated to ensuring quality health care to women, and is \nwholly committed to preserving reproductive rights.\n  Barbara has also been an important political adviser and friend to me \nover these last 9 years, and to many other government officials and \npoliticians. But mostly, she has been a leader for the women of Rhode \nIsland, and has gained the respect of both those who share her views \nand those who don't.\n  Rhode Islanders will miss Barbara, and we wish her well in her move \nto Tennessee. But we want her to know that the door to our State will \nalways be open to her, and we hope that some day she will return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1551-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATIONS TO PRESIDENT SOARES UPON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, as President Soares, one of Portugal's \ngreatest modern leaders, prepares to retire, I would like to offer my \npersonal congratulations. President Soares is a good friend who has my \nadmiration for all he has done to make Portugal a vibrant and \ndemocratic part of Europe. During the dark days of Portugal's \nauthoritarian regime, President Soares demonstrated an enormous amount \nof courage. He was an active opponent of that rule--and for that he \npaid dearly. I particularly remember that when those dark days ended in \n1974, President Soares returned to Portugal to help lead the new \ngovernment. I followed his career closely in the ensuing years--when he \nserved as foreign minister twice and prime minister three times before \nbecoming President in 1986. I have deep regard for President Soares' \nleadership in the 1980's in preparing Portugal for entry into the \nEuropean Community, and in more recent years, in ensuring that Portugal \nremains firmly planted in the European Union and NATO.\n  I have a huge respect for Portugal and her people, and have been \nfortunate to work with President Soares over the years. My State of \nRhode Island has a large and vibrant Portuguese community.\n  Portugal is an important ally. Our two countries share a commitment \nto democracy, freedom, and peace--values which are important not only \nas we confront a changing Europe--but as we approach challenges in the \nMiddle East and Africa. Portugal is a great friend of the United \nStates, and it is in the spirit of this friendship that I pay tribute \nto President Soares, and wish him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1551-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1551-S1552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HOW MUCH FOREIGN OIL BEING CONSUMED BY UNITED STATES?

Mr. President, I rise to offer my warmest thanks, \nrespect, and heartfelt congratulations to my legislative director, \nTrudy Vincent, who will leave my staff at the end of this week. For 3 \nyears, in her second tour of duty in my office, Trudy has been the \nanchor of my legislative work, and deserves much of the credit for the \nlegislative accomplishments of my office since 1993.\n  Although Trudy will be leaving my staff, she will not be leaving the \nSenate, and my office's loss is the gain of my colleague Senator \nBingaman of New Mexico, who will undoubtedly grow to depend upon her \nmuch as I have.\n  Like many of the most gifted and successful of the staff members who \nserve this institution, Trudy first came here as a fellow through an \nacademic program, having first pursued and succeeded in another \ndemanding field. In her case, Trudy first attained a doctorate in \npsychology, then joined my office in 1987 as a legislative fellow, \nworking on innovative education and health initiatives.\n  When her first tour of duty in my office ended after a year, Trudy \njoined the staff of her home State Senator, Senator Mikulski, rose to \nlegislative director, and returned to my staff as legislative director \nin 1993. I have found her good sense, her wide knowledge, her broad \nnetwork of friends and professional contacts, and her sense of humor to \nbe of invaluable help in all that I do for the people of New Jersey and \nthe Nation.\n  The most important attribute a Senator or legislative staffer can \npossess, I have found, is persistence and dedication. You have to be \nentrepreneurial, always looking for opportunities to move a good idea \nforward and never giving up when things look bleak. Trudy exemplifies \nthese qualities. Her persistence and dedication has helped us move \nforward most of my urban initiatives of 1993, the funding for the high \nschool student exchange with the republics of the former Soviet Union, \nstudent loan reform, several nominations, and very soon, I hope it will \nlead to final passage of my bill to prohibit new mothers from being \ndischarged from the hospital before they or their babies are ready.\n  In addition to these qualities, there is an intangible between a \nSenator and a staff member. It is related to loyalty and knowledge, but \nit also is something more. It is the phenomenon of being confident that \nthe staff member knows how to further the Senator's goals in a way that \nis consistent with the Senator's values and style. I've always felt \nthat way about Trudy. I could truly leave it to her and know that it \nwould be done as I would want it done. I guess I'm saying that at the \ncore of a Senator-staff relation is trust. That's clearly the way it's \nbeen between us, for which I am lucky and very grateful.\n  I want finally to thank Trudy again, express my appreciation for all \nher long hours and hard work, and wish her all the best fortune as she \ncontinues to contribute to the workings of this democratic institution \nafter I leave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE).

Mr. President, I now move to proceed to calendar 341, \nSenate Resolution 227.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion.\n  Is there further debate?\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, we are here today primarily because the \nWhite House has not been dealing with the special committee in good \nfaith. I know that there are those who would accuse this committee of \nconducting a political witch hunt in an election year. But I submit \nthat there are legitimate and powerful reasons to be investigating \nWhitewater Development Corp. and all of the related matters.\n  At the outset, it should be made clear that the main reason this \ncommittee needs additional time is the abject failure of this \nadministration to cooperate. Contrary to all of their public \nstatements, I believe the White House has been actively engaged in a \ncoverup. They have repeatedly refused to turn over relevant evidence \nand have often failed to remember key facts under oath.\n  To give just one example, Bruce Lindsey was asked on numerous \noccasions whether he had produced all relevant documents to the \ncommittee, and he insisted under oath that he had. In particular, the \ncommittee asked about any notes he might have taken during the November \n5, 1994, meeting of the Whitewater defense team. That is the same \nmeeting where William Kennedy took notes, and we almost had to go to \ncourt to obtain them. Last Friday--that is the very date the special \ncommittee's funding was set to expire--he turned over his clearly \nmarked notes of the November 5 Whitewater defense team meeting.\n  The American people deserve better than that. Again, this is only one \nexample--where Bruce Lindsey was asked over and over again whether he \nhad taken notes during that November 5 meeting, and we were told over \nand over again that he had not. On the day this committee's funding \nexpired, they turned over these notes of the meeting.\n  In my opinion, the White House has done everything in its power to \nhide the truth. That is why we are here asking for additional funds to \ncontinue the committee's work.\n  Mr. President, I suspect that over the next several hours we \nobviously will hear from both sides of the aisle on this. But on our \nside of the aisle, I expect that most of our Members who participated \nin these hearings will probably do as I have done; that is, to focus my \nattention on some specific areas where I focused my attention during \nthe committee hearings. So my comments now will be somewhat focused on \nthe behavior of the White House officials immediately after Vincent \nFoster's death.\n  The death of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr., on \nJuly 20, 1993, marked the first time since Secretary of Defense James \nForrestal died in 1949 that such a high-ranking\n\n[[Page S1553]]\n\nU.S. official took his own life. Mr. Foster was a close friend of both \nthe President and Mrs. Clinton, and provided legal counsel to them on a \nnumber of sensitive personal matters, including Whitewater. Given Mr. \nFoster's sensitive position within the administration and his close \npersonal friendship with the Clinton's, there were legitimate questions \nto be asked about the way he died.\n  The reason I raise this is because I have a feeling that those who \nmay have just casually been observing or watching these hearings may \nhave asked the question, What is all the concern about how the White \nHouse handled the review of documents in Vince Foster's office? I have \nalready indicated that he was a personal friend of the Clintons, but \nthere are questions that would be raised about any suicide of an \nindividual in this kind of position.\n  Questions, for example, could be: Was there blackmail involved? Was \nhe a victim of a crime that had something to do with his position? \nCould he have been the subject of extortion? Was our national security \ncompromised in any way? Officials would certainly be concerned with \nfinding out the answers to these questions as soon as possible.\n  In the days following his death, White House officials--in \nparticular, members of the White House counsel's office--searched the \ncontents of Mr. Foster's office and at the same time prevented law \nenforcement officials from conducting a similar search. In doing this \nand later covering it up, they have come to look like the guiltiest \nbunch of people I have ever seen.\n  Section (1)(b)(1) of Senate Resolution 120 authorizes the committee \nto inquire ``whether improper conduct occurred regarding the way in \nwhich White House officials handled documents in the office of White \nHouse Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster following his death.''\n  Pursuant to this directive, the committee conducted 69 depositions \nand held 17 days of public hearings to investigate the actions of White \nHouse officials in the week following Mr. Foster's death. The \ncommittee's investigation revealed, among other things, the following \nfacts.\n  Fact: Foster's office was never sealed the night of his death despite \nfour separate official requests.\n  Fact: High-ranking White House officials searched it without \nsupervision.\n  Fact: Maggie Williams was seen by an unbiased witness carrying a \nstack of documents out of Foster's office.\n  Fact: Nussbaum made an agreement for Justice Department officials to \nconduct a search of Foster's office.\n  Fact: Nussbaum told Stephen Neuwirth that the First Lady and Susan \nThomases was concerned with the Justice officials having unfettered \naccess to Foster's office.\n  Fact: A flurry of phone calls occurred at critical times--17 separate \ncontacts in a 48-hour period among Hillary Clinton, Maggie Williams, \nSusan Thomases, and Nussbaum.\n  Fact: After those calls, Nussbaum reneged on the deal with the \nDepartment of Justice investigators. He insisted on searching the \noffice himself.\n\n  Fact: Once the investigators left the scene, a real search occurred \nwith Maggie Williams' help, and afterwards she took documents to the \nresidence.\n  Mr. President, I am going to go back through those various facts that \nI have raised, and again I am focusing on a very, very small portion \nand limited area of this whole debate. The area that I will be focusing \non again is the night of Foster's death and the few days following that \ndeath.\n  Seven different persons recalled four separate requests to White \nHouse officials to seal Vincent Foster's office on the evening of his \ndeath. This was not done until the next morning. Hillary Rodham Clinton \ncalled Maggie Williams, her chief of staff, at 10:13 p.m. immediately \nupon hearing of Mr. Foster's death on July 20, 1993. Right after \ntalking with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams proceeded to the White House to \nMr. Foster's office. White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum and Deputy \nDirector of the White House Office of Administration, Patsy Thomasson, \nmet her there and conducted a late-night search of Mr. Foster's office \nwithout law enforcement supervision.\n  Mrs. Clinton then called Susan Thomases, a close personal friend, in \nNew York at 11:19 p.m. Secret Service officer Henry O'Neill testified \nthat on the night of Mr. Foster's death, he saw Ms. Williams remove \nfile folders 3 to 5 inches thick from the White House counsel's suite \nand place them in her office.\n  Now, why would this Secret Service individual lie about that? This \ncould constitute obstruction of justice, particularly if the billing \nrecords were in those files. If this is true, there could be two \npossible separate counts, the first against Maggie Williams for \nknowingly taking relevant documents out of Foster's office with the \nintent to hide them from investigators, and the second for turning them \nover to someone else, possibly the Clintons, who then intentionally \nwithheld them from us in violation of numerous document requests and \nsubpoenas.\n  This is one of the central questions which the committee must \nresolve.\n  After searching Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death, Ms. \nWilliams called Mrs. Clinton in Little Rock at 12:56 a.m. on July 21, \n1993, and talked with her for 11 minutes. Again, this is 12:56 a.m., \nmiddle of the night. Once that call was concluded, only 3 minutes \nlater, at 1:10 a.m., after her conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \nWilliams called Ms. Thomases in New York and they talked for 20 \nminutes.\n  I wish to note here that when we first spoke to Ms. Williams, she \ncategorically denied talking to Ms. Thomases that night. Imagine, that \nwas a 20-minute conversation that took place at 1:10 in the morning and \nMs. Williams categorically denied talking to Ms. Thomases. When the \ncommittee asked her for her phone records to prove her claim, she and \nher lawyer stated they were not available from the phone company. We \nasked the phone company for the records and, voila, 1 week later, we \nhad them.\n  Susan Thomases, a New York lawyer, is a close personal friend of \nPresident and Mrs. Clinton. She has known the President for 25 years \nand Mrs. Clinton for almost 20 years. She was an adviser to the Clinton \n1992 Presidential campaign and remained in the close circle of \nconfidants to the Clintons after the election. One article referred to \nMs. Thomases as the ``blunt force instrument'' of enforcement for the \nFirst Lady. She was the one who got things done in a crunch. As my \ncolleague, Senator Bennett, described her during the hearings, she was \nthe ``go-to'' guy on the Clinton team. If the First Lady wanted to make \nsure that her people got to Foster's files before outside law \nenforcement, Susan Thomases was just the person to get the job done.\n  Department of Justice officials testified that they agreed with Mr. \nNussbaum on July 21, 1993, that they would jointly review documents in \nMr. Foster's office. Let me just say that again. There was an agreement \nbetween the Justice Department and Bernie Nussbaum as to how the \ndocuments in Mr. Foster's office would be reviewed.\n  Then there is a flurry of phone calls that occurs at what I would \ncall critical times. We then begin a period of time in which a \nmultitude of calls took place involving Thomases, Williams, and the \nFirst Lady. I believe the purpose of these calls might have been to \nmake sure that the agreement Bernie Nussbaum had made with the Justice \nDepartment concerning the search of Foster's office was not kept.\n  Call No. 1. At 6:44 a.m.--fairly early in the morning. I am trying to \nthink about how many phone calls I have actually placed at 6:44 a.m. \nAnyway, 6:44 a.m. Arkansas time on July 22, Maggie Williams called Mrs. \nClinton--this is the day following--called Mrs. Clinton at her mother's \nhouse in Little Rock, and they talked for 7 minutes. Ms. Williams \ninitially did not tell the special committee about her early-morning \nphone call to the Rodham residence.\n  After obtaining her residential telephone records documenting the \ncall, the special committee voted unanimously to call Ms. Williams back \nfor further testimony. When presented with these records, Ms. Williams \ntestified, ``If I was calling the residence, it is likely that I was \ntrying to reach Mrs. Clinton. If it was 6:44 in Arkansas, there's a \npossibility that she was not up. I don't remember who I talked to, but \nI don't find it unusual that the chief of staff to the First Lady might \nwant to call her early in the morning for a number of reasons.''\n  Maggie Williams said, ``I don't recall'' or ``I don't remember'' so \nmany\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\ntimes I lost count. According to one New York paper, as of last month, \nall of the Whitewater witnesses combined said this a total of 797 times \nduring the hearings alone.\n  Call No. 2. This is a call that takes place now 6 minutes after the \ncall that Maggie Williams forgot or just did not mention to the \ncommittee until we had records of the call. But 6 minutes after she \napparently was willing to wake up the First Lady 6:44 Arkansas time, 6 \nminutes later Mrs. Clinton called the Mansion on O Street, a small \nhotel where Susan Thomases stayed in Washington, DC. The call lasted 3 \nminutes. Oddly enough, Ms. Thomases did not remember this call again \nuntil after the committee was provided with her phone records.\n  Call No. 3. Upon ending her conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Susan \nThomases immediately paged Bernie Nussbaum at the White House, leaving \nher number at the Mansion on O Street. When Mr. Nussbaum answered the \npage, they talked about the upcoming review of documents in Mr. \nFoster's office. Ms. Thomases actually told the committee that these \ntwo phone calls had nothing to do with one another. After obtaining \nrecords documenting that she talked with Mrs. Clinton for 3 minutes \nimmediately prior to paging Mr. Nussbaum, the special committee voted \nunanimously to call Ms. Thomases back for further testimony.\n  She maintained, however, that she called Nussbaum, because again, ``I \nwas worried about my friend Bernie, and I was just about to go into a \nvery, very busy day in my work, and I wanted to make sure that I got to \ntalk to Bernie that day since I had not been lucky enough to speak with \nhim the day before.''\n  I will come back to the busy day she was having later. At this point \nI will say that she was busy all right, but not with her private law \npractice.\n  Mr. Nussbaum has a different recollection of his conversations with \nMs. Thomases. On July 22 he testified that Ms. Thomases initiated the \ndiscussion about the procedures that he intended to employ in reviewing \ndocuments in Mr. Foster's office.\n  ``The conversation on the 22d''--this is a quote now-- ``The \nconversation on the 22d was that she asked me what was going on with \nrespect to the examination of Mr. Foster's office.'' ``She said * * * \npeople were concerned or disagreeing * * * whether a correct procedure \nwas being followed, * * * whether it was proper to give people access \nto the office at all.''\n  According to Mr. Nussbaum, Ms. Thomases did not specify who these \n``people'' were to whom she was referring, nor did Mr. Nussbaum \nunderstand who they were. Mr. Nussbaum testified he resisted Ms. \nThomases' overture, but he said, ``Susan * * * I'm having discussions \nwith various people,'' which, by the way, we determined those various \npeople were Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Maggie Williams. Again \nquoting--``Susan * * * I'm having discussions with various people. As \nfar as the White House is concerned, I will make a decision as to how \nthis is going to be conducted.''\n  He did decide to renege on his deal with the Department of Justice, \nbut only after more phone calls from Maggie Williams and Susan \nThomases. We have independent corroboration from Steve Neuwirth. Steve \nNeuwirth, a member of the White House counsel staff, testified under \noath that Bernie Nussbaum told him Susan Thomases and the First Lady \nwere concerned about giving the officials from Justice ``unfettered \naccess'' to Foster's office.\n  While the Justice Department officials were kept waiting outside, \nNussbaum continued his discussions, as more phone calls ensued, \npresumably about how to search the office.\n  Call No. 4. We are back again to this series of phone calls I was \ndescribing a little earlier. This is the fourth phone call. This is \n8:25 in the morning of July 22. Thomases called the Rodham residence \nand spoke for 4 minutes.\n  Call No. 5. At 9 a.m., Thomases called Maggie Williams and left the \nmessage ``call when you get in the office.''\n  Call No. 6. 10:48 a.m., Thomases calls Chief of Staff McLarty's \noffices, spoke with someone for 3 minutes.\n  A meeting involving numerous members of the White House staff was \ngoing on in McLarty's office at this time to decide how to handle the \nsearch of Foster's office. In the meantime, the officials from the \nJustice Department, Park Police, and other agencies were waiting around \nfor the search to begin.\n  Call No. 7. 11:04 a.m., Thomases called Maggie Williams, spoke for 6 \nminutes.\n  Call No. 8. This is occurring 1 minute after the conclusion of the \nprevious call--Thomases calls Chief of Staff McLarty's office, spoke \nwith someone for 3 minutes.\n  Call No. 9, just a couple minutes later, Thomases calls Chief of \nStaff McLarty's office again; spoke with someone for 1 minute.\n  Call No. 10. 11:37 a.m., Thomases called Maggie Williams, spoke for \n11 minutes. Three minutes after that call was completed, Thomases \ncalled Maggie Williams and spoke for 4 minutes. Do not forget, this is \nall taking place during the time that Ms. Thomases said she was going \nto be very, very busy on conference calls related to her private legal \npractice.\n  When we asked Ms. Williams about all these calls to her office from \nSusan Thomases, she denied talking to her, and told us it could have \nbeen anybody else in her office, could have been an intern, a \nvolunteer, or another staffer. Her refusal to take responsibility for \nthe calls resulted in 32 different staffers having to be interviewed \nabout who might have spoken to Susan Thomases that day, and all said \nthey do not remember talking to her.\n\n  By doing this, Maggie Williams asked the committee to believe that \nSusan Thomases regularly calls unpaid interns at the White House just \nto chat. Her testimony to the committee was frankly typical of her \nwhole approach to the process. In my opinion, both Maggie Williams and \nSusan Thomases are openly contemptuous of the committee's work. Their \nattitude toward this inquiry has never been one of cooperation, but \nrather blatant hostility.\n  Their behavior, coupled with the documentary evidence we have \nacquired, lead me to no other reasonable conclusion than that Maggie \nWilliams and Susan Thomases were involved or influenced the decision to \nbreach the agreement with the Department of Justice. Their behavior, \nand what I believe to be the reasons behind it, are frankly an insult, \nnot just to us, but to the credibility and integrity of the Presidency.\n  Call No. 12. At 12:47 p.m., Capricia, an individual who is Hillary \nClinton's personal assistant, paged Maggie Williams from the Rodham \nresidence.\n  Call No. 13. 12:55 p.m., Maggie Williams called the Rodham residence \nand spoke for 1 minute. The pressure on Nussbaum must have been too \ngreat. He broke his agreement with the Justice Department and conducted \nthe search essentially unsupervised. After learning of Nussbaum's \nreversal, David Margolis, one of the seasoned DOJ officials sent over \nfor the search, told Nussbaum, that he was making a big mistake.\n  Once he heard this news, Philip Heymann, the Deputy Attorney General, \nlater asked, ``Bernie, are you hiding something?\"\n  Call No. 14. At 1:25 p.m., the White House phone call to Rodham \nresidence. Conversation for 6 minutes. Was this to tell Mrs. Clinton \nthe deal with the Justice Department had been reneged upon?\n  Then we move to the search which takes place in Foster's office from \napproximately 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. The Department of Justice officials \nagain are kept at bay.\n  Call No. 15. 3:05 p.m., Bill Burton, McLarty's deputy, called Maggie \nWilliams and left a message. He had been asked by Nussbaum, after the \nreview of Foster's office, to locate Maggie Williams. This signals the \nattempt by Nussbaum, through his deputy, to get the real search of the \noffice underway, but only with Ms. Williams' help.\n  Call No. 16. 3:08 p.m., Thomases called Maggie Williams. Spoke for 10 \nminutes.\n  Call No. 17. 3:25 p.m., Steve Neuwirth called Ms. Williams and left a \nmessage. They are still trying to find Ms. Williams.\n  Call No. 18. It occurred somewhere between 4 and 4:30 p.m. Bernie \nNussbaum personally called Maggie Williams to summon her to Foster's \noffice. They searched the office for about half an hour.\n  Call No. 19. Somewhere between 4:30 and 5 p.m. Maggie Williams phoned \nHillary Clinton.\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\n  Call No. 20. 5:13 p.m., Thomases called Maggie Williams. Spoke for 9 \nminutes, 30 seconds.\n  Then Maggie Williams takes the documents to the residence. Although \nthe public was initially told by the White House spokesperson that all \nthe Clintons personal documents were immediately turned over to their \nlawyers after Foster's death, once again, we later learned this was \nsimply untrue.\n  Tom Castleton, a White House employee, spoke against his own interest \nand told us Maggie Williams asked him to take boxes of documents from \nFoster's office to the residence on July 22, 1993, so the First Lady \nand the President could review them.\n  I want to go back to this point again. This is Maggie Williams who \nagain says that this did not occur. We have got testimony under oath \nfrom Tom Castleton that when he and Maggie Williams were taking these \ndocuments to the third floor of the White House, that Maggie Williams \ntold Tom Castleton that the reason they were doing this is so that the \nFirst Lady and the President could review them.\n  What I see is a day that begins and ends with Maggie Williams, Susan \nThomases and Hillary Clinton conversing. I think Maggie Williams \nstarted the day at 6:44 talking with the First Lady about the need to \nkeep law enforcement out of Foster's office and to get certain \ndocuments into a safe place.\n  She ended the day with a conversation with Thomases and a \nconversation with Hillary Clinton to let them know--mission \naccomplished. Bernie Nussbaum was able to control the document review. \nNothing was divulged to the Department of Justice investigators. The \nsensitive documents of the First Lady were whisked away to the private \nquarters where months later Carolyn Huber discovered critical billing \nrecords which had Foster's handwriting all over them.\n  Hubbell even told us he had last seen them in Foster's possession. I \nbelieve those records may have been among the files Maggie Williams \ntook out of Foster's office.\n  The first time we talked to Ms. Williams and Ms. Thomases, we only \nhad a record of 12 of these phone calls. They denied talking to each \nother, except maybe once or twice, during this period. We received the \nphone records in three separate installments and, in the end, we see \ntheir testimony was nothing but deception.\n  There were 17 separate contacts in a 48-hour period among Hillary \nClinton, Maggie Williams, Susan Thomases and Bernie Nussbaum, which I \nbelieve were related to how to handle the documents in Foster's office. \nThomases was on the phone to the White House for 28 out of 58 minutes \nwhen Nussbaum was trying to decide how to handle the search of Foster's \noffice.\n  Again, this was on the day that, in her own words, again I quote, ``I \nwas just about to go into a very, very busy day in my own work.'' It \nnow appears that her work was, in fact, the First Lady's work.\n  But that is not all. There is more deception about the suicide note \nand the documents removed from Foster's office. I want to reiterate, I \nhave picked out one small segment of the investigation of the testimony \nthat we reviewed, and it certainly ought to become obvious to people, \nas they listen to this, the lack of cooperation that we received from \nthe witnesses, the lack of cooperation that we received from the White \nHouse. As I said earlier, I believe that the White House was actively \ninvolved in trying to cover up.\n  I am moving now to July 27, 1993. It is an important day. This is the \nday that the suicide note was turned over. Vince Foster's suicide note \nhad been found the previous day. It was only turned over to the Park \nPolice after a meeting with Janet Reno where she instructed the White \nHouse to do so. Attorney General Reno was very strong and decisive in \nher direction to the White House. I am paraphrasing, but basically the \nimpression she left was, ``Why did you waste my time? Why did I have to \ncome to the White House to tell you to turn these documents over?\"\n  I raise the question, Why were the documents not turned over the same \nday they were found? If you think about it for a moment, what possible \nreason could the White House have for keeping that note overnight, 30 \nhours? Why?\n  In retrospect, it is stunning that the White House did not turn it \nover to the Park Police right away. Obviously, as we can see by their \nhandling of the note, they had no real intention of cooperating. Prior \nto the note being turned over to the Justice Department or Park Police, \nHillary Clinton and a horde of other White House officials saw it. From \nwhat it sounded like, there were a large number of people--again, what \nI am referring to is from the testimony. The note was found, taken to \nNussbaum's office, and people were coming in and reviewing this note. \nThe people who, in fact, had seen the note were asked to testify about \nthat note and who else was in the room, who else saw the note.\n  Oddly enough, everyone who was later interviewed by the FBI about the \ncircumstances of finding the note forgot about the First Lady having \nseen it. Only during our second round of hearings did we learn about \nthis important fact.\n  As for the documents that Tom Castleton and Maggie Williams took up \nto the residence on the 22d, they were turned over to Bob Barnett, the \nClinton's personal attorney, on this day, on the 27th. Susan Thomases \nhas testified she did not recall seeing Mrs. Clinton on July 27 and \nthat she was not involved in Ms. Williams' transfer of Whitewater files \nfrom the White House residence to Clinton's personal lawyer, Mr. Bob \nBarnett, this despite records showing that Susan Thomases entered the \nresidence at the same time as Mr. Barnett.\n  Thomases spent 6 hours there, yet she does not remember anything \nabout being in the White House that day. I mean, they are really asking \nus to stretch our willingness to understand how this could happen.\n  I want to go over that point again because I find this really--6 \nhours she was in the White House. It would be one thing if somehow or \nanother she just happened to either bump into Maggie Williams or bump \ninto Bob Barnett and forgot it, but to, in essence, have forgotten \nanything about the 6 hours at the White House, I just find that very, \nvery, very hard to believe.\n  As recently as January 9, 1996, we received another phone record of a \nmessage from Mrs. Clinton to Susan Thomases from July 27, 1993 at 1:30 \np.m., asking Thomases to please call Hillary. Ms. Thomases was in \nWashington, DC on that day when she would not normally have been in \ntown, and she had received a message from Mrs. Clinton's scheduler the \nday before. This is also the first time Ms. Thomases saw the First Lady \nafter Vince Foster committed suicide.\n  So that is two personal requests by the First Lady to speak to her, \nbut Thomases has no memory of the occasion. Ironically enough, she was \nable to tell the committee in some detail the specific reasons why she \nhappened to be in Washington on Tuesday instead of on Wednesday but has \nabsolutely no memory of a White House visit when there. This type of \nmemory loss is, first, unbelievable and, second, I believe a purposeful \nattempt to avoid giving the committee information that it is entitled \nto.\n  What I have gone over is just, again, one small portion of the body \nof evidence this committee has uncovered.\n  Here are some other items which form my view of the situation and \nexplain why I have arrived at the conclusion that this White House has \nengaged in an attempt to completely stonewall the committee and the \nAmerican public.\n  Unethical Treasury/White House contacts led to the resignation of \nAltman and Hanson and Steiner, saying he lied to his diary. You may \nrecall that from earlier hearings we had. These contacts were a \nsystematic effort to gain confidential information from Government \nsources and ultimately influence the criminal and civil investigations \nof Madison.\n  The President's refusal to turn over vital notes under the guise of \nattorney-client privilege--this kind of coordination among White House \nstaff and personal lawyers resulted in a multimember Clinton defense \nteam at taxpayers' expense.\n  Now we understand why they did not want to turn over those notes, \nbecause they contain phrases such as ``vacuum Rose law files.''\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\n  The coverup has now reached the third floor of the White House \nresidence. It is difficult to construct a scenario where whoever left \nbilling records on that table is not guilty of a felony. It is the most \nsecure room in the world. Are we supposed to believe, as my colleague \nfrom North Carolina indicated during the hearing, that the butler did \nit?\n  Hillary Clinton has publicly floated the possibility that \nconstruction workers may have placed those billing records in the book \nroom. After committee investigation, we now know that workers are under \nconstant Secret Service supervision and they would be fired if they \nmoved anything around.\n  The White House has seriously delayed document production from key \nWhite House players in the Whitewater legal defense team: Gearan, Ickes \nand Waldman--and, as I said earlier, just last week, Lindsey.\n  Even when documents were turned over, there were redactions which \nwere just plain wrong. The notes Mr. Gearan produced to us of a series \nof meetings of the Whitewater legal defense team were so heavily \nredacted that the committee insisted on a review of the complete notes. \nAs it turns out, the White House chose to redact highly relevant \nstatements.\n  For example, one redacted portion--and I guess maybe I ought to stop \nfor a minute, because some people may not understand what ``redaction'' \nmeans. It would be, for example, if I were to take this page and make \nthe determination that there were some things on here that were not \nrelevant; I would just white them out and white out everything on the \npage I thought was irrelevant, leaving only, let us say, a note on here \nthat says, ``Quality, not quantity of evidence'' that is important.\n  So, for example, one of the redactions said that ``the First Lady was \nadamantly opposed to the appointment of a special counsel.'' What I am \nsaying to you is, when we first got the document, a lot of information \nthat we believed was relevant was whited out, redacted. We could not \nsee it. It was only after we demanded to see it, after they said to us, \n``Do not worry, there is nothing else of any relevance on this document \nto what you are investigating.'' This one redacted portion said, ``The \nFirst Lady was adamantly opposed to the appointment of a special \ncounsel.''\n  I think that is relevant and it is another example of the White \nHouse's efforts to keep us from moving forward. I know that the White \nHouse, as well as Members on the other side of the aisle, keep \nhammering on the fact that over 40,000 pages of documents have been \nproduced. But it is not the quantity of documents that matter. They \ncould produce a million pages but deliberately withhold one key page. \nBy telling us to be satisfied with what they have already given us, it \nis like telling us we can have everything but the 18-minute gap in the \n4,000 plus hours of Watergate tapes. Plain and simple, in my opinion, \nthis amounts to contempt of the Senate and obstruction of justice.\n  We in the Senate have a serious responsibility to investigate abuses \nof power in the executive branch. It is one of our constitutional \nobligations and is a responsibility which the people of Florida expect \nme to carry out.\n  The obligation of the legislative branch to hold the executive branch \naccountable goes back to the beginning of our American heritage. The \nFounding Fathers had this very role in mind when they debated \nratification of the Constitution. In Federalist Paper No. 51, James \nMadison explained the need for checks and balances among the branches \nof Government.\n\n       If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal \n     controls on government would be necessary. In framing a \n     government which is to be administered by men over men, the \n     great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the \n     government to control the governed; and in the next place \n     oblige it to control itself.\n\n  The special committee's work is an attempt to ensure that we are \ncontrolling government in the way our Founding Fathers envisioned. We \nowe it to the American people. This is their Government, and we are \naccountable to them.\n  Now, the failure of Madison Guaranty cost the taxpayers $60 million. \nI have attended hearings day after day and heard some amazing \nincidences of wrongdoing, only to turn around and hear administration \napologists proclaim, ``So what.'' This is my reaction to the ``so \nwhat'' response. In other words, what they are saying is, ``You have \nnot proved anybody guilty of anything. There is no smoking gun. So \nwhat.'' It is like saying that if somebody takes a gun and shoots at \nsomebody and misses, no harm was done. I think, in fact, there is harm \nthat has been done; and it has, in fact, been uncovered.\n  To those who insist that nothing wrong was done, I suggest you look \nto the results obtained so far from the independent counsel's work: \nNine guilty pleas and indictments against seven others. That tells me \nthat the issues we are pursuing are important.\n  In fact, in the most recent round of indictments, the President's \n1990 gubernatorial campaign is specifically mentioned as the direct \nbeneficiary of criminal behavior.\n  It is also interesting to note that the work of this committee has \nhelped, not hindered or duplicated, the work of the independent \ncounsel. The Albany Times Union observed that without the public demand \nin our hearings for the First Lady's billing records, the special \nprosecutor might still be waiting for them.\n  The public has a right to know the truth about this administration. \nOn February 25, the Washington Post ran an editorial favoring an \nextension of the special committee. The main reason stated for needing \nadditional time was the failure of the White House to cooperate. This \nis what the Washington Post said: ``Clinton officials have done their \nshare to extend the committee's life.''\n  A January 25 editorial in the New York Times said, ``Given the White \nHouse's failure to address many unanswered questions, there is . . . a \nstrong public interest in keeping the committee alive.''\n  One Florida newspaper, the St. Petersburg Times said, ``Forget \nelection year politics. The American people deserve to know whether the \nClinton administration is guilty of misusing its power and \norchestrating a coverup. For that reason--and that reason alone--the \nSenate Whitewater hearings should go on.''\n  Further, they cited the most important and most democratic reason to \ncontinue these hearings was, ``Ordinary citizens need to learn what all \nthis Whitewater talk is about. Americans deserve a President they can \ntrust, someone who embraces questions about integrity instead of \nrunning from them. If the answers make Clinton's campaigning more \ndifficult, so be it.''\n  Wrongdoing should not go unpunished just because it was discovered \nduring an election year. ``The search for answers cannot stop now.''\n  I agree wholeheartedly with the St. Petersburg Times. This \ncommittee's work must continue in order to preserve the future \nintegrity of the office of the President. The Presidency of the United \nStates is an office which should be looked to as a beacon of trust. Our \nPresident should be honest and forthright, and so should his staff. Our \nduty is to ensure that the President upholds this basic standard, \nabides by the laws of the land, and avoids any abuse of his sacred \noffice.\n  Apologists for the administration's behavior have complained this \ninvestigation is costing taxpayers too much money. I agree with my \ncolleague, again, from North Carolina, who said, ``You cannot put a \nprice tag on the integrity of the Presidency.''\n  For those of my colleagues who may still be deciding how to vote on \nthis matter, I suggest they ask themselves a few basic questions. Have \nall the White House staffers been forthcoming, candid, helpful, and \ninformative in their testimony and conduct? Did the career employees of \nkey agencies who contradicted White House staff lie when they told us \nof White House interference? Has the President fulfilled his pledge to \ncooperate fully with the committee? If you answer one or more of these \nquestions with a no, do as I will, and support the resolution so that \nwe might finally learn the truth.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the issue before us is a resolution that \nhas\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\nbeen reported from the Rules Committee, introduced by Senator D'Amato, \nthe chairman of the Special Whitewater Committee, which would \nindefinitely extend the special committee and provide another $600,000 \nover and above the almost million dollars that was provided last year \nfor it to continue its work.\n  The distinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, has proposed that \nthe committee's work continue until the 3rd of April with an additional \n$185,000. The question is really whether the life of this committee \nought to be given an indefinite extension throughout the 1996 \nPresidential election year.\n  I am going to retrace the history of our inquiry with respect to this \nparticular issue, because I am very frank to say that I think the \nindefinite extension of the work of this committee will only result in \npoliticizing the committee. It will be increasingly perceived by the \npublic as an investigation being conducted for political purposes.\n  Now, that was recognized last year when the resolution establishing \nthe committee was first passed. Last May--on May 17--the Senate adopted \nSenate Resolution 120, which provided for the establishment of the \nSpecial Committee To Investigate the Whitewater Development Corporation \nand Related Matters. That resolution, which provided $950,000--almost \n$1 million to carry out that investigation--provided that the funding \nwould expire on February 29, 1996.\n\n  The reason it provided that was that from the beginning the intent \nwas to carry out this inquiry in a fair, thorough, and impartial \nmanner, and complete it before the country enters into the Presidential \ncampaign. Therefore, Resolution 120, by authorizing funding only \nthrough February 29, accomplished this objective. In fact, the \nresolution states that the purposes of the committee are ``to expedite \nthe thorough conduct of this investigation, study and hearings'' and \n``to engender a high degree of confidence on the part of the public \nregarding the conduct of such investigation, study and hearings.''\n  In fact, Chairman D'Amato, before the Rules Committee, stated when \nfunding for the inquiry was being sought, ``We wanted to keep it out of \nthat political arena, and that is why we decided to come forward with \nthe one-year request.''\n  So it is very important to understand that at the time the resolution \nwas adopted there was a concern about this inquiry becoming a partisan \npolitical endeavor. It was very clear that to avoid that it was decided \nnot to extend the inquiry well into the Presidential election year. In \nfact, the resolution provided that the committee should report to the \nSenate in mid-January, evaluating its progress and the status of the \ninvestigation. When that report was made, regrettably the majority took \nthe position they needed an unlimited extension of the inquiry--\nunlimited. In other words, it could go throughout 1996.\n  The minority took the position--and this was back in mid-January--\nthat the committee should complete its investigation by the date \ncontained in the resolution; namely, the 29th of February. We argued in \nthat report, ``It is well within the ability of the committee to \ncomplete its investigation by the February 29th date provided for in \nthe resolution. The committee should undertake a schedule for the next \n6 weeks that will enable it to meet that objective.''\n  In fact, the Senate leadership had announced that the Senate would \nnot be in regular voting sessions from the period of mid-January until \nnear the end of February, and without any competing legislative \nbusiness, it was our view that the committee could devote full \nattention of this investigation, hold an intense series of hearings and \ncomplete its inquiry on schedule--on schedule--and within budget as \nprovided for in Senate Resolution 120 which this body adopted last May \non a vote of 96-3.\n  It was possible for the committee to have met 4 or 5 days a week, a \npace the committee has on previous instances followed. This very same \ncommittee has followed that pace on other occasions. That would have \ngiven the committee the opportunity to do the Arkansas phase of the \ninquiry, part of which remained to be completed, the committee having \nlargely completed the work on the Foster papers phase and the \nWashington phase.\n  Now, between July and August of last year, between July 18 and August \n10, at a time when the Senate was in session and Members were handling \nextensive legislative business, this special committee held 13 days of \npublic hearings and examined 34 witnesses. That is a period of 3 weeks \nlast summer, this committee, working hard, held 13 days of public \nhearings and examined 34 witnesses. The Iran-Contra committee, which I \nwill turn to in a bit to make some other contrasts, held 21 days of \nhearings back in 1987 between July 7 and August 6 in order to complete \nits work.\n  Now, there is an important reason not to carry this matter well into \na Presidential election year. By authorizing the funding only through \nFebruary 29, Senate Resolution 120 stated that the purpose was to \nengender a high degree of confidence on the part of the public \nregarding the conduct of such investigation, study and hearings. \nExtending the life of the committee beyond that date, and in particular \nextending it for an indefinite period of time would undermine this \nobjective. Inevitably, in my judgment, it would diminish public \nconfidence in the impartiality of this inquiry.\n  Now, regrettably, an intensification of the hearing schedule was not \npursued through January and February. So we came to the end of February \nand the majority, now led by Chairman D'Amato, has proposed an \nunlimited extension of time to continue the Senate investigation. That \nproposal was reported out of both the Banking Committee and the Rules \nCommittee on a straight partisan vote, in contrast to the vote on \nSenate Resolution 120 last May.\n  The minority proposed an alternative. We took the position in mid-\nJanuary that this inquiry could be finished by the end of February, \npursuant to Senate Resolution 120, but the kind of hearing schedule \nthat would have been necessary to accomplish that was regrettably never \nadopted. In fact, we have a situation in which in the 2-month period, \nwe saw opportunities to conduct hearings simply pass by. In January, we \nheld one hearing this week, two hearings this week, two this week, two \nthat week. So we held seven hearings in the entire month of January. \nJanuary--seven hearings.\n  I remind Senators that last summer this very same committee in the \nperiod between July 18 and August 10, a period of 3 weeks, held 13 days \nof public hearings, 13 days of public hearings. The Iran-Contra \ncommittee, in a month, held 21 days of public hearings. Mr. President, \nseven hearings in the month of January; the pace in February was the \nsame. The month of February we held eight hearings. All of these \nopportunities to hold hearings on all these other days did not take \nplace, and in the last 2 weeks we held 1 day of hearings out of nine \npossibilities. So we came to the end of February not having intensified \nthe hearing schedule, and Chairman D'Amato and the majority now propose \nan indefinite extension of the hearing schedule.\n  Additional funding, $600,000, which, of course, would bring Senate \nexpenditures on the investigation of Whitewater matters to $2 million--\n$400,000 in the previous Congress, $950,000 thus far by this committee, \nand an additional $600,000. Now, of course, that does not take into \naccount the money spent by the independent counsel, which is now \nunderstood to be above $25 million, and increasing at about the rate of \n$1 million a month; or the money spent by the RTC on a civil \ninvestigation carried out by the Pillsbury Madison firm, which comes in \nat just under $4 million. We have no firm figure on the amount spent by \nHouse committees looking into the Whitewater matter, nor a figure for \nthe money spent by Federal agencies assisting with or responding to \nthese investigations. In any event, it is very clear that the amount \nspent in total, including all of these various sources, is over $30 \nmillion.\n\n  Senator Daschle wrote to Senator Dole on the 23d of January, at the \ntime the report was filed, in which the minority argued very strongly \nthat the committee should undertake an intensified hearing schedule in \nthe final 6 weeks, to complete its investigation by the February 29 \ndate, and said in his letter, and I am quoting Senator Daschle now:\n\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\n\n       It is well within the special committee's ability to \n     complete its inquiry by February 29. The committee can and \n     should adopt a hearing schedule over the next 6 weeks that \n     will enable it to meet the Senate's designated timetable.\n\n  As I indicated, no serious effort to intensify the hearing schedule \nin order to meet the February 29th deadline occurred. In fact, in the \nlast week no hearing whatever was held. In the week before, only one \nhearing was held. In other weeks, more hearings were held, two \nhearings, maybe three hearings, but often with witnesses who had little \nnew to contribute to the investigation.\n  Senator Daschle has put forth an alternative proposal in an effort, \nreally, to demonstrate reasonableness, with respect to the work of the \ncommittee, and that is to provide an additional 5 weeks, until April 3, \nfor the special committee to complete its hearing schedule, and until \nMay 10 for the committee to complete its final report and to pay for \nthis extra time by additional funding of $185,000.\n  In my view, 5 weeks of additional hearings should be more than \nadequate to complete the so-called Arkansas phase of this \ninvestigation, a phase which concerns events that occurred in Arkansas \nsome 10 years ago, events which have been widely reported on since the \n1992 Presidential campaign, about which much is already known.\n  So, in an effort to reach an understanding, Senator Daschle said we \nfelt that you could have completed your work by the deadline, by \nFebruary 29, as was enacted by the Senate last May when they passed the \nresolution establishing the committee. That represented the judgment \nand the consensus of this body in passing that resolution 96 to 3. And \nwhen we reached the mid-January point, it was clearly stressed that an \nintensified schedule would enable the committee to complete its work on \ntime and within budget. That did not happen. We did not get that \nintensification of schedule. Now we come, having passed the 29th of \nFebruary, with Chairman D'Amato and the majority arguing that they now \nwant an indefinite extension of this inquiry.\n  I think the proposal put forth by the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, is an eminently reasonable one. Regrettably, it was rejected \nin the Banking Committee on a straight party-line vote and rejected \nagain in the Rules Committee by a straight party-line vote. In other \nwords, the Democratic position was, we are willing to provide a limited \nextension in order to finish up the things that you assert are not yet \ndone and will provide a limited amount of time. We do not want to, in \neffect, commit $600,000, but we will commit $185,000.\n  Let me compare and contrast the procedure that has been followed with \nrespect to this resolution and the question of its extension with what \noccurred on the Iran-Contra hearings which took place in 1987, namely \nthe year preceding a Presidential election year, just as 1995 precedes \na Presidential election year. In considering a resolution with respect \nto Iran-Contra, Senator Dole took the very strong position that the \ninquiry ought not to extend into the Presidential election year.\n  In fact, in early 1987, when Congress was considering establishing a \nspecial committee on Iran-Contra, some advocated that it have a long \ntimeframe, extending into 1988, in order to complete its work. There \nwas a conflict between some Democrats in the House and Senate who \nwanted no time limitations placed on the committee, and Republican \nMembers, led by Senator Dole, who wanted the hearings completed within \n2 or 3 months. And, of course, it was pointed out at the time, and \nescaped no one's attention, that an investigation that spilled into \n1988 would only place the Republicans in a defensive posture during the \nPresidential election year.\n  Senator Inouye, who was selected to chair the special committee, and \nCongressman Hamilton, who was selected as its vice chairman, \nrecommended at the time rejecting the opportunity to prolong, and \nthereby exploit for political purposes, President Reagan's \ndifficulties. They determined, in fact, that 10 months would provide \nenough time to carry out the inquiry, and that was the requirement \nunder which the Iran-Contra Committee moved forward. In fact, during \nthe Senate debate on the resolution to establish a select committee on \nIran-Contra, Senator Dole noted the good-faith effort of these two \ncongressional leaders to have the committee complete its work in a \ntimely manner.\n  He stated:\n\n       I am heartened by what I understand to be the strong \n     commitment of both the chairman and vice chairman to avoid \n     fishing expeditions and to keep the committee focused on the \n     real issues here.\n\n  And the time period then was shortened from what many had been \nproposing in order to expedite and complete work on the matter and not \ncarry it into the 1988 election year. Senator Dole argued during floor \ndebate that the country had many other matters to deal with, and \nstated:\n\n       With all these policy decisions facing us, the Senate--and \n     the country, for that matter--cannot afford to be consumed by \n     the Iranian arms sales affair.\n\n  So the Senate, when it passed the resolution, established a \ntermination date well before the end of 1987. The termination date in \nour resolution was in February 1996. But it was recognized that that \nwas to avoid going further into a Presidential election year. In doing \nthat, Senator Dole said:\n\n       There is still a national agenda that needs to be pursued. \n     There are a number of issues that must be addressed, and the \n     American people are concerned about the Iran-Contra matter. \n     But they are also concerned about the budget, about the trade \n     bill, about health care, and a whole host of issues that we \n     will have to address in this Chamber.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The problems of the past, as important as they are, are not \n     as important as the future. And, further, if we get bogged \n     down in finger pointing, in tearing down the President and \n     the administration, we are just not going to be up to the \n     challenges ahead, and all of us--all Americans--will be the \n     losers.\n\n  I want to compare these two ways of proceeding because it was debated \nat the time of Iran-Contra, and recognized some push to extend it into \n1988 and into the Presidential election year. That was very strongly \nopposed by Senator Dole, and by his colleagues. In the end, Senator \nInouye and Representative Hamilton turned down the opportunity to \nprolong the inquiry into the election year and extend it for political \npurposes.\n  This Senate last May took, in effect, the same position by \nestablishing the February 29, 1996 date. We have now reached that date. \nAnd we find the majority asking for an unlimited extension of this \ninquiry after we have been through a period in which neither in January \nnor in February did the committee embark upon an intense hearing \nschedule in order to finish its work by the cutoff date.\n  As I have indicated, we had hearings only 8 days in the month of \nFebruary, a month when the Senate was not in session. And, therefore, \nwhen it was possible to really devote all day every day to this issue, \nthere were no hearings in the last week in February--only one hearing \nin the next to the last week. And in the month of January, once again, \nmany days without any hearings by the special committee, 7 days of \nhearings out of the entire month, 8 days in February. That is a total \nof 15 days over 2 months.\n  As I indicated earlier, this very committee last summer in the latter \npart of July and the first part of August--over a 3-week period--held \n13 days of hearings. But let us compare it with Iran-Contra because \nthat was a situation in which the Democrats controlled the Congress. \nThere was a Republican administration.\n  The question then was, what was fair in terms of carrying out this \ninquiry, and how far should it extend into the Presidential election \nyear? And the Democrats took the position that they were not going to \nextend it into the Presidential election year. They were going to try \nto keep politics out of the inquiry. Obviously, the further it goes \ninto a Presidential election year, the more politics will come into the \ninquiry. And there is just no doubt about that, and the more the \npublic's confidence in the impartiality of the inquiry will be eroded.\n  In 1987, in order to meet this schedule, the Iran-Contra committee \nheld 21 days of hearings between July 7 and August 6. It met literally \nevery Monday through Friday with three exceptions over a 5-week period.\n  So there was an intense set of hearings in order to carry through on \nthe undertaking that had been made to finish up its work in a timely \nfashion and\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\navoid keeping the matter out of the 1988 Presidential election year--21 \ndays of hearings with only three open days during that period so it \ncould complete its hearing work within the timeframe set forth in the \nresolution which established it; 21 days of hearings.\n  Contrast that--the undertaking made by the Democratic Congress then \ndealing with a Republican administration to honor the effort to keep it \nout of the election year and out of the political context and not to \nhave it turn into a partisan endeavor. Contrast this hearing schedule--\n21 days of hearings in a 1-month period--with a hearing schedule that \nhas been pursued by this committee over the last 2 months. There were \nonly 8 days of hearings in February, and only 7 days of hearings in \nJanuary for a total of 15; 15 days over 2 months when Iran-Contra had \n21 days in a month and finished up its work to honor the undertaking \nnot to project it into a political year.\n  My own view is that the committee could and should have finished its \nwork by the 29th of February as it was charged to do by the resolution \nthat was adopted by this body last May. I think that was well within \nthe ability of the committee. It did not happen. We are now confronted \nwith a situation in which Chairman D'Amato and his colleagues seek an \nunlimited extension of the work of the committee.\n  Senator Daschle indicated on the 23d of January that he thought the \ncommittee could complete its work by February 29. Now he has prepared \nand has offered an alternative in an effort to accommodate providing \nsome additional time and funding for the committee to carry on its \nwork.\n  In other words, we felt the committee should have finished by \nFebruary 29. They did not follow a schedule in order to do that. The \nquestion is, what now? Senator Daschle, in an effort to accommodate, \nproposed providing additional weeks of hearings, until April 3 to \ncomplete a hearing schedule, until May 10 to complete a final report, \nand funding to carry out this work of $185,000 as contrasted with the \n$600,000 that Chairman D'Amato is seeking for an indefinite extension \nof the work of the committee. In other words, an extension that can go \nthroughout 1996 and obviously right into the Presidential campaign--an \nextension which, in my judgment, by prolonging the investigation well \ninto a Presidential election year, will contribute to a public \nperception that the investigation is being conducted for political \npurposes.\n  It needs to be understood, of course, that the independent counsel's \ninquiry will continue. The independent counsel operates under, in \neffect, his own statute. He has unlimited funding. So that inquiry will \ngo on as long as the independent counsel deems that it should go on. \nJudge Walsh, as we know, went on many, many years with respect to Iran-\nContra and, in fact, continued his work after the hearings were \nconcluded.\n  These hearings have never been related to the work of the independent \ncounsel because the independent counsel is on a separate track. As we \nsaw in Iran-Contra, those hearings ended in the latter part of 1987, \nbut the independent counsel continued his work. Of course the work of \nthe current independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, will go forward. He was \ngiven broad authority by a special panel of Federal judges to \ninvestigate Whitewater. He has a staff that eclipses anything that is \navailable to any other inquiry that is now going on--we understand 30 \nattorneys and over 100 FBI and IRS agents; and the Independent Counsel \nReauthorization Act sets no cap on the cost of his investigation, which \nhas been over $25 million thus far.\n  So, in fact, many have raised the point: Let the independent counsel \ndo the inquiry, on the premise that that is a less political arena than \nhearings conducted here in the Congress, particularly hearings that go \ninto the election year itself, so you have politicians looking at \npoliticians in a political year, and that is almost certain to \nguarantee a political endeavor.\n  Now, in addition, it is important to realize that the RTC-\ncommissioned report, the comprehensive report by an independent law \nfirm, Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, headed by a former Republican U.S. \nattorney, Jay Stephens, that report has now been made public. It cost \nalmost $4 million. And the conclusion transmitted to the RTC was that \nthey found no basis on which the RTC should bring any actions, civil \nactions, with respect to the various matters which they investigated.\n  That represents a very thorough and comprehensive review.\n  Let me turn for a moment to the argument about requiring an open-\nended extension in order to get more material. It is my understanding \nthat the White House has now provided all material requested with the \nexception of those further requests made to it by the special committee \nover the last 2 or 3 weeks.\n  A great to-do is made about material that has been provided 2 weeks \nago, a month ago, in early January. But the important thing to remember \nis that that material was provided; so it was made available to the \ncommittee. People raise a lot of commotion about the fact that Mr. \nGearan's notes were not provided earlier on. Well, they were provided. \nHe has an explanation as to why they were not provided earlier on. In \nany event, the committee got them, reviewed them, and held a hearing \nwith Mr. Gearan, an all-day hearing, in which we went over those notes. \nThe same thing is true of the notes with respect to Mr. Ickes.\n  On March 6, today, Jane Sherburne, the special counsel to the \nPresident, sent a letter to Chairman D'Amato and to me as the ranking \nmember in which she states the following, and I am quoting the letter:\n\n       Since the issuance of the Special Committee subpoena on \n     October 30, 1995, the White House has received some 30 new \n     requests from the Chairman. This letter summarizes the status \n     of our response to those requests.\n       We have provided responses to every request with the \n     exception of two new requests for e-mail made by the Chairman \n     in February after we reached what we had understood was the \n     Committee's finalized e-mail request memorialized in my \n     letter to the Committee on January 23, 1996. One of these \n     additional e-mail requests relates to the discovery of copies \n     of Rose Law Firm billing records which were provided to the \n     committee on January 5, 1996, 2 weeks before the Committee \n     staff finalized its e-mail request.\n       The other outstanding e-mail request relates to the period \n     January 3 through January 12, 1994. This request was first \n     made on February 16, 1996, but without the necessary detail \n     to conduct the retrieval process. The detail was later \n     provided by staff orally.\n       As you are aware, the Executive Office of the President \n     already has incurred over $138,000 in out-of-pocket costs for \n     the e-mail described in my January 23, 1996, letter. Although \n     we retrieved and reviewed 10 boxes of e-mails, this effort \n     produced nothing of use to the committee's inquiry. \n     Nonetheless, we are undertaking to respond to the new \n     requests and hope to provide you with the results shortly.\n\n  Those are additional requests that were made. The original e-mail \nrequests--well, the original request was so broad that no one really \nreasonably could be expected to respond to it, and after extended \ndiscussions, we were able to reach an agreement to focus those e-mail \nrequests and to narrow them down, and they now have all been provided.\n  In addition, the White House undertook to verify that all documents \nprovided to the counsel's office by White House staff beginning in \nMarch 1994 had been reviewed and produced to the committee as \nresponsive. They also undertook to verify that all relevant White House \nfiles of certain former White House officials that may contain \nresponsive material had been reviewed. So they undertook to go back and \nscrub down the files as a consequence of a couple of these late-\narriving requests.\n  As a consequence of that work, some additional material--not much--\nhas been provided to the committee. Most of them are copies or \nduplicates of matters that had previously been produced to the \ncommittee.\n\n  But that material has also now been received by the committee. So the \ncommittee now has all of this material in hand, which seems to me \nargues very strongly for an approach as the one contained in that put \nforth by the minority leader, by Senator Daschle, which would provide \nthe committee an extension of 5 weeks from the termination date in \norder to complete its inquiry, some additional time in order to do its \nreport, and would really serve to keep this matter out of the election \nyear.\n  There has been no counterresponse to that proposal of the \ndistinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle. I mean, the original \nproposition put forward by Chairman D'Amato was an indefinite extension \nand $600,000. Senator\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\nDaschle and his colleagues on this side of the aisle indicated that \nthat was unacceptable because it would really politicize this inquiry \neven further in an election year and guarantee that it would turn into \na partisan political endeavor.\n  The Democrats did not seek to do that with Iran-Contra in 1987, and I \nam frank to say I do not think the Republicans should seek to do that \nwith Whitewater in 1996.\n  The leader, faced with this proposal for an unlimited extension, \noffered what I think was a very reasonable proposal. That is for an \nextension until the 3d of April for hearings and until the 10th of May \nfor the report. That has not elicited any response from my colleagues \non the other side other than simply to press forward with their \noriginal proposal, which was for an indefinite extension and an \nadditional $600,000.\n  As we have indicated, Mr. President, we do not think that is \nnecessary or required. We believe an indefinite proposal would make \nthis inquiry simply a partisan political endeavor. We note that while \nthe original resolution was passed by a very overwhelming bipartisan \nvote of 96 to 3, the proposal for an unlimited extension is moving \nalong simply on the basis of a straight party vote.\n  We do not believe that is the way this matter should be handled. I \nurge my colleagues on the other side to look again at the proposal put \nforth by the minority leader, which I think represents a very \nreasonable proposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have several observations and reactions \nto the statement by the Senator from Maryland, who has done his usual \nthorough job of examining a whole series of issues. But if I may, Mr. \nPresident, without being disrespectful of my colleague, I would like to \nsay that those issues are not particularly significant or relevant to \nwhat we are talking about here. I was not in the Senate when the Senate \ndiscussed Iran-Contra or the October Surprise or Watergate or any of \nthe other hearings that he has discussed in such detail.\n  The issue before us is not whether or not those hearings were \nconducted well or badly, whether they were conducted in a speedy and \nexpeditious manner or whether they were dragged out. The issue is \nwhether or not this committee deserves more time to do its work. For \nthat reason, I will not really debate with the Senator from Maryland \nanything regarding Iran-Contra or October Surprise or any other such \nissue.\n  The committee clearly needs more time to conclude its work. That is a \ngiven. The proposal offered to the Senate by the distinguished \nDemocratic leader very specifically demonstrates a recognition of the \nfact that the committee needs more time. So I do not think that \nquestion is at issue.\n  The only question at issue before us is, how much time do we need? To \nme, the answer to that is very simple--as much time as it takes to get \nthe facts. It is not that complicated. I know my colleague from Florida \nspoke for 45 minutes, close to an hour. My colleague from Maryland has \nspoken for the same period of time.\n  To me, the issue is very simple--how much time will it take to get \nthe facts? Not how much time has elapsed or how many witnesses we have \nheard or how many documents have been furnished or how much time was \ntaken in another controversy that took place years ago. How much time \ndo we need to get the facts?\n  In an effort to try to come to that point, Mr. President, I turn to \nthe press. I will quote briefly from three editorials. They have been \nquoted extensively before. They have been put in the Record. So I will \nsimply summarize some of them on the point that I have tried to make.\n  The Washington Post on the 25th of February, after examining many of \nthe outstanding issues says this in conclusion:\n\n       Who knows where this all will lead? The committee clearly \n     needs time to sift through these late-arriving papers as well \n     as interview witnesses now unavailable because they are key \n     figures in the Whitewater-related trials. So like it or not, \n     the Senate committee is unlikely to go off into the sunset at \n     month's end when its mandate expires. Clinton officials have \n     done their share to extend the committee's life.\n\n  That summarizes it for me, Mr. President. Why do we need more time? \nBecause Clinton officials have not been as forthcoming as they should \nhave been. The committee clearly needs time for two reasons. One, to \nsift through these late-arriving papers. Why are they late arriving? \nAgain, ask President Clinton and his staff. The committee has been \nasking for them for months. One, to sift through these late-arriving \npapers, and, two, interview witnesses who are now unavailable because \nthey are key figures in the Whitewater-related trials. Very \nstraightforward. All right.\n  The New York Times, making comment in the aftermath of the Iowa and \nNew Hampshire primaries says:\n\n       The excitement of Iowa, New Hampshire has diverted \n     attention from the Senate Whitewater committee and its \n     investigation into the Rose Law Firm's migrating files.\n\n  I think that is an interesting phrase, the law firm's ``migrating \nfiles.''\n\n       Naturally this pleases the White House--\n\n  Referring to the lack of focus on this--\n\n       Naturally this pleases the White House and its allies, who \n     hope to use the interregnum to let their `so what' arguments \n     take root. David Kendall, the Clinton's private attorney, \n     says the curious paper trail is just one of the meaningless \n     mysteries of Whitewater.\n\n  Then the Times says:\n\n       There are mysteries here, but they are not meaningless.\n\n  Then it goes on again through that which has been covered so many \ntimes. I do not feel the necessity of covering it one more time. But \nthe Times concludes:\n\n       Perhaps the files will also show that there was no coverup \n     associated with moving and storing these files.\n\n  And this sentence--I love it, because it summarizes what we are \ntalking about.\n\n       Inanimate objects do not move themselves. It is pointless \n     to ask Senators and the independent prosecutors to fold their \n     inquiry on the basis of the facts that have emerged so far. \n     To do so would be a dereliction of their duties.\n\n  I love the way this is written. The ``migrating files,'' ``inanimate \nobjects do not move themselves.''\n  Another newspaper, USA Today, offered these comments in an editorial. \nIt leads off with this statement:\n\n       This week author Hillary Rodham Clinton was supposed to \n     inform the nation about the truths kids can tell us. Instead, \n     the nation is confronted with questions about whether the \n     First Lady is telling the whole truth about her role in two \n     scandals, Whitewater and Travelgate, and whether she and her \n     husband can stop acting like children when asked about it.\n\n  It then goes on to list a series of questions. Again, they have been \ntalked about at great length here on the floor. I see no point in \nasking them again just for the sake of asking them.\n  But I like the conclusion, again, out of this editorial, after \nrenewing all of these questions. It says:\n\n       Mrs. Clinton and the President have raised these questions, \n     not Republicans.\n\n  I would like to repeat that for emphasis, Mr. President:\n\n       Mrs. Clinton and the President have raised these questions, \n     not Republicans. They've created the impression they may be \n     covering something up by being less than thorough in \n     responding to legitimate demands for information. This is not \n     the first time Mrs. Clinton has run into such a problem. She \n     never fully explained profits from the 1970's commodities \n     trades. Concerns linger that the profits came from wealthy \n     friends seeking political favors.\n\n  And then the conclusion, with which I heartily agree:\n\n       Rather than pointing fingers at the investigators, the \n     Clintons need to offer some apologies, plus the whole truth \n     of what went on with Madison, Whitewater and the travel \n     office. Nothing less will do.\n\n  That is the end of that editorial.\n  So, Mr. President, I could go on for a significant period of time and \nreview what we found out in the committee, rehearse the various things \nthat were said, comment once again on the inconsistencies and all of \nthe rest of that. I do not see that it serves much purpose. The issue \nis very clear: How much more time does the committee need?\n  I believe that the offer made by the Democratic leader is for an \ninsufficient amount of time. The argument is made that the request made \nby the chairman of the committee for no firm date is too much time. I \nhope both sides can sit down and say somewhere between the offer made \nby the Democratic leader and the request for an open-ended\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\ninquiry made by the chairman, we can find a date that can satisfy the \ntwo requirements, which are sufficient time to sift through the late-\narriving documents and enough time for us to hear from the witnesses \nwho are currently unavailable.\n  To me, it is not that hard to figure out. I hope that we can arrive \nat that point instead of tying up the Senate in endless rehashing of \nissues that, as I say, in my view, are not relevant.\n  I go back to the New York Times for the final summary of that when \nthe New York Times said editorially, for the Democrats to filibuster \nthis request will look like silly stonewalling.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I always enjoy the opportunity for an \nexchange with my distinguished colleague from Utah. I listened \ncarefully as he quoted from the Washington Post editorial headed \n``Extend the Whitewater Committee.'' The Post then, in a subsequent \neditorial headed ``Extend, But With Limits,'' said:\n\n       . . . but the Senate should require the committee to \n     complete its work and produce a final report by a fixed date.\n\n  It then goes on to say, and this may, in effect, get into the area \nthat the Senator was perhaps suggesting in his comments because I \nlistened very carefully and as I made the point myself, the proposal we \nhad from the other side was an unlimited extension.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The distinguished Democratic leader said, ``Well, we \ncan't agree to an unlimited extension, but we are prepared to offer \ncarrying it forward.'' We have heard nothing back with respect to that. \nSo that is the play on this issue.\n  This editorial said:\n\n       Democrats want to keep the committee on a short leash by \n     extending hearings to April 3rd with a final report to follow \n     by May 10th. A limited extension makes sense, but an \n     unreasonably short deadline does not. Five weeks may not be \n     enough time for the committee to do a credible job. Instead, \n     the Senate should give the committee more running room, but \n     aim for ending the entire proceeding before summer when the \n     campaign season really heats up. That would argue for \n     permitting the probe to continue through April or early May.\n\n  And, of course, we had suggested April 3.\n  I know the Senator has quoted some editorials that say go on with \nthis thing. There are other editorials, of course, which take just the \nopposite point of view.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, may I respond to that very quickly?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has the floor. Does \nthe Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I certainly yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have to leave the floor, and I thank my colleague from \nMaryland for his courtesy. I simply say, Mr. President, that subsequent \neditorial that the Senator from Maryland quoted is in exactly the vein \nof what I am talking about, that I find the Democratic leader's \nproposal to be too short a leash, but this Senator would not object if \nwe met the two objectives called for of enough time to sift through the \nlate-arriving papers and the ability to interview witnesses who are \ncurrently unavailable. My only objection to the proposal made by the \nDemocratic leader is that it does not provide for meeting those two.\n  So I say to the Senator from Maryland, Mr. President, that this \nSenator would be willing to have some kind of agreement along the lines \nthat he is now talking about. My objection is to the cutoff date in the \nproposal made by the Democratic leader which I think is too short a \nleash.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, let me point out that there are other \neditorial comments around the country which actually think this should \nend right now, period.\n  The Sacramento Bee on March 2 had an editorial, ``Enough of \nWhitewater.'' Let me quote a couple of paragraphs:\n\n       Senator Alfonse D'Amato, the chairman of the Senate \n     Whitewater committee and chairman of Senator Bob Dole's \n     Presidential campaign in New York, wants to extend his \n     hearings indefinitely, or at least one presumes until after \n     the November elections. The committee's authorization and \n     funding ran out Thursday, and the Democrats, in part for \n     related political reasons, want to shut the committee \n     hearings down. In this case, the Democrats have the best of \n     the argument by a country mile. With every passing day, the \n     hearings have looked more like a fishing expedition in the \n     Dead Sea.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of that editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sacramento Bee, Mar. 2, 1996]\n\n                          Enough of Whitewater\n\n       Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the chairman of the Senate Whitewater \n     Committee and chairman of Sen. Bob Dole's presidential \n     campaign in New York, wants to extend his hearings \n     indefinitely--or least, one presumes, until after the \n     November elections. The committee's authorization and funding \n     ran out Thursday and the Democrats, in part for related \n     political reasons, want to shut the committee hearing down.\n       In this case, the Democrats have the best of the argument \n     by a country mile. With every passing day, the hearings have \n     looked more like a fishing expedition in the Dead Sea.\n       Given the fact that D'Amato's mighty and costly labors have \n     so far caught little but crabs; that there is a special \n     prosecutor going over the same ground; that there have \n     already been nearly 20 months of Senate hearings, first under \n     the Democrats, then under the Republicans; that a couple of \n     House committees have held their own hearings; and that an \n     armada of journalists has covered the ground for more than \n     three years, you'd think that whatever Whitewater is had been \n     covered to death.\n       Thursday, the Democrats, though in the minority, managed to \n     use parliamentary devices to block the indefinite extension \n     that D'Amato asked for. They're willing, they said, to accept \n     a five-week extension to wrap up the hearings, then another \n     six weeks to allow the committee to write a report. That, \n     said D'Amato, sends ``the unmistakable message that (the \n     Democrats) want to prevent the American people from learning \n     the full facts about Whitewater.''\n       In fact, it ought to be plenty. Even if every charge were \n     true, the political cronyism and favoritism allegedly \n     bestowed in connection with the Whitewater development while \n     Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas--and so far only \n     alleged--would be of no interest to any congressional \n     committee were it not for the fact that Clinton is present. \n     Similar shenanigans--and worse--occur routinely in state \n     after state. Why isn't D'Amato investigating Lamar Alexander, \n     who benefited richly from business cronies during his days as \n     governor of Tennessee and as president of its state \n     university?\n       There may well have been attempts in the Clinton White \n     House to cover up the dealings among the Clinton, the \n     Whitewater development company and the failed Arkansas \n     savings and loan that helped to bankroll it. There was \n     certainly a great deal of stonewalling and evasive behavior. \n     But Kenneth Starr, the special prosecutor, has been sparing \n     no effort to investigate both that and related matters. What \n     is it that D'Amato can credibly establish that Starr can't.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, finally an editorial in the Atlanta \nConstitution which calls for bringing this inquiry to an end. It goes \non to point out, ``one, that a recent Resolution Trust Corporation \ninvestigation found no hint of impropriety by the Clintons regarding \ntheir Whitewater involvement.''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The first couple is still under investigation by \n     Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr, a former Reagan Justice \n     Department official, who can be expected to scrutinize the \n     Clinton's legal and business affairs rigorously. Any \n     additional sleuthing by Senator D'Amato would be a waste of \n     taxpayers' money.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that editorial be printed in the Record \nas well.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Atlanta Constitution, Feb. 15, 1996]\n\n                    Take D'Amato Off Clintons' Case\n\n       The Senate's Watergate hearings of 1973-74 were momentous, \n     delving into White House abuses of power and leading to the \n     resignation of a disgraced president and the imprisonment of \n     many of his aides. They lasted 279 days.\n       Next week, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and his fellow \n     Whitewater investigators will surpass that mark (today is the \n     275th day), and they have nothing anywhere near conclusive to \n     show for their labors. To put matters in context, all they \n     have to ponder is a fairly obscure 1980s real estate and \n     banking scandal in Arkansas.\n       With a Feb. 29 expiration date for his special panel \n     staring him in the face, D'Amato has the effrontery to ask \n     the Senate for more time and money to continue drilling dry \n     investigative holes. Specifically, he wants open-ended \n     authority and another\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\n     $600,000. That's on top of the $950,000 his committee has \n     spent so far, plus $400,000 that was devoted to a Senate \n     Banking Committee inquiry into Whitewater in 1994.\n       The partisan motives behind D'Amato's request couldn't be \n     more obvious. Here he is, a chief political strategist for \n     the leading Republican contender for the presidency, Bob \n     Dole, seeking to legitimize the committee's hectoring of \n     President and Mrs. Clinton well into the campaign season.\n       If the panel could demonstrate a glimmer of a hot new lead \n     connecting the Clintons to the Arkansas scams, D'Amato's \n     appeal for an extension might have merit. Invariably, though, \n     the committee's supposed revelations have evaporated for want \n     of substance. Witnesses who testified in the past are being \n     summoned back, often to go over familiar ground. Chelsea \n     Clinton's former nanny had to appear again this week, for \n     heaven's sake.\n       This is not to let the Clintons off the hook. They might \n     have allayed suspicions about themselves long ago if they had \n     promptly produced documentation of their Arkansas business \n     and legal dealings. But lawyerly reticence, however \n     politically unwise, by no means indicates guilt. Remember \n     that a recent Resolution Trust Corp. investigation found no \n     hint of impropriety by the Clintons regarding their \n     Whitewater involvement.\n       The first couple is still under investigation by \n     independent counsel Kenneth Starr, a former Reagan Justice \n     Department official who can be expected to scrutinize the \n     Clintons' legal and business affairs rigorously. Any \n     additional sleuthing by D'Amato would be a waste of \n     taxpayers' money.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the Greensboro, NC, News and Record had \nan editorial headed ``Whitewater Hearing Needs To Wind Down.'' Let me \njust quote a couple of paragraphs from that:\n\n       A legitimate probe is becoming a partisan sledgehammer.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       A legitimate probe is becoming a partisan sledgehammer. The \n     Senate Whitewater hearings, led since last July by Senator Al \n     D'Amato (R-NY), have served their purpose. It's time to wrap \n     this thing up before the election season.\n\n  Then they end that editorial with this comment:\n\n       Let the GOP use the fruits of D'Amato's labors as they will \n     in the coming campaign, but don't let the opposition party \n     run a smear campaign at public expense.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Whitewater Hearing Needs To Wind Down\n\n       A legitimate probe is becoming a partisan sledgehammer.\n       The Senate Whitewater hearings led since last July by Sen. \n     Al D'Amato, R-N.Y., have served their purpose. It's time to \n     wrap this thing up before the election season.\n       The committee has documented the Clinton's various \n     relationships with a bankrupt Arkansas savings and loan and \n     related enterprises. It has developed evidence of a damage \n     control campaign run from the White House. And it has \n     revealed a mean and petty episode involving the White House \n     travel office. The portrait of Arkansas politics curing the \n     '80s is not a pretty one.\n       All of this--including the mysterious, belated appearance \n     in the White House of documents that had been subpoenaed by \n     the committee months earler--will surely be politically \n     damaging to the Clintons. D'Amato's committee should sum up \n     its findings, publish them for all to see, and go on to \n     something else. The committee has done its work, sometimes \n     more than once.\n       Still, D'Amato and company haven't had enough. The New York \n     senator wants his mandate, which has already eaten up $1 \n     million of your money, extended indefinitely. He has asked \n     for another $600,000.\n       Republicans charge that it has been the White House's \n     desultory compliance with the committee's requests that has \n     slowed its work, necessitating the extension of this \n     expensive and fruitless exercise. But that argument is \n     becoming tedious.\n       The committee has already subpoenaed everybody and every \n     document in sight. The committee's thoroughness is not in \n     question. The committee's excesses are. They have begun to \n     eat into its credibility.\n       Senator D'Amato tries to explain away his obvious conflict \n     of interest by making the laughable argument that his role as \n     New York chairman of the Bob Dole campaign has no connection \n     to his use of the Senate committee. Here's what's happending.\n       D'Amato is carrying on Dole's campaign in the Senate with \n     repetitious hearings that highlight testimony from the White \n     House staff, then outside the Senate chambers with press \n     conferences. Covering Whitewater once in 1995 was a \n     legitimate Senate inquiry. Rehashing it in 1996, an election \n     year, is exploiting the forum to damage the president.\n       What began as only a partly political exercise has over the \n     months become blatantly that, thanks to D'Amato and his North \n     Carolina ally, Sen. Lauch Faircloth.\n       The committee had good reason to look into the Clintons' \n     role in the Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan mess and related \n     matters. But the panel majority, and especially the chairman, \n     have turned a search for the truth into a partisan vendetta \n     against the Clintons. Not even a casual observer of these \n     proceedings could miss the contempt that the committee \n     chairman has for the president and his wife. Allowing these \n     hearings to go on indefinitely would be giving D'Amato--and \n     by extension the legislative branch--a license to harass the \n     executive.\n       There's no reason to let the Clintons off the hook. An \n     independent counsel is plowing the same ground--including the \n     serious allegations that the White House may have attempted \n     to obstruct justice and that Clinton exercised undue \n     influence over savings and loan regulators while governor of \n     Arkansas. There is no need for taxpayers to pay for this work \n     twice and then again, particularly not when the Senate \n     committee has so obviously become an arm of the Republican \n     campaign to unseat the President.\n       Let the GOP use the fruits of D'Amato's labor as it will in \n     the coming campaign. But don't let the opposition party run \n     its smear campaign at public expense.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, it would appear that we are going into \nnot a debate on the issues here, but a debate on who can find the best \neditorials. I say to the Senator from Maryland that he read from the \nGreensboro, NC, News and Record. I have found, over the few years that \nI have been in the Senate, when I get an unfavorable editorial in the \nNews and Record, I finally did something right. But since we are going \ninto the editorials, I will read one from USA Today. I am quoting from \nthe last four paragraphs:\n\n       Why did it take so long to find the papers? Subpoenas for \n     Travelgate and Whitewater documents are many months old. \n     Failure to provide them quickly warranted legal action. The \n     statute of limitations for filing suits against Madison \n     lawyers lapsed just days before the bills were produced. How \n     could the White House have missed them? Mrs. Clinton and the \n     President have raised questions, not Republicans. They have \n     created the impression they may be covering up something by \n     being less than thorough in responding to legitimate demands \n     for information. This is not the first time Mrs. Clinton has \n     run into such a problem. She never fully explained profits \n     from a 1970 commodity trade--\n\n  And they are being kind to her when they say ``never fully \nexplained.'' She never even slightly explained.\n\n       Concerns linger that the profits came from wealthy friends \n     seeking political favors. There has never been any \n     explanation of that. Rather than pointing fingers at the \n     investigators, the Clintons need to offer some apologies, \n     plus the whole truth about what went on with Madison, \n     Whitewater, and the travel office. Nothing less will do.\n\n  Now, that is from USA Today, January 10, 1996.\n  Mr. President, we have been through this charade with the \nadministration for more than 2 years now. It is time that it ends, and \nthe length and amount of time that we have expended in these \ninvestigations is brought on not by the Republicans on the committee, \nbut by the delay of the White House in providing subpoenaed \ninformation. That is simply the reason we are here today asking to \nextend the length of the resolution.\n  Mr. President, the central issue in this debate is this: Will the \nU.S. Senate, for the first time in my memory, take the affirmative step \nof refusing to investigate a scandal of public corruption? That is very \nsimply what we are talking about doing with the filibuster here today--\nit is that the Senate is saying, ``We are not going to investigate \nthese people. We do not want to get into it.''\n  The length of the investigation is irrelevant. As I said, the delays \nhave come about not by the investigating committee, but by the White \nHouse itself. It has been nothing more than an attempt to wear it out, \nto use it up, to exhaust the people, to exhaust the money, to hope it \nwould go away, and the length and time set for the investigation would \nlapse.\n\n  Just a few weeks ago, we received key documents from Mark Gearan. We \nreceived new documents from Harold Ickes, the White House Deputy Chief \nof Staff. And even just this week, still documents are coming in from \nWhite House lawyers. If the legal staff and the White House do not know \nwhere their notes and papers are, maybe that explains some of the \nconfusion we see coming out of the White House. What do they know if \nthey do not know where their notes and papers are?\n  Last December, on the Senate floor, we voted for a resolution to \nsubpoena William Kennedy's notes from a November 5, 1993, meeting \nconcerning Whitewater. The full Senate voted a subpoena. And last \nFriday, Bruce\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\nLindsey admitted that he, too, had notes from this meeting. Last \nFriday. That is 2 years and 3 or 4 months. He brought those notes \nforward for one reason, which is that he believes this investigation is \ngoing to go on and he has a fear of obstructing justice. Can you \nimagine someone of that rank at the White House telling the committee \nthat he did not take notes and then find them after the deadline has \nexpired? We are asked to believe that. Furthermore, the accidental \ndiscovery of documents always seems to occur on Friday afternoon after \nthe news deadline. This is when Bruce Lindsey turned over his \ndocuments. This is when the First Lady's billing records were released. \nI do not think a committee of the U.S. Senate should be treated with \nthe disrespect the White House has shown this committee.\n  The cost of the investigation is not small, but I have asked, ``Can \nwe put a price on the integrity of the White House?'' Mr. President, it \nis worth discussing how we arrived at this point? It is worth reviewing \nhow Whitewater became a congressional issue, because it tells us \nsomething about the failure of the savings and loan industry and also \ntells us a lot about the ethics of Bill and Hillary Clinton?\n  In February 1989, Madison Guaranty Savings Loan failed. The failure \ncost American taxpayers an estimated $60 million at that time. I see \nfigures today that it is over $70 million. But, whatever, it was a lot \nof taxpayer dollars. In fact, the entire savings and loan crisis cost \nthe American taxpayers $150 billion--an unbelievably staggering amount \nof money. The Banking Committee has every right--and, in fact, a duty--\nto review the cause of the crisis. Is there any question that the \nAmerican people, who are paying this bill--they are paying the $60 or \n$70 million Madison lost, and they and their children and grandchildren \nare going to pay the $150 billion, and they have a right to know where \nthe money went and how it happened.\n  While Madison was a small institution, its failure was one of the \nworst in the Nation. When it failed, the cost to the taxpayers was 50 \npercent of the assets of the institution--50 percent.\n  In Arkansas, 80 percent of the State-chartered S's failed while \nBill Clinton was Governor. Jim McDougal took over Madison from 1982 to \n1986. In 4 short years, the assets grew from $6 million to $123 \nmillion. Now, if we will back up and look at what assets mean, that \nmeans he borrowed $117 million more in a period of 4 years. He borrowed \n$117 million that wound up being guaranteed by the taxpayers of this \ncountry. In 4 years, he borrowed $117 million that the taxpayers of \nthis country wound up paying off for him. Part of that money, a good \nbit of it, went to Whitewater Development.\n  He increased his loans to insiders. That is what Bill and Hillary \ncertainly would have been, since they were his partners in a real \nestate deal. He increased his loans to insiders. When he took it, the \ninsider loans were $500,000. Four years later, he had increased his \nloans to insiders, which were Bill and Hillary Clinton, the President \nand First Lady, to $17 million. Whitewater was one of the ventures that \ncaused Madison to fail.\n  Furthermore, the claims that the Clintons lost money is false. They \nnever had any of their money at risk. You cannot lose money you did not \nhave. It was a sweetheart deal for the new Governor, tracking and \ncongruent with the commodity trade in which Hillary Clinton earned \n$100,000. Do you know how she earned $100,000 in the most speculative \nbusiness in the world? She read the Wall Street Journal. After she \nearned $100,000, without explanation, in this brilliant, brilliant \ntrade, worked by a commodity broker named Red Bone who was investigated \nfor everything, she quit. No more commodity trades. If she possessed \nthe skill to turn $1,000 into $100,000 in that length of time by being \nFirst Lady, she is wasting the most valuable and potential money-making \nasset this Nation has ever known.\n  The Pillsbury report that has been referred to many times by Senators \nin the minority showed that the taxpayers of this country lost far more \nmoney on Whitewater than the Clintons. To me, that alone is a scandal.\n  Furthermore, there are reports in today's Washington Post that Mrs. \nClinton herself was much more involved in Whitewater than we believed, \nthat she was fully aware that the McDougals had put more money into the \ndeal than the Clintons did. Again, we have two Yale-educated attorneys \nthat today tell us they were oblivious to the whole affair, that they \ndid not understand it. It is almost beyond the concept of most of us on \nthe committee to see two of the ``smartest lawyers''--said her press \npeople or somebody; we were clearly often told Mrs. Clinton was one of \nthe 100 smartest lawyers in the Nation, and he certainly was at \nOxford--could not buy 300 acres of cheap Arkansas land without a \nnational scandal. The two smartest lawyers in the country could not buy \n300 acres of cheap Arkansas land without creating a national scandal.\n\n  Why? Because it was not a clean legal deal. That is why you could not \nbuy it without a scandal. Madison Guaranty was a high-flier savings and \nloan. It has been called the personal piggy bank for the political \nelite in Arkansas. I called it a calabash or a pot of money that the \npoliticians were dipping in and taking out. I do not often agree with \nthe editorial pages of the New York Times, but they have called the \nWhitewater hearings a stew of evasion and memory lapses. They do not \noften get it correct, but they did that time.\n  Mr. President, the central issue in Whitewater has been whether \nMadison received favorable treatment from Arkansas savings and loan \nregulators because of Jim McDougal's close ties to President Clinton. \nEssentially, the question is this: Did the losses to the taxpayers \nincrease because Jim McDougal pressed his case with State regulators, \nwhich President Clinton, then Governor Clinton, Bill Clinton, had \nappointed?\n  The notes from Gearan's meeting, from the meeting he was in, \nsuggested the White House wanted to send somebody down to Little Rock \nto get the story straight with Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the State \nsavings and loan regulator. Get the story straight. The folks we were \ntalking about, if we send them--and I do not remember the initials--but \nif we send CP, HL, and CB, it will come out. We cannot send them. Maybe \nwe could get somebody from New York to go. They probably would not be \nrecognized very quickly in Little Rock. Maybe we can get somebody from \nhere or there to go. If we send our people, they will be recognized; it \nwill get out.\n  Well, if it were an honest, clean trip, what was there to get out? \nWhy not go down and talk to Ms. Schaffer and say, ``Here is what we are \nhere for. Tell us the truth.'' That was not the purpose of the trip. \nThe purpose of the trip was to get the story to match.\n  Had the American public been given the real picture in the wake of \nthe savings and loan crisis, I think they would have reacted very \ndifferently to the inside quid pro quo way of doing business in \nArkansas and Little Rock, particularly since the American taxpayers \npaid for the lax regulations. We will be paying for this into the whole \nnext century.\n  Mr. President, Whitewater extends even farther than Madison Guaranty. \nIt involves a small business investment corporation called Capital \nManagement Services. This company was run by a man named David Hale. \nIt, too, served as a personal bank for the politically connected in \nArkansas. Its purpose was to make loans to the disadvantaged, but that \nturned out to be the rule-making politicians of Little Rock. \nRegrettably, the American taxpayers paid over $3 million for the \nfailure of Capital Management.\n  Mr. President, it is a fact that Capital Management made a $300,000 \nloan to Whitewater. Now, inside the beltway of Washington and in the \nvernacular of the Congress, $300,000 would not even be a blip on the \nscreen. To the average American, $300,000 is an enormous amount of \nmoney.\n  Now, Capital Management made a $300,000 loan to Whitewater. That is \nfar more than anybody had put into it in real money. We have strong \nevidence that President Clinton asked this loan be made. I think time \nwill tell that David Hale is telling the truth when he says that Bill \nClinton pressured him to make this loan to help benefit Whitewater. If \nit is not true that Bill Clinton pressured David Hale to make this \nloan, then we need to--and I hope\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\nthe Democrats would be pushing to extend these hearings so we can bring \nDavid Hale to the hearings and let him clear Bill Clinton's name.\n  If it is true, if it is true that the President, now President \nClinton, pressured him, then that needs to be brought to the light and \nlet the public see it.\n  Here again, the American taxpayers have paid to subsidize President \nand Mrs. Clinton's failed real estate venture in Arkansas. Again, our \nWhitewater hearings have uncovered that the White House was aware of \nthe Hale investigation from the very beginning. They had testimony from \na career SBA official that the SBA briefed Mike McLarty in May 1993, \nabout the SBA investigation of David Hale. They briefed McLarty about \nthe SBA investigation of David Hale, the man who said he was pressured \nby then-Governor and now President Bill Clinton to make the loan.\n  That is essentially what these hearings are about, the loss of \ntaxpayer money in Madison, Whitewater, and Capital Management. We have \nnever had Mr. Hale as a witness. We need him as a witness and we need \nto wait until the legal proceedings going on in Little Rock are over \nand bring him as a witness.\n  Mr. President, on another issue, Vince Foster's death and the \nhandling of his papers on the eve of his death has raised the most \nquestions with the committee. We know for a fact that the First Lady \nspoke with her assistant, Maggie Williams, before Maggie Williams went \nto the White House and Vince Foster's office. In fact, she spoke to her \nin almost record time that you could drive from Maggie Williams' house \nto get in Vince Foster's office. And we know by the telephone records \nwhen she left her home and we know by the Secret Service records when \nthe alarm went off in Vince Foster's office and she went in. And she \ndid it in almost record time.\n  We asked her before the committee, why did she go to the White House? \nAnd the explanation was a somewhat vague, that she was out riding and \nhad to be somewhere. Well, she was somewhere, in Vince Foster's office.\n  We know that they spoke later in the evening, immediately upon Maggie \nWilliams' return from the White House. We know that she called, Mrs. \nClinton called her. She went to the White House. We know she went to \nthe White House, she went to Vince Foster's office, she went directly \nback home, and she called the First Lady. That we know.\n  Then, in the morning, 1 a.m., Maggie Williams was talking to Susan \nThomases. We have the sworn testimony of uniformed Secret Service \nOfficer Henry O'Neill, who saw Maggie Williams remove documents from \nVince Foster's office on the night of his death. All of this is \nundisputed fact.\n  Within the last few weeks we have gathered more information that I \nthink gives credence to the notion that files were indeed removed on \nthe night of Mr. Foster's death. First, two files relating to the \nMadison Guaranty were sent back to the Rose Law Firm by David Kendall. \nThey had to have come out of Vince Foster's office. Yet these files \nwere never part of the box that Maggie Williams said she took from \nFoster's office 2 days after his death. These documents were reviewed \nand cataloged by Bob Barnett, the Clinton's other attorney. The two \nMadison files never appeared there.\n\n  Mr. President, what we have seen is massive inconsistency and \nconfusion. It has gone on and on and on. The truth, as I use a poor \nsimile, is that getting information out of the White House was akin to \neating ice cream with a knitting needle. And that is about what it has \nbeen, a little bit here and a little bit there. But never enough to \nsatisfy.\n  This is the way it has gone on since the beginning of the hearings \nand unbelievable stories we have been asked to believe. We can go back \nto the Maggie Williams/Susan Thomases flurry of telephone calls, and \nalso to Mrs. Clinton's explanation of them.\n  Maggie Williams: I do not know why I went to the White House. I could \nnot possibly have taken anything out. Yet she met a uniformed 18-year \nveteran of the Secret Service in a 5-foot hall, and neither of them are \nsmall people. He had no reason to tell it wrong. She immediately calls \nMrs. Clinton from her home phone when she gets back to her house, and \nshe went directly back to her house. There were many calls to Susan \nThomases and Mrs. Clinton over a very short period of time. And the \nexplanation we have for these calls is this one: They were \ncommiserating with each other. They were making sure everybody was all \nright. They were checking to see if the bereaved were comfortable.\n  Mrs. Clinton herself said that these calls were commiserating and \nthere was a lot of sobbing going on on those calls that night.\n  I find that extremely difficult to believe, and if I am wrong I would \nbe delighted to be corrected by the facts. But we find no calls from \nMrs. Clinton to Mrs. Foster or the children. The telephone records have \nnot indicated those calls existed, and so far they have not been \nbrought forward. I believe the documents that Maggie Williams delivered \nthat night are the now-famous missing billing records. I fully believe \nthat Maggie Williams had them in her arms that night. Certainly \neverybody agrees that Vince Foster's handwriting was all over these \nbilling records--in the original writing, not copies. The records were \ncopies but his handwriting was the original. It was all over them.\n  Many have said, Well, what is it in the billing records that is \nsignificant?\n  There are two very important significances. One of them is that they \nwere subpoenaed by a Senate investigating committee, they were \nsubpoenaed by an independent counsel, and whoever knew where they were \nshould have brought them forward regardless of what they said. They \nwere subpoenaed papers.\n  But the significance--another significance is the work on the Castle \nGrande project is important. That was the one project that RTC said: \nThere may be legal liability for the Rose Law Firm. Is it any wonder \nthat they stayed hidden until after the statute of limitation had \nexpired?\n  The First Lady had over 14 calls with Seth Ward, according to her \nbilling records. Seth Ward was the Castle Grande man. This was a known \nsham deal identified by the RTC as a sham deal. Is it reasonable to \nthink that one of the 100 smartest lawyers in the country could have \nhad 14 telephone calls with a client doing a sham deal and not suspect \nit or known it was wrong? I think she knew well what she was doing. She \nhad to know. That is why the documents did not turn up.\n  Castle Grande cost the American taxpayers $4 million. The RTC tried \nto collect some of the money. But Mrs. Clinton had disguised work on \nthis issue. No wonder they were so concerned about the statute of \nlimitations expiring in 1994 but extended until the end of 1995. This \nis what sparked the meeting that we saw in 1994.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, we still have key witnesses to call, \nwitnesses that know where the bodies are buried, witnesses that will \ntalk and can talk, but they are tied up in a trial in Little Rock now. \nWe need to get them here. Jim McDougal, Susan McDougal, and David Hale. \nCan you imagine if we held Iran-Contra hearings without Ollie North or \nJohn Poindexter or Bud McFarland? What would the hearings show? Can you \nimagine if the Republicans wanted to end these hearings and had wanted \nto end them? The media would have crucified us. It would not have \nhappened.\n  To conclude, here are some of the questions that need answers. These \nwe need answered before we conclude the hearings.\n  Who placed Mrs. Clinton's subpoenaed records in the White House book \nroom? Nobody has given me any argument that the White House book room \nand Mrs. Clinton's private adjoining office are the two most secure \nrooms in the world. If they are not, they should be, because that is \nwhere the President spends his private time.\n  Were those records in Vince Foster's office the night he died? If so, \nwho removed them? And where were they stored for 2 years?\n  Clearly, the records did not walk out of Vince Foster's office. They \nwere walked out, and whoever walked them out knows where they carried \nthem and where they were hidden for 2 years.\n  Did White House officials lie to investigators about what went on in \nthe hours and days after Vince Foster's death? Did the White House \nresponse\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\nteam obstruct justice by attempting to control the scope of the \ninvestigation? Did the White House Whitewater response team obstruct \njustice by attempting to tamper with a witness? Did then-Governor \nClinton pressure a local judge to make an illegal loan to his business \npartner? These we can answer if we get the people here.\n\n  Why did the Clinton business partner pay most of the Clintons' share \nof Whitewater Development Corps. bills? What motivated his generosity? \nWas the administration involved in any action which prevented, impeded, \nor obstructed the administration of justice? If so, who directed it, \nwho carried it out, and what was done? Why cannot the American people \nget the answers to these questions?\n  If there is nothing to hide, which has been contended by the \nDemocratic side and the White House, why not bring forth the facts, \nbring forth the documents and stop letting them out little by little by \nlittle? Nothing would clear the name of the Clintons quicker than to \nbring forth all of the facts, bring the people in from Little Rock, and \nconclude the hearings.\n  Would we be literally facing a filibuster if there were nothing to \nhide? If there is not, let us end the filibuster, and let us get on \nwith the investigation.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time that we get on with the \ninvestigation. I agree with the Democrats: We need to bring it to a \nconclusion, but we need to complete our work before we bring it to \nconclusion.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague and friend from California is on \nthe floor. So at this time I will yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for yielding the floor at this time.\n  Mr. President, what I would like to do in the beginning of my remarks \nis to correct the record on a couple of matters that the Senator from \nNorth Carolina raised. First of all, the statute of limitations on the \nCastle Grande transactions had not expired when the Rose Law Firm \nbilling records were found in the White House in early January 1996. In \nfact, by a agreement between the RTC and the Rose Law Firm, the statute \nof limitations had been extended until March 1, 1996.\n  So, Mr. President, we could have a disagreement on whether we ought \nto continue these hearings, but let us not get on the floor of the \nSenate and say things that are not true. It is simply wrong to suggest \nthat the documents were discovered because the statute of limitations \nhad expired when, in fact, the statute of limitations had not expired.\n  Second, Mr. President, I think it is very important when colleagues \nstand up and make comments that there be a basis for those comments.\n\n  I am happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I am very much aware, and we all are, that the statute \nof limitations was not applicable to the First Lady's business. But as \na member of a Rose Law Firm, as the attorney involved, and as a billing \nattorney involved in this--and she was the billing attorney on Castle \nGrande--she would certainly have a responsibility, maybe not a personal \nfinancial responsibility, but she very much would be involved in the \nproceedings.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I might reclaim my time, I think my friend is not \ncontradicting what I said. I will repeat what I said.\n  The statute of limitations had been extended until March 1, 1996, and \nit is wrong to suggest that the documents were discovered because the \nstatute of limitations had expired. That is the only point I am making \nto my friend. I think it is important we not stand up here and say the \nstatute had expired.\n  I am going to have to take back my time and tell my friend he is \ngoing to have to seek time on his own only because of a pressing \nappointment in my office. I need to make this statement and finish it, \nif I might.\n  I am glad to yield to my friend, but I hope he would have a question.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. My question is in answer to the statement. Mrs. \nClinton's attorney, Mr. Kendall, said it was a legal question whether \nit involved the Rose Law Firm or Mrs. Clinton personally. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would just restate that whether it did or did not is \nnot my point. My point is a statement was made here that the statute \nhad expired, and the implication is that, if there was something wrong \nin the billing records, the First Lady and the Rose Law Firm would be \noff the hook. The statute did not expire. In fact, we know the billing \nrecords were turned over, and actually underscored what the First Lady \nhad said, that the time she put into that is minimum.\n  That is the first point I want to correct, Mr. President.\n  Second, I want to quote from the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan \nand Whitewater Development Co. supplemental report written by \nPillsbury, Madison & Sutro. And we know part of that firm is Jay \nStephens, who has strong ties to the Republican Party. This is what \nthey found. I am going to state this and quote directly from the \nreport.\n\n       There is no basis to assert that the Clintons knew anything \n     of substance about the McDougals' advances to Whitewater, the \n     source of funds used to make those advances, or the source of \n     the funds used to make payments on the bank debt.\n\n  That is on page 77.\n  On page 78, quoting from an investigative report that cost about $3 \nmillion--excuse me, I stand corrected, $4 million--page 78:\n\n       There is no basis to charge the Clintons with any kind of \n     primary liability for fraud or intentional misconduct. The \n     investigation has revealed no evidence to support any such \n     claim, nor would the records support any claim of secondary \n     derivative liability for the possible misdeeds of others.\n  Page 78. ``It is recommended''--and this is very important, I say to \nmy colleagues--``it is recommended that no further resources be \nexpended on the Whitewater part of the investigation.''\n  Now, this is an objective report, paid for by the taxpayers, done by \nthe firm of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, a great law firm, including Jay \nStephens, known for his ties to Republicans, and what do they say?\n\n       It is recommended that no further resources be expended on \n     the Whitewater part of the investigation into Madison \n     Guaranty.\n\n  So what are we doing in the Senate? Ignoring this, ignoring this and \nmoving on with an investigation of a Senate select committee. I think \nwe ought to start listening to people who are objective on this, who \nhave no political ax to grind. As a matter of fact, people thought in \nthe beginning, when Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro got that: My God, this \nis going to be political.\n  Well, it turned out that the Clintons have been cleared.\n  Now, I know that annoys a lot of my Republican friends, and I feel \nsorry for them, that this is the biggest thing in their lives, some of \nthem. But I have to tell you there are other things in the lives of the \nAmerican people that have to be addressed by this Senate. And I have to \ntell you, these attacks on the First Lady of the United States, these \npersonal attacks, these personal attacks on the President of the United \nStates border, in my opinion, on being unpatriotic. It is my personal \nopinion. But that is up to each individual Senator. And clearly it is \nup to the people of the country to decide.\n  I have to say, listening to these attacks, when my colleague says he \nbelieves David Hale, well, that is his right. This is a man who has \nalready pleaded guilty to two felonies, as I understand it. And not \nonly that, but we have word that the State is prosecuting him as well. \nAnd this is the individual that is quoted in this Chamber to prove that \nour First Lady and our President are not good human beings. Well, \nagain, it is every Senator's right to call it the way he sees it, but I \nthink the American people see right through this. And who are they \ngoing to believe? A man who has already stated that he committed two \nfelonies or Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, which says in their report: Let \nus spend no more time on this investigation. The Clintons are not \nguilty of anything.\n  Now, I supported every single vote here to move this investigation \nforward. I voted to set up the special committee. I voted to extend the \nspecial committee. I had nothing but support for those two resolutions. \nWe reached across party lines. We worked together. We shaped \nresolutions that were not political. But I say it is time to step back \nand wind this thing down.\n\n  I have to tell you, the offer that we Democrats have made is \nextremely\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\ngenerous in terms of the time and the allocation of funds we have \nrecommended. Let me prove that point. We have already heard from 121 \nwitnesses, some of them two and three times, mind you. They are brought \nback. They have to pay for attorneys. Some of them do not have means to \ndo it. Some of them will be paying that off for decades, if ever. But \nwe have done it.\n  We have met for 230 hours of hearings. I want you to keep that number \nin mind--230 hours of actual hearings. Now, the Democratic leader and \nranking member, Senator Sarbanes, and all of us are saying, let us have \nan additional 5 weeks of hearings, almost $200,000 more, recommending \nalso that there be 4 weeks allocated in addition to write a report, and \nour Republican colleagues say it is not enough. It is not enough.\n  Why? Why? This is their latest reason. Because they cannot get up \nhere and say we want to keep investigating, keep the story alive \nbecause it hurts the First Lady and it hurts the President. You cannot \nsay that. But this is what they say. In the court, there is a hearing. \nThere is a trial in court, and we need to call those people. We need to \nwait.\n  Let me quote from a letter signed by our ranking member, Senator \nSarbanes, and our chairman, Al D'Amato, that was written in October \n1995. This is signed by both.\n\n       The special committee does not intend to seek the testimony \n     of any defendant in the pending action brought by your \n     office.\n\n  This is to Ken Starr.\n\n       Nor will it extend to expand upon the grants of immunity \n     provided to persons by your office. Indeed, Senate Resolution \n     120 expressly provides the special committee may not immunize \n     a witness if the independent counsel informs the committee in \n     writing that immunizing that witness would interfere with the \n     independent counsel's ability to prosecute.\n\n  So, in writing, our chairman said he had no intention of calling any \nwitnesses. Now, the big reason we have to wait is we have to call the \nsame people who are going before this jury.\n  Now, let me say something. And this was brought out by our ranking \nmember, Senator Sarbanes, but it bears repeating. I wish to say to my \nRepublican friends, this is America. We do not have trials in secret in \nthis country. Every one of these people involved in the trial, all the \npeople who Senator Faircloth says he wants to hear from, they are going \nto be in that courtroom and we are going to hear from them. But, no, \nthat is not enough. We want to play prosecutor. You know, this is not \n``L.A. Law.'' This is the Senate of the United States of America. We \nare legislators, not prosecutors. That is why we have the independent \ncounsel.\n  And by the way, does the independent counsel have any limits to his \ninvestigation? The answer is no. He has, as I understand it, 100 FBI \nagents on this matter and 30 lawyers; unlimited sums of money. But we \nare going to play prosecutor. Maybe some of them are jealous; they want \nto be prosecutors. Well, they ought to do that and not be Senators. \nThat is fair. But do not turn this Senate into a group of prosecutors \nbecause that is not our role. That is why we have the independent \ncounsel. Take the politics out of this thing. So we have had 230 hours \nof hearings, and now we are offering another 5 weeks.\n  Now, let me say this to anyone who is listening. I sat down with my \npen and figured out how many hours of hearings we could have under the \nDemocratic proposal. Let us say we worked 8 hours a day, taking an hour \nfor lunch like most Americans, 8 hours a day, and held those hearings 5 \ndays a week. Most Americans work 5 days a week. I think it is a sound \nidea myself. We could hear from so many witnesses. We could hear from \n100 witnesses, maybe more.\n  As I figure it, we would have 175 hours of additional hearings. They \nhave only had 230. They could have another 175 hours. What happens if \nwe decide to work 10 hours a day? Just work a little harder, take an \nhour for lunch, a 10-hour day. We could have another 250 hours of \nhearings under the Democratic proposal.\n  We have only had 230. So we could just do as much as we have done, \nplus. If my Republican friends are so anxious to work on this, let us \nget to work. Let us go. Let us get your witnesses, let us line them up, \nan hour at a time. Let us do our work.\n  But, no, as the ranking member has pointed out, there are some weeks \nthey have one witness. They harangue them for 9 hours--and I mean \nharangue--to no avail, by the way. So if we are really serious, the \nDemocratic alternative has offered them more hours than they have \nalready spent. So let us stop saying that we want to close it down. By \nthe way, some Members on my side do want to close it down. They do not \nwant any more hours. I happen to believe let us close it down in an \norderly fashion. So I am supporting this additional 5 weeks, with 4 \nweeks to write a report.\n  I just cannot understand why my Republican friends do not want to \ntake this, if they are serious about saying they want to get their work \ndone. They want to hear from these witnesses in the jury trial. We can \nlisten in, just as all Americans can, and read all the reports about \nthe trial and get the information we need. If we feel we need to take \nmore action legislatively because we found out new information, we can \ndo that.\n  By the way, I also point out we do have a Senate Banking Committee \nthat can meet any day of the week. Why do we need to hire all these \nspecial lawyers they bring in? They go on television every night and \nreport, move their careers up the line. At what cost? At what cost? We \nhave very good people on staff. We can do some of this in the Senate \nBanking Committee.\n  So we are legislators, not prosecutors. The Democratic alternative \ngives you more hours than you have already expended on this matter. The \nonly reasonable conclusion I think the American people can draw is that \nthat is not their interest. Their interest is in dragging this out \nuntil election day--until election day.\n  I have to tell you something. It is not working for them. From a \npolitical standpoint, if I were being political, I would just let them \ngo right ahead, because the American people are disgusted. They are \nwatching this, and they are saying, ``This is incredible. These people \nare meeting back here in Washington, and what are they doing? Nothing \nto make our lives better, nothing to make our lives better. As a matter \nof fact, spending $600,000''--which is the proposal of the \nRepublicans--``which could be better spent either on deficit reduction \nor restoring some of the cuts to education they so happily made here.''\n\n  Teachers are being laid off all over who teach reading to children, \nbecause of the actions of this Senate. They could not find the money \nfor education. But boy, oh, boy, they find it pretty easy for this.\n  I have a Superfund site in San Bernardino, CA, where a poison plume \nis moving down into the water supply. That cannot be cleaned up because \nthe Republicans, who control this body and the other body, do not even \nhave the budget passed. I am on the Budget Committee. We are supposed \nto be working on the next budget. They do not even have the current \nbudget passed.\n  But, oh, no, we have to talk about Whitewater. We need $600,000, not \nto restore some of these cuts, not to reduce the deficit, not to clean \nup Superfund sites, not to raise the minimum wage. You do not even need \nmoney to do that; you just need time on the floor to vote on it. It is \nat a 40-year low. People try to live on it. They cannot take time for \nthat.\n  I mean, it is just amazing to me. So politically, as far as I am \nconcerned, when people look at this Congress, they are saying, ``We \ndidn't expect this kind of change. We didn't expect a whole breakdown \nin the budget process. They can't even get their act together to pass \nthe debt.'' Hurting our ratings because we cannot even do our job. But \nthey have a lot of time for Whitewater.\n  So maybe I should not be here complaining about it. Maybe, \npolitically speaking, it will help, help change who is in control \naround here. But be that as it may, I have to say what I think. What I \nthink is that this offer from the Democrats to extend these hearings \nfor 5 weeks, another 4 weeks to write a report, if we got our act \ntogether and worked 8, 10 hours a day, we could just have well over 100 \nwitnesses and wrap this up and get on to the work and keep this out of \nthe political arena.\n  People want job training, education. They want pension protection. \nThey\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\nwant health insurance that is portable. We have a great bipartisan \nbill. Why is that not up here? The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill will protect \nour people from getting their insurance canceled because of a \npreexisting condition. It would allow them to take that health \ninsurance with them.\n  I ask you, what is more important for our people, standing up and \nberating the President and the First Lady on something that happened \nyears and years ago, where the special counsel has all the resources he \nneeds to bring justice, or doing the work of the U.S. Senate? I am \nabsolutely amazed that, after all the bipartisanship we have had on \nthat committee over so many years, our ranking member and our chairman \ncannot agree when we have offered hours and hours of hearings to them.\n\n  It is extraordinary to me. I think this issue of the trial is a false \nissue. Again, this is not going to be a secret trial. So, Mr. \nPresident, I am clearly distraught that this is the priority of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for 3 minutes \non a different subject. Then I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1552-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    VIOLENCE BY TERRORISTS IN ISRAEL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the recent violence in \nIsrael and to express my profound hope that these cowardly terrorist \nattacks will not destroy the peace process that so many have worked so \nhard to cultivate.\n  In the past week, the extremist, terrorist organization Hamas has \nsponsored four deadly bombings, killing more than 60 people and \nwounding more than 200 innocent, innocent people. These vile and \ndisgusting acts clearly targeted at innocent civilians on public buses \nand on busy streets must be condemned.\n  It is hard to imagine the kind of deranged mind that could \ncontemplate such appallingly evil deeds. As the President said very \neloquently yesterday, he cannot even imagine an adult who could teach a \nchild to hate so much.\n  The most recent attack, which occurred this past Sunday, killed 14 \nIsraelis, including 3 children dressed in their costume for the Purim \nfestivals.\n  Purim is among the most joyous holidays for the Jewish people. It \ncommemorates how the children of Israel overcame a genocidal plot \nthousands of years ago. Purim reminds us that in the end, good triumphs \nover evil and reminds us that the Jewish people have an indomitable \nspirit of survival. The Persians could not destroy the Jewish people \nthousands of years ago. The Nazis failed 50 years ago. And Hamas will \nfail, too.\n  The United States of America stands shoulder to shoulder with Israel \nduring this crisis. Their battle against these evildoers will be the \nbattle of all civilized people everywhere.\n  An all-out war on terrorism must and should be waged. But the Hamas \nterrorists want one thing more than anything else, Mr. President--to \nscuttle the peace process. We must not allow them to win. We must \ndefeat the terrorists and ensure a lasting peace.\n  PLO President Yasser Arafat can and must do much more. His recent \nstatements condemning these attacks unconditionally have been good, but \nhis actions must now follow his words. Only he has the power, the \nposition, and the influence to gain control over Hamas.\n  My heart goes out to the victims of this violence and to all the good \npeople of the Middle East who pray and work for peace.\n  I thank you very much, Mr. President, and I yield the floor. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1567-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1567-S1595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT CORP. AND RELATED MATTERS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard just about all the whining \nabout Whitewater that I can stand. To be honest with you, if this was a \nRepublican President, what has already been uncovered would be front-\npage headlines all over the country everyday.\n  The fact is, it is a mess, and it does not take any brains for people \nto realize that if you set a short time limit, people are literally not \ngoing to comply with that time limit.\n  We have had more than ample proof that that has been the case here--\nmore than ample proof. The fact of the matter is, we have had documents \ndribbling in at the last minute 2\\1/2\\ years since there has been a \nsubpoena for them. There is no excuse for it. To hear our friends on \nthe other side on this issue, it is outrageous what they are saying, \nand to act like this is not the Senate's business is also outrageous. \nThere may not be anything more important for the Senate to do than to \ndo its job in this area.\n  Now, I have to say, I hope personally that the President and the \nFirst Lady do not have any difficulties in the end, but there are a lot \nof unanswered questions. There are a lot of things that any logically \nminded person or fairminded person would have to conclude create some \ndifficulties for anybody, let alone the President and the First Lady.\n  It is one thing to stand up and defend your party and your party's \nPresident--I have done it myself, and I do not have any problem with \nthat at all; in fact, I commend my friends on the other side for doing \nit--but it is another thing to act like this is not important business \nor that we should not be doing this; that there are other things more \nimportant. Of course, there are other things that are also important, \nbut not more important, and we should be doing all of them. And I agree \nwith some of the criticism that has been given with regard to some of \nthe things that need to be done.\n  We have done a lot, but a lot has been vetoed. There is a lot tied up \nin conferences today. There is a lot that is not being done because of \nparty warfare here. I have never seen more filibusters used in my whole \n20 years in the Senate than I have seen in the last couple of years. \nAlmost everything, even inconsequential bills. Why? Because they want \nto stop any momentum of the Contract With America. That is legitimate. \nI am not going to cry about that, but I do not believe you use \nfilibusters on just about everything. To me that is wrong.\n  So I rise today to express my support for the extension of the \nSpecial Committee on Whitewater and Related Matters. As chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, I see it as my duty to defend the separation of \npowers and the constitutional prerogatives of the executive branch. \nThese are important things, and I have to say, in some ways, I resent \nsome of the comments that indicate these are not important things. I \nguess they are not important because it is a Democratic President who \nis being investigated at this time. Boy, they were sure important when \nRepublican Presidents were in office. You could not stop anything from \ngoing on, and you had both Houses of Congress controlled by Democrats \nin most of those cases.\n  We are talking about the separation of powers and the constitutional \nprerogatives of the executive branch. After giving this issue careful \nthought, however, I have decided that the special committee's \ninvestigation into Whitewater must continue. This issue transcends the \nclaims of partisanship and goes to the very constitutional authority of \nCongress to investigate wrongdoing at the highest levels of Government.\n  Congress has the constitutional obligation to see that public \nofficials have not misused their office, and we have a duty to bring \nthese matters to the public eye so that the American people can be \nconfident that their Government is operated in a fair, just, and honest \nway.\n\n  We must provide the special committee with more time in order to \ndemonstrate that delaying tactics of a White House, whether Democrat or \nRepublican, will not be permitted to frustrate a legitimate \ncongressional investigation.\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\n  For example, I was dismayed that we received more notes from the \nWhite House relevant to this investigation just last week. Now, I am \nhappy that we received these notes--more notes--that are responsive to \nthe special committee's requests. I am just concerned about the delay \nin the response.\n  Last Thursday, the special committee's resolution expired. In light \nof the fact that information keeps trickling out of the White House, I \ncan see no other way than to extend the committee's investigation until \nthe most pressing questions are answered. We cannot be expected to wrap \nup our investigation when we are still receiving important information \nfrom the White House and awaiting the availability of key Arkansas \nwitnesses currently involved in related court proceedings in that \nState.\n  The special committee must be given time to conduct a fair, careful \nand thorough investigation so that the Congress can be confident that \nall of the issues surrounding the Whitewater scandal have been fully \naired and examined. Some have requested that a time limit be put on the \nextension of the Whitewater committee. That might not be a bad idea \nunder certain circumstances. Unfortunately, however, we cannot agree to \nany time limits until the criminal trials have been completed.\n  Some have thought that the reason the Democrats have suggested 5 \nweeks is because that is how long the criminal trials will take. At \nthat point, it will be over and you cannot get some of the witnesses \nwho really have to come before the committee.\n  Many of the witnesses who will testify in the criminal trials may \nalso need to come before the Whitewater committee. We cannot agree to \nany time limit that would preclude the Whitewater committee from \ncompleting its work or we will get into the same debate 5 weeks from \nnow. If we set that time limit, I guarantee you we will be in this same \ndebate 5 weeks from now because there will be further delays, further \nobfuscation, further finding of documents at the last minute. At least \nthat has been the situation up to now.\n  As long as doubt concerning Whitewater continues, the President and \nthe First Lady will not enjoy the full trust of the American people. \nThis scandal is not just bad politics, it is bad for the future of our \nNation.\n  I believe we do need more time to further examine whether White House \nofficials attempted to interfere improperly with the Justice \nDepartment's investigation. During January 1994, Mr. Mark Gearan, then \ndirector of communications at the White House, took detailed notes of a \nseries of meetings on Whitewater with senior White House personnel. I \nam concerned that, despite White House denials, attempts were made both \nto influence the appointment of a special prosecutor or independent \ncounsel and to affect the testimony of some of the key witnesses in \nthat case.\n  I am particularly concerned that attempts were made to influence the \nappointment of an independent counsel. We have only begun efforts, the \nneeded efforts to investigate these problems.\n  Mr. Gearan's notes indicate several White House officials, including \nMr. Ickes, argued that an independent counsel should not be sought. \nNow, I can see that. But from what I am able to glean from these notes, \nI presume the reason White House officials opposed an independent \ncounsel's appointment was that an independent counsel could not be \n``controlled.'' That is what the notes say.\n  For example, in the January 5 meeting, Mr. Gearan's notes record \nBernie Nussbaum as saying that the independent counsel is ``subject to \nno control.''\n  During the January 7 meeting, Mr. Gearan's notes say, ``We cannot \naffect the scope of the prosecutor.''\n  I think a fair reading of these statements is that the high-level \nWhite House officials were concerned about the appointment of an \nindependent counsel, because they could not exercise control over his \nor her investigation. According to Mr. Gearan's notes, Mr. Ickes stated \nthat neither the President nor the staff could speak to the First Lady \nabout appointing a special counsel.\n  This suggests to me that the First Lady was making the final decision \nabout whether a special counsel should be appointed. It certainly is \nnot proper for the possible subject of an investigation to have input \nas to whether or not a special counsel should be appointed. We need \nmore time to study this very worrisome possibility.\n  Mr. Gearan's notes of January 8 indicate that Mr. Ickes said that Mr. \nKendall, the Clintons' personal lawyer, attempted to talk to Alan \nCarver who was supervising Donald McKay's investigation into Whitewater \nat the time. In fact, according to Mr. Gearan's notes, Mr. Ickes called \nMr. Carver a ``bad'' guy, a guy who would not talk to Mr. Kendall \nwithout FBI agents present.\n  Then, according to Gearan's notes:\n\n       Mr. Ickes went so far as to say, ``That guy is f. . . us \n     blue.''\n\n  Was the Department of Justice getting too close to the truth? How \ncould Mr. Carver and Mr. Mackay be a problem if they were only doing \ntheir jobs to carefully investigate Whitewater? During the same time as \nthe White House meetings, Attorney General Janet Reno was considering \nwhether to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Whitewater. At \nthat time, the independent counsel statute had lapsed and the Attorney \nGeneral chose Robert Fiske on January 20 to be her special prosecutor.\n  Unlike the independent counsel, the special prosecutor was under the \ncontrol of the Justice Department and, ultimately, the President. Less \nthan 2 weeks after these White House meetings, during which time the \nbenefit of an apathetic special counsel was discussed at length, Janet \nReno chose Robert Fiske as the special prosecutor, a man who many \nconsider had failed to investigate fully the events surrounding \nWhitewater. I read some of his depositions. They were not detailed. \nThey were not carefully done. I know Mr. Fiske. I have a high regard \nfor him as an attorney, but in this particular matter I do not think he \nwas doing the job that needed to be done.\n  We have learned that Webster Hubbell kept Whitewater documents of the \nRose Law Firm in his basement after the election. Some of these may \nhave been in Vince Foster's office when he died. We need to investigate \nwhether at the time of these White House meetings Mr. Hubbell continued \nto have the documents in his basement while serving as an Associate \nAttorney General of the United States and was perhaps privy to \ndiscussions in the Justice Department concerning whether to appoint an \nindependent counsel.\n  Another area that disturbs me is the effort to contact Ms. Beverly \nBassett Schaffer. According to evidence collected to date, Mr. Ickes \nwas deeply concerned about Ms. Schaffer's testimony. She had been the \nacting securities commissioner. He wanted a checkered story to make \nsure it would support President and Mrs. Clinton's version of the \nevents surrounding Whitewater. Mr. Ickes even said he could not send \nany prominent members of the White House to speak with her because the \npress, or others, might get wind of what was going on. Mr. Ickes said \nthat if these steps were not taken, ``We are done.''\n  I hate to read anything sinister into that statement, but an argument \ncould be made that Mr. Ickes was worried that if he could not \nsuccessfully manipulate Ms. Schaffer's testimony, serious consequences \ncould result. I am gravely concerned about any discussion by White \nHouse officials to influence the workings of the Justice Department, \nparticularly when it conducts ongoing criminal investigations into the \nWhite House.\n  Earlier, when I questioned Ms. Sherburne and Mr. Gearan about the \nnotes, I became concerned that officials at the White House were trying \nto influence the story of an important witness--Ms. Schaffer--in this \ninvestigation. Ms. Sherburne agreed the notes could be read that way. \nThat was in response to my questions--that, yes, they could be read \nthat way.\n  The possibility that White House officials might attempt to influence \nor tamper with the ongoing actions of the President and his aides \nraises questions about the integrity and fairness of the administration \nof justice in our Nation. I cannot believe that anybody in good \nconscience could oppose a continuation of this committee's \ninvestigation until we start getting answers to the many troubling \nquestions that have been raised.\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n  Putting aside these problems, there are many other unanswered \nquestions that have been raised by the committee's investigation that \nwould require further investigation. Now, this is my Whitewater top 10 \nquestions list. It is, by no means, exhaustive. It is just 10 I think \nought to be answered.\n  First: How did the First Lady's billing records from the Rose Law \nFirm mysteriously appear in the personal quarters of the White House \nlong after they had been subpoenaed?\n\n  Second: Who brought Madison Guaranty into the Rose Law Firm as a \nclient, and who had primary responsibility for that account?\n  Third: Did the First Lady attempt to benefit from her relationship \nwith her husband, then-Governor Clinton, in representing Madison \nGuaranty before Arkansas regulators, including Beverly Bassett \nSchaffer, who was the Arkansas State Securities Commissioner?\n  Fourth: Did the First Lady attempt to persuade Beverly Bassett \nSchaffer to approve a highly unusual deal that would have allowed \nMadison to stay afloat longer than it did?\n  Fifth: What was the First Lady's role in the Castle Grande deal? Did \nshe assist Madison in what the RTC concluded was a sham transaction to \nconceal Madison's true ownership interest in the problem?\n  Sixth: Have the President and the First Lady's lawyers attempted to \nimpede the investigations into Whitewater by the special prosecutor and \nthe Senate special committee?\n  Seventh: Did the First Lady, her aides, or Bernard Nussbaum prevent \nJustice Department investigators from searching Vincent Foster's office \nafter his death?\n  Eighth: Was there a effort to interfere with the investigation of \nWhitewater, as suggested by Mr. Gearan's notes?\n  Ninth: Who ordered the firing of Billy Dale in the White House travel \noffice? What was their motive? Was there some connection with \nWhitewater? Was there some connection with something that was \ninappropriate or wrong? Certainly, there appears to be, and that needs \nto be cleared up. I hope there was nothing wrong, but there appears to \nbe so.\n  Tenth: Were Rose Law Firm records purposely removed from the firm \nand/or destroyed?\n  Before these hearings began, the American public had been told there \nhad been full disclosure. We now know that this is not true.\n  Before these hearings began, the American people were told Hillary \nClinton did not work on Whitewater or Castle Grande. We now know that \nis not true. On Whitewater, she billed 53 hours, had 68 telephone \nconversations, and 33 conferences. You could go on and on. On Castle \nGrande, she billed more than any other partner in the law firm, as I \nunderstand it. I think it was 14\\1/2\\ hours. She had a number of \nconversations with Seth Ward, who was used as a straw man to circumvent \nthe law in what regulators have called a sham transaction.\n  Before these hearings began, the American public had been told that \nthere had been full disclosure. It is clear there had not been. We know \nthat is not true. It is only because of these hearings that we know \nthat.\n  These hearings have been very important, regardless of the outcome. \nIt is our constitutional responsibility to follow through and conclude \nthem in a satisfactory, fair, and decent manner.\n  Before these hearings began, as I said, the American people were told \nHillary Clinton did not work on the Whitewater and Castle Grande cases. \nWe now know that is not true. We know that. The hearings proved it.\n  Before these hearings began, we were told there was no interference \nwith the Justice Department's investigation into Vince Foster's death. \nWe now know, as a result of these hearings, that is not true.\n  You could go on and on. Given this history of deception, delay, and \nobfuscation, should the Senate take the administration's word on these \nmatters? To permit us to close the book on this scandal, the Senate \nmust approve the extension of the Whitewater committee operations. The \nAmerican people demand no less from their elected officials. The \ncounsel is pursuing the criminal aspects of this case, and it is \nimportant that the Congress fulfill its constitutional duty to conduct \noversight at the executive branch and inform the American people of its \nfindings. We have had suggestions that we ought to take 5 weeks and \nwork 8 to 10 hours a day and we will solve this problem.\n  I have to tell you that since this committee has been established, \ncommittee counsel has been working a lot more than 10 hours a day every \nday. You cannot have hearings every day because it takes time to do the \ndepositions and prepare, get documents together and go through them, \nand it takes time to put them together in a cohesive way. To prepare \nthe questions, it takes time for each Senator. These hearings have to \nbe planned and done in a reasonable, orderly, credible way.\n  I also can guarantee you that the minority's attorneys have been \nworking full time on these matters because they are serious, because \nthere are thousands of documents, because there are questions that are \nunanswered, because we have to get to the bottom of this.\n  Again, I will repeat that I like President and Mrs. Clinton. I have \nworked rather closely with the President for these last 2 years. I do \nnot think anybody in this body can deny that. I have tried to help him \nwith judges and other appointments, and on legislation, and I think he \nwould be the first to acknowledge that. I have been very friendly to \nthe First Lady. I hope there is nothing that hurts either of them here. \nBut it would hurt the Congress, the Senate, if we, once we have this \ncharge, do not follow through and bring it to a conclusion in a fair, \njust, and orderly way. We are clearly not at a conclusion now, not with \ngetting documents as late as last week, even after the commission of \nthis special committee has expired.\n  So this is important stuff, and I know that my colleagues are tired \nof it on the other side. I do not blame them. I got tired of Iran-\nContra and a number of issues that were, in many respects, worked to \ndeath.\n  This is something that until it is resolved and resolved in a fair, \njust, and reasonable way, I think you cannot count on the President and \nFirst Lady having the full trust and confidence of the American people. \nHopefully, when this is all over, they can. If they cannot, it is \nanother matter. But at least we ought to get this thing put to bed and \nput to bed right.\n  I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, you \ncannot put a 5-week delay on it. You do have to put up enough money to \nresolve these matters, to be able to investigate them fully. There are \njust countless documents, countless witnesses in this matter, and we \nhave not even gotten into the hard-core issues of this matter. That \ncannot be done until the trial is over, which is estimated to take 5 or \n6 weeks.\n  I know that my colleagues are not just simply choosing that timeframe \nso that they can avoid another set of hearings or mess up this \ninvestigation. On the other hand, I think they have to acknowledge that \n5 weeks is not enough time and that, if you do put a time limit on it, \nthere is a natural propensity on the part of those who have something \nto hide to make sure it is hidden until after it is too late to bring \nit up.\n  Frankly, I do not think we should do that. We owe it to the Senate, \nwe owe it to the Constitution, we owe it to our own conscience to do it \nin the right way. I want the hearings to be fair. I think thus far they \nhave been. I want to commend the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator D'Amato. Contrary to what many on the opposite side \nthought before these hearings began, I think he has conducted them in a \nfair and reasonable manner.\n  I also want to compliment the minority leader on the committee, \nSenator Sarbanes. He is one of the more thoughtful, intelligent people \nin this body. We came to the Senate together. I have tremendous respect \nfor him. I think he has conducted himself in the most exemplary of \nways, and I have respect and admiration for the way he has done so. I \nthink both of them have done a very good job. I think other members of \nthe committee have done a good job as well.\n  It is apparent that it takes time. It is apparent it is a painful \nexperience for all to go through, including those on the committee. It \nmeans reading thousands of documents and trying to stay\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\nup with a very convoluted set of circumstances here that are very \ndifficult for anyone. We simply have to go forward. I do not think it \nis right to delay this any longer. I think literally we should go \nforward. There should not be a filibuster on this matter.\n  In fact, of all things, I think there should be no filibuster on this \nmotion to extend the time of the committee. Truthfully, I think the \nRules Committee needs to get the resolution out and we need to vote on \nit, up or down, and let the chips fall where they may and go about \ndoing our business in the best, most ethical, reasonable, and just way \nwe possibly can.\n  In the meantime, I will be pushing to extend this committee because I \nthink it is the right thing to do. I have raised a lot of questions \nthat literally have not been answered as of this time. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota on the floor. I know he wishes to speak.\n  I want to take a couple of moments because there is one thing my \ndistinguished colleague from Utah made reference to. He talked about \nthe previous hearings and other Congresses when the Congress was \nDemocratically controlled, and I think that is an important point. I \njust want to come back to revisit the Iran-Contra hearings on which the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah served. As he will recall, at the \noutset of that, there were Democrats who wanted to extend those \nhearings into 1988, into the election year. Now, Senator Inouye and \nRepresentative Hamilton rejected that proposition and agreed, in \nresponse to a very strong representation by Senator Dole for a specific \ndate to end it, and then conducted hearings in a very intense manner in \norder to accomplish that.\n  Again, I want to make the contrast between the hearings schedule in \nIran-Contra in order to meet its cutoff date, which involved 21 \nhearings between July 7 and August 6. In other words, we had hearings \nevery weekday throughout that period from July 7 to August 6 except for \n2 days--21 out of 23 days we held hearings. Contrast that pace, that \neffort to comply with a requirement that had been passed by the Senate, \nwith what took place over the last 2 months, when this committee in \nJanuary held only 7 days of hearings--in other words, all of the other \ndays were open to hold hearings, and no hearings were held. The same \nthing happened in February, where we held only 8 days of hearings. In \nfact, this committee, over a 2-month period, without the Senate being \nin session--we had the opportunity to really meet continually--held \nonly 15 days of hearings over a 2-month period; whereas the Iran-Contra \nCommittee, to which my colleague made reference, held 21 days of \nhearings in a 23-day period.\n  I think this simply demonstrates the effort then in that Congress to \nkeep this matter out of the political election year. It stands in \nmarked contrast to what has transpired over the last 2 months.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I want to take a few minutes of \nthis debate, but offer my thoughts within a somewhat different \nframework.\n  In a recent USA-CNN Gallup Poll of big issues facing Congress--and I \nam sure others have referred to this--virtually no one suggested \nCongress should be devoting time and resources to Whitewater--67 \npercent of the people said Congress should work on approving public \neducation; 66 percent cited crime as a major concern; 64 percent said \njobs and the economy; and 63 percent worried about health care.\n  Madam President, this Senate, the majority-led Senate, has not held \neven one hearing on better jobs and wages. We have not had one hearing \non better jobs and wages. Only 3 hearings have been held on improving \npublic education, and 12 on crime control, drugs, and terrorism. Madam \nPresident, the majority party did not hold even one Senate hearing on \nwhat was an unprecedented plan to slash Medicare.\n  The reason I mention this, Madam President, is that I think there is \na disconnect between all of the time and all of the resources that have \nbeen devoted to this hearing versus what it is people are telling us in \ncafes and town meetings in our own States that they are really \nconcerned about. I do not hear people talking to me about the \nWhitewater hearings, except they wonder why they go on and on and on \nand on, and they want to know how much more will be spent on them.\n  I do hear people talking to me, not in the language of left or right, \nnot in the language of Democrats or Republicans. People say to me, \n``Senator, am I going to have a pension when I retire? I am really \nworried. I am 67 years old, and I am really worried.'' ``Will there be \nMedicare?'' Or, ``Senator, I have Medicare but I have to pay for \nprescription drug costs. I have Parkinson's disease. My father had \nParkinson's disease. I cannot afford the price of these drugs.'' Or, \n``Senator, you know the story about AT? That is my story. I worked \nfor a company for 30 years. I worked 5 days a week and more. I was \nskilled. I was middle management and a responsible wage earner. I gave \nthat company everything I had. I did a good job. I thought if you did \nthat, at age 50 or 55 you would not find yourself fired with nowhere to \ngo, just spit out of the economy.''\n  Or people in cafes say, ``Senator, this is for all of us, regardless \nof party. Senator, we have three children. They are in their twenties \nand the problem is that they are not able to obtain jobs that pay \ndecent wages with decent fringe benefits. We do not know what will \nhappen with our kids.'' Or ``Senator, I have a small business going and \nI do not know if I can continue to make a go of it.'' These are the \nissues that people are talking about--basic economic opportunity \nissues, basic bread and butter issues, basic issues about how to \nsustain their families and communities.\n  Madam President, I raise this because I wanted today to focus on \nanother one of these basic economic ``bread and butter'' issues, which \nis minimum wage. As the author of the only minimum wage legislation in \nthe last Congress, I congratulate the minority leader, Senator Daschle, \nfor his focus today on increasing the Federal minimum wage. Despite the \nincreases that went into effect in 1990 and 1991, the current minimum \nwage is not a living wage. It is a poverty wage--$4.25 an hour. Should \nwe not start talking about that on the floor of the U.S. Senate? A \nperson working 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, works for a poverty \nwage. A person making a minimum wage earns just about $170 a week, and \nthat is before taxes--income tax, Social Security tax, you name it.\n\n  Madam President, the principle that a minimum wage ought to be a \nliving wage served this Nation well for 40 years. From the enactment of \nthe first Federal minimum wage law in 1938, through the end of the \n1970's, Congress addressed this issue six times.\n  Six times bipartisan majorities, with the support of both Republican \nand Democratic Presidents, reaffirmed our Nation's commitment to a fair \nminimum wage for working people in this country. But during the 1980's \nthe real value of the minimum wage plummeted and, adjusted for \ninflation, the value of the minimum wage has fallen by nearly 50 cents \nsince 1991 and it is now 27 percent lower than in 1979, using 1995 \ndollars. To put it in another context, we need to realize that the \nminimum wage would have had to have been raised to $5.75 an hour last \nyear to have the same purchasing power it averaged in the 1970's.\n  When are we going to start talking about good education and good \njobs? I said on the floor of the Senate before, real welfare reform \nwould mean an increased minimum wage, good education, and a good job. \nIf you want to reduce poverty: Good education, and a good job. If you \nwant to reduce violence you have to focus, in addition to strong law \nenforcement, on a good education, and a good job. If you want to have a \nstable middle class, it is a good education and a good job. Do you want \nour Nation to do well economically? A good education, a good job. When \nare we going to focus on these issues, I ask my colleagues?\n  We go on and on and on and on with these hearings, and now they want \nto go on and on again. And we do not focus on the very issues about \nwhich people are coming up to us, back in our States, and saying to us, \nin as urgent and as eloquent a way as possible, ``Senators, please \nspeak to the concerns and circumstances of our lives. We are worried \nabout pensions. We are\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\nworried about health care. We are worried about jobs. We are worried \nabout being able to educate our children. We are worried about being \nable to reduce violence in our communities.'' When are we going to \nfocus on that?\n  When are we going to talk about raising the minimum wage? Madam \nPresident, 75, 80 percent of the people in the country say we must do \nthis. And contrary, Madam President, to popular misconception, the \nminimum wage is not just paid to teenagers who ``flip burgers'' in \ntheir spare time. Less than one in three minimum wage earners are \nteenagers. In fact, less than 50 percent of those who receive minimum \nwage are adults 25 years of age and over. And more important, 60 \npercent of the minimum wage earners in this country are women.\n  Madam President, we have talked about welfare reform. And, you know, \nI think it is true the best welfare reform is a job. But I think we \nought to add to that and say the best welfare reform is a job that pays \na living wage. Increasing the minimum wage will help in the welfare \nreform effort, because it is one means of making work pay.\n  I guess that the reason that I use this opportunity to talk about a \nminimum wage is that I want to point out the disconnect between all \nthese hearings, all this money we have spent on Whitewater, and a \nRepublican-led Senate that is not focusing on raising the minimum wage, \nnot focusing on living wages, not focused on what we are going to do to \nmake sure people keep their pensions, not focused on opportunity, not \nfocused on how people are going to afford education for their children \nor for themselves.\n  People work hard in this country and they deserve to earn a living \nwage for their work. It is that simple. I would appreciate it if we \nwould get some focus on this in this U.S. Senate. Pretty soon I am \ngoing to come to the floor with other Senators with an amendment so we \ncan have a vote, so people can hold us accountable. Because people want \nto know what in the world we are doing as legislators to make a \npositive difference in their lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I was on Iran-Contra Committee. I have to \nadmit it was a huge committee with a huge budget and all kinds of \nlawyers, and it had to be--I do not know how many people were on that \ncommittee, but it was both the House and the Senate. And every effort \nwas put forth. And I have to say the White House cooperated fully. \nOutside of the documents that were shredded by Oliver North and his \nsecretary, which were fully explained, there was complete cooperation. \nThere was not obfuscation. There was not withholding of documents. \nThere was not withholding of witnesses. There were not notes indicating \nthat there were these type of things going on in the White House.\n\n  We have had to fight for everything we got here. I do not think \nanybody who watches those hearings seriously would conclude other than \nthat there has been a lot of delay and a lot of obfuscation, a lot of \nfailure to comply, a lot of failure to work with the committee.\n  There has been an effort to work with the committee, too. I do not \nwant to fail to give people respect who have legitimately come forth. \nBut this committee was created just 9 months ago on May 17, 1995. The \nIran-Contra investigation lasted for more than a year.\n  The Joint Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and \nthe Nicaraguan Opposition was established on January 6, 1987. The \ncommittee conducted hearings until August 1987. The committee was \nextended twice in 1987, from August to October and then from October to \nNovember. And the committee filed its report on November 17, 1987. On \nDecember 10, 1987, the House voted to extend its operation to March 1, \n1988.\n  There is an important thing we ought to note here. The special \ncommittee is not really seeking a ``extension.'' That is, Resolution \n120 will not expire and the committee will not cease to exist on March \n1, 1987, if the new resolution is not adopted. All that the committee \nis asking for is additional funding so that the investigators and the \nattorneys can be paid.\n  By historical standards the Whitewater committee has not been an \nespecially long-lived investigatory committee. The Truman Committee, \nalso known as the Special Committee To Investigate the National Defense \nProgram, was in existence for 8 years, from 1941 to 1948. During that \ntime the committee held 432 hearings and examined 1,798 witnesses; I \nguess millions of documents.\n  The Joint Select Committee on the Conduct of the War, the Civil War \nthat is, lasted for 3\\1/2\\ years, from 1861 to 1864, and the committee \nconvened 272 times.\n  The Watergate Committee, also known as the Select Committee on \nPresidential Campaign Activity, was formed on February 7, 1973, and \nissued its final report on June 27, 1974.\n  The Senate spent 11 months investigating the so-called October \nSurprise. A subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Relations \nappointed a special counsel on October 16, 1991. The special counsel's \nreport was issued on November 19, 1992.\n  The allegations at issue in the October Surprise investigation were \ncompletely spurious--completely. Everybody acknowledges that today. Yet \nit took 11 months. I hope they are here, too, but it does not look that \nway. At least with what we have done so far, there are too many \nunanswered questions that have to be answered.\n  With respect to the central allegation on the October Surprise \nmatter, that the Reagan campaign made a deal with the Khomeini regime \nto delay the release of the hostages until after the 1980 Presidential \nelection, the special counsel concluded that:\n\n       There is not sufficient credible evidence to support this \n     allegation. The primary sources for this allegation have \n     proven wholly unreliable. Their claims regarding alleged \n     secret meetings are riddled with inconsistencies and have \n     been contradicted by irrefutable documentary evidence as well \n     as the testimony of vastly more credible witnesses.\n\n  Now, let me just say the $30 million figure is not the amount of \nmoney this committee has spent. The special committee thus far has \nspent $950,000. The special committee has been very productive. This \ncommittee has deposed 221 witnesses, had 41 hearing days and heard the \ntestimony of 121 witnesses, with a staff of around 20. That is pretty \nproductive. That does not indicate any wasting of time.\n\n  I commend both the chairman and the ranking member for having worked \nso hard along with other members of the committee. But what this \ncommittee has done compares favorably with the Iran-Contra Committee \nwhich conducted 250 depositions and 250 interviews, had 40 days of \nhearings, and heard the testimony of 28 witnesses. And they had a staff \nof 100.\n  What would be a waste of money would be to end the investigation now \njust when the investigation is starting to heat up and before the \ncommittee has received the White House e-mail and has fully \ninvestigated the withholding of the billing records.\n  Senator Byrd said the following during the Iran-Contra debate in \nresponse to a suggestion that the investigation would not be worth its \ncosts. Senator Byrd said:\n\n       May I say, if we are going to talk in terms of cost, this \n     is the 200th anniversary of the Constitution of the United \n     States, and there is no price tag on a constitutional system \n     which has been around for 200 years and which has worked very \n     well, and which will continue to work very well. Under our \n     constitutional system, there is a doctrine that we speak of \n     as checks and balances, and that is precisely what is being \n     done here. The Congress has a constitutional responsibility \n     of oversight, a constitutional responsibility of informing \n     the people, a constitutional responsibility of legislating. \n     Now before it can legislate it has to have hearings in order \n     to conduct its oversight responsibilities. I am saying this \n     for the Record. I am not telling the Senator anything he does \n     not know. But its oversight responsibilities and its \n     informing responsibilities which Woodrow Wilson said were as \n     important if not more important than legislative \n     responsibilities which are done mostly by committees. A \n     problem has developed which we will not go into but which \n     everybody has been reading about for quite some time, and it \n     is incumbent upon all of us to try to see what the facts are. \n     There is no price tag on that constitutional system. If there \n     is one thing we can do in this 200th year of the writing of \n     the Constitution it would be to reassure the faith of the \n     American people in that constitutional and political system, \n     and one way of doing it is to find out about all of these \n     things that we have been hearing. And the way to do it is to \n     go at it, put our hand at the plow and develop the facts.\n\n  Senator Byrd said that on January 6, 1987. I agree with Senator Byrd.\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\n  We are not at the end of these hearings. We are not at the end of \nthis investigation. We are still receiving documents at the last \nminute. We have not had the cooperation that I think they had in Iran-\nContra and in other hearings. And, frankly, there is no reason not to. \nWe just plain ought to finish these and carry out our constitutional \nresponsibility to the best of our ability to do so.\n  I hope that we can continue to do this. I think it is unseemly to \ndeny the committee investigators and attorneys, the necessary requisite \nfunds to be able to continue to do so, and to insist that 5 weeks is \ngoing to be adequate to do this job. I do not think that it will be; \nnot the way we have been treated, sometimes getting documents that are \n2 years old and longer.\n  I might say that the committee has been successful, too. Again, I \nwill make this point. If this was a Republican President all hell would \nbe breaking loose right now with what this committee has already \nuncovered. There is not misgiving about that. Everybody in America \nknows that. There is a double standard around here. There are some \ndramatic things that have been brought out. I think the committee has \nbeen successful. But it happens to be a Republican Senate investigation \nunder a Democratic President and First Lady.\n  Again, I will just say that I hope there is nothing wrong. I hope \nthere is no problem with either of them. I am hoping that is the case. \nBut there are a lot of things that look terrible here.\n\n  I think it is simply not true to say that nothing has been found in \nthe Whitewater investigation in general, or this committee in \nparticular. One measure of what has been found is the number of \nWhitewater related indictments and convictions that have been obtained.\n  Here are some of the numbers. Nine people have been convicted and \nseven are currently under indictment. And the indictments are still \ncoming. The two owners of the Perry County Bank were indicted just last \nweek. Further, three senior officials--Bernie Nussbaum, Roger Altman, \nand Jean Hanson were forced to resign over their handling of Whitewater \nmatters. Rightly or wrongly they had to resign.\n  Some of what the committee has learned include the following: A \nSecret Service agent saw Maggie Williams, the First Lady's chief of \nstaff, abscond with numerous files from Vincent Foster's office the \nnight of his death. She denies that. But what reason would the Secret \nService agent have to lie?\n  You might ask that question the other way. Would Maggie Williams have \nany reason not to tell the truth? I think subsequent facts kind of \nindicate otherwise.\n  For instance, there was a flurry of early morning phone calls between \nthe First Lady, Maggie Williams, her chief of staff, and Susan \nThomases, her good, smart, sharp attorney friend on July 27, 1993. That \nis the First Lady's good, sharp attorney friend.\n  That same day, on July 27, 1993, Bernie Nussbaum reneged on a deal he \nhad agreed to the day before to let career DOJ, Department of Justice \nattorneys review the documents in Vince Foster's office. Why did he do \nthat after that short flurry of phone calls that all of a sudden \nneither Susan Thomases nor Maggie Williams can really explain because \ntheir memories had suddenly become short?\n  Notes taken during the November 35, 1993 meeting between White House \nofficials and the Clinton's personal lawyers contain a reference to \n``vacuum Rose Law files.'' While at the Rose Law Firm, Mrs. Clinton had \na dozen or more conferences with Seth Ward in connection with the \nCastle Grande matter. That land deal which banking regulators have \ntermed a sham cost the taxpayers $4 million.\n  I can tell you of a case in Utah where the president of the bank \nsaved the bank. Throughout, the 100 percent stockholding owner of the \nbank bounced his checks and saved the bank, and yet he and the board of \ndirectors had to go through a tremendous and ill-advised litigation \nthat cost them well over $1 million in legal fees before the Government \nfinally admitted that the bank had broken even, and that they really \nhad saved the bank and not caused the bank the problem. This was \nnecessary in order to just get it off their backs.\n  You have a case of $4 million actually lost through what was \nconsidered a sham transaction, a fraud. And the taxpayers are stuck \nwith it.\n  Mrs. Clinton also prepared an option agreement that was intended to \nbe the way that Seth Ward would be compensated for acting as a straw \nman in this sham transaction called the Castle Grande transaction. \nMaybe none of this amounts to a smoking gun. But it is instructive to \nremember what Senator Sarbanes said in connection with the Iran-Contra \ninvestigation upon which he also sat. He said that requiring a smoking \ngun ``sets a standard of certainty that is very rare that we are going \nto reach.''\n  To make a long story short, there is a lot of smoke here. There are a \nlot of unanswered questions. There has been a lot of obfuscation. There \nhas been a lot of selective memory loss. There has been a lot of delays \nin giving documents. There has been a lot of ignoring subpoenas. And \nthere have been a lot of explanations that just do not make sense in \nlight of the notes and what is on those notes--like ``vacuum the Rose \nLaw Firm files'' being treated as though they ought to clean them up. \nLet me tell you. There is a lot here. There is a lot here, and I do not \nthink we should ignore it even though we should make every effort to be \njust and fair to everybody concerned.\n  I certainly will make every effort to do that and will insist that \neverybody else do likewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I really want to address this \nsuggestion by my colleague from Utah of the double standard and his \nreference back to Iran-Contra because, if there is any double standard \nat work, I think it is very amply demonstrated with respect to this \nproposal now to extend indefinitely this inquiry.\n  Let me go back into that Iran-Contra matter because my colleague from \nUtah says, well, if this were a Democratically controlled Congress and \na Republican administration, you would really be seeing things \ndifferently.\n  Now, in early 1987, when Congress was considering establishing a \nspecial committee on Iran-Contra, some Members advocated that it have a \nlong timeframe extending right into the 1988 election. There was a \nconflict between some Democrats both in the House and Senate who wanted \nno time limitations placed on the committee and Republican Members who \nwanted the hearings completed within a matter of a few months. It was \npointed out at the time, although it really escaped no one's attention, \nthat an investigation that spilled into 1988 would be very political \nsince that was a Presidential election year.\n  Senator Dole was very strong in his comments about the necessity to \nhave a fixed time for the conduct of that inquiry. Now, that is a \nRepublican administration, a Democratic Congress. This is the double \nstandard issue that my colleague raised. He said, and I quote him:\n\n       If we get bogged down--\n\n  This is Senator Dole--\n\n     get bogged down in finger pointing; in tearing down the \n     administration--we are just not going to be up to the \n     challenges ahead. All of us--all Americans--will be the \n     losers.\n\n  And he pressed repeatedly for an ending date for that inquiry.\n  Now, the Democratically controlled Congress responded to that \nrepresentation, and both Senator Inouye, who was selected to chair the \nspecial committee, and Congressman Hamilton, who was selected as its \nvice chair, recommended rejecting the opportunity to prolong the \nhearings and to exploit President Reagan's difficulties for political \npurposes. In fact, they set a termination date, and Senator Dole \nwelcomed that. In fact, he said:\n\n       I am heartened by what I understand to be the strong \n     commitment of both the chairman and vice chairman to avoid \n     fishing expeditions; and to keep the committee focused on the \n     real issues here.\n\n  Now, if we do not want a double standard, I ask my Republican \ncolleagues, why will they not respond now as the Democrats responded in \n1987?\n  Senator Dole went on to say:\n\n       We ought to be able to shorten that time, expedite it and \n     complete work on this matter. . .\n\n  In fact, that is what happened. As I indicated earlier, in order to \ncomplete\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\nwork, the Iran-Contra committee held 21 days of hearings in the last \nmonth in order to complete its work, a record that stands in marked \ncontrast with what this committee has done. It has, over a 2-month \nperiod here at the end, instead of moving expeditiously in order to \nfinish its work, held only 15 days of hearings. So if you want to talk \nabout a double standard, there is the double standard. The double \nstandard is the comparison between how the Democratically controlled \nCongress handled the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987 and how the \nRepublican-controlled Senate is seeking to handle the Whitewater \nhearings in 1996.\n  Now, we agreed in the resolution that was passed last May by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote that this inquiry should come to an end on \nFebruary 29. It is my very strongly held view that, if the committee \nhad intensified its hearings schedule comparable to what the Iran-\nContra committee did in 1987 or comparable to the earlier intense \neffort that this very committee pursued last summer, we could have \ncompleted our work by February 29 as provided in the resolution. We \ncould have completed it within the budget and a request for an \nindefinite extension and for another $600,000 would never have been \nnecessary.\n  Regrettably, that kind of work schedule was not followed. In effect, \nwe had a drawn-out procedure over 2 months when the committee could \nhave been very hard at work, since the Senate was not in session, and \nwe failed therefore to carry through all of the hearings that were \nbeing projected.\n  Now, I think the reason we failed is we did not intensify the hearing \nschedule, and, therefore, I think the responsibility for that rests \nupon those who were directing the hearings in terms of the schedule \nthey laid out and its lack of intensity.\n  Nevertheless, Senator Daschle, in an effort to be accommodating and \nreasonable, indicated that he was willing to extend the hearings for \nanother 5 weeks into early April in order for the committee to complete \nits matters. I regard that as a very reasonable proposal. It has not \ndrawn a response from my Republican colleagues, who continue to adhere \nand insist upon their original position, which was an indefinite \nextension of this inquiry into a Presidential election year, thereby \nvirtually guaranteeing that it is going to be a partisan political \nendeavor.\n  We worked hard to prevent it from being a partisan political endeavor \nwhen we established the committee and when we set the parameters of its \nwork, including completion of its work by February 29 of this year--in \nother words, well before we got into the election year, barely into the \nprimary period. We wanted to bring it to a close so it did not carry on \nand therefore raise in the public mind, I think, very legitimate \nquestions that this matter was being pressed for political reasons.\n  Prolonging the investigation well into a Presidential election year, \nin my judgment, cannot help but contribute to a public perception that \nthis investigation is being conducted for political purposes, and that \nis exactly what is happening. We are now getting editorials in \nnewspapers across the country that are making exactly that point. The \nGreensboro, NC, paper editorialized:\n\n       Whitewater Hearing Needs to Wind Down. A legitimate probe \n     is becoming a partisan sledgehammer. The Senate Whitewater \n     hearings, led since last July by Senator Al D'Amato, \n     Republican of New York, have served their purpose. It's time \n     to wrap this thing up before the election season.\n\n  The Sacramento Bee to the same effect, saying they now want to extend \nthe hearings indefinitely, as they say, ``or at least one presumes \nuntil after the November election.''\n  They go on to make the point that the independent counsel, Kenneth \nStarr, will continue his work on any matters that can be left to him. \nIn fact, it is only the independent counsel who can bring criminal \ncharges in this matter in any event, not something that the Senate \ncommittee can do.\n  I think that Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader, has put forward \na reasonable proposal. The committee ought to be able to conclude its \nwork with a short extension of time. I think that is the path that we \nought to follow and avoid pressing this matter throughout the election \nyear and the creating the perception that it is being conducted for \npolitical purposes.\n  In fact, Chairman D'Amato, when he went to the Rules Committee last \nyear, stated that--I quote him--``We wanted to keep it out of that \npolitical arena, and that is why we decided to come forward with the 1-\nyear request.'' That was the right approach then. It was reflected in \nthe action taken by the full Senate.\n  The majority's proposal now for another $600,000 and an open-ended \nperiod of time will project this investigation into the election \nseason, thereby inevitably diminishing public confidence in the \nimpartiality of the inquiry. That is not the right approach. The time \nsuggested by the minority leader should be more than adequate for the \nArkansas phase of this investigation. It will save public money and it \nwill complete the job. That is what we ought to be about.\n  The double standard--the double standard--is reflected in the \ndifference in the position of my Republican colleagues with respect to \nthe length of time for this inquiry and the position they took in 1987 \nwith respect to the inquiry in Iran-Contra. It is also reflected in the \nfact that in 1987, the Democratic majority in the Congress agreed--\nagreed--to the representation by our Republican colleagues that we \nought to have an end date and not prolong the matter into the political \nyear. Senator Inouye and Chairman Hamilton agreed with that \nrepresentation. That is the process that we followed.\n  My Republican colleagues refuse now to accede to the same process, \nthereby clearly applying a double standard to this matter. Madam \nPresident, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I inquire, are the managers controlling \ntime, or may I seek time in my own right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no control of time.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me preface my remarks this afternoon, if I may, by \nacknowledging the very difficult decisions that Senators on both sides \nof the aisle have to make over the coming days--I hope it is days and \nnot weeks--on this issue.\n  Let me also preface my remarks by, first of all, commending and \nthanking my colleague from Maryland who has been the ranking member of \nthe Banking Committee and has handled the lion's share of the work on \nour side of the aisle over these past many months and demonstrated, I \nthink, remarkable patience and a great sense of cooperation.\n  I do not know the exact number, but I think there has been only a \nhandful of incidents in the last sets of hearings that we have had over \nthe past year and a half where there has been any real disagreement at \nall between the majority and the minority, thanks to the leadership of \nthe Senator from Maryland, cooperating and working with, I might say, \nof course the Senator from New York, the chairman of the committee. I \nthink it is important for all our colleagues to know the tremendous \namount of work that the Senator from Maryland has done.\n  Let me also say I appreciate the job of the Senator from New York. It \nis not an easy job to be chairman of a committee, particularly one that \nhas the responsibilities as this committee has had over the past 270 \ndays to try and sort out the various differences that exist.\n  But nonetheless, it will be, to some, a difficult decision. For \nothers, I do not think it is that difficult a decision, given the \namount of time we have spent.\n  Conducting a thorough Senate investigation is hard and painstaking \nwork. Certainly I can appreciate the dilemma in which some of the \npeople in the majority find themselves, particularly when there are \nthose who come to them and say, ``Look, you must vote with us here \nregardless of what your own feelings may be on this issue. We have to \nhave your vote. Stick with us on this.''\n  We have all at one time or another, I suppose, been confronted by \nthose who\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\nhave asked us to ``stay with them,'' as the usual expression goes, even \nthough our own views may be otherwise.\n  I am especially sensitive to that difficulty, because I well remember \nmy own experience with the debate on a matter, not unlike the one \nbefore us this afternoon, involving President Bush's role in the so-\ncalled October Surprise of 1991 and 1992.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember there were allegations in late \n1991 that President Bush, when he was Ronald Reagan's running mate in \n1980, had had secret meetings with the Iranian Government to urge that \nGovernment not to release the American hostages until after the 1980 \nPresidential elections, thus avoiding the October Surprise that might \nhave lifted President Carter to reelection. There was an enormous hue \nand cry in the media about those allegations, and a little bit of \nexcitement among some of our colleagues who viewed this as an \nopportunity to do some damage to President Bush, as we went into the \n1992 elections. There were many, many articles, many, many stories, \nmany, many editorials, about those allegations.\n\n  Mr. President, I believed at the time that those allegations--after \nlooking at the charges that were made and the information that was \nbeing offered to support those conclusions, I thought that the \nconspiracy theories that were being hatched by those who wanted to \nbring those hearings to bear were motivated principally, in my view at \nthe time, by politics. For those reasons, Mr. President, I, along with \nothers opposed that investigation. And I hope that some of my \ncolleagues in the majority do so now, despite the pressures that I am \nsure members of the majority are getting today to vote for open-ended \nhearings with a $600,000 appropriation are getting--in fact, I know it \nis the case because a number of our colleagues have basically told me \nthey think this is a waste of time and money. But this sense of staying \ntogether because we have 34 weeks to go before election day, and \neverybody sort of linking arms here, let us not let this get out of \nhand here. If anyone deviates or breaks ranks, of course, this falls \napart. I know what that is like.\n  So as a result of several of us voting differently, those hearings \ndid not go forward. They ended, much to the disappointment, I might \nsay, of a number of our colleagues who felt we should have gone \nforward. The reason I raise that is not to suggest somehow that the \nSenator from Connecticut deserves any particular commendation, but to \nhope there might be some colleagues today who are faced with a similar \nfact situation and might respond similarly, when we know, frankly, that \nan additional $600,000--$400,000 in consulting fees--an open-ended \ninvestigation, at this juncture, with respect to those involved, has \ngone on too long.\n  The overwhelming majority of people in this country think, frankly, \nit has gone on too long. It has been 270 days, the longest \ncongressional investigative hearings--to the best of my knowledge--in \nthe history of the U.S. Congress. Twenty months. The Watergate hearings \nwent on 16 or 17 months; Iran-Contra, 6 or 7 months, from January 1987 \nthrough August 1987. Those I remember very, very well because the now \nmajority leader, Robert Dole, came to Senator Inouye and Chairman \nHamilton--in 1987 now, not 1988--and said, ``Even though you have the \nright under the resolution to go until October of that year, can we not \nwrap these up in August?'' I will tell you why. Because it was getting \ninvolved in election-year politics. Let us get it done early. Dan \nInouye, the Democratic Senator from Hawaii, and Lee Hamilton, a \nCongressman from Indiana, who cochaired those investigations, agreed \nwith the then-minority leader Dole to wrap up those hearings in August, \nso that they would not contaminate the political season 1 year out--not \n34 weeks out, but 1 year out.\n  As a result of that, the Iran-Contra hearings were completed by early \nAugust 1987, if my memory serves me well. I think, as our distinguished \ncolleague from Maryland pointed out, there were 21 hearings, in fact, \nconducted between early July 1987 and early August 1987, in order to \naccommodate the then-minority leader's request.\n  Now here we are 34 weeks away, after 20 months of hearings, 270 days, \n50 actual hearings, 100 witnesses, and 50,000 documents have been \nturned over. I do not know how many people have been through \ndepositions. And it is nothing, by the way, even remotely close to \nIran-Contra in allegations. I remind my colleagues to remember the days \nwhen Fawn Hall was stuffing documents into her cowboy boots, sneaking \ninto the White House, or they had shredding parties at the White House, \nthey called them, to destroy documents. Nothing like that has been \nalleged here.\n  We have documents that have turned up. I know our colleagues have \ngone on at some length--I think, entirely appropriately--to examine \nwhat happened there. None of us has suggested that we ought not to look \ninto that. But as I pointed out in the past, in every single case where \nthese documents have emerged, nothing in them contradicts anything we \nlearned earlier. Had these documents produced contradictory evidence, \nthe suspicions about showing up late, or in some other place, would \nhave much more credibility. But everything we found in the documents \nthat came later has corroborated what we knew earlier. It does not \nexcuse the fact they showed up late.\n  Again, we may never know the answers completely. But to suggest there \nis a great conspiracy here is not borne out by the facts of what was in \nthe documents once discovered.\n  So my basic plea, Mr. President, is for some Members on the other \nside to join us, and we could end this. Ending it is not to terminate \nit tomorrow, from our perspective. The Senator from Maryland and the \nminority leader have offered five more weeks of hearings, almost \n$200,000 more in money, beyond the almost $1.5 million we have spent in \nthe last 2 years just in the Senate, and one more month beyond that to \nwrite the report. So it is a proposal to go to the end of May. That is \nabout 20 weeks away from election day, not a year as we were in 1987. \nYet, we are being told flatly that that is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, you might understand the frustration we feel in all of \nthis. That is not an unreasonable request. The original agreement was \nto end in February. We had snow days. We had a disagreement over the \nexecutive privilege argument, which took some days. You can make a case \nthat you need a bit more time. But we entered into those agreements \nalmost unanimously, with maybe two or three dissenting votes. But when \nyou end up with almost all of the Senate voting overwhelmingly to \nconduct the hearings and to do the second phase and to agree on the \ntermination date, and to be told on February 29, ``Sorry, we are going \nto ask for $600,000 more and no date certain when we end them,'' \ndespite the fact that we are weeks away from election, knowing full \nwell that the mere fact that you are having these hearings would create \nthe kind of damage we would like to cause, that is why we are upset \nabout this. This is no great joy to be engaged in a lengthy debate and \ndiscussion here. We ought not to be doing this.\n  Here we are, and we hold one hearing on Medicaid all last year--one, \ndespite the proposals to cut $240 billion out of that program. I think \nwe had two or three hearings on education, and virtually no hearings on \nhealth care at all. Then we sit around and wonder why it is that Pat \nBuchanan seems to be igniting some support when he talks about jobs and \npeople and they see us suspending maybe a week on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate debating the Whitewater hearings. We had 10 or 12 days on Waco. \nI do not know how many House hearings and Senate hearings there were on \nRuby Ridge. I think there is value in looking at those issues, but this \nis going beyond the pale, going too far. It is going way too far.\n  So we are urging, Mr. President, that some Members of the majority \nstand up and join us in this compromise proposal to bring a conclusion \nto these hearings and to do so in a reasonable way, with a reasonable \namount of dollars. We are the ones on the committee who have to sit \nthere day after day. We are prepared to do it.\n  I remember in the summer of 1994, when we sat there 12, 13 hours a \nday in order to wrap this up. We went late into the night to do it. If \nit takes that, then let us do it. We are prepared to do that, to bring \nthis to closure. So we are urging colleagues to join us in this \nproposal, in this effort.\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\n  Mr. President, I went over some of the earlier points. It may be \nworth it to reiterate some of the things that happened. The Senate's \nWhitewater investigation began in 1994, with bipartisan support. \nBipartisan support was continued in May 1995 when the Senate \noverwhelmingly approved Senate Resolution 120 to create the Special \nCommittee To Investigate Whitewater.\n\n  Since 1994, there have been more than 50 hearings, as I have \nmentioned, with testimony from well over 100 witnesses, after detailed \nexamination of more than 45,000 pages of documents. By the way, Mr. \nPresident, it is worthwhile to note that here, unlike in other \ncongressional investigations, not a single witness from the White House \ncame other than voluntarily, and several witnesses came on many \noccasions.\n  Other than the argument over attorney-client privilege--which is a \nlegitimate argument--every single document received we received \nvoluntarily. There has been no effort here to fight for the release of \ndocuments at all except when there was a legitimate question about \nattorney-client privilege and executive privilege. Those only occurred \nin very rare cases. Beyond that, in every other instance, we had a \ntremendously cooperative White House on this.\n  I think the documentation is about fifty-fifty: About 10,000 or \n12,000 pages of White House representation, and 12,000 from the \nClintons' files themselves that have come into the committee's \npossession for examination. It is hard for those who pushed for this \ninvestigation to admit that nothing new has been turned up. Yet, that \nis the case.\n  I might point out in addition to the moneys we have spent of almost \n$2 million, not including what we may be spending now with this \nadditional request, the Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro law firm out on the \nwest coast has spent several millions of dollars over the last 2 years \non an independent examination for the RTC, Mr. President, of the Rose \nLaw Firm and related matters. As you know, Mr. President, they \nconcluded their report in December, but when the new billing records at \nthe White House showed up they asked for an extension to determine \nwhether or not the conclusions in December would be warranted. They did \nthat examination and basically several day ago filed their final \nconclusions after examining these new records and reached the \nconclusion in their words, ``That no more moneys ought to be spent on \nthe Whitewater investigation.'' That, in fact, in their view there was \nno proof to substantiate the Clintons' or the law firm's involvement in \nthe Madison Guaranty issues. It is a long report, about 170 pages. I do \nnot expect my colleagues to read through it but the conclusions are \nthere for people to read. Again, that has been completed.\n  Then we have the $26 million spent by the independent counsel up to \nnow. Again, as our colleague from Maryland pointed out, I believe it is \n$1 million a month; $1 million a month the independent counsel is \nconsuming. Nothing we are suggesting here limits the independent \ncounsel's investigation. In fact, they can go on in perpetuity. Some \nfear they probably will, if past practice is any indication of future \nconduct. We ought to take a look at that issue at some point, but the \nindependent counsel proceeds apparently at $1 million a month with no \nlimitations on their work.\n  So there is $30 million--more than $30 million--that has been spent \nover 270 days or so, with more hearings than in any other investigation \nin the history of Congress. Is it unreasonable that we say can we not \nwrap this up in 5 weeks--our part of this, in 5 weeks--with $200,000, \nalmost a quarter of a million dollars, in additional funding? Is that \nan unreasonable request, particularly when you compare it to the \nrequest that says we want half a million, not including consulting fees \nfor an unlimited amount of time. Which is the more reasonable request \nin light of what we have been through over these past several years?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the Senator which is the more reasonable request, \nif you put it in the context of what occurred in 1987 with respect to \nthe Iran-Contra hearings in which a Democratically controlled Congress \nwas looking into the activities of a Republican administration and had \nMembers who were pressing hard for an open-ended investigation that \nwould carry well into the 1988 political year. The minority leader of \nthe U.S. Senate, then Senator Dole, in early 1987 took a very strong \nposition against an unlimited hearing on that matter, pointing out it \nwould turn into a political exercise in an election year.\n\n  Senator Inouye, who headed up the select committee on the Senate \nside, and Chairman Hamilton, from the House side, accepted that \nargument and agreed to a limited period of time. In fact, later they \nintensified the schedule in order to finish it earlier in 1987, in \nAugust, so it would not carry over into 1988.\n  Now, if you put it in that context, I say to the Senator, is not the \nproposal made by Senator Daschle an eminently reasonable proposal? I \nheard talk on the floor today that there is a double standard. Someone \ngot up and said if this were a Republican President now and a \nDemocratic Congress, things would be different. They might well be \ndifferent. They were different in 1987 when we had a Republican \npresident and a Democratic Congress, and the Democratic Congress then \naccepted the argument that we did not want to turn it into a political \nexercise in the 1988 election, and carried through and did the \nhearings--did 21 days of hearings in 23 days in order to bring the \nmatter to an end.\n  Given that history and placing it in that context, does that not make \nthe proposal of the minority leader, Senator Daschle, seeking to \naccommodate for the extension of another 5 weeks to do the hearings, a \nfar more reasonable proposition than the proposal of Chairman D'Amato \nfor an indefinite extension of these hearings throughout the election \nyear?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague from Maryland is exactly right. \nHe answers his question with his question. In fact, it obviously is far \nmore reasonable.\n  Again, I recall the then-minority leader, Senator Dole, making the \ncase in part that it was not just the politics. He worried about the \ndamage being done to the Presidency, the office of the Presidency. So \nhe made that appeal on the basis that we ought not to damage the office \nof the Presidency. Of course, we are well aware that our colleague from \nKansas, the majority leader, is an active candidate for the office of \nthe Presidency today, and yet yesterday in the Rules Committee when the \nmatter came up as to whether or not we ought to try and put some \nlimitation on this for 5 weeks and a limited amount of money, there was \na vote.\n  Our colleague, Senator Ford of Kentucky, offered an amendment to the \nopen-ended proposal and said, ``How about 5 weeks, $185,000, with an \nadditional month to wrap it up?'' The majority leader was there for the \nvote. He voted against that and voted for the open-ended proposition. \nOnly 5 years ago he was, of course, making a strong case in the other \ndirection.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield on that point, what he said \nin the debate in early 1987, ``If we get bogged down in finger \npointing, in tearing down the President and the administration, we are \njust not going to be up to the challenges ahead, and all of us, all \nAmericans, will be the losers.'' Let me repeat that, ``and all of us, \nall Americans, will be the losers.''\n  As the Senator from Connecticut pointed out, this was an added \nargument that was made in addition to the argument which was accepted \nby the Democratic majority that the inquiry ought not to be carried \ninto the election year. There is this the very point that the Senator \nalluded to just a moment or two ago.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Maryland for raising that point. \nIt goes to the heart of what I was suggesting at the outset here, that \nin the conduct of these investigations by and large there has been an \neffort at least on the part of those of us here to seek bipartisan \naccommodation. These are not matters that necessarily ought to fall \ninto the area of partisan debate because we recognize the sensitivity \nof them. Hence, over the years, the formation of these committees and \nthe allocation of resources, with some minor exceptions, have enjoyed \nbipartisan support.\n  As the Senator from Maryland points out, it was, in fact, the \nleadership of\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\nthe majority in 1987 that agreed with the minority and accommodated \ntheir request to not allow those hearings to spill over into the fall \nof 1987, a year away from election day. Not 34 weeks away from election \nday, a year away from election day.\n\n  I might point out that resolution called for the termination of the \nIran-Contra hearings in October 1987. That was the termination date. We \nmoved it back and finished the work in August, a year and a half before \nthe election, because the request from the then-minority leader was \nthat this might contaminate the election season.\n  Yet here, after the longest investigatory hearings in the history of \nCongress, 50 hearings, 100 witnesses or more and all of the information \nwe have accumulated and collected, to a request to wrap this up 6 \nmonths--less than 5 months, less than that--before election day, the \nanswer is a resounding, ``No. Tough. We have something going here \npolitically and we are going to ride this one down the road here, even \nthough we have no information or no evidence of any wrongdoing--not \neven any wrongdoing; any unethical behavior--we are going to ride this \none out because, who knows, maybe we can get something going here.''\n  This is a very unhealthy thing for this body to be doing, very \nunhealthy. It invites a kind of deterioration in the comity that is \nessential in this body to get anything done, when we engage in this \nkind of practice.\n  Mr. President, what we are confronted with here, then, is obviously \nthe dilemma the majority is in--which should be a dilemma which is not \nthat difficult to resolve but nonetheless is a dilemma--do you push, on \nthe one hand, for an extension of the hearings that we have already \nconducted for such a lengthy period of time deep into the Presidential \ncampaign season and thus undermine, in my opinion, the integrity of the \nSenate with what will appear to be, at least it does to many, a purely \npartisan attack on the President? Or do you admit that the \ninvestigation has turned up no new evidence of illegal or unethical \nbehavior and risk the vocal wrath of those on the fringes for whom the \nvery absence of proof is in itself evidence of a coverup? A true \nHobson's choice, in many ways, for the majority leader and the \nmajority.\n  At this point, I think it is appropriate to ask if it was necessary \nfor the Senate to even reach this point. I do not believe so. One of \nthe key provisions of Senate Resolution 120 was a requirement that the \nspecial committee conclude its business by February 29, 1996. By \nadopting a date specific to terminate the special committee, the Senate \nas a body wisely--wisely--intended to eliminate the taint of partisan \npolitics from the committee's work and to avoid the kind of pressures \nthat come from outside fringe groups that demand a continuation of our \nwork in perpetuity. That is why, unanimously, we agreed on that date.\n  Now, we understand we may need a few more days. We understand that.\n  But we avoid the very problem that we have now found ourselves in by \nestablishing those kind of dates. By the way, I went back and \nresearched this. There is not a single investigation that I could find \ndone by the Senate of the United States over the past 30 years that did \nnot have a termination date in the original resolution that established \nthe committee. Wisely the Senate has done so to avoid the kind of \nproblem we get into when you have open-ended investigations with no end \nin sight. Therefore, we put that in the resolution.\n  In adopting a cutoff date well in advance of the 1996 Presidential \nelections, the Senate was following the same procedures advocated by \nthe majority leader, as pointed out by our colleague from Maryland, \nback in 1987 when he then as minority leader successfully argued for \nthe limiting of the duration of the special committee to investigate \nthe Iran-Contra affair. Of course, as this deadline approaches we find \nourselves operating in a far different political landscape than we were \nin the months following the 1994 congressional elections. The enhanced \npolitical position of the President has led some to speculate that the \nproposed extension is little more than a desperate, nakedly partisan \nattempt to smear the First Family. What is particularly interesting is \nthat as the committee moved closer and closer to the deadline which we \nestablished almost unanimously it actually slowed down the pace of the \nhearings to the point where we held only eight hearings in the entire \nmonth of February, and none in the last week of February. I remind my \ncolleagues there were no votes. The majority leader did not call up any \nvotes in the month of February. There were no interruptions. Yet, for \nthe entire month we were all around--members of the committee. We had \neight hearings over 5 weeks, and only one hearing with a single witness \nin the last week of the hearings.\n  Mr. President, I also find it interesting that last week the majority \nprovided a preliminary witness list indicating that it wanted to call \nas many as 60 to 75 people as witnesses when over a month ago, and \nbefore we heard from 15 witnesses, the chairman of the committee said \nin response to questions from myself and Senator Sarbanes of Maryland \nthat ``we have identified 60 potential witnesses.'' That was on \nFebruary 1, 1996, on page 84 of the transcripts. As I mentioned, we \nhave heard from 15 witnesses since that time, leading one to reasonably \nbelieve that we were down to calling 45 witnesses, or less at this \npoint. I say this not to place the chairman of the special committee in \nany embarrassing position but to illustrate the fact that the bar keeps \ngetting raised by the majority as to how much time they need to \ncomplete their inquiries.\n  It would be one thing, of course, if we had no precedents to rely \nupon as far as Senate investigations go. But, in fact, we have many \nprecedents, including our experience with the Iran-Contra hearings. The \ncontrast, as has been pointed out by our colleague from Maryland, could \nnot be more stark. When the Iran-Contra hearings entered its final \nmonths of existence and knew it had a lot of ground to cover, it held \n21 hearings in that 1-month period. Mr. President, that is 21 hearings \nin 1 month by Iran-Contra, compared to 8 in 1 month by the Whitewater \nCommittee. Did Senators have more stamina in 1987 than they do in 1996? \nProbably not. I do not think so. But perhaps there was a greater will \nto get the job done by the members of that committee than we have seen \nso far by the members of the Whitewater Committee.\n  The majority raises a number of issues to justify an indefinite \nextension of the special committee. But I believe, based on the facts, \nthat the alternative that we are offering to this indefinite extension \nwill provide ample time for the committee to complete whatever work \nremains. The primary reason cited by my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle for continuing these hearings indefinitely has been that the \nWhite House has failed to cooperate with the committee's investigation. \nThat is just fundamentally wrong. To buttress this contention, we are \ntold by the majority and it is pointed out by the majority, \nthe confrontation over the so-called Kennedy notes--that is the \nlawyer--and the discovery since January of documents are relevant to \nthe committee's work. The conclusion drawn by the majority is that the \nWhite House will delay providing damaging documents until just before \nthe committee's termination date and thus an open-ended extension is \nwarranted.\n\n  Mr. President, the facts do not justify such a conclusion. First and \nforemost, this administration, as I said earlier, has been more \ncooperative with the committee's investigation than any administration \nin memory. The White House has turned over 14,000 pages of White House \ndocuments, and the President and the First Lady's personal attorney \nhave turned over in excess of 10,000 to 20,000 pages of additional \ndocuments.\n  Furthermore, every administration official has been made available to \nthe committee and has testified voluntarily--every single one of them \nwithout the promise of immunity that Congress was required to give \nmembers of the previous administration during the Iran-Contra hearings.\n  Many of us in the Senate well remember the actions of the previous \ntwo administrations with respect to the Iran-Contra investigation. Who \ncan forget the time we heard about high-level national security \nofficials holding shredding parties at the White House? In fact, the \ntop two Reagan officials in White House deleted over 5,000 e-mails in \nthe hours just before they both resigned in disgrace from their \npositions;\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\n5,000 e-mails were destroyed just hours before they submitted their \nresignations. And yet we did those hearings in 6 months. Who can forget \nthe image of Fawn Hall stuffing sensitive documents into her boots so \nthey could be spirited out of the White House before investigators \ncould examine them?\n  Many of us remember the changing memory of top officials who refused \nfor 6 years to turn over documents to the independent counsel, Lawrence \nWalsh, despite repeated demands to do so. None of that has happened \nhere.\n  What have we received? We have received as a good-faith effort by the \nWhite House to comply with the innumerable and frequently overly broad \nrequests of the special committee. Perhaps there would be more \ncredibility to the allegations if the documents that have been turned \nover since January offered startling new evidence of wrongdoing, or if \nthey contradicted previous testimony. But the fact is that all of these \ndocuments--yes, even the ones we found just recently--confirm the \ninformation that has been provided to the special committee in previous \nevidence; in every single case.\n  Far from revealing the smoking gun, these documents provide \nexculpatory evidence that there was no illegal or unethical activity by \nthe President or the First Lady or administration officials. We have \nalso been told by the majority, citing the controversy over producing \nthe so-called Kennedy notes as a reason for why the committee cannot \ncomplete its work on time. The fact of the matter is that there was a \nlegitimate dispute between the committee and the White House over the \nlegitimate claims of attorney-client privilege. To simply dismiss the \nWhite House concerns on this issue is nothing more than obstructionism. \nBut as Geoffrey Hazzard, a noted professor of law, stated in a letter \nto the White House at the time of this controversy, and I quote from \nit:\n\n       Presidents of both political parties have asserted the \n     privilege. This position is, in my opinion, correct reasoning \n     from such precedents as can be applied. Accordingly, the \n     President can properly invoke the attorney-client privilege.\n\n  I am not trying to reopen the debate on this issue which ended after \nmutually satisfactory negotiations with the committee getting all the \ndocuments it had requested, but to put to rest an assertion that there \nwas no basis for the White House to be concerned with inadvertently \nwaiving the President's right to confidential communications with their \nattorneys.\n  There are some observers who believe that the entire controversy over \nthe so-called Kennedy notes was orchestrated by the majority to create \na conflict within the White House over providing documents. The reason \nfor that belief is that there has been a strong tendency on the part of \nthe committee to make document requests that are so broad as to make \ncompliance virtually impossible. There are numerous examples of this, \nnot just a few. But I particularly remember when the majority wanted to \nsubpoena--listen to this--all of the telephone records from the White \nHouse to area code 501, which just so happens to be the entire State of \nArkansas--all of the telephone records of the entire State of Arkansas. \nThat was the subpoena request. If you think I am making this up, that \nis the kind of request we were getting.\n  Senator Kerry of Massachusetts and I asked majority counsel for the \nbasis of such a broad request, and let me quote from the hearing \ntranscript.\n\n       Senator Kerry. That's the entire State of Arkansas. You \n     want calls to the entire State of Arkansas from the White \n     House for 5 months?\n       Majority counsel. I don't know what the area code 501 \n     encompasses.\n       Senator Dodd. It's the entire State. You ought to know that \n     before you put it in a subpoena.\n\n  There you have a case where here we are subpoenaing an area code and \ncounsel says, I don't know what it encompasses. We are just going to \nthrow the net out here. You wonder why we are frustrated and angry over \nhow this is proceeding.\n  Ultimately, the subpoena was narrowed, thanks to the efforts of the \nSenator from Maryland, to a legitimate framework. But that small \nexample, that one example I hope gives our colleagues a flavor of the \ndifficulty faced by the White House during these proceedings. It seems \nthat every time the majority makes a document request, it starts out so \nbroad that days or weeks of negotiations are necessary before the \nrequest can be complied with. Thus, the question might not be why the \nWhite House takes so long to comply with the document requests but, \nrather, why the majority consistently chooses to frame those requests \nin a way that ensures the maximum amount of time will elapse before \nthere can be compliance with the request. That is one of the reasons \nfor the delay.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is the Senator familiar with the request that was made \nfor all communications between anyone on the White House staff, current \nor past, and 50 named individuals over an 18-month period on any \nsubject whatsoever? Let me repeat that. That was the initial request. \nFor any communication between anyone on the current White House staff \nor past White House staff and an enumerated list of more than 50 people \nover an 18-month period on any subject whatsoever. And, of course, the \nresponse to that is that this is so broad it is just impossible to \ncomply with. And eventually, by interaction, and so forth, it was \nnarrowed down to more relevant time periods, to more relevant \nindividuals, and to more relevant subjects. And then, once that was \ndone, we were able then in a reasonable period of time to get \ncompliance from the White House. But that is another example along the \nlines of the 501 area code, which the Senator cited, of the problems we \nhave confronted.\n  Now, as the Senator indicated earlier, I generally joined with the \nmajority in the various document requests, but I refused to do it in \nthose few instances in which the requests were so broad that they \nliterally were not possible reasonably to comply with. And then, over \ntime, eventually we were able to narrow those down, put them in a \nreasonable framework and then put them forward and get compliance.\n  Now, the White House has now responded to every request that has been \nmade to them as of today with the exception of two new requests made in \nthe last couple of weeks with respect to e-mails. These were additional \ne-mail requests, beyond the ones that have previously been made. So \nthere has been an effort on their part to comply with some of the most \nbroad and sweeping and onerous requests that I think anyone could \nimagine.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate my colleague making that point. I wonder if my \ncolleague would agree that it is not unreasonable for those who watch \nthose kinds of requests to begin to question whether or not there is an \nintentional desire to provoke a delay, knowing full well that such a \nbroad request is going to have to be unacceptable, so that time is \nconsumed narrowing the request to a reasonable level so that the White \nHouse in this case can respond. I do not know how long my colleague \nactually spent in those cases to actually narrow the subpoenas down to \na reasonable level. May I inquire. Was it several days?\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly. More than that. More than that. And the \nWhite House's response to these overly broad requests is, What can we \ndo with this? We have to get more rationality into the request if we \nare to respond to it in a reasonable period of time.\n  That has been one of the problems throughout.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for that additional information which \nI had forgotten, but it is a very good point indeed. Any communication \nto, was it 18 employees? Did I hear it correctly?\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, no, it was between anyone on the White House \nstaff----\n  Mr. DODD. Anyone?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Current or past, and 50 people, named people over an \n18-month period on any subject matter whatsoever. That was the original \nrequest. That was not the request that was finally responded to because \nwe were able, by working together, to narrow the request in a way that \nwe were able to limit the number of people, the subject matter, and the \ntime period so it become manageable.\n  Mr. DODD. That is incredible.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This was the original thing we were confronted with.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I apologize. I thought it was 18. It \nwas 18\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\nmonths, every single employee, past or present, in this administration \nover an 18-month period.\n  Mr. SARBANES. On the White House staff, yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I should complete my remarks at that particular point. I \nthink that makes the case. It is a better example than almost the \nentire area code of a State.\n  Mr. President, another reason we have been given as to why the \ncommittee should be extended indefinitely--and let me emphasize this \nindefinite extension--is that we must wait until the independent \ncounsel has completed his trial of Governor Tucker, Jim McDougal and \nSusan McDougal, in Arkansas. That trial is scheduled, after several \ndelays, to begin on March 4--in fact, it is underway--and to last from \n6 to 10 weeks.\n  However, the idea of waiting for Mr. Starr's trial to end is contrary \nto the bipartisan position taken by the special committee just a few \nmonths ago. On October 2 of last year, the chairman and Senator \nSarbanes sent a letter to Mr. Starr. Let me quote from this letter, if \nI may. This is from the chairman of the Whitewater Committee and \nSenator Sarbanes, joint signatures. The letter says:\n\n       If the special committee were to continue to defer its \n     investigation and hearings, it would not be able to complete \n     its task until well into 1996.\n\n  They continued saying:\n\n       We have now determined that the special committee should \n     not delay its investigation of the remaining matters \n     specified in Senate Resolution 120. We believe that the \n     concerns expressed in your letter do not outweigh the \n     Senate's strong interest in concluding its investigation and \n     public hearings into the matter specified in Senate \n     Resolution 120 consistent with section 9 of the resolution.\n\n  Section 9 of the resolution is the provision that requires the \nspecial committee to complete its work by February 29, 1996.\n  So the committee is specifically on record, it is on record, as \nopposed to delaying its work in order to accommodate the trial going on \nin Arkansas. One cannot help but wonder what has changed other than the \npolitical situation to prompt the chairman to unilaterally change his \nmind on this fundamental issue.\n  There is one critical fact that I hope my colleagues will not lose \nsight of during the course of these debates, and that is that our \ndecision about extending the committee will not affect the \ninvestigation of the independent counsel by one iota. There are no \nlimits, none, on either the duration of Mr. Starr's investigation or \nits scope or its cost, for that matter--none whatsoever. As a matter of \nfact, the independent counsel recently requested and received \npermission to expand his inquiry to include matters from 1992 that were \nnot originally part of his mandate.\n  I hope that those Senators who might worry that ending our \ninvestigation will somehow give the Clintons a free ride will certainly \nwant to know what Mr. Starr is doing down in Little Rock with a staff \nof 30 attorneys, 100 investigators, and a cost to the taxpayers of $1 \nmillion a month on top of the $26 million he has already spent.\n  That would be a good inquiry, maybe extend these hearings. Maybe we \nought to do an investigation of how that investigation is being done--\n$26 million. You have more lawyers down there than you do focused on \norganized crime in some of our major cities. The American public might \nwant to know how their tax money is being spent with that kind of an \neffort.\n  Given the absence of any compelling factual basis to continue these \nhearings, Mr. President, the alternative that we have proposed through \nthe minority leader, Senator Daschle, I think is more generous in \nallowing the committee to complete whatever task the majority feels \nmust still be accomplished.\n  You know, Mr. President, in some ways I regret we did not do what the \nminority had done back in 1987. In retrospect, maybe we should have had \nthe minority leader, Senator Daschle, approach the majority last fall \nand ask to wrap up these hearings early, as Senator Dole did in 1987. \nRemember what I said earlier, the original termination date was October \nof 1987. Senator Dole came in the spring and said, ``Can't we get this \ndone early, get it done by August, in order to avoid the campaign \nseason of 1988? Can't you get it done in August of 1987, not in October \nwhen it gets into the campaign season?''\n  Maybe we should have approached the majority last fall and said, \n``How about getting this done earlier?'' Then maybe we might have \nfinished around February. Instead, we thought it was on the level. In \nfact, it was set at February 29 as a reasonable time, and then because \nyou may need a few extra days, we have suggested 5 more weeks, almost a \nmonth and a half more of hearings, and an additional month to file the \nreport, and almost $200,000 more to do it, not to mention the \nconsultants' fees that are going to be spent.\n  Our colleagues ought to know that I think a substantial minority or \nmaybe a majority of the Senators on this side feel this should have \nended on the 29th, and that is it. But because Senator Sarbanes and the \nmajority leader and others, myself included, made a case, look, a few \nmore days here, let us try, and there are additional witnesses we need; \nlet us try to wrap this up.\n  But I think many people here feel, as the American public does by \noverwhelming majorities--they feel this has gone on too long--$30 \nmillion dollars. It is their money we are spending on this. It is their \nmoney that is being spent on this, on this investigation that has gone \nnowhere, shown nothing, uncovered nothing. Now they want half a million \ndollars more of your money to spend on this, along with consultancy \nfees for an unlimited amount of time.\n  You wonder why the American public get sick and tired of how \nWashington pays attention to itself, is preoccupied with itself, trying \nto get $30 million to spend on hearings instead of looking into what is \nhappening to our cities or education or health care or joblessness in \nAmerica. You could not get the votes here for that. But we will spend \n$30 million over 270 days, and 50 hearings, on whether or not something \nhappened in the 1980's, 15 years ago, in Arkansas.\n  Then we wonder why there is rage in the country over how Washington \ndoes its business. Well, you get a good taste of it now in this last \nCongress. Not one hearing on Medicare. Whether you agree with the cuts \nor not, the fact that we would propose cutting $240 billion out of the \nsafety net for people's health care, and we do not even have a hearing \nto look at it and examine it.\n  Oh, but we can spend 50 hearings on this, 10 or 12 hearings on Waco, \n15 hearings on Ruby Ridge. Boy, those are important issues. That is \njust what the American public sent us here for. That is how they want \ntheir money spent. Now they want an unlimited amount of time and a half \na million more. And people say, wringing their hands, ``Why are people \nso upset with Washington?'' Well, watch this spectacle over the next \nfew days. You do not have to ask yourself the question.\n  We ought to wrap this up and get it over with. It has gone on too \nlong. The proposal by the minority leader, Senator Daschle, is a \nreasonable one--this body ought not to take 10 minutes to debate it--5 \nmore weeks, $185,000 to complete its work, and particularly as it is \ncoming down, as everyone--everyone--knows in the country.\n  It is one thing to engage in politics with your own money, but to \nengage in political activities with the taxpayers' money is insulting. \nIt angers people. It makes them angry. They are right to be angry. They \nought to be angry about this process and watch these votes when the \nvotes come up and remember how people vote on this, how quick they are \nto spend their money on this.\n  But how unwilling they are when it comes down to your health care or \nyour kid's education or your jobs. They are, ``Oh, no, we can't afford \nto do that. We've got to balance the budget, but, by God, we'll spend \nthe money on this.'' That is why people are angry in America. And I do \nnot blame them.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope in the coming days here, over the next day \nor so, that we can reach an understanding here that 5 weeks is plenty \namount of time. We can hold a lot of hearings in 5 weeks. We can wrap \nthis up and put it behind us. It is unhealthy for this institution. It \ndoes damage to this institution. It does a disservice to the American \npublic. So I urge that we come to an agreement on this and move along.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we heard a good deal of rhetoric relative to the \nprevailing attitude of the American people. My good friend from \nConnecticut has indicated that the public has had enough and that \nclearly this side of the aisle is to blame for continuing the efforts \nin the Whitewater probe.\n  I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are either not \nlistening to the American public or not reading the daily newspapers in \nthe United States. I have a list that was compiled a little while ago, \njust a very, very partial list, of the newspapers specifically \nrequesting extended hearings--the Washington Times, the Washington \nPost, New York Times, the New York Post, the Times-Picayune, the Times \nUnion. And in support of the hearings, there has been the same group of \nnewspapers. This is a very, very, very, very small list of those \nnewspapers.\n  That represents public opinion, Mr. President. That represents the \npublic's opinion in light of the overwhelming information that just \nkeeps coming out about Whitewater. So much of this information just \nseems to be trickling out of the White House, and the public wants \nanswers.\n  Let me refer specifically to what I am talking about by referring to \nthe chart behind me which clearly makes my point.\n  If one looks--I might just make a reflection on a comment that was \nmade in the book ``Men of Zeal'' by Senator Cohen and former Majority \nLeader Mitchell.\n  I quote:\n\n       The committee's deadline provided a convenient stratagem \n     for those who were determined not to cooperate.\n\n  That, of course, is a commentary on the events surrounding the Iran-\nContra hearings.\n  But let us look at the record, Mr. President. And this, Mr. \nPresident, is why these hearings must be extended. The documents simply \nkeep coming. In August of 1995, The committee requested documentation \nfrom the White House.\n  In October it was necessary to send a subpoena to the White House.\n  January 5. The Rose Law Firm billing records were produced.\n  Records discovered by Carolyn Huber in the White House personal \nresidence in August 1995.\n  January 29, 1996, and February 7. Mark Gearan's documents produced, \ndocuments ``inadvertently taken'' from the White House.\n  February 13. Michael Waldman's documents produced. Documents found \n``in the course of an office move.''\n  Well, let us move to February.\n  February 20. Harold Ickes' documents produced. Documents were \n``inadvertently overlooked'' and Mr. Ickes was under ``mistaken \nbelief'' that they had been produced earlier.\n  February 29. Special committee funding expires. And that, Mr. \nPresident, is why we are here are today.\n  But incredulously, the White House documents just keep coming. March \n1, suddenly Bruce Lindsey's documents are produced. Documents \n``inadvertently were not produced previously.\n  March 2. White House produces 166 pages of documents of various \nadministration officials, including Lisa Caputo, Neil Eggleston, Bruce \nLindsey, Bernard Nussbaum, and Dee Dee Myers.\n  March 5. Rose Law Firm documents produced. Documents were ``just \nlocated.''\n  Mr. President, look at the facts. Since the funding has expired, we \nhave received three separate groups of documentation. Why did that \noccur? Well, one can do some guessing. Perhaps there was some fear of \nthe consequences that occur from withholding evidence? And perhaps \nmemories were suddenly refreshed when those consequences became more \napparent.\n  Mr. President, do not buy for a minute the argument of the other side \nthat somehow this debate is a Republican plot, a partisan plot. Well, \nMr. President, finding answers to the many unanswered questions about \nWhitewater is not partisan politics. Let's look at what the public \nthinks, as reflected in many editorials from newspapers across the \nnation.\n  The Times Picayune:\n\n       Senate Democrats should think twice about filibustering to \n     end the Whitewater investigation committee's attempt to get \n     to the bottom of President and Mrs. Clinton's involvement in \n     Whitewater and related matters. The public would likely \n     simply add Senate Democrats to the list of participants in a \n     suspected coverup.\n\n  I read on:\n\n       But the Senate investigation has not popped up suddenly in \n     this election year, it began 20 months ago, and it's \n     sometimes snail's pace has not had to do with dragging it out \n     until the election year but instead with the White House's \n     determinedly evasive tactics.\n\n  The White House, Mr. President, not the Congress.\n\n       The White House pleads that it is cooperating, but although \n     it has provided the committee reams of requested documents, \n     it still has not provided key documents that might clear the \n     matter up, one way or the other.\n       The natural conclusion must be that the Clintons have \n     something to hide, and that if they do not want to make it \n     public, it must not support the Clintons' declarations that \n     they have done nothing illegal or unethical.\n\n  It concludes:\n\n       No matter how this might serve the Democratic campaign \n     interests, it would not serve the public interest. That \n     interest is having the facts, and only then can the public \n     draw its own conclusion.\n\n  Mr. President, the editorial that I just read, is representative of \nmany editorials across the United States. So, I ask again, is it only \nthe Senate Republicans who wish to get answers about Whitewater? It \nclearly is not. It is the opinion of editorials across the nation, and \nthese editorials reflect the attitudes and opinions of the American \npublic. Let's look at some more editorials:\n  The Washington Post, March 4, entitled ``Twenty Months and \nCounting.'' It reads as follows:\n\n       Twenty months and counting. That is the disdainful cry of \n     Senate Democrats as they rise in opposition to the request of \n     Senate Republicans for an open-ended extension of the now-\n     expired Whitewater investigation.\n       . . . The committee, for example, has been having an \n     exceedingly tough time obtaining subpoenaed documents or \n     unambiguous testimony from administration officials. Seldom \n     have so many key witnesses had no earthly idea why they did \n     what they did, wrote what they wrote, or said what they \n     said--\n\n  Or if they even remembered it at all.\n\n       . . . White House aides keep dribbling down documents--\n     suddenly and miraculously discovered--to the committee. Just \n     when we think we've seen the last of the belated releases, \n     one more turns up. The latest was Friday night, when one of \n     the President's top aides, Bruce Lindsey, produced two pages \n     of notes that he had earlier told the Whitewater committee he \n     didn't remember taking.\n\n  At issue today, as has been the case for some time, is whether the \nClinton administration has done anything to impede investigations by \nCongress or the independent counsel and whether the Clintons engaged in \nany improper activities in Arkansas while he was Governor and the First \nLady was partner in the Rose law firm. Nothing illegal on their part \nhas turned up yet. For those who are inclined to dismiss any and \neverything that falls under the label of Whitewater as just another \npolitical witch hunt, it is worth remembering that 16 people have been \nindicted by Federal grand juries as a result of the independent \ncounsel's probe and 9 have entered guilty pleas. Congress doesn't have \nthe job of sending people to jail. But factfinding is part of the \ncongressional job description. The Whitewater Committee should be \nempowered to do just that.\n  The St. Petersburg Times has another interesting editorial. And \nagain, Senate Republicans did not write these editorials, Mr. \nPresident. Newspaper editors wrote these editorials; editorials that I \nsubmit reflect the views of many Americans. Let me quote the last \nportion of an editorial in the St. Petersburg Times, dated February 29:\n\n       There are many . . . compelling reasons for continuing the \n     Senate work, including the criminal Whitewater proceedings \n     that may unearth important new facts. But the most important \n     reason is also the most democratic: Ordinary citizens need to \n     learn what all this is about, what this Whitewater talk is \n     about. While Arkansas' most powerful couple, did the \n     Clinton's trade their public trust for private gain? Since \n     going to Washington have the Clintons and their associates \n     used the power of the presidency to cover their tracks?\n\n  These are painful questions, and not just for the Clintons. Americans \ndeserve a President they can trust, someone who embraces questions \nabout integrity instead of running from them. If the answers make the \nClintons' campaign more difficult, so be it. The search for answers \ncan't stop now.\n  Let me quote the Washington Post of February 29, which is not a \nproduct of\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\nthis side of the aisle by any means. I read the last paragraph:\n\n       What the Senate does not need is a Democratic-led \n     filibuster. Having already gone bail for the Clinton White \n     House, often to an embarrassing degree, Senate Democrats \n     would do themselves and the President little good by tying up \n     the Senate with a talkathon. Better that they let the probe \n     proceed.\n\n  Again, whose idea is this, Mr. President? This is public opinion \nthroughout the Nation through the editorial writers of some leading \nnewspapers in this country.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for just a moment on these two \nPost editorials?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will yield at the conclusion of my brief statement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would it be--\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Please proceed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent that these two editorials from \nthe Washington Post, that were cited, be printed in the Record, because \none of them says:\n\n       . . . the Senate should require the committee to complete \n     its work and produce a final report by a fixed date.\n\n  And later it says:\n\n       That would argue for permitting the probe to continue \n     through April or early May.\n\n  The other says:\n\n       The Whitewater committee should be empowered to do just \n     that . . .\n\n  That is, factfinding within a reasonable time and it suggests 2 \nadditional months.\n  So both of these editorials reject the notion that we should have an \nindefinite extension of this hearing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two editorials be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 29, 1996]\n\n                        Extend, but With Limits\n\n       We noted the other day that the White House--through its \n     tardiness in producing long-sought subpoenaed documents--has \n     helped Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato make \n     his case for extending the Whitewater investigation beyond \n     today's expiration date. If one didn't know any better, one \n     might conclude that the administration's Whitewater strategy \n     was being devised not by a White House response team but by \n     the high command of the Republican National Committee.\n       However, despite the administration's many pratfalls since \n     Whitewater burst onstage, Sen D'Amato and his Republican \n     colleagues have not provided compelling evidence to support \n     the entirely openended mandate they are seeking from the \n     Senate. There are loose ends to be tied up and other \n     witnesses to be heard, as Republican Sen. Christopher Bond \n     said the other day. But dragging the proceedings out well \n     into the presidential campaign advances the GOP's political \n     agenda; it doesn't necessarily serve the end of justice or \n     the need to learn what made the Madison Guaranty Savings & \n     Loan of Arkansas go off the tracks at such enormous cost to \n     American taxpayers. The Senate should allow the committee to \n     complete the investigative phase of its inquiry; including a \n     complete examination of the Clinton's involvement with the \n     defunct Whitewater Development Corp. and their business \n     relationships with other Arkansas figures involved in \n     financial wrongdoing. But the Senate should require the \n     committee to complete its work and produce a final report by \n     a fixed date.\n       Democrats want to keep the committee on a short leash by \n     extending hearings to April 3, with a final report to follow \n     by May 10. A limited extension makes sense, but a \n     unreasonably short deadline does not. Five weeks may not be \n     enough time for the committee to do a credible job. Instead, \n     the Senate should give the committee more running room but \n     aim for ending the entire proceedings before summer, when the \n     campaign season really heats up. That would argue for \n     permitting the probe to continue through April or early May.\n       What the Senate does not need is a Democrat-led filibuster. \n     Having already gone bail for the Clinton White House, often \n     to an embarrassing degree, Senate Democrats would do \n     themselves and the president little good by tying up the \n     Senate with a talkathon. Better that they let the probe \n     proceed. Give the public some credit for knowing a witch hunt \n     and a waste of their money if and when they see one. And \n     that, of course, is the risk Sen. D'Amato and his committee \n     are taking. * * *\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 4, 1996]\n\n                       Twenty Months and Counting\n\n       That is the disdainful cry of Senate Democrats as they rise \n     in opposition to the request of Senate Republicans for an \n     open-ended extension of the now-expired Whitewater \n     investigation. After conducting more than 50 days of public \n     hearings involving 120 witnesses, taking 30,000 pages of \n     deposition testimony, collecting 45,000 pages of White House \n     documents, spending more than $1.3 million, and compiling a \n     casualty list of near financially destroyed administration \n     officials, what do Whitewater committee Chairman Alfonse \n     D'Amato and his Republican colleagues have to show for it? \n     the Democrats ask. A good question, indeed. But it's not the \n     only one to be answered in deciding whether to extend the \n     life of the committee.\n       The committee has been working for more than a year to \n     gather the facts surrounding the collapse of the federally \n     insured Madison Savings and Loan in Little Rock, the \n     involvement of Bill and Hillary Clinton in the defunct \n     Whitewater Development Corp., and the handling of documents \n     and the conduct of White House officials and Clinton \n     associates in the aftermath of Deputy White House Counsel \n     Vincent Foster's suicide. Whitewater, in the hands of \n     congressional Republicans and the independent counsel, is now \n     a much wider-ranging investigation that seeks answers to a \n     host of questions concerning Washington-based actions taken \n     after the administration was in office.\n       The committee, for example, has been having an exceeding \n     tough time obtaining subpoenaed documents or unambiguous \n     testimony from administration officials. Seldom have so many \n     key witnesses had no earthly idea why they did what they did, \n     wrote what they wrote, or said what they said--if they owned \n     that they even remembered at all.\n       Committee Republicans assert that dozens of witnesses still \n     must be examined. Some will not be available until their \n     trials end. That's the major reason Sen. D'Amato gives for a \n     lengthy open-ended extension. The next has to do with the way \n     White House aides keep dribbling documents--suddenly and \n     miraculously discovered--to the committee. Just when we think \n     we've seen the last of the belated releases, one more turns \n     up. The latest was Friday night, when one of the president's \n     top aides, Bruce Lindsay, produced two pages of notes that he \n     had earlier told the Whitewater committee he didn't remember \n     taking. See what we mean?\n       At issue today, as it had been for some time, is whether \n     the Clinton administration has done anything to impede \n     investigations by Congress or the independent counsel and \n     whether the Clintons engaged in any improper activities in \n     Arkansas while he was governor and she was a partner in the \n     Rose Law Firm. Nothing illegal on their part has turned up \n     yet. For those who are inclined to dismiss any and everything \n     that falls under the label of Whitewater as just another \n     political witch hunt, it is worth remembering that 16 people \n     have been indicted by federal grand juries as a result of the \n     independent counsel's probe and nine have entered guilty \n     pleas. Congress doesn't have the job of sending people to \n     jail. But fact-finding is part of the congressional job \n     description. The Whitewater committee should be empowered to \n     do just that, but within a reasonable time. Two additional \n     months, with a right to show cause for more time, makes \n     sense.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no objection to that. It was my intention to \ninclude each of these editorials in their entirety, though I would like \nto point out that I only made reference to one Washington Post \neditorial. What I quoted to the President is what I believe reflects \nthe difference between the two sides, the Democrats and Republicans. \nWhat is occurring today is a great deal of finger pointing, and \nunfortunately the finger pointing will likely continue throughout this \ndebate.\n  Today's debate, Mr. President, reflects a process that has been \ninitiated by one side of the aisle. One side of the aisle wishes to \nterminate the process by preventing a vote on this resolution. My \nconcern is that the process that they have initiated is based upon \nmisconstruing the facts. Let me explain what I mean.\n  I think the Senator from Connecticut had used the figure of close to \n$30 million of taxpayers' funds, suggesting that somehow this is \nconnected with the activities of our committee. Well, that is not \nfactual.\n  The Senate has spent $950,000 on the Whitewater investigation. The \ninvestigation associated with the special counsel, Ken Starr, has spent \n$23 million through 1995. The RTC spent almost $4 million. But to \nsuggest by association that the Senate Whitewater Committee is \nresponsible for this expenditure is misleading, to say the least, and \nfar from the disclosure that is appropriate in this body, where we \nspecifically identify each expenditure that is referenced.\n  The reality is that the information still keeps coming in, Mr. \nPresident. There is absolutely no denying that fact. I ask my \ncolleagues to address this issue. Is there a reasonable explanation \nrelative to why we would still get material coming in when, clearly, \nthe authority of the funding for the committee has expired? That is \nevidenced by the activity associated with material that came in on \nMarch 1, 2, and 5. We may get some more material in today, tomorrow, or \nthe next day.\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\n  Now, that is why this process has to continue. At what time in the \nfuture will it be appropriate that we make a determination that enough \nis enough? Well, obviously, that is up to the membership of this body \nand whether this body is satisfied with the work of the committee. But \nit is fair to say, Mr. President, that the American public feels that \nthis process should continue. The American public is knowledgeable \nenough to be aware that once there is a date certain, the committee \nwill face delay after delay from the White House. It's a pattern that \nhas been well established. Witnesses and document production would \nlikely be nonresponsive until shortly before the committee's next \ndeadline. If today this body sets a date certain of when the \ninvestigation would end, I believe that much of the information that \nthe committee would attempt to obtain would never be given the light of \nday.\n  Furthermore, there is a trial starting in Little Rock. The relevance \nof that trial to this committee's action has yet to be addressed, but \nit is legitimate and should be part of the ongoing consideration. We \nall know that there may be individuals in that trial that should come \nbefore our committee and give their testimony. We may have some \npenetrating questions for them. I can certainly say that those of us on \nthis side have several questions that we would like to ask, if given \nthe opportunity. We hope that opportunity will be extended. But, \nunfortunately, we do not know when that trial is going to be concluded.\n  So we could go on and on here with justifications for legitimatizing \nthis process. However, bottom-line, we have a responsibility as U.S. \nSenators of oversight; a responsibility to complete the work that was \nauthorized by 96 Senators. And to suggest that we do anything less than \nthat, or restrict ourselves to a date certain, is absolutely \nirresponsible. I think a majority of the Members of this body recognize \nthat for what it is and are prepared to support a continuation of the \ncommittee's activities, without a date certain.\n  Let us face it, it is a political year. We all know that. But we all \nhave an obligation in our conscience to address the responsibility \nassociated with our office, and that is to do the best job possible, \nrecognizing the human limitations associated with an investigation of \nthis type and the realization that each person has to vote his or her \nown conscience. Mr. President, that is an obligation and trust that has \nbeen given to us by our constituents and one we do not take lightly.\n  So we may differ on the merits relative to the political \nconsequences, but we have a job to do, and it would be absolutely \nirresponsible to suggest that we can set a time certain for that job to \ncease, especially in light of the fact that the committee has had three \nseparate submissions of subpoenaed materials that came in after \nFebruary 29, 1996--the date when this investigation was to cease.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague waiting to speak. I will yield the \nfloor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I think it is very important that we \ncontinue to fund the committee's work for a couple of pretty obvious \nreasons. For one, documents are turning up like wildflowers everywhere. \nEvery week or so, the Whitewater Committee receives a pile of \n``mistakenly overlooked documents'' from the White House.\n  Mr. President, how is it that mistakenly overlooked Whitewater files \nlabeled ``Whitewater Development Corporation,'' or that they fail to \nensure that notes they took in meetings dedicated exclusively to the \ndiscussion of Whitewater, as part of a Whitewater damage control \nresponse team, are not produced as part of the subpoena's request?\n  Mr. President, if you were going to comply with a subpoena that is \nseeking documents related to Whitewater, would you not start with a \nWhitewater response team? It is obvious that you would.\n  Mr. President, that would seem to be the minimum in terms of \ncompliance, would it not? Frankly, I am surprised that we are even \ndebating today whether to continue funding for the Special Committee To \nInvestigate Whitewater. Mr. President, it was only a little more than a \nmonth ago that the committee first learned of the existence of billing \nrecords that had been under subpoena for over 2 years. What was \nincredible about their discovery, Mr. President, was that these billing \nrecords were discovered by a White House aide in the personal residence \nof the White House, probably one of the most secure places in the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, documents do not have legs. They cannot walk. They \nhave to have somebody to carry them. The White House can argue that the \nbilling records support the First Lady's prior statements until the \ncows come home. They can argue about what the word ``significant'' \nmeans, or about what ``minimal'' means. They can rewrite Webster's if \nthey want to. But, Mr. President, that will not change the fact that \nthese records we are talking about were under subpoena for close to 2 \nyears and were not produced during that time. Regardless of motive, \nsomeone had custody of these records while they were under subpoena and \nchose not to produce them.\n  Mr. President, the mysterious appearance of these records prompted \nthe independent counsel to subpoena the First Lady to testify before \nthe grand jury. This unprecedented action by the independent counsel, I \nbelieve, underscores the seriousness and the importance of the billing \nrecords' reappearance to this committee's investigation.\n  What we do know about the billing records is this. Certainly, what we \ndo know is certainly less than what we do not know. What information \nthe committee has been able to glean thus far since the records' \ndiscovery is the following:\n  Mr. Foster's handwriting is found all over the billing records in red \nink.\n  Mr. Foster's writing appears to direct questions to the First Lady \nabout her billings of Madison Savings & Loan.\n  Mr. Foster was the last person that we know of that had possession of \nthese records after the 1992 Presidential campaign. And the records \nwere found on a table in the book room of the personal residence of the \nWhite House sometime in late July or early August.\n  Mr. President, the committee thus has a sense of who may have had the \nrecords last, but no answers to the who, what, where, and when of the \nbilling records' reappearance. We need that information. More important \nis still what remains unanswered, like, for example, how did the \nbilling records end up in the White House personal residence?\n  Where have they been for the past 2 years while they have been under \nsubpoena?\n  Were the records in Mr. Foster's office when he died? If so, who took \ncustody of these records after Mr. Foster's death?\n  Finally, and most important, who left the billing records on the \ntable in the book room of the White House residence?\n  As the New York Times so aptly noted in its February 17, 1996, \neditorial, ``Inanimate objects do not move themselves, we all know \nthat.''\n  These are serious questions, Mr. President, questions that the \ncommittee and the public deserve answers to. There is nothing partisan \nor politically motivated about trying to uncover the circumstances \nsurrounding the much belated discovery of records under subpoena for \nover 2 years. Indeed, answers to these questions, I believe, are \ncentral to the committee's investigation.\n  If Mr. Foster did, in fact, have these records in his possession as \nof his tragic death, how did they move, Mr. President, from the White \nHouse counsel's office to the personal residence? Obviously, not on \ntheir own motion. Testimony given before the committee about the Foster \noffice search and movement of files to the personal residence leads us \nto some sense of how they may, Mr. President, have made their way to \nthe book room. The committee heard testimony from a Secret Service \nofficer who swore that he saw Maggie Williams, the First Lady's chief \nof staff, carrying documents out of Mr. Foster's office the night of \nhis death. Phone records obtained by the committee, Mr. President, \nshowed a spate of early morning phone calls between Ms. Williams, the \nFirst Lady, Susan Thomases, and Bernie Nussbaum, immediately preceding \nMr. Nussbaum's decision to renege on his agreement with the Deputy \nAttorney\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\nGeneral of the United States, Mr. Heymann, on how the search of Mr. \nFoster's office would be conducted.\n  A senior White House aide testified that the day of the search, Mr. \nNussbaum, White House counsel at that time, told him of his concerns \ncoming from the First Lady--told of concerns coming from the First Lady \nand Susan Thomases--about law enforcement officials having unfettered \naccess to Mr. Foster's office.\n  Department of Justice officials have testified before the committee \nas to suspicions and concerns that began to arise after the White House \nreneged on an agreement on how Mr. Foster's office would be searched--\nsuspicion and concerns, Mr. President, that prompted the Deputy \nAttorney General of the United States at that time, Mr. Philip Heymann, \nto ask the then White House counsel, Mr. Bernie Nussbaum, ``Are you \nhiding something?'' A White House aide testified that later on in the \nday of the search of Mr. Foster's office, he assisted Ms. Williams in \ncarrying boxes of materials from Mr. Foster's office to the personal \nresidence, during which time Mrs. Williams offered the explanation that \nthe materials were personal documents that needed to be reviewed by the \nClintons.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Williams testified that documents were moved from \nMr. Foster's office to a closet on the third floor, to the personal \nresidence of the White House, where they were later reviewed and \ncollected by the Clintons' personal attorneys. This testimony, Mr. \nPresident, in conjunction with the belated discovery of the billing \nrecords and other Whitewater documents, has only fueled suspicions that \nthe White House has not been truthful about the search of Mr. Foster's \noffice after his death.\n\n  Mr. President, the many unanswered questions that remain are in truth \ndue in large part to the lack of cooperation and evasive tactics coming \nfrom the White House. While the committee has undertaken to conduct its \ninvestigation expeditiously, events like the mysterious discovery of \nthe billing records, the miraculous location of over 100 pages of notes \nfrom top White House aides and Whitewater damage control team members, \nundermine the committee's ability to conduct a timely and thorough \ninvestigation.\n  Mr. President, these documents have been under subpoena, as I said, \nfor over 2 years, and they only now, Mr. President, surface with \nexplanations that confound credibility, such as ``Sorry, mistakenly \noverlooked.'' ``Didn't know you were looking for notes of those \nWhitewater meetings.'' Or, ``I thought they were already turned over to \nthe White House counsel.''\n  Mr. President, the excuses are too little, and I believe they are too \nlate. ``No harm, no foul'' just will not work for the White House \nanymore. The committee and the independent counsel will not and cannot, \nMr. President, accept misunderstandings, miscommunications, mistakes, \nmismanagement, and general bungling as an excuse by the White House for \nnot producing documents that we are legitimately entitled to. I think \nit is time for answers, not excuses.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, the White House's lack of cooperation and \nforthcomingness, its defensive posture and its behavior in response to \nthe legitimate congressional and law enforcement inquiries has led us \nto where we are today. The White House's handling of the documents in \nMr. Foster's office after his death and its continued and persistent \npattern of obstruction and evasion perpetuate the belief they have \nsomething to hide.\n  Last summer, the committee heard testimony about the search of Mr. \nFoster's office after his death. I want to briefly read from the \ncommittee transcript testimony we heard from Deputy Attorney General \nPhilip Heymann, because I believe it clearly reveals why this committee \nand many Americans continue to believe that the White House has not \nbeen truthful about what went on in the hours following Mr. Foster's \ndeath.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire script \nbeginning on pages 41 of Mr. Heymann's testimony be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Excerpts of Testimony of Deputy Attorney General Heymann\n\n       Senator Shelby. Okay. At some point on the 21st, it was \n     determined that Roger Adams and David Margolis would be sent \n     over to the White House, as I said, to review documents \n     regarding the relevance and privilege dealing with the Foster \n     investigation, you said that are right.\n       Mr. Heymann. That's correct, Senator Shelby.\n       Senator Shelby. And the scope of this review, according to \n     your notes, would be looking for anything to do with this \n     violent death. You want to refer to your notes?\n       Mr. Heymann. Yes, I have my notes here and that's correct.\n       Senator Shelby. Is that correct?\n       Mr. Heymann. That's correct.\n       Senator Shelby. And it was--was it your understanding by \n     the end of the 21st that an agreement or understanding had \n     been reached between the Department of Justice, the Park \n     Police and the White House over how the search would be \n     conducted, the search of the deputy counsel's office?\n       Mr. Heymann. Yes, Senator Shelby, in the sense that we all \n     had agreed on how it would be done. And in what I still think \n     was a very sensible way----\n       Senator Shelby. Would you relate what you recall of how \n     the--what you agreed to or thought you had agreed to?\n       Mr. Heymann. I'd be happy to. I just wanted to make clear, \n     Senator Shelby, I didn't feel that I had a binding commitment \n     by Mr. Nussbaum or anyone else. We simply all had talked \n     about it by then and we all were on the same track, we all \n     were on the same page, we all thought it would be done in the \n     way I'm about to describe.\n       Senator Shelby. Did you think when you sent Mr. Adams and \n     Mr. Margolis over there that it would turn into an \n     adversarial relationship or something close to that?\n       Mr. Heymann. No, I did not.\n       Senator Shelby. You did not.\n       Mr. Heymann. You'd asked me to describe what the \n     understanding was, Senator Shelby.\n       Senator Shelby. Yes, sir, that's right. You go ahead.\n       Mr. Heymann. The understanding was that they would see, \n     these two senior prosecutors, not the investigators, but the \n     prosecutors would see enough of every document to be able to \n     determine whether it was relevant to the investigation or \n     not. Now, I've been handed some pages from my transcript, but \n     let's assume this is a document, it's about 30 pages long. \n     They would look at this and it says ``deposition of Philip \n     Heymann, re: Whitewater,'' and they would know that that \n     didn't seem to have anything, any likely bearing on the cause \n     of Vince Foster's death. If need be, they might have to look \n     a page or two into it. But the object was to maintain the \n     confidentiality of White House papers to the largest extent \n     possible with satisfying ourselves that we were learning of \n     every potentially relevant document.\n       If there was a relevant document, it would be set aside in \n     a separate pile. If the White House counsel's office believed \n     that it was entitled to executive privilege, and therefore \n     should not be turned over to us, we would then have to \n     resolve that: There would be a separate pile of documents; \n     some relevant and would go directly to the investigators some \n     relevant but executive privilege claims, in which case we \n     would have to resolve it perhaps with the assistants of the \n     legal counsel's office of the Justice Department.\n       Senator Shelby. Mr. Heymann, did you contemplate that this \n     would be done jointly or just done by the White House \n     counsel?\n       Mr. Heymann. I thought it was essential, Senator Shelby, \n     that it be done jointly with these two prosecutors being able \n     to satisfy themselves, and through them satisfy the \n     investigative agencies that whatever might be relevant was \n     being made available to us.\n       Senator Shelby. That it would be a bona fide investigation \n     and not a sham; is that right?\n       Mr. Heymann. Well, I don't----\n       Senator Shelby. Or be a bona fide investigation.\n       Mr. Heymann. That it would be an entirely--it would be a \n     review of documents that would be entirely credible to us, to \n     the investigators and to the American public.\n       Senator Shelby. Okay. Your notes mention, I believe, Mr. \n     Heymann, that Steve Neuwirth objected to this agreement, but \n     that Mr. Nussbaum agreed with Margolis that it was a done \n     deal; is that correct? You want to refer----\n       Mr. Heymann. That is what they reported to me when Mr. \n     Margolis and Mr. Adams returned that evening, the evening of \n     Wednesday the 21st, to the Justice Department.\n       Senator Shelby. What do your notes reflect, I was \n     paraphrasing them?\n       Mr. Heymann. It said they discussed the system that had \n     been agreed upon, I just described it to you. BN that stands \n     for Mr. Nussbaum, agreed. SN, that stands for Steve Neuwirth, \n     said no. We shouldn't do it that way. The Justice Department \n     attorneys shouldn't have direct access to the files. David \n     Margolis, the Justice Department attorney, said it's a \n     done deal and Mr. Nussbaum at that point said yes, we've \n     agreed to that.\n       Senator Shelby. Was it important to you and to the \n     Department of Justice that you represented that the documents \n     be reviewed independently, is that why it was important that \n     the Department of Justice look for relevance and privilege \n     jointly in this undertaking?\n       Mr. Heymann. Yes, Senator Shelby. Again, I did not think it \n     was necessary and do not\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\n     think it was necessary to review documents which we could \n     quickly determine had no relevance to Vince Foster's death. \n     So our attorneys would not have looked at those, that was a \n     clear part of the understanding. Or pages, yeah.\n       Senator Shelby. I didn't say. I understand that you \n     received a call from David Margolis the next morning from the \n     White House about the search; is that correct? You want to \n     refer to your notes?\n       Mr. Heymann. That's correct, Senator Shelby.\n       Senator Shelby. What was this call about?\n       Mr. Heymann. He and Roger Adams had gone over with the Park \n     Police and the FBI to do the review we planned.\n       Senator Shelby. This was pursuant to the understanding you \n     had with Mr. Nussbaum?\n       Mr. Heymann. Pursuant to the understanding of the 21st.\n       Senator Shelby. Okay.\n       Mr. Heymann. Mr. Margolis told me that Mr. Nussbaum had \n     said to me that they had changed the plan, that only the \n     White House counsel's office would see the actual documents. \n     Mr. Margolis had asked Mr. Nussbaum whether that had been \n     discussed with me and Mr. Nussbaum had said no. I told Mr. \n     Margolis at that point to put Mr. Nussbaum on the phone, and \n     I was----\n       Senator Shelby. Did he get on the phone?\n       Mr. Heymann. He got on the phone.\n       Senator Shelby. What did you say to him?\n       Mr. Heymann. I told him that this was a terrible mistake.\n       Senator Shelby. Terrible mistake. Go ahead.\n       Mr. Heymann. Well, please don't----\n       Senator Shelby. That was your words; is that right?\n       Mr. Heymann. Yeah--no, no, please don't assume that what I \n     now paraphrase would be the words I actually used. This is \n     740 days ago and it would be quite unreliable to think \n     they're the exact words. I remember very clearly sitting in \n     the Deputy Attorney General's conference room picking up the \n     phone in that very big room. I remember being very angry and \n     very adamant and saying this is a bad--this is a bad mistake, \n     this is not the right way to do it, and I don't think I'm \n     going to let Margolis and Adams stay there if you are going \n     to do it that way because they would have no useful function. \n     It would simply look like they were performing a useful \n     function, and I don't want that to happen.\n       The Chairman. You told this to the counsel?\n       Senator Shelby. You told this to Nussbaum; is that correct?\n       Mr. Heymann. I told this to Mr. Nussbaum.\n       The Chairman. But you volunteered this? In other words, it \n     did not come from Mr. Margolis or Mr. Adams? This was your \n     saying I'm not going to keep them here if this----\n       Mr. Heymann. I suspect, Senator D'Amato, that when I talked \n     to Mr. Margolis in the same phone conversation shortly before \n     I asked him to put Mr. Nussbaum on the phone he would have \n     said to me something like we have no useful role here, and it \n     would--I would have picked it up from that, and I would have \n     said I don't think I'm going to keep them there. Mr. Nussbaum \n     was, as always, entirely polite and he said--he was taken \n     back by my anger and by the idea that I might pull out the \n     Justice Department attorneys and he said I'll have to talk to \n     somebody else about this or other people about this, and I'll \n     get back to you, Phil.\n       Senator Shelby. Did he tell you who he was going to talk \n     to?\n       Mr. Heymann. He did not tell me who he was going to talk \n     to.\n       Senator Shelby. He didn't tell you or indicate it was the \n     President of the United States or the First Lady?\n       Mr. Heymann. He never indicated in any way who he was going \n     to discuss this with, nor has he ever.\n       Senator Shelby. Just the phrase I'm going to talk to \n     somebody?\n       Mr. Heymann. I'm--just the notion was I have to talk to \n     other people about this. I had obviously shaken him enough \n     that he wanted to consider whether he should come back to \n     what we had agreed to the day before on the 21st, but there \n     were other people involved that he had to talk to about that.\n       Senator Shelby. Was it your impression, Mr. Heymann, then \n     that Mr. Nussbaum would get back to you before any review of \n     the documents in the White House was conducted?\n       Mr. Heymann. He said to me specifically don't call Adams \n     and Margolis back to the Justice Department. I'll get back to \n     you.\n       Senator Shelby. Did he ever call you back?\n       Mr. Heymann. He never called me back.\n       Senator Shelby. Did you ever consent to the change in the \n     plan in how the search would be conducted, Mr. Heymann?\n       Mr. Heymann. I did not.\n       Senator Shelby. Did David Margolis or any other law \n     enforcement official have an impression of whether the \n     Department of Justice had consented to this search?\n       Mr. Heymann. Mr. Margolis was clear that the Department of \n     Justice had not consented to the changed arrangement. It \n     was--he obviously thought that he was to remain, even if it \n     was changed, because he did remain, but he knew that we had \n     not consented to the changed arrangement and did not approve \n     of it.\n       Senator Shelby. You later found out, sir, that the search \n     was conducted with Mr. Nussbaum calling the shots that night; \n     is that right?\n       Mr. Heymann. That's correct.\n       Senator Shelby. Did you talk to Mr. Nussbaum after that?\n       Mr. Heymann. I found that out at about--when Mr. Margolis \n     and Mr. Adams returned the evening of the 22nd----\n       Senator Shelby. Returned to your office?\n       Mr. Heymann. Returned to my office, I went home to an \n     apartment we were renting then and I picked up the phone and \n     I called Mr. Nussbaum and I told him that I couldn't imagine \n     why he would have treated me that way. How could he have told \n     me that he was going to call back before he made any decision \n     on how the search would be done and then not call back?\n       Senator Shelby. What did he say to that?\n       Mr. Heymann. I don't honestly remember, Senator Shelby. He \n     was, again, polite. He didn't--there was no explanation given \n     that I would remember. And I remember saying to him, Bernie, \n     are you hiding something. And he said no, Phil, I promise you \n     we're not hiding something.\n       Senator Shelby. Did you say to him--and you can refer to \n     your notes if you like--Mr. Nussbaum, you misused us? What \n     did you--if you said that, what did you mean by that? Do you \n     believe then that the White House had something to hide or \n     was worried about the investigation? What was your \n     impression?\n       Mr. Heymann. Well, when I said you misused us, or something \n     like that, I meant that he had used Justice Department \n     attorneys in a way that suggested that the Justice Department \n     was playing a significant role in reviewing documents when \n     they had come back and told me they felt like they were not \n     playing any useful role there.\n       Senator Shelby. Did you know later that the White House had \n     issued a statement that Justice--something to the effect that \n     the Justice Department was involved in the review of the \n     documents and not just observing, and then they did a \n     correction on that when someone objected, maybe it was your \n     office?\n       Mr. Heymann. The following morning it was called to my \n     attention that they had said that the Justice Department and \n     the FBI--I now know it--in the press release it said--well, \n     whatever it was, the Justice Department along with the FBI \n     and the Park Police had supervised the review of documents.\n       Senator Shelby. Was that a CBS News report?\n       Mr. Heymann. What I was shown at my deposition, Senator \n     Shelby, was, I think, a piece from the Washington Post. I \n     directed that the Department of Justice put out a correction \n     that we had not supervised, that we had simply been there as \n     observers while the investigation was carried out--while the \n     search was carried out by the White House counsel.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this was a question that this Senator \nasked Mr. Heymann when he was before the committee.\n\n       Senator Shelby. Was it your understanding by the end of the \n     21st that an agreement or understanding had been reached \n     between the Department of Justice, the Park Police and the \n     White House over how the search would be conducted, the \n     search of the deputy counsel's office?\n       Mr. Heymann. Yes, Senator Shelby, in the sense that we all \n     had agreed on how it would be done. And in what I still think \n     was a very sensible way----\n       Senator Shelby. Would you relate what you recall of how \n     the--what you agreed to or thought you had agreed to?\n       Mr. Heymann. I'd be happy to. I just wanted to make clear, \n     Senator Shelby, I didn't feel that I had a binding commitment \n     by Mr. Nussbaum or anyone else. We simply all had talked \n     about it by then and we all were on the same track, we all \n     were on the same page, we all thought it would be done in the \n     way I'm about to describe.\n       Senator Shelby. Did you think when you sent Mr. Adams and \n     Mr. Margolis over there that it would turn into an \n     adversarial relationship or something close to that?\n       Mr. Heymann. No, I did not.\n       Senator Shelby. You did not.\n       Mr. Heymann. You'd asked me to describe what the \n     understanding was, Senator Shelby.\n       Senator Shelby. Yes, sir, that's right. You go ahead.\n       Mr. Heymann. The understanding was that they would see, \n     these two senior prosecutors, not the investigators, but the \n     prosecutors would see enough of every document to be able to \n     determine whether it was relevant to the investigation or \n     not. Now, I've been handed some pages from my transcript, but \n     let's assume this is a document, it's about 30 pages long. \n     They would look at this and it says ``deposition of Philip \n     Heymann, re: Whitewater,'' and they would know that that \n     didn't seem to have anything, any likely bearing on the cause \n     of Vince Foster's death. if need be, they might have to look \n     a page or two into it. But the object was to maintain the \n     confidentiality of White House papers to the largest extent \n     possible with satisfying ourselves that we were learning of \n     every potentially relevant document.\n       If there was a relevant document, it would be set aside in \n     a separate pile. If the White House counsel's office believed \n     that it was entitled to executive privilege, and therefore \n     should not be turned over to us, we would then have to \n     resolve that? There would be a separate pile of documents; \n     some relevant and would go directly to the investigators some \n     relevant but executive privilege\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\n     claims, in which case we would have to resolve it perhaps \n     with the assistants of the legal counsel's office of the \n     Justice Department.\n       Senator Shelby. Mr. Heymann, did you contemplate that this \n     would be done jointly or just done by the White House \n     counsel?\n       Mr. Heymann. I thought it was essential, Senator Shelby, \n     that it be done jointly with these two prosecutors being able \n     to satisfy themselves, and through them satisfy the \n     investigative agencies that whatever might be relevant was \n     being made available to us.\n       Senator Shelby. That it would be a bona fide investigation \n     and not a sham; it that right?\n       Mr. Heymann. Well, I don't----\n       Senator Shelby. Or be a bona fide investigation.\n       Mr. Heymann. That it would be a entirely--it would be \n     review of documents that would be entirely credible to us, to \n     the investigators and to the American public.\n       Senator Shelby. OK. Your notes mention, I believe, Mr. \n     Heymann, that Steve Neuwirth objected to this agreement, but \n     that Mr. Nussbaum agreed with Margolis that it was a done \n     deal; is that correct? You want to refer----\n       Mr. Heymann. That is what they reported to me when Mr. \n     Margolis and Mr. Adams returned that evening, the evening of \n     Wednesday the 21st, to the Justice Department.\n       Senator Shelby. What do your notes reflect, I was \n     paraphrasing them?\n       Mr. Heymann. It said they discussed the system that had \n     been agreed upon, I just described it to you. BN that stands \n     for Mr. Nussbaum, agreed. SN, that stands for Steve Neuwirth, \n     said no. We shouldn't do it that way. The Justice Department \n     attorneys shouldn't have direct access to the files. David \n     Margolis, the Justice Department attorney, said it's a \n     done deal and Mr. Nussbaum at that point said yes, we've \n     agreed to that.\n       Senator Shelby. Was it important to you and to the \n     Department of Justice that you represented that the documents \n     be reviewed independently, is that why it was important that \n     the Department of Justice look for relevance and privilege \n     jointly in this undertaking?\n       Mr. Heymann. Yes, Senator Shelby. Again, I did not think it \n     was necessary and do not think it was necessary to review \n     documents which we could quickly determine had no relevance \n     to Vince Foster's death. So our attorneys would not have \n     looked at those, that was a clear part of the understanding. \n     Or pages, yeah.\n       Senator Shelby. I didn't say. I understand that you \n     received a call from David Margolis the next morning from the \n     White House about the search; is that correct? You want to \n     refer to your notes?\n       Mr. Heymann. That's correct, Senator Shelby.\n       Senator Shelby. What was this call about?\n       Mr. Heymann. He and Roger Adams had gone over with the Park \n     Police and the FBI to do the review we planned.\n       Senator Shelby. This was pursuant to the understanding you \n     had with Mr. Nussbaum?\n       Mr. Heymann. Pursuant to the understanding of the 21st.\n       Senator Shelby. Okay.\n       Mr. Heymann. Mr. Margolis told me that Mr. Nussbaum had \n     said to me that they had changed the plan, that only the \n     White House counsel's office would see the actual documents. \n     Mr. Margolis had asked Mr. Nussbaum whether that had been \n     discussed with me and Mr. Nussbaum had said no. I told Mr. \n     Margolis at that point to put Mr. Nussbaum on the phone, and \n     I was----\n       Senator Shelby. Did he get on the phone?\n       Mr. Heymann. He got on the phone.\n       Senator Shelby. What did you say to him?\n       Mr. Heymann. I told him that this was a terrible mistake.\n       Senator Shelby. Terrible mistake. Go ahead.\n       Mr. Heymann. Well, please don't----\n       Senator Shelby. That was your words; is that right?\n       Mr. Heymann. Yeah--no, no, please don't assume that what I \n     now paraphrase would be the words I actually used. This is \n     740 days ago and it would be quite unreliable to think \n     they're the exact words. I remember very clearly sitting in \n     the Deputy Attorney General's conference room picking up the \n     phone in that very big room. I remember being very angry and \n     very adamant and saying this is a bad--this is a bad mistake, \n     this is not the right way to do it, and I don't think I'm \n     going to let Margolis and Adams stay there if you are going \n     to do it what way because they would have no useful function. \n     It would simply look like they were performing a useful \n     function, and I don't want that to happen.\n       The Chairman. You told this to the counsel?\n       Senator Shelby. You told this to Nussbaum; is that correct?\n       Mr. Heymann. I told this to Mr. Nussbaum.\n       The Chairman. But you volunteered this? In other words, it \n     did not come from Mr. Margolis or Mr. Adams? This was your \n     saying I'm not going to keep them here if this----\n       Mr. Heymann. I suspect, Senator D'Amato, that when I talked \n     to Mr. Margolis in the same phone conversation shortly before \n     I asked him to put Mr. Nussbaum on the phone he would have \n     said to me something like we have no useful role here, and it \n     would--I would have picked it up from that, and I would have \n     said I don't think I'm going to keep them there. Mr. Nussbaum \n     was, as always, entirely polite and he said--he was taken \n     back by my anger and by the idea that I might pull out the \n     Justice Department attorneys and he said I'll have to talk to \n     somebody else about this or other people about this, and I'll \n     get back to you, Phil [meaning Phil Heymann].\n       Senator Shelby. Did he tell you who he was going to talk \n     to?\n       Mr. Heymann. He did not tell me who he was going to talk \n     to.\n       Senator Shelby. He didn't tell you or indicate it was the \n     President of the United States or the First Lady?\n       Mr. Heymann. He never indicated in any way who he was going \n     to discuss this with, nor has he ever.\n       Senator Shelby. Just the phrase I'm going to talk to \n     somebody?\n       Mr. Heymann. I'm--just the notion was I have to talk to \n     other people about this. I had obviously shaken him enough \n     that he wanted to consider whether he should come back to \n     what we had agreed to the day before on the 21st, but there \n     were other people involved that he had to talk to about that.\n       Senator Shelby. Was it your impression, Mr. Heymann, then \n     that Mr. Nussbaum would get back to you before any review of \n     the documents in the White House was conducted?\n       Mr. Heymann. He said to me specifically don't call Adams \n     and Margolis back to the Justice Department. I'll get back to \n     you.\n       Senator Shelby. Did he ever call you back?\n       Mr. Heymann. He never called me back.\n       Senator Shelby. Did you ever consent to the change in the \n     plan in how the search would be conducted, Mr. Heymann?\n       Mr. Heymann. I did not.\n\n  Just think about it a minute. This is the beginning of it shown in \nthis transcript that has been made a part of the Record here.\n  Why should we extend the Whitewater Committee? Let us look at some \nother things. The Senator from Alaska talked about some editorials from \nsome of the leading newspapers in the country and I want to expand on \nthem a little bit.\n  For example, the Washington Post editorial that I have here by my \npointer, it says, on February 25, ``Extend the Whitewater Committee.''\n\n       For an administration that professes to want a quick end to \n     the Senate Whitewater hearings before the election year gets \n     into full swing, the Clinton White House seems to be doing \n     everything in its power to keep the probe alive.\n\n  Think about it, this is the Washington Post, not a Republican \nnewspaper by any means.\n  Another editorial that I want to refer to here from the New York \nTimes entitled ``The Whitewater Paper Chase''; February 17, 1996.\n\n       The excitement of Iowa and New Hampshire has diverted \n     attention from the Senate Whitewater committee and its \n     investigation into the Rose Law Firm's migrating files. \n     Naturally this pleases the White House and its allies, who \n     hope to use [this time] . . . to let their ``so what'' \n     arguments take root.\n\n  This is the New York Times saying we should extend the investigation \nof Whitewater.\n  Another editorial, January 25, 1996, in the New York Times. Headline \nin the editorial section, ``Extend the Whitewater Committee.'' Why? \nBecause the public has a right to know. It says:\n\n       The committee and its chairman need to be mindful of the \n     appearance of political maneuvering, but recent events argue \n     strongly against too arbitrary or too early a deadline.\n\n  That is what we are talking about here.\n  Subpoenas were ignored. Perhaps the files will also show that there \nwas no coverup associated with moving and storing these files. But \ninanimate objects, as I said earlier, do not move themselves. So it is \npointless to ask Senators and the independent prosecutors to fold their \ninquiry on the basis of the facts that have emerged so far. To do so \nwould be a dereliction of our duties.\n  Mr. President, I have additional editorials that have run throughout \nthis country.\n  USA Today, January 10, 1996, ``Clintons owe answers about First \nLady's role. Newly released documents reveal troubling inconsistencies. \nThe public deserves the whole story.'' That is what this is all about.\n  Additionally, ``The Whitewater Committee,'' the Washington Times \neditorial, February 27.\n\n       There are plenty of documents the White House still has not \n     released; and there are plenty of witnesses still to be \n     questioned; there are also many witnesses whose testimony was \n     so misleading or incomplete that they need to be re-\n     questioned.\n\n  Attempts by the administration to frustrate the work of the \ncommittee, I\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\nthink, are not going to work. We need to extend the Whitewater inquiry, \npolitics notwithstanding. We need to move to the next step.\n  Mr. President, you cannot always agree with some of these papers. I \ndo not always agree with the New York Times, the Washington Post, and \nothers. But the New York Times and the Washington Post for a lot of \npeople, rightly or wrongly, are conventionally viewed as vanguards of \ngood government, and I would venture to say can hardly be characterized \nas supporters of Republican partisanship.\n  After reviewing everything that has gone on in the Whitewater \ncommittee, the mysterious disappearance of files, the finding of files \nin a mysterious way, Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in \nsupporting the continued funding of the committee to continue our \ninvestigation.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in view of the fact that my \ndistinguished colleague from Alabama was quoting the Washington Post \neditorial, I would like to include in the Record after his remarks the \nPost editorial from February--both of these editorials come after the \none he was citing--February 29 in which the Post said the ``Senate \nshould require the committee to complete its work and produce a final \nreport by a fixed date.'' I underscore ``by a fixed date.'' And then it \ngoes on to say, ``That would argue for permitting the probe to continue \nthrough April or early May.''\n  And in their other editorial of March 4, they say, ``The Whitewater \ncommittee should be empowered to do just that''--that is factfinding--\n``but within a reasonable time.'' And it goes on to say, ``Two \nadditional months'' constitutes a reasonable time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of these editorials, since they, in \nfact, make a different point than the one that was being made by my \ncolleague from Alabama, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 29, 1996]\n\n                        Extend, but With Limits\n\n       We noted the other day that the White House--through its \n     tardiness in producing long-sought subpoenaed documents--has \n     helped Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato make \n     his case for extending the Whitewater investigation beyond \n     today's expiration date. If one didn't know any better, one \n     might conclude that the administration's Whitewater strategy \n     was being devised not by a White House response team but by \n     the high command of the Republican National Committee.\n       However, despite the administration's many pratfalls since \n     Whitewater burst onstage, Sen. D'Amato and his Republican \n     colleagues have not provided compelling evidence to support \n     the entirely open-ended mandate they are seeking from the \n     Senate. There are loose ends to be tied up and other \n     witnesses to be heard, as Republican Sen. Christopher Bond \n     said the other day. But dragging the proceedings out well \n     into the presidential campaign advances the GOP's political \n     agenda; it doesn't necessarily serve the ends of justice or \n     the need to learn what made the Madison Guaranty Savings & \n     Loan of Arkansas go off the tracks at such enormous cost to \n     American taxpayers. The Senate should allow the committee to \n     complete the investigative phase of its inquiry, including a \n     complete examination of the Clintons' involvement with the \n     defunct Whitewater Development Corp. and their business \n     relationships with other Arkansas figures involved in \n     financial wrongdoing. But the Senate should require the \n     committee to complete its work and produce a final report by \n     a fixed date.\n       Democrats want to keep the committee on a short leash by \n     extending hearings to April 3, with a final report to follow \n     by May 10. A limited extension makes sense, but an \n     unreasonably short deadline does not. Five weeks may not be \n     enough time for the committee to do a credible job. Instead, \n     the Senate should give the committee more running room but \n     aim for ending the entire proceedings before summer, when the \n     campaign season really heats up. That would argue for \n     permitting the probe to continue through April or early May.\n       What the Senate does not need is a Democrat-led filibuster. \n     Having already gone bail for the Clinton White House, often \n     to an embarrassing degree. Senate Democrats would do \n     themselves and the president little good by tying up the \n     Senate with a talkathon. Better that they let the probe \n     proceed. Give the public some credit for knowing a witch hunt \n     and a waste of their money if and when they see one. And \n     that, of course, is the risk Sen. D'Amato and his committee \n     are taking. The burden is also on * * *\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 4, 1996]\n\n                       Twenty Months and Counting\n\n       That is the disdainful cry of Senate Democrats as they rise \n     in opposition to the request of Senate Republicans for an \n     open-ended extension of the now-expired Whitewater \n     investigation. After conducting more than 50 days of public \n     hearings involving 120 witnesses, taking 30,000 pages of \n     deposition testimony, collecting 45,000 pages of White House \n     documents, spending more than $1.3 million, and compiling a \n     casualty list of near financially destroyed administration \n     officials, what do Whitewater committee Chairman Alfonse \n     D'Amato and his Republican colleagues have to show for it? \n     the Democrats ask. A good question, indeed. But it's not the \n     only one to be answered in deciding whether to extend the \n     life of the committee.\n       The committee has been working for more than a year to \n     gather the facts surrounding the collapse of the federally \n     insured Madison Savings and Loan in Little Rock, the \n     involvement of Bill and Hillary Clinton in the defunct \n     Whitewater Development Corp., and the handling of documents \n     and the conduct of White House officials and Clinton \n     associates in the aftermath of Deputy White House Counsel \n     Vincent Foster's suicide. Whitewater, in the hands of \n     congressional Republicans and the independent counsel, is now \n     a much wider-ranging investigation that seeks answers to a \n     host of questions concerning Washington-based actions taken \n     after the administration was in office.\n       The committee, for example, has been having an exceedingly \n     tough time obtaining subpoenaed documents or unambiguous \n     testimony from administration officials. Seldom have so many \n     key witnesses had no earthly idea why they did what they did, \n     wrote what they wrote, or said what they said--if they owned \n     that they even remembered at all.\n       Committee Republicans assert that dozens of witnesses still \n     must be examined. Some will not be available until their \n     trials ends. That's the major reason Sen. D'Amato gives for a \n     lengthy open-ended extension. The next has to do with the way \n     White House aides keep dribbling documents--suddenly and \n     miraculously discovered--to the committee. Just when we think \n     we've seen the last of the belated releases, one more turns \n     up. The latest was Friday night, when one of the president's \n     top aides, Bruce Lindsay, produced two pages of notes that he \n     had earlier told the Whitewater committee he didn't remember \n     taking. See what we mean?\n       At issue today, as it has been for some time, is whether \n     the Clinton administration has done anything to impede \n     investigations by Congress or the independent counsel and \n     whether the Clintons engaged in any improper activities in \n     Arkansas while he was governor and she was a partner in the \n     Rose Law Firm. Nothing illegal on their part has turned up \n     yet. For those who are inclined to dismiss any and everything \n     that falls under the label of Whitewater as just another \n     political witch hunt, it is worth remembering that 16 people \n     have been indicted by federal grand juries as a result of the \n     independent counsel's probe and nine have entered guilty \n     pleas. Congress doesn't have the job of sending people to \n     jail. But fact-finding is part of the congressional job \n     description. The Whitewater committee should be empowered to \n     do just that, but within a reasonable time. Two additional \n     months, with a right to show cause for more time, makes \n     sense.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I take no backseat to any Member in this \nChamber in terms of trying to ascertain and ferret out the truth as it \nrelates to the so-called matter which has been embraced--the subject of \nWhitewater.\n  We have today spent some 277 days on this matter. We have heard from \nmore than 100 witnesses. We have collected more than 45,000 pages of \ndocuments. That is an enormous expenditure of time and effort. Mr. \nStarr, the special counsel, has spent some $25 million to date to \nengage 30 attorneys and 100 FBI agents working in concert with them.\n  If we are truly interested in getting at the truth, and ascertaining \nif in fact there is any wrongdoing arising out of these matters, I \nbelieve that we have vested Mr. Starr with the authority and the \nresources to be complete and exhaustive in his review of all facts \ncalled to his attention.\n  I happen to have had experience with Mr. Starr in a former capacity \nas chairman of the Ethics Committee. Mr. Starr served as a special \nmaster reviewing matters that were contained in a diary and to first \nreview that information to determine whether or not it was subject to \nan agreed upon exception which the committee had established and, if \nnot, that information should be available to us.\n  My personal observation of Mr. Starr is that he is competent, he is \naggressive, he is tough, and he is energetic. There is no reason to \nbelieve that Mr. Starr, with the resources made available to him, will \nnot ferret out any\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\nwrongdoing if in fact such wrongdoing has occurred.\n  I think it is important to remember that the premise for establishing \nthe Office of Special Counsel was to take these kinds of circumstances \nout of the realm of partisanship on the floor of the U.S. Senate, vest \nspecial independent counsel with the authority to conduct the \ninvestigation, and then let the chips fall where they may. If indeed \nthere is evidence of wrongdoing, that should be vigorously presented \nand prosecuted, and those who are guilty should be sentenced \naccordingly.\n  I must say, having served on this Banking Committee for my 8th year, \nthat it has been the history of the Banking Committee to be bipartisan \nin its approach. There are some committees that by reputation in the \nCongress are extraordinarily confrontational and partisan, that there \nis constant bickering, and that they really have evolved into partisan \ndebating societies. That has not been the history of the Banking \nCommittee. Sure, we have had our differences, and there have been \nintense discussions and debate. But we have not, by and large, broken \ninto partisan bickering and confrontation.\n  Let me say that if you go back to the end of last year, Mr. Starr \nrequested of the committee that it hold action in abeyance until after \nhe could have proceeded further with respect to his investigation and \nprosecution of these matters. That letter came to us, a letter dated \nSeptember 27. That was carefully considered by our distinguished \nchairman and our able ranking member, and I believe in the spirit of \nbipartisanship which has historically characterized the operation and \nfunction of the Banking Committee that the chairman and the ranking \nmember concluded that they would not do so; that, indeed, they felt \nthat it was in the best interest of the Senate to proceed.\n  I invite my colleagues' attention to a particular paragraph on page \n2, which concludes, and I read it:\n\n       For these reasons we believe that the concerns expressed in \n     your letter do not outweigh the Senate's strong interest in \n     concluding its investigation and public hearings into the \n     matters specified in Senate Resolution 120.\n\n  So at the very outset last fall, there was a delinking, if you will, \nin terms of the Senate's actions with respect to the Whitewater inquiry \nand the actions undertaken by the special counsel, or prosecutor. That \nwas done in a spirit of bipartisanship.\n  Let me say that I believe the premise of that letter, which is dated \nOctober 2--I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record--that \npremise is as valid today as it was last October.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n           Affairs,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 1995.\n     Kenneth W. Starr, Esq.,\n     Independent Counsel, Office of the Independent Counsel, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Starr: We have reviewed your September 27, 1995 \n     letter advising us of your belief that, at this time, your \n     office's investigation would be hindered or impeded by the \n     Special Committee's inquiry into the matters specified in \n     Sections 1(b)(3) (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) and (G) of Senate \n     Resolution 120 (104th Congress). You have raised no specific \n     concerns respecting the Special Committee's investigation of \n     the other seven matters specified in the Resolution, \n     including all of those contained in Section 1(b)(2), although \n     in our meeting on September 19, 1995 you did indicate \n     concerns about the Committee's investigation of the substance \n     of the RTC's criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty \n     Savings and Loan Association.\n       The Senate has consistently sought to coordinate its \n     investigation of Whitewater and related matters with the \n     Office of the Independent Counsel. Last year, in Senate \n     Resolution 229 (103rd Congress), the Senate refrained from \n     authorizing the Banking Committee to investigate a great \n     majority of such matters. Moreover, at the request of then-\n     Special Counsel Robert Fiske, the Banking Committee postponed \n     in July 1994 its authorized investigation of the handling of \n     documents in the office of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent \n     Foster following his death.\n       Senate Resolution 120 encourages the Special Committee, to \n     the extent practicable, to coordinate its activities with the \n     investigation of the Independent Counsel. As a result, over \n     the past four months, the Special Committee has delayed its \n     investigation into the vast bulk of the matter specified in \n     Section 1(b) of Senate Resolution 120. We held public \n     hearings this past summer into the handling of documents in \n     Mr. Foster's office following his death only after you \n     indicated that your investigation would not be hindered or \n     impeded by such hearings.\n       The Senate has directed the Special Committee to make every \n     reasonable effort to complete its investigation and public \n     hearings by February 1, 1996. (S.R. 120 Sec. 9(a)(a)(1)). \n     Your letter of September 27th asks the Special Committee to \n     forebear, until some unspecified time, any investigation and \n     public hearings into the bulk of the matters specified in \n     Senate Resolution 120.\n       Your staff has indicated that the trial in United States v. \n     James B. McDougal, et al. is not likely to commence until at \n     least early 1996 and is expected to last at least two months. \n     Our staffs have discussed the possibility that this trial \n     could be delayed even further by pretrial motions and by \n     possible interlocutory appeals, depending on certain pretrial \n     rulings. Under these circumstances, if the Special Committee \n     were to continue to defer its investigation and hearings, it \n     would not be able to complete its task until well into 1996.\n       Over the past month, we have instructed the Special \n     Committee's counsel to work diligently with your staff to \n     find a solution that appropriately balances the prosecutorial \n     concerns expressed in your September 27th letter and the \n     Senate's constitutional oversight responsibilities. We have \n     now determined that the Special Committee should not delay \n     its investigation of the remaining matters specified in \n     Senate Resolution 120.\n       The Senate has determined, by a vote of 96-to-3, that a \n     full investigation of the matters raised in Senate Resolution \n     120 should be conducted. The Senate has the well established \n     power under our Constitution to inquire into and to publicize \n     the actions of agencies of the Government, including the \n     Department of Justice. At the same time, our inquiry must \n     seek to vindicate, as promptly as practicable, the \n     reputations of any persons who have been unfairly accused of \n     improper conduct with regard to Whitewater and related \n     matters.\n       We understand that courts have repeatedly rejected claims \n     that the publicity resulting from congressional hearings \n     prejudiced criminal defendants. Fair and impartial juries \n     were selected in the Watergate and Iran-Contra trials \n     following widely publicized congressional hearings. Even \n     where pretrial publicity resulting from congressional \n     hearings has been found to interfere with the selection of a \n     fair and impartial jury, the sole remedy applied by courts \n     has been to grant a continuance of the trial.\n       For these reasons, we believe that the concerns expressed \n     in your letter do not outweigh the Senate's strong interest \n     in concluding its investigation and public hearings into the \n     matters specified in Senate Resolution 120 consistent with \n     Section 9 of the Resolution. Accordingly, we have determined \n     that the Special Committee will begin its next round of \n     public hearings in late October 1995. This round of hearings \n     will focus primarily on the matters specified in Section \n     1(b)(2) of Senate Resolution 120. Through the remainder of \n     this year, the Special Committee will investigate the \n     remaining matters specified in Senate Resolution 120 with the \n     intention of holding public hearings thereon beginning in \n     January 1996.\n       Having determined that the Senate must now move forward, \n     the Special Committee will, of course, continue to make every \n     effort to coordinate, where practicable, its activities with \n     those of your investigation. The Special Committee has \n     provided your staff with the preliminary list of witnesses \n     that the Committee intends to depose. We stand ready to take \n     into account, consistent with the objectives set forth above, \n     your views with regard to the timing of such private \n     depositions and the public testimony of particular witnesses.\n       The Special Committee does not intend to seek the testimony \n     of any defendant in a pending action brought by your office, \n     nor will it seek to expand upon any of the grants of immunity \n     provided to persons by your office or its predecessors. \n     Indeed, Senate Resolution 120 expressly provides that the \n     Special Committee may not immunize a witness if the \n     Independent Counsel informs the Committee in writing that \n     immunizing the witness would interfere with the Independent \n     Counsel's ability ``successfully to prosecute criminal \n     violations.'' (Sec. 5(b)(6).)\n       As you know, the Special Committee has solicited the views \n     of your office prior to making requests for documents. We \n     will continue to take into account, where practicable, your \n     views with regard to the public disclosure of particular \n     documents.\n       In sum, it is our considered judgment that the time has \n     come for the Senate to commence its investigation and public \n     hearings into the remaining matters of inquiry specified in \n     Senate Resolution 120. We pledge to do so in a manner that, \n     to the greatest extent practicable, is sensitive to the \n     concerns expressed in your September 27th letter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Paul S. Sarbanes,\n       Ranking Member.\n     Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n       Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am not unmindful, nor is anybody in this \nChamber, nor anyone in America, that we are in the heat of a great \nPresidential debate. That is as it should be. That is a quadrennial \nexperience in America. But we ought not to allow that Presidential \ndebate to divert the\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\nfocus of our own energies on the Banking Committee and on every other \ncommittee in the Congress in which we have very serious public business \nto undertake.\n  I must say that the proposal that has been advanced--that we extend \nthese hearings in the Senate not to a time certain but until after the \nso-called McDougal trial is concluded--in my judgment is nothing more \nthan an open-ended extension which I regret to say smacks of \npartisanship seeking some advantage, seeking to embarrass the \nPresident, seeking to develop headlines, and not in the advancement of \nour effort to ascertain the truth--that is going to occur through the \naggressive investigation of Mr. Starr--but to seek some political gain \nat the President's expense.\n  First of all, we do not know when that trial might be concluded. This \nis a trial of extraordinary complexity. At a bare minimum, it would \ntake several months for this trial to be concluded. Moreover, it is not \nwithout precedent in cases like this that there could be further \nunanticipated delays in which this body, the Senate of the United \nStates, would have no ability to control or influence, nor should we.\n  So we have no idea when this matter will be concluded based upon the \nuncertainties that a very complicated trial, as this has every \nexpectation of being, would conclude.\n  Let us assume for the sake of argument that, indeed, a conviction \nwere secured against all of the defendants. I do not believe that \nanybody in this Chamber would challenge the proposition that there will \nbe an appeal taken during the course of the aftermath of that \nconviction or convictions. As a result, those defendants would \ncertainly not be available to the Senate committee because it is clear \nin every circuit in the country that the privilege which exists with \nrespect to each of those defendants is not waived, nor is it \nextinguished in any form because it is entirely possible that an \nappellate court could reverse those convictions, in which case, if \nthere was a subsequent trial, the defendants ought not to be \ndisadvantaged by being compelled to disclose testimony which \nsubsequently could be used against them. So that is very clear.\n  Let us assume for the sake of argument that the trial concludes and \nthe defendants are found innocent. Does that extinguish the privilege? \nWould that constitute some kind of a waiver? Look at the experience \nthat the McDougals themselves had. They were prosecuted and \nsubsequently acquitted. They are now subject to trial once again. They \nargued that they were precluded under the double jeopardy provisions of \nthe Constitution from being tried again, and they lost in that \nargument.\n  No one is arguing that the jurisdiction of the special prosecutor and \nthe jurisdiction of the Senate Whitewater Committee is concurrent in \nall respects. So very clearly as a result of those circumstances the \ndefendants, if they were acquitted, would not have lost their right to \nassert the privilege, and their testimony would not necessarily be \navailable to this committee.\n  Although it has a superficial appeal--well, let us wait until after \nthe trial and then we will hear from the various defendants--in point \nof fact, that is clever but simply an open-ended prospect in which \nthere may be no definitive conclusion by reason of the two alternatives \nI posit here--either a conviction, in which case they are certainly not \ngoing to be forthcoming in their testimony, or in the event of an \nacquittal by reason of the prior experience they have had there could \nbe some other ancillary prosecution that could be commenced.\n  So I think that the premise upon which this extension is sought is \nfundamentally flawed--that is, namely, this testimony would be \navailable to us at such time as the trial would be concluded, whenever \nthat might be, for whatever period of time, which could be for an \nextended period of weeks or even months, or, even assuming it is \nconcluded either by reason of a determination of guilt or acquittal, \nthat in either of those two circumstances the testimony might be \navailable to us.\n\n  I respectfully submit that a careful analysis of the information \nwould indicate that in neither of those two events is it reasonable to \nassume that that evidence would be made available to us, and that in \neach of those cases it is very likely the defendants would continue to \nassert their privilege and the committee would not have the ability to \nreceive their testimony.\n  I began my comments by saying that I am as committed as any Member in \nthis Chamber to getting at the facts. If there is evidence of \nmisconduct, it should be brought to public attention. Indeed, the \ntrials which are occurring right now will be public trials and that \ninformation, if there is such evidence, will come out. The American \npeople will fully understand.\n  I have indicated that I think Mr. Starr is a competent and an \naggressive, energized prosecutor. There is every reason to believe he \nwill follow any leads, any evidence that may suggest wrongdoing, and he \nwill be aggressive in doing so.\n  I believe an argument could be made that the Whitewater matter has \ngone on long enough in the Senate and it ought to be concluded at this \npoint. But I believe the compromise that has been offered by the \nranking member, namely, that we extend the hearings for a period of 5 \nweeks, and then allowing another 4 weeks thereafter to compile the \nreport, is reasonable. In that period of time we ought to be able to \nconclude this matter, unless there is a different agenda here. And I \nthink the American people need to understand that. I believe--and I \nhate to say this, but I think it is true--there is a different agenda. \nIt is not an agenda to find out exactly what happened and to get to the \nbottom of this. It is to keep this issue alive, to generate a headline, \nto generate ongoing controversy with the hope that somehow this may \nspill over into the Presidential race this year and disable the \nPresident politically.\n  What has been proposed is a very reasonable compromise, and I think \nany fairminded person who has looked at the 277 days, the 100 \nwitnesses, the 45,000 pages of documents we have examined would \nconclude that another 5 weeks is a reasonable period of time. And so I \ncommend the distinguish Senator from Maryland. That is a reasonable \napproach. I say to the American people that in 5 weeks, done \nenergetically, not just one hearing for 1 hour, 1 day each week, but I \nmean an aggressive hearing schedule that would engage the members of \nthe committee for a 4- or 5-day workweek, we can reasonably examine any \nevidence or tie up any loose ends that might have existed. But that \noffer was rejected. That offer was rejected.\n  What we are faced with is a proposition that in effect has no time \nlimit, no constraint at all. After the trial, whenever that might be, \nwhatever week, whatever month, who knows, whatever year, we do not know \nwhat might occur. Those of my colleagues who have done trial work know \nthat oftentimes in the course of a major piece of litigation--and this \nis certainly a major case--unexpected events occur and, indeed, the \ntrial is recessed for a considerable period of time--weeks, even \nmonths.\n  And so I would urge my colleagues to enable us to reach a responsible \ncompromise that has been suggested by the distinguished ranking member, \nthe senior Senator from Maryland, and let us go on with this. There are \nso many other things I would like to do in this year in the Banking \nCommittee. Some are interested in regulation reform with respect to the \nbanking industry. I would like to work on some of those provisions.\n  I would like to see us complete our work here on the floor, the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act, which was something that I personally invested a \ngood many years on. But the reality is that the entire agenda of the \nBanking Committee, the legitimate public policymaking part of that \nagenda, has been held captive or hostage to the political machinations \nwith an attempt to prolong a hearing on Whitewater, not for the purpose \nof getting at the truth, but for the purpose of trying to embarrass the \nPresident.\n  I regret that I have to say that on the floor, Mr. President, but in \nmy view the evidence lends itself to no other conclusion.\n  I will conclude as I began by pointing out that last October, what \nmay very well be the high-water mark in terms of the bipartisan \napproach which I hoped would characterize the entire\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\nWhitewater inquiry in the Senate, in which it was affirmatively stated \nthat these matters needed to be concluded, that we should not hold our \nhearings in abeyance until the trial and those ancillary proceedings \nare concluded, but that we had a compelling public interest to address \nthis issue and to address it thoroughly but to address it promptly and \nresponsibly. That, I fear, Mr. President, we are not doing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of reasons why the \nWhitewater Special Committee should get on with its work and be \nlimited. But this evening I am going to take a different approach that \nI think my colleagues ought to consider that has nothing to do with the \nfacts of the investigation.\n  That may seem strange, but I have been chairman of the Rules \nCommittee with a strong responsibility; I am now ranking member of the \nRules Committee with a strong responsibility. So, Mr. President, I feel \nthat it is incumbent upon me to let my colleagues know what the actual \ncosts are and what the prospects of getting the money might be.\n  Mr. President, under title II of the United States Code, it gives the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration the exclusive authority--I \nunderscore ``exclusive authority''--to approve payments made from the \ncontingency fund of the Senate. No payment may be made from the \ncontingency fund without the approval of the committee. I think that is \npretty clear.\n  Inherent in that authority is the responsibility to assure that there \nare adequate funds--adequate funds--in the contingency fund to cover \nthe various expenses of the Senate. This is just one. We are affecting \nevery committee chairman in the Senate. I will get to that in a minute.\n  Senate Resolution 227 before us today authorizes funds to be paid \nfrom the inquiries and investigation account within the contingency \nfund of the Senate. During the meeting of the committee on this \nresolution, I raised the concern that there may be insufficient funds \nwithin this account to support an open-ended extension of the \nWhitewater Special Committee at an additional amount of $600,000.\n  Similarly, the full Senate should consider whether there is adequate \nfunds in this account to provide for the extension. Not to consider \nthis issue, in my opinion, Mr. President, would be irresponsible.\n  First, let me advise my colleagues that the actual cost of extending \nthe special committee is considerably more than $600,000. Senate \nResolution 227 authorizes--and I quote--``additional sums as may be \nnecessary for agency contributions related to the compensation of \nemployees of the Special Committee.''\n\n  The original resolution, Senate Resolution 120, was silent on how \nagency contributions were to be paid, but was amended, Mr. President, \nto provide retroactively that additional sums may be provided to pay \nthese expenses. So, really the original amount is now well over $1 \nmillion. The $900,000, $950,000 is well over $1 million. We will get to \nthat in a minute.\n  Any agency contributions include such expenses as the employer's \nshare of health insurance, life insurance, retirement, FICA tax, and \nthe employer match for the FERS thrift savings plan. For standing \ncommittees, the rule of thumb for figuring agency contributions is \nabout 26 percent of payroll.\n  It is my understanding that the percent incurred by the special \ncommittee might be slightly more than that. But let us consider the 26 \npercent. So, Mr. President, based on 26 percent of payroll expense, the \nadditional cost to the taxpayer and expense to the contingent fund of \nthe extension of the Whitewater Special Committee could be upward of \n$150,000 more than the $600,000 that is being requested, bringing the \nactual total to over some $750,000.\n  I should also point out to my colleagues that the same is true of the \n$950,000 authorized under Senate Resolution 120. The retroactive \namendment to Senate Resolution 120, which provided additional funds to \npay for agency contributions, could cost upward of $247,000. So we have \na $950,000 figure. Then we have to add $247,000 to that. That comes out \nof the contingency fund. That could bring the initial cost of the \nspecial committee, as we add it up, to be well over $1 million to date.\n  So, Mr. President, in reviewing the financial state of the inquiries \nand investigations account, I am advised there is an estimated $2.3 \nmillion unobligated in this account for this fiscal year. I am \nconcerned that this is not a sufficient balance to allow the Senate to \nauthorize another $600,000 or more in expenses for continuation of the \nWhitewater Special Committee and have sufficient resources to meet \nother obligations of the Senate.\n  Overtime is coming, whether you like it or not. We voted for that. \nOffices are already paying overtime. If you have been listening to the \nSecretary of the Senate and the Sergeant-at-Arms, they are very \nconcerned about overtime. We think that will be a minimum of 4 percent \nfor committees. That is over $2 million.\n  If you take Whitewater out of that contingency fund, you add on the \nother expenses that are necessary, you have a fund that is short, that \nis absolutely short. We will not have money. You jeopardize every \ncommittee in the U.S. Senate.\n  Let me advise my colleagues as to the expenses that are paid out of \nthis account. These expenses include all salaries and expenses of the \n19 standing committees, special and select committees, including the \nallowance for a COLA, if authorized, and the employer's share of all \ncommittee staff benefits. I go back and repeat, that means FICA, life \ninsurance, health insurance, retirement, and the match for \ncontributions to the FERS thrift savings plan.\n  In addition, all salaries and expenses of the Ethics Committee are \npaid from this account. Also, the initial $950,000 for the special \ncommittee, plus agency contributions, were paid from this account.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, we are now subject to the overtime \nprovisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Just last week--and I \nrepeat myself here--we heard from both the Secretary of the Senate and \nthe Sergeant-at-Arms that they anticipate a substantial amount of \novertime costs.\n  The Rules Committee has heard from committee chairmen and ranking \nmembers who are facing the potential of substantial amounts of overtime \ncosts without any funds budgeted to pay these costs.\n  If the Senate should find it necessary to authorize additional funds \nto pay overtime expenses of committees, these expenses would be paid \nfrom the inquiries and investigations account of the contingency fund.\n  While we have no history of overtime costs for Senate committees, it \nis clear that we will incur overtime costs before the end of this \nfiscal year.\n  Based upon the current projected surplus in this account, if we \nshould fund the extension of the special committee at the recommended \nlevel, we would have only about a 3-percent-of-payroll cushion for \npaying overtime expenses.\n  This may be dry, and you may not be interested in what I am saying, \nbut when you run out of money and your staff cannot be paid, you go \nback and remember what I said on this particular date.\n  We simply cannot authorize an additional $600,000 in expenses from \nthe contingency fund at this time. Doing so means nothing less than \nchoosing between funding our obligations to our committee staff and \nhiring more consultants and issuing more subpoenas for more documents \nthat have proven no wrongdoing at all.\n  Let me be very clear. My colleagues may be choosing between paying \nCOLA's, overtime expenses and the employer's share of health insurance, \nlife insurance, retirement, and other items for our staff, or the \nconsultant fees for an open-ended fishing license.\n  Moreover, while an amount is theoretically budgeted for the expense \nof the Ethics Committee, that committee has unlimited budget authority, \nwhich is funded out of this account. While the Ethics Committee funding \nneeds vary from year to year, investigations in the recent past have \nrequired substantial expenditures for hiring outside counsel. Again, my \ncolleagues need to be aware that there are numerous important and \nunforeseen expenses that must be paid from the contingency fund.\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\n  Mr. President, during the Rules Committee consideration of Senate \nResolution 270, I offered two amendments which we believe provided \nsufficient time and funding to complete the business of the special \ncommittee without jeopardizing benefits to committee employees. The \nfirst amendment would have both reduced the additional funding for the \nWhitewater Special Committee and limited the ability to obligate \nexpenses to be paid from the contingency fund after May 10, 1996.\n  This amendment would have reduced the funding for the special \ncommittee from $600,000 to $185,000, with a corresponding reduction in \nthe amount which can be used for consultants under this resolution from \n$475,000 down to $147,000.\n  It would also have prohibited obligated expenses from the contingency \nfund after May 10, 1996, and based upon prior experience, it is clear \nthat the additional witnesses and hearings the special committee wishes \nto call could be accommodated within that amount. However, with \nvirtually no debate, that amendment was defeated on a party-line vote 9 \nto 7.\n  The second amendment that was offered would have reduced the \nadditional funding for expenses and salaries of the special committee \nwithout the sunset date. This amendment would also have reduced \nauthorization from $600,000 to $185,000, with a corresponding reduction \nin the amount available for consultants from $475,000 to $147,000.\n\n  So with this resolution, if adopted, we would go out and get private \nconsultants and pay them $475,000, almost half a million dollars of \ntaxpayers' money to come in and help us gin up some more subpoenas, for \nall the telephone calls for the total State of Arkansas.\n  This amendment would have allowed the special committee to complete \nits work without jeopardizing the funding of the other 19 Senate \ncommittee budgets and the benefits of the employees who work for those \ncommittees. Again, that amendment was defeated on a party-line vote.\n  We are going to be here after Whitewater. The committees are going to \nbe functioning after Whitewater. Staff is going to have to be paid on \nall the committees after Whitewater. But I tell you, when you dilute \nthis fund--and we are going to have to have a line item, I say to the \nranking member, for the new procedures of the Senate, and it is going \nto be a humongous amount of money. Some of it may start this year, and \nwe will not have the amount of money necessary to complete.\n  Let me be clear that we are not suggesting the special committee not \nbe allowed to finish its work. I am only urging that we be responsible \nwith the American taxpayers' money and be responsible to our staff by \nlimiting both the life and the additional funding of the special \ncommittee to an amount that will not jeopardize the quality or, more \nimportant, the obligations of the Senate contingency fund.\n  The American people will best be served if we reach a reasonable \ncompromise for the extension of the special committee.\n  So I urge the leadership on both sides of the aisle to make an effort \nto try to arrive at a compromise that will give us an opportunity to be \nsure that the contingency fund is not diluted.\n  Mr. President, I just reiterate that we authorized $950,000 for \nSenate Resolution 120 and over $220,000 in addition to that which we \nhad to pay. That is this unobligated--the little quotes that we get at \nthe end of the bill. This one will be well up there, too, and well over \nthe $600,000 that the chairman of the committee is asking for.\n  What I have done here is to alert my colleagues to the possibility of \njeopardizing the contingency fund, the possibility of jeopardizing our \nability to take care of the other 19 committees to pay what the \nSergeant at Arms and the Secretary of the Senate have said they are \nvery concerned about--overtime.\n  Overtime is tough, and it is going to get tougher. When we have \napproximately 3 percent left in the contingency fund, then I think we \nare on the verge of depleting that contingency fund.\n  So I hope my colleagues will look at that; that they will see that it \nwill take more money from the committees than is absolutely necessary; \nthat this committee can wind it up by May 10; that we cannot dilute the \ncontingency fund. I am very concerned, not for myself, not for the \nSenators, but I certainly am concerned for those who work for us on our \ncommittees every day and put in a good job, work hard and long, and \nthey are entitled to have the overtime, because we now made it law.\n  So, therefore, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, last week, my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side objected to us taking up this very same resolution by \nway of unanimous consent essentially to empower the committee, to \nauthorize the committee to do its job, to finish the work that it has \nstarted.\n  Make no mistake about this: This is not an argument about funds; this \nis not an argument about a deadline. This really comes down to the \ncrucial question of whether or not we are going to do our job and to \nfulfill the constitutional responsibilities and to get the facts. By \nthe way, it may not be pleasant. Those facts may be very distressing or \ndisturbing to some. Let me suggest that they may be disturbing because \nsome may suspect that all kinds of misdeeds may have been committed by \npeople in the administration or close to the administration, by friends \nof the administration, and suspect the possibility of attempting to \nimpede investigations. But, indeed, there may be findings that there \nwere no misdeeds--none. Some people may be upset by that. There may be \nfindings that indeed there was improper conduct and activities.\n\n  Regardless of which way it is, whether it is to clear away the clouds \nof suspicion, or whether the ultimate findings are that there was \nserious misconduct on the part of people in the administration, we have \na duty to get the facts. If those facts are exculpatory, if they clear \naway the doubts, then fine, let the chips fall where they may.\n  To oppose the proper work of this committee, which is authorized, \npursuant to almost unanimous consent--96 to 3--to undertake this \ninvestigation, is to say very clearly that there may be facts that may \nnot be exculpatory, they may be damaging. Now, look, it is easy to \nsuggest that this committee has conducted its work in what one would \ncall an unfair partisan manner. I say, let us look at the record. Yes, \nwe have had suggestions and, yes, there have been subpoenas initially \ndrafted, but not served, that may have been overly broad. That is not \nunusual. You negotiate to determine what the scope should be. Al Smith, \nthe Governor of New York State, coined an expression. He used to say, \nwhen there were controversies, ``Let us look at the record.'' If one \nwere to look at the record, you would ultimately find, notwithstanding \nthat there may have been negotiations between the Democrats and \nRepublicans, that ultimately, in almost all cases, over the life of \nthis committee and its predecessor, agreement has been reached. On only \none occasion--out of the dozens of subpoenas that were issued and \nrequests for witnesses' testimony--did we really have one disagreement \nthat could not be solved in a bipartisan manner.\n  To come forth at this time and suggest that this is politically \ninspired is at variance with the record. Al Smith said, ``Let us look \nat the record.'' That record indicates, quite clearly, that \nnotwithstanding the times that we may have had differences, we were \nable to surmount them in a way that brought clarity and dignity to our \nwork. We may not have found what some would characterize as the smoking \ngun. But, indeed, ours is not to anticipate what will or will not be \nfound. The work of this committee is to gather the facts, my friends, \nnot to prejudge, not to offer speculation, not to suggest that, well, \nwhat do you do then if you unearth some terrible, horrible chilling \nthing. Ours is to gather the facts. If those facts clear away the \nclouds of doubt that may exist, fine. But I suggest to you that there \nwas sufficient room, at least, to say there are some very real \nconcerns--repeated memory lapses, tied to factual situations; diaries \nthat people kept notes in, which mysteriously turn up after the work of \nthis committee could have come to an end; missing records that turn up. \nContradictory testimony of Secret Service Officer O'Neill and young Mr. \nCastleton, two people who\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\nhave no reason to make up stories, cast very real doubts and concerns \nas to the manner in which key documents that were removed from Mr. \nFoster's office were handled. Who requested the movement of those \ndocuments? What were those documents? Officer O'Neill says that he saw \nthe first lady's chief of staff, Maggie Williams, removing files. It \nwas very clear in his testimony. Very clear. As a matter of fact, it is \nso clear that I think most people, if they have heard his account, \nwould believe it. And I can assure my friends and colleagues on the \nother side that I will go over that narrative very carefully if they \ncontinue to oppose us going forward and orchestrate what is a \nfilibuster.\n  I do not think it behooves the interest of the committee, the Senate, \nDemocrats or Republicans, or the entire political process, given the \ngrave doubts that people have with respect to Washington, that we fail \nin our duties and obligations to continue to do our work in an \nexpeditious a manner as reasonable, dealing with the circumstances that \nwe have, recognizing that there are key witnesses that are unavailable.\n  Mr. President, those witnesses may never be available. I am the first \nto suggest that. They may never be available. But at least we will have \ndone the best we can do. If we file a report based upon all of the \nwork, our best efforts, then we can say that we have discharged our \nresponsibility. The American people have a right to know, and we have \nan obligation to get the facts.\n  Some people say, ``Why do you continue with this? People are bored.'' \nIt is not our job to be concerned with whether or not people are bored. \nThe question is not whether there are sensational headlines that will \ncome out of revelations. The question is: What are the facts? Were \nthere misdeeds, an abuse of power, an attempt to cover up? Was there an \nattempt to stop investigations from taking place? And then going to the \nheart of the issue, was there misuse of taxpayers' moneys in Little \nRock? That is the question. If there was, who was responsible? As a \nresult, was there a concerted effort to keep these facts from being \nrevealed to the American people?\n  I am sorry that this matter has been drawn out as it has. \nNotwithstanding those who would claim that this was deliberate, that is \nnot the case. Nor would I differ with my friends if they were to say \nthat there were dates that we could have held more hearings. Certainly, \nbut that would not have permitted us to complete the work of this \ncommittee. It absolutely would not have. Indeed, it would have left a \nsituation where there were still numbers of documents that we have no \nreason to believe would have been produced any earlier, and numbers of \nwitnesses, including Judge Hale, who I believe the committee wants to \nat least make a good-faith effort to bring before the committee. And \nagain--and I know it is difficult--I think we want to attempt to be as \nfair and reasonable in our presentations of our cases as we possibly \ncan be. I do not know the truth or falsity of what Judge Hale is \nreported to have said. I do not know whether he can shed any light on \nany factual material. It certainly is important enough to make the \neffort. If, indeed, at the conclusion of the trial when we subpoena \nhim--together, hopefully, and I have every reason to believe that my \nDemocratic colleagues will join in that because that has been the \nindication of the ranking member--his lawyers may assert and raise the \nconstitutional questions about self-incrimination. That may take place.\n\n  Then we could say, ``Well, Senator, why did you do this?'' I admit we \nhave no assurance that any of these witnesses that we want will be \nforthcoming. But, by gosh, we have an obligation to do the job, \nthoroughly, correctly, and in the right way. All the arguments about \nmoney, and how much has been spent, is a red herring. There is no truth \nto that. This committee has been rather frugal. Indeed, if you want to \nlook at the costs, hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent \ncorrectly in gathering the evidence, taking depositions--these \ntranscripts cost thousands of dollars a day. That is part of the cost. \nThis has not been a wasteful exercise that costs $30 million. I hear \npeople say, ``Why are you wasting money--$30 million?\"\n  Let me say again, the committee's work has been extended. It has been \nextended because the special counsel has asked us as it relates to key \ntimes and dates to withhold from the subpoenaing of information, to \nwithhold from the subpoenaing witnesses. We have worked with them. I \nthink that is responsible. Did I want to get those witnesses in? Yes, \nabsolutely. There is a degree of responsibility that this committee \nmust exercise. It does not mean that we cede to the special counsel all \nauthority and say, ``When you raise an objection, we shall not go \nforward,'' but in good conscience we have attempted to act in a way \nthat would not jeopardize the important work of the special counsel.\n  Mr. President, I think that if the minority continues to thwart, as \nit can, if it votes against cloture--and there will be a cloture vote \nscheduled--then I think they are very clearly saying to the American \npeople that they are afraid of the facts that will be revealed. There \nis no doubt in my mind this is a carefully orchestrated opposition \nbeing raised, and that orchestration comes from the White House.\n  Indeed, packets of information have been distributed to denigrate \nindividual Members. That is not what a White House should be about. \nThat is not what this investigation should be about--people assigned \ntasks, responsibilities of gathering information on a Senator from the \nDNC. That is not right. That is not fair. This Senator has known about \nthat for quite a while. I bring it up now for the first time because, \nMr. President, if we want democracy to work, then we have to stop these \ndirty little games, the dirty tricks of attempting to embarrass, \nattempting to hurt so that one is diverted, one's attention is diverted \nfrom the facts.\n  Now, Mr. President, I believe that we could come to a resolution. I \nhave not spelled out any particular methodology. It seems to me that we \nknow with a good degree of certainty that the trial will be concluded. \nThere may be appeals. So what? That will not preclude us from asking \nfor witnesses to come in. Indeed, their lawyers may or may not assert \nconstitutional rights. At least at that point we have given to the \nspecial counsel the opportunity to do his work. He may disagree. The \ncommittee may say, ``Look, we want to resolve this and go forward.''\n  On the other hand, the committee may say, reasonably, we should not. \nAt that point, I would be first to say we may have to conclude, or \ncertainly there is no further reason to continue going forward if there \nare not other areas that have not been successfully covered.\n  It would seem to me we would be in a position to look into the \nquestion of the leases that have been made with respect to Mr. McDougal \nand the State. We would be able to look into the Arkansas Development \nFinance Authority, the propriety of its acts, the relationships that it \nhad or did not have with various people, the probity of those--all of \nthose areas that are left unresolved. I am not going to take the time \nat this point to go into them, but I will. And I will spell them out in \ndetail as we will spell out the testimony of Mrs. Williams, Maggie \nWilliams, in detail and the testimony of young Mr. Castleton and the \ntestimony of the officer, which is clearly at variance with what her \nmemory and what her reflections are to such a degree that one has to \nsay that there are very real issues that are not resolved. I will do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I think we have an opportunity to do the business of \nthe people, not to create these doubts--what are my Democratic friends \nworried about? What is the White House worried about? What are they \nhiding? If there is nothing there, then, fine, the committee will fold \nits tent, as it should. It will conclude. But it has an obligation to \nfirst have the real opportunity to conclude its work as we should, as \nhonest factfinders. That is what this is about, being honest \nfactfinders. Nothing more, nothing less.\n  I hope that we would not engage in the kind of accusations that \noftentimes come about where there are contentious matters, matters of \nconscience. There may be some of my colleagues who absolutely feel that \nthe only reason we are going forward is to seek to discredit \npolitically. There may be\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\nsome on my side who seek partisan advantage for that purpose. But \nirrespective of those feelings, we have an obligation. The obligation \nis to get the facts and to try to do it in a manner that really \ndemonstrates to the American people that notwithstanding contentious \nissues--issues that could very easily be blown out of proportion by \npartisanship--that we are above it.\n  Now, I am not suggesting to you that reasonable people may not have \nreason to disagree with some of my decisions or actions on that \ncommittee. But I believe if one were to examine his or her conscience, \nthey would have to say that the chairman has endeavored to be fair. \nYes, fair; yes, thorough; yes, comprehensive; but, above all, fair. \nThat does not mean we have to agree on every issue.\n  It seems to me that one way which is not recommended, a recommended \ncourse, is to continue our work and look at the conclusion of the trial \nas a point in which we would look to set some kind of reasonable time, \nand that we would agree if there was work that still needed to be done, \nthat we would take up whether or not it should be extended. I do not \nsee how you can set a limit based upon a date certain--what if the \ntrial does go 2 months, and we say we have to wrap up the work of the \ncommittee by April 5. That means that those key witnesses would be \nprecluded.\n  That means that we set a timeline. It has been suggested, and I know \nreferenced by some of my colleagues in the debate, that when you set a \ndeadline for the completion of congressional investigations, decisions \nare often dictated by political circumstances and the need to avoid the \nappearance of partisanship. This is what was done in the Iran-Contra \ncase. They set a particular timeline. What that did is set a convenient \ndrop-dead date by which lawyers sought to delay and wait out the \ninvestigation.\n  My distinguished colleagues, the former Democratic majority leader \nand Senator Cohen, suggested that should not have been done. Here is a \nquote: ``The committee's deadline provided a convenient stratagem for \nthose who were determined not to cooperate.'' That is in this book, \n``Men of Zeal.'' I have to suggest that, given the appearance of \ndocuments at the last minute--and I am not going to argue the merits--\nbut I have to suggest there has been a history of documents coming in \nconveniently late. The last of them was the miraculous production of \nthe Bruce Lindsey documents. Mr. Lindsey, the assistant to President \nClinton, his close confidant and friend, testified before the \ncommittee, that he did not take notes--he did not remember taking \nnotes. He was asked specifically about it. His lawyer was requested to \nlook and see and to make a proper search. He did undertake this so-\ncalled review and this search, and lo and behold, after the committee's \nfunding ended, guess what? On a Friday, the miraculous production. \nAlways on a Friday. Always late on a Friday. This time I think it was \nabout 7 or 8 o'clock Friday.\n  Why? To avoid the news, avoid the news. The White House got these \ndocuments, I understand, on a Wednesday. But they did not make them \navailable to the committee until Friday. What is that all about? \nManaging the flow of information. That is managing the flow of facts. \nIs that right? Is that proper? I will tell you what it appears like to \nme. It appears to me that my Democratic friends are so interested in \nthe management of the facts, facts that may be embarrassing, that they \nare willing to scuttle our constitutional obligations. That is just \nwrong and that is what leads people to say: What are you hiding? What \nare you hiding?\n  Do I believe that all my colleagues are in league with that? No, I do \nnot. But I believe that there are those who are so intent upon stopping \nthis investigation that they have laid down a hard and fast rule. They \nare probably polling right now to ascertain whether or not this is \ngoing to hurt their credibility or not.\n  I think whenever you want to end a duly constituted investigation \nwhen there are substantial open questions and work to do, people have \nto say: Why? Why are you keeping the committee from doing its work? I \nthink we can do our work. I think we can do it again in a reasonably \nfast way, but in a way that meets our obligations.\n  I do not look to draw this out. I said to this committee, to the \nRules Committee, when we sought authorization, it was my hope that we \ncould keep this matter from continuing into the political season. I \nstill think we can deal with this in a manner which means that it would \nend sometime in June, late June or maybe even earlier. I think we \nreally can.\n  But there has to be a starting point that is reasonable and will \nassure that we have some opportunity to get the facts. If we never get \nthe opportunity to examine the witnesses--and that is what would take \nplace if we had an arbitrary deadline of April and that trial is not \nover--we will be denied this opportunity. I recognize they can take \nappeals. They could take appeals for years. I am not suggesting we wait \nuntil the appellate process is over. That is not the case at all.\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask that my colleagues on the Democratic \nside consider an attempt to deal with this in a way that will not put \nus to the test of coming to vote to end this filibuster. They should \nnot be filibustering this. We have other things to do. We have \nimportant things to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to stand and commend the \ndistinguished Senator from New York. The Rules Committee, of which I am \na member, proceeded to meet yesterday, in a very correct manner, hoping \nto consider S. Res. 227, I believe, reported it to the floor, and that \nis the subject of the pending business.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the chairman and his staff for their cooperation \nin conducting that hearing with expedition. The matter is now before \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I listened to Senator D'Amato, the \nchairman of the Whitewater Committee, with great interest. I want to \nsay that the unreasonable element in this current situation is a \nrequest for an indefinite extension of the work of the committee. That \nwas not the premise on which the committee was established in Senate \nResolution 120. In fact, it is very clear that in Senate Resolution 120 \nwe agreed to a termination date just as we did in the Iran-Contra \ninvestigation at the strong urging of Senator Dole who at that time was \nthe minority leader and who pressed the Democratic majority at that \ntime in the Senate and the House to have a closing date on the inquiry \nin order to avoid making it a political exercise in a Presidential \nelection year in 1988.\n  That is exactly what we sought to do here by having a termination \ndate of February 29, 1996, and the request that has been made is for an \nindefinite extension.\n  The minority leader, Senator Daschle, has responded to that by \nproposing a limited time period. But the proposal before us that was \nbrought first from the Banking Committee, and then by the Rules \nCommittee, on a straight partisan vote is for an indefinite time period \nin order to carry out this inquiry. And, as I have indicated, this is \nperceived as unreasonable.\n  I know of no plot, as my colleague suggested, to denigrate Senators. \nCertainly no one on this side of the aisle is involved in any such \nendeavor. I want to establish that in a very clear fashion.\n  Two things have been argued. One is we have not gotten all of the \nmaterial in, and, therefore, we need to extend. Of course, Senator \nDaschle proposed a period of time for extension. I just observe that \nthe material is all now in. We got these notes. We had hearings on \nthese notes. I have to take the explanations as they come.\n  The Lindsey notes constitute three pages. This is what came. That is \nthe extent of it. These notes, in fact, corroborate what has previously \nbeen available to the committee.\n  Let me just read the note that comes from their counsel. It says:\n\n       Following a recent Senate committee hearing in which \n     questions were raised as to whether a January 10, 1994 \n     memorandum from Harold Ickes was copied to other White House \n     officials and whether they had produced their copies of such \n     documents in response to the committee's request, Mr. Lindsey \n     and this firm undertook a review of all our prior document \n     productions.\n\n  And I think it is important to point out that there have been very \nextensive prior document productions.\n\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\n\n       With respect to the January 10th memorandum, we found that \n     an identical copy of the document produced to the committee \n     by Mr. Ickes was in Mr. Lindsey's White House files and had \n     been produced by Mr. Lindsey to the White House Counsel's \n     office January 1995 for review with regard to executive \n     privilege and other issues. In the course of this review, we \n     have identified two other documents in our files which \n     inadvertently were not produced to you, or the White House \n     Counsel's Office, earlier and which are attached.\n\n  Those are these three pages of notes. And he then goes on to say:\n\n       First, while Mr. Lindsey previously informed your committee \n     that he did not recall taking any notes as of November 5, \n     1993 with Mr. David Kendall and other counsel for \n     the President, our recent review has located some very \n     brief handwritten notes set forth as attachment A here, to \n     which Mr. Lindsey did write at that meeting but did not \n     previously recall. As you will see, these brief notes are \n     completely consistent with the testimony of Mr. Lindsey \n     and others, and the Kennedy notes of the same meeting \n     presented to your committee about that meeting.\n\n  You may want to go at one or another of these people for not \nproducing the documents early but the fact is the document had been \nproduced--the Gearan document. Then we had a full day of hearing on \nthose documents. And the same thing, of course, is true with respect to \nthe Ickes notes.\n  So those matters have been furnished to the committee. And, as I \nunderstand it, now every request made by the committee to the White \nHouse has been responded to with the exception of two new requests for \ne-mail that the chairman made in the latter part of February that have \nnot yet been responded to.\n  Those two e-mail requests are pending, and the White House has \nindicated that it will provide them to the committee as soon as it is \nable to prepare them and furnish them to the committee.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If the Senator will yield for an observation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Sure.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. This is the first time that I have seen the letter \nconveying the notes. I guess we got these last Friday. They did not \nreally come into our possession until Saturday.\n  That would be a week ago Saturday?\n  Yes, last Saturday. Last Saturday. So when we got these notes, I \nthink you have to understand very clearly that Mr. Lindsey testified to \nthe committee that he did not take notes. Then there is another \nencounter----\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, they state that in the \nletter. They are not trying to conceal that fact.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Sure. I understand.\n  Mr. SARBANES. They are very up front about saying ``previously \ninformed your committee that he did not recall taking any notes.''\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Sure.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And he now says they have found these brief handwritten \nnotes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I understand. And then we made a request after that \ntestimony and his lawyer said that he was going to look, to search the \nrecords. And we did not get anything. And now, on March 2, after the \ncommittee goes out of its authority--I do not know whether we have \nauthority, but certainly authorization expired February 29--this letter \nis sent to us enclosing the notes he had taken.\n  I find the letter interesting; this is the first time I have seen the \nletter, and I would ask my friend if he would take a look at the second \npage of the letter, the last paragraph, last sentence. ``We have not \nproduced, of course, attorney-client privileged documents reflecting \neither Mr. Lindsey's communications with this firm.'' I understand \nthat. In other words, he should not have to report his communications \nthat he has had with his lawyer. Those are privileged. He has a right \nto assert that. But this is where I have some real trouble, and I think \nthe committee will, and it is a very proper question. We will look and \nwe will press and we will subpoena, if necessary, these documents, \nwhatever they may be, because obviously his lawyer thought they were \nimportant enough that they would not place him in a position where he \nmight be charged with obstructing justice or not responding to the \nsubpoena. He has very smart lawyers. He is a lawyer himself, a former \nsenior partner in a law firm. ``Or his''--meaning Mr. Lindsey's--\n``attorney-client privileged communications with private counsel for \nthe President.''\n  I have to suggest he does not have a privilege with respect those \nconversations that he had and cannot assert that with respect to those \nconversations and those documents, and we have been in touch with him \nabout this. We have gone to the point that we brought down to the \nSenate floor and voted on--this is the one area that we could not agree \non--whether or not documents were privileged. That same kind of \nquestion about whether they would be required to waive privilege came, \nand we were ready to vote enforcement of the subpoenas that we issued. \nThat was the only time that we had a disagreement.\n  I have to say to my friend, again, this raises very substantial \nquestions. Now, reasonable people might disagree, but I have to suggest \nto you that was not just placed in there as some legal nicety. That is \nimportant. And I have to say, what information does he have?\n  We have settled the manner in which to deal with many of these \nissues. We have had majority counsel and minority counsel meet to see \nwhether or not information should be made public, whether the committee \nhad a right to it or not. At the very least, we have a right to see \nwhether or not this falls within that area of information that is not \ngermane to the subject of our inquiry--at the very least.\n  Now, if people want to raise, if the White House wants to raise the \nissue of privilege, which the President of the United States said he \nwould not--he would not--why, then, that is their right. But for Mr. \nLindsey's attorney to withhold and say, ``We are not going to do it,'' \nthat is improper.\n  Now, if the White House wants to come in and say, ``We are asserting \nthat Mr. Lindsey had communications with the President's private \ncounsel that are privileged,'' then they have a right to do that. I am \nnot agreeing that we are going to say that falls within the parameters \nof the privilege. We may insist on enforcement. But I have to tell you \nthat this again raises questions. And when do we get this information? \nSaturday.\n  How is it that we have got so many of these convenient kinds of \nlapses? And this is not the first time. Mr. Lindsey is an assistant to \nthe President of the United States. He has the lapse. The deputy chief \nof staff, Mr. Ickes, he has a lapse. He finds documents, again, at the \nlast minute. Mr. Gearan, he has a lapse. Again, every one of these \npeople involved with the Whitewater team has a lapse. I have to suggest \nto you that it does raise real questions and is very troubling.\n  That is why I think there are many people who believe that we have an \nobligation to finish this and to get the facts, and I think that if we \nwere to move forward you would see even more documents be produced, \nmore discoveries, more things that have not been turned over to this \ncommittee. I cannot believe given the tasks--and I am prepared to go \nthrough the list--that Mr. Ickes assigned to various people that all of \nthe documents related to their Whitewater activities have been turned \nover to this committee.\n  I yield the floor to my friend because the Senator has been more than \ngracious. I just wanted to raise this matter.\n  Mr. SARBANES. All I would say to the Senator is that these documents \nhave been furnished to the committee. They have not been concealed from \nthe committee, and they have not been hidden.\n  Now, the people who furnished them said, ``We were late furnishing \nthem for the following reasons.'' Now, you may accept or reject those \nreasons. And if you want to inquire into the reasons, you are perfectly \nfree to do so. But the fact remains that the committee has these \ndocuments. They are now in hand.\n  I have been sitting here listening today to my colleagues recite \nvarious aspects of our inquiry. The fact is the matters they have been \nreciting they can recite because we have gotten documents, we have had \nhearings, we have had witnesses that we have been able to question, we \nhave taken depositions, and therefore they can get up and talk about \nthese matters--often I think drawing conclusions not warranted by the \nfacts, but leave that to one side--they can talk about these matters \nbecause this material has been furnished\n\n[[Page S1593]]\n\nto the committee. So the fact is now that there has been a tremendous \ndragnet set out for material and a tremendous amount of material \nfurnished back to the committee, the fact is when we set out on this \nendeavor last May it was agreed that we would draw it to a conclusion \nat the end of February.\n  That has been a consistent principle that has been applied to all \ninquiries and all investigations by the Senate. None of them has been \nopen ended. In 1987, when Democrats pushed for an open-ended hearing, \nSenator Dole was very strong in saying that should not be done, and the \nDemocrats actually acceded to his representations and a concluding date \nwas set--in fact, quite an early one--and in order to accommodate it, \nthe Iran-Contra committee held 21 days of hearings in the last 23 days \nof its working period in order to get the job done.\n  Now, as the chairman knows, we urged him in mid January to have an \nintensified hearing schedule in respect to this matter. We now find \nourselves here at the beginning of March. I think that the minority \nleader has been very forthcoming in proposing an extension of time \nuntil the April 3 in order to complete our hearings. And, in any event, \nI do not regard it as a reasonable proposition to ask for an indefinite \ntime period which is completely contrary to the premise on which we set \nout. It is completely contrary to the premise of Iran-Contra, and it is \ncompletely contrary to the premise of every other inquiry and \ninvestigation.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I do not know if my friend is finished, and without \nlosing the right to the floor, I would like to make an observation if \nhe would care to comment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the fact is that this letter--by the way, \nnot so clearly, not so clearly--is what I consider to be a brilliant \nlegal, scholastic exercise in extricating one's client from meeting the \nobligations that he would be required to meet pursuant to the subpoena \nthat asked him to produce all relevant documents with respect to \nWhitewater. Brilliant. This is absolutely terrific.\n\n  And this fellow, Allen B. Snyder, is one good lawyer. He is the \nlawyer who signed this letter. Let me tell you why. Analyze this; you \nhave to agree, this is good. This is good. Listen to this, Mr. \nPresident. ``We have not produced''--this is the last sentence in this \nletter that says, here we give you these things, how we found them--\n``We have not produced, of course,''--gets you into believing, of \ncourse--``attorney-client privilege documents reflecting either Mr. \nLindsey's communication with this firm''--oh, OK, all right, we are not \ngoing to ask about that.\n  You are talking to your lawyer and saying, by the way, I have a \nproblem, et cetera, whatever. We have some facts or are talking \nstrategy, et cetera. That is what we consider to be privileged. By the \nway, it would seem that constitutional authorities would indicate in \nsome cases that we would actually have the right to that documentation.\n  So, ``* * * of course, attorney-client privilege documents reflecting \neither Mr. Lindsey's communications with this firm or--get this; now we \nsearch very carefully--``or his attorney-client privileged \ncommunication with private counsel for the President.''\n  He is withholding documents. We do not have those documents. We have \nnot seen those documents. And he is now asserting for the first time \nthat he has information. He did not know he had it before. He just \nremembered it. He just found it. He did not know it. But he now says, \n``I've got documents that you have subpoenaed. But I'm not going to \ngive them to you because, guess what, I had conversations with or \ncommunications with the President's counsel.'' Let me tell you \nsomething, as an assistant to the President, if he has communications \nand shares documents with a private counsel for the President, they are \nnot privileged. And this Senate and the Congress has a right to know \nwhat that information is.\n  Look, it may be that we are arguing over nothing. We have agreed to a \nmethodology, a methodology of not attempting to provoke a court \nconfrontation. I will tell you, I will ask for enforcement of the \nsubpoena because this subpoena was served before the authorization of \ncommittee funds ran out. This response is carefully contrived, and the \ndocuments are produced after the committee goes out.\n  Is it any wonder why reasonable people say, ``Why are you doing this? \nWhy are you holding this?'' Is there any reason why newspapers say, \n``How come you keep dribbling this thing out? What are you trying to \nhide?''\n  At the very least, it all seems to me that the majority counsel and \nthe minority counsel have done this before. We can look at this \ninformation, see if it is relevant or not, and examine whether or not a \nclaim of privilege is valid. I cannot see how it can be asserted, but \nif it is not relevant, we will not ask for it. We will agree to take a \npass.\n  I do not want to know whether he was discussing whether a football \nteam or basketball team was going to win the game the night that they \nwent to see it, or if he was in the company of the President, that he \ndiscussed that kind of thing. But if it is relevant, we have a right to \nit. If he communicated to the President's counsel, ``By the way, I'm \nworried about X, Y and Z,'' we have a right to that.\n  Either we want the facts or we do not. Do we want to hide the facts? \nLet me say, as it relates to the proposition that we are not willing to \nset a time certain, I think that is bad. I think it is really bad. But \nI am willing to say, let us provide a period of time after the \nconclusion of the trial. We know, whether that trial concludes with a \nfinal verdict--guilty, innocent, hung, et cetera--that within 10 weeks \nafter that trial, we will conclude.\n  You have to start someplace. I do not like setting a time because I \nthink again when you set a time line, you set a prescription for people \nlooking to delay and get past that time line. That is what our friends \nin ``Men of Zeal'' said. And they were right. Again, this was authored \nby Senator Cohen and Senator Mitchell about Iran-Contra. They said, \n``The committee's deadline provided a convenient stratagem for those \nwho were determined not to cooperate.''\n  I suggest, given the manner in which these documents came forward, \nthat this is part of the stratagem. When I see this letter, we know \nconclusively that we have not had an opportunity to examine documents \nthat were subpoenaed.\n  This is a very brilliant, lawyerly, scholarly letter. I read it for \nthe first time, and it just jumped out at me. Then counsel told me they \nhave attempted to get some kind of an agreement from Mr. Lindsey's \ncounsel in order to inspect this material. They were told no.\n  So where is the cooperation? If the White House has nothing to hide, \nwhere is that cooperation? It's a needle in a haystack. We want the \nfacts and information--the needles--but we get the whole haystack, we \ndo not get the critical information.\n  This is just another example. Let me suggest to you, is it not great \ncooperation when lawyers tell their clients, ``What are you holding \nback?'' and ``You better not hold back''? I see a pattern here. I see \nsome very bright lawyers saying, ``You can't withhold this stuff. You \nhave memorandums all over this place. If someone comes over and says, \n`Where is that memorandum?' and you sent it to eight different people, \nwhere do you think we get these documents from?''\n  Some very capable lawyers would tell a client, ``I'm not going to be \npart of advising you to withhold.'' Perhaps, that is why we have been \ngetting documents from them. Of course, that is an assumption on my \npart. There are a number of suspicious instances. We could take Susan \nThomases and the repeated requests to her for records--two times, three \ntimes, four times before we get all of the information, before we get \nthe logs that show the communications, key communications, information \nwithheld from us. I think there are some very capable lawyers that she \nhas representing her saying, ``Wait a minute. Wait a minute. They have \nasked you about these things. You can't withhold these things.''\n  You really think that a very capable lawyer like Ms. Thomases would \nnot have looked at the diaries and logs as it relates to communications \nthat she had during critical periods of time on or about the day of the \nsuicide, or the\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\nday following the suicide, of Vince Foster? She would have missed these \nduring that week? And it took us months to obtain this vital \ninformation.\n  We have not been able to examine her. She broke her leg. We examined \nher twice. She was scheduled to come in a third time. Unfortunately, we \ncould not do that because she said she broke her leg. What were we \nsupposed to do? Drag her in there? Have her come in a wheelchair?\n  I recognize the discomfort level that my friends and colleagues on \nthe other side would have as it relates to an indefinite extension. I \nunderstand that. But as a practical matter, if we receive $600,000, and \nspend it at the rate of approximately $150,000 a month, Mr. President, \nwe are talking about 4 months. That is the practical side of this.\n  We could be doing that business without rancor, doing it to the best \nof our ability. We may not be able to complete all of the work as we \nwould like. If there were facts and information that clearly \ndemonstrated that we had to go forward, I am sure that my colleagues \nwould then say, maybe reluctantly, we have to do that. That is the \nposition we would be placed in.\n  You know, the editorials indicate that we should go forward. They \nalso say that there is a caveat, a clear caveat, as it relates to the \nwork of the committee, if we begin to appear to be unfair, if we appear \nto be partisan in terms of being demanding, and that we, those of us \nwho are pressing to finish our work, could feel the political fallout. \nBut there are what we call common sense, common decency, in handling \nthe inquiry in a manner that is proper. I think we can do that. I would \nlike to proceed in that manner.\n  I thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity, at least, to \nshare these thoughts with you. I hope that between now and tomorrow, \nwhen we come to the floor again, that I have put forth something in a \nmanner in a way in which we could possibly move forward.\n  I suggested some way to begin to resolve this, such as taking a \nperiod of time after the completion of the trial. I said 10 weeks. My \nfriend may feel that is too long, but let us see if we cannot do it. \nAgain, there is a finite amount of time, constrained by very limited \nresources, resources of $600,000.\n  There has been an endeavor by my friends to put forth a proposal for \n5 weeks starting now and $185,000. I think we have to say even if that \nis the most good-faith offer they can make--and I do not question the \nfact that my colleague advances that in good faith--I hope that my \nfriend, Senator Sarbanes, will understand that it will not deal with \nthe question of access to those witnesses.\n  Again, we may never have access to them. I admit that. I am not \ntrying to score debating points here. What I am trying to do is tell \nyou clearly where we are troubled, what some of those facts are and see \nif we cannot work out a way cooperatively to go forward.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me say to the chairman, let me make a couple of \npoints. First of all, they cite editorials that say do an indefinite \nextension. I have cited on the floor today editorials that say--let me \njust quote a couple of them.\n\n       . . . Whitewater hearing needs to wind down. A legitimate \n     probe is becoming a partisan sledgehammer.\n       . . . The Senate Whitewater hearings, led since last July \n     by Senator Al D'Amato, have served their purpose. It's time \n     to wrap this thing up before the election season.\n\n  That is the Greensboro, NC, paper.\n  The Sacramento Bee says:\n\n       With every passing day, the hearings have looked more like \n     a fishing expedition in the Dead Sea.\n\n  And says these ought not to be extended.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is at least an imaginative image, fishing in the \nDead Sea. I like that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is very imaginative, in my opinion. This is a \ngrowing body of editorial view about the nature of these hearings.\n  When we agreed to these hearings on a 96 to 3 vote last May, an \nessential premise was that they would come to a conclusion. In fact, \nwhen the chairman went before the Rules Committee, he made the point \nthat he wanted to keep it a year, so it would not extend into the \nelection season.\n  It was very clear that we were not going to defer to Starr and his \ntrial. We were going to carry out our hearings, just the way Iran-\nContra carried out their hearings, and Walsh kept going after they \nconcluded their hearings. Iran-Contra did not come in behind the \ntrials. They carried out their hearings and brought them to a close, \nand, in fact, we stated that to Starr very clearly back on October 2 \nwhen we joined and wrote him a letter and said:\n\n       For these reasons, we believe the concerns expressed in \n     your letter do not outweigh the Senate's strong interest in \n     concluding its investigation and public hearings into the \n     matter specified in Senate Resolution 120 consistent with \n     section 9 of the resolution.\n\n  And section 9 was the February 29 date. So we were very clear about \nthat, as far back as October.\n  By seeking an indefinite extension, there is a complete change in the \nground rules by which the special committee has been operating \nheretofore. And I say to the chairman, that is part of the basis for \nthe very strong opposition that we have to an indefinite extension of \nthis inquiry. It has not been done before.\n  I commend to you Senator Dole's very strong comments in 1987 on this \nvery issue in which he was very explicit, repeatedly, with respect to \nthis question, and actually to accommodate, the Democratic Congress \nagreed that we would not extend the inquiry into the election year, \nthereby politicizing the matter and, I think, increasing the public \nperception that what is going on is simply a political exercise.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Again, I have not heard any response, but I have \nindicated that, obviously, the committee would be very hard pressed to \ncontinue its work past 4 months. That is No. 1. At $150,000 a month, in \nsome cases even more, and particularly if we are going to attempt to \nconclude this and take the necessary depositions, et cetera, that is \nabout the time frame that we are talking about.\n  It is reasonable to assume we are going to talk about a trial that \nlasts anywhere in the area of 6 to 8 weeks. I suggested we take a time \nline from the conclusion of that trial and attempt to use that as the \ndate.\n  So I have given an opportunity to our Democratic colleagues and \nfriends to consider this, instead of just being placed in a position of \nthose of us who would come to the conclusion, rightfully or wrongfully, \nthat there may be people who are calling and orchestrating this from \nthe White House who just do not want those facts to come out, whatever \nthey may be.\n  I do not know what they will be. I tell you, if they are exculpatory, \nif they clear the record, if they clear the clouds away, fine, so be \nit.\n  While Senator Dole has indicated previously the need and necessity to \nkeep investigations and hearings from going into the political season--\nand I recognize that and I have addressed that--there is the experience \nthat our colleagues and the former majority leader had during that same \nperiod of time. In his book, ``Men of Zeal,'' it was said that to set a \ntime line is basically to encourage people to look at delay.\n  We can continue this back and forth, but I hope my colleague will \nconsider what I suggested as a way to attempt to resolve this without \nus becoming involved in other matters.\n  Let me say this to you. Tomorrow I will advance, if we do not get an \nextension and if my colleagues continue to vote against cloture--and I \nhave no reason to believe my Democratic colleagues will not come in \nhere and, to a man, vote against proceeding and we will continue this \nfilibuster--then we will go through the record very clearly and attempt \nto make the case why it is we are seeking to continue, what facts we \nare still seeking, what information, what witnesses, in detail. They \ncan still vote that particular way. But then there will come a point in \nwhich we will attempt to do the work of the committee. It may not be as \nneat, it may not be as tidy, but I can assure my friend and colleague \nthat we will persist. I think when I say we are going to undertake \nsomething and I am committed to seeing to it that we do the best job we \ncan, that is something we can count on.\n  I put forth an offer that I think I can get substantial support for. \nThere will be some of my colleagues, as I am sure there will be a \nnumber of yours, who are adamantly opposed to any kind of compromise. I \nrecognize that, and I\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\nrecognize, in all due sincerity, that my friend probably has a number \nof colleagues who just do not want to agree to even 5 weeks. I \nrecognize that, too.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield on that point, there are many \npeople who feel the committee should have done its work within the \nrequirements of Senate Resolution 120, just as Iran-Contra had to do \nits work within its allotted requirements under the resolution under \nwhich it was operating.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I really tried as hard as possible to attempt to put \nforth an offer----\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, I just want you to understand there are some \nstrongly held views of that sort.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Sure, and you must recognize that there are legitimately \nheld views that people themselves feel strongly about without any \npartisan motives being attached to their feeling; that they say we want \nto end that. I understand that, and I am saying to you that I have a \nnumber of Members who do not want to compromise as it relates even to a \ntime line and they suggest we are going to be back in the same problem \nagain. But there comes a point in time when you have to make the best \nof the situation.\n  I am suggesting possibly we explore looking at a time certain, from \nwhich we say we will conclude, that being the conclusion of the trial, \none way or the other, if it is a hung jury, whatever it might be. We \nmay not be able to get any of those witnesses.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right, and we need to examine that up front.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am first to admit that. I am first to admit that. What \nI am trying to do is to say there is a good faith offer, an attempt to \nwind this up in a manner that does not detract from everything and \neverybody because there are going to be those who say in the drumbeat \nof the political spin doctors on one side saying the Senator from New \nYork is attempting to keep this going for political reasons.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I understand that. On the other side, there will be the \nchorus, What are you hiding? For every editorial you can produce, I can \nproduce one, two, three, four and you can produce some, and back and \nforth. What does that achieve? My gosh, what have we advanced?\n  So I am--and I am not asking you for an answer now--I am asking you \nto consider attempting to deal with this impasse, so that we do not \nhave to come down here and have our colleagues vote, line up on one \nside, those vote to cut off debate, cut off the filibuster, and those \nwho take the opposite possible positions and all the various \ncharacterizations that are going to flow--from both sides, absolutely \ntotally well-meant. All right. So I hope I have covered the waterfront \non that.\n\n  It may be that we cannot find a way to resolve this. But I am \nsuggesting that I am certainly willing to spare us further debate here, \nfurther time here, and let us be able to do the best we can, given that \nwe cannot control all the circumstances in this investigation. Some of \nit is beyond our ability to control.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my friend for his courtesies in giving \nme the opportunity at various times to make some points that I thought \nwere important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I believe, without imposing upon my \ncolleague, that concludes our discussion with respect to going forward \non the Whitewater resolution.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1567-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VACANCIES AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, on that note, let me say this. The \nBanking Committee has been waiting for months now for the President to \nfill vacancies at the Federal Reserve Board. It was just a little less \nthan 2 weeks ago last Saturday, March 2--there are two vacancies, two \nother vacancies aside from Mr. Greenspan--I guess it was about 10 days \nago when the President indicated that he was going to recommend not \nonly Chairman Greenspan but two other people, Alice Rivlin as the Vice \nChairman, and Lawrence Meyer as a Governor.\n  Since this announcement from the White House--and I have indicated \npublicly that we would move expeditiously to take up these nominees--we \nhave not received any word and the Federal Reserve has been forced to \nadopt various rules to address this gap so that Chairman Greenspan \ncould carry on his work. This continues to be a very critical post, and \nthese positions are critical. I hope the administration will move with \nsome speed and alacrity in sending those nominations over to us so we \ncan move.\n  I pledge to the body here and to the administration and to the \nPresident that we will move as quickly as we possibly can. We will set \nup a hearing--if it means in the afternoon, if it means whatever time \nconvenient to the nominees--to deal with these important nominations, \nbecause they are important and they are critical.\n  We want to move this. I hope they will send those nominations over. \nCertainly they should send over Mr. Greenspan at this point in time. We \ncould dispose of that. I do not understand why they would not have Mrs. \nRivlin ready, given her long stewardship in Federal Government and the \nfact that she has had all her clearances, et cetera. So at least two of \nthose positions are something we would be willing to move on very \nexpeditiously.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1595-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Once again, a suicide bomber did this awful deed; people are \ndead and injured; a nation is stricken; and the peace process is \nfurther jeopardized.\n  Ironically, Purim commemorates the time in which Esther, a Jewish \nheroine, convicted her husband to stop the slaughter of the Jews. There \nwas no modern day Esther Monday in Tel Aviv.\n  Monday's bombing follows Sunday's in Jerusalem, which took place on a \nstreet down which I have walked. I can see with terrible clarity the \nhorror of Sunday's bombing.\n  Mr. President, along with my colleagues, the President, and all \nAmericans, I offer my condolences to the families of those killed and \ninjured.

BARRY McCAFFREY, DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL \n                                 POLICY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in today's Washington Post there is a \nremarkable article. I commend all to read it. It is about the \nPresident's appointment of Gen. Barry McCaffrey, a four-star general, \nto the position of drug czar. It has been my privilege to know this \nfine American for some many years. I recall on one occasion, together \nwith other colleagues in this body--it may well have been the \ndistinguished whip was on that trip, the Senator from Kentucky, when we \nvisited the gulf region. We visited a number of the U.S. commanders who \nhad taken an active participation in the war in the gulf. General \nMcCaffrey was the general who spearheaded the tank column which crushed \nSaddam Hussein's armor.\n  From that experience and many other chapters of complete heroism as a \nsoldier, he now takes on another assignment and immediately goes into\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\nbattle, this time a battle to counter the threat of illegal drugs and \ndrug abuse to this Nation. It is a threat as serious as any that has \never faced this Nation in our history from any foreign military power \nor terrorist organization. I congratulate the President of the United \nStates. Indeed, he had awesome powers of persuasion, to get this \nAmerican to step aside, to promptly retire as a four-star officer, a \nman who may well have been destined to become Chief of Staff of the \nU.S. Army. He will take on a new challenge and enter another battle in \na life which, although this man is quiet and humble, is filled with \nheroism.\n  But General McCaffrey's appointment is timely, Mr. President. As \ntoday's Washington Post article opens up--and I will quote the article \nand I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in full at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER [reading]: ``By moving full circle in this election year, \nPresident Clinton plans an ambitious upgrading of the White House drug \ncontrol policy office three years after virtually wiping out that \noffice in order to fulfill a campaign pledge to reduce White House \nstaff.''\n  How tragic, Mr. President. Just look what happened statistically \nsince the Clinton administration has been in office.\n  The statistics over the past 2\\1/2\\ years are astonishing and \nalarming. The number of 12- to 17-year-olds using marijuana in the \nUnited States increased from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.9 million in \n1994.\n  The category of recent marijuana use increased a staggering 200 \npercent among the 14- to 15-year-olds in this same period of time.\n  Since 1992 there has been a 52-percent jump in the number of high \nschool seniors using drugs on a monthly basis.\n  I spoke with a group of parents the other day. The principal theme of \nour meeting was education. Yes, we talked extensively about education, \nbut in the course of an exchange between myself and this group they \nquickly turned to the threat that drug abuse poses to their children's \nsafety. We all know that safety in the educational environment equates \nwith the quality of education that these children hope to receive. We \nalso know that a portion of the violence that occurs in our schools is \nrelated to illegal drugs and their sales and distribution.\n  One in three high school seniors now smoke marijuana. The American \npeople recognize the problems with drug abuse. A December 1995 Gallup \nPoll shows that 94 percent of Americans feel illegal drug abuse is \neither a crisis, or a very serious problem.\n  So, Mr. President, I am glad the President of the United States has \nresponded. He has gone to general quarters, as well he should. He is \nproviding General McCaffrey considerable support, and I am glad General \nMcCaffrey's conditions are being met.\n  Just look at the record. The Clinton administration has virtually \nwiped out the Drug Control Policy office reducing the staff from 146 in \n1993 to just 25 as of today. This decision to staff up, made in \nconjunction with the appointment of General McCaffrey, comes at a time \nwhen numerous articles and television programs about the terrible \nincrease in substance abuse are appearing throughout our country.\n  Mr. President, thank you for getting the message from the American \npeople.\n  I pledge to this fine general and his staff my full cooperation so \nlong as I am privileged to be a Member of the U.S. Senate. I daresay my \ncolleagues likewise will support him.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                               About-Face\n\n                            (By Ann Devroy)\n\n       Moving full circle in this election year, President Clinton \n     plans an ambitious upgrading of the White House drug control \n     policy office three years after virtually wiping out that \n     office in order to fulfill a campaign pledge to reduce White \n     House staff.\n       According to requests submitted yesterday to Congress and \n     sources at the White House, the president is seeking to \n     increase drug policy staffing from 40 to 150 slots, reversing \n     steps he took in 1993 to reduce the office from 146 workers \n     to 25.\n       In addition, the White House has agreed to requests by its \n     new drug policy chief, retired Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, to \n     move the operation from a relatively distant office near the \n     New Executive Office Building back into the Old Executive \n     Office Building, where it was located under its first and \n     most high-profile director, William J. Bennett. McCaffrey, \n     also at his request, will be a given a slot on the National \n     Security Council, a new power perk, and the job will continue \n     to hold Cabinet rank.\n       One White House official explained the reversal this way: \n     ``The general wants some troops to command, and Clinton \n     wanted the general.'' But White House aide Rahm Emanuel, who \n     handled the upgrading of the operation, said the new staffing \n     levels and access for McCaffrey signal Clinton's confidence \n     in the former head of the military's Southern Command and his \n     commitment to an expanded fight against drugs.\n       ``This is what he needs to get the president's policy \n     implemented,'' Emanuel said. ``It is what the president \n     believes will help us improve on our record.''\n       While the new staff and spending are likely to consign \n     Clinton's staff-cut efforts to history, it will help him with \n     what may be a more potent political issue: his commitment to \n     drug control at a time when drug use among young people has \n     risen every year he has been in office.\n       Clinton yesterday sent to Congress a request for $3.4 \n     million in supplemental spending for the Office of National \n     Drug Control Policy. That request will pay for 80 new jobs, \n     according to the White House submission. In addition, \n     McCaffrey has gotten White House approval to take 30 \n     ``detailees'' from the Pentagon to his new operation. \n     Detailees are paid by their home agencies, so their cost is \n     not reflected in the White House budget.\n       The White House also has given McCaffrey the go-ahead to \n     formulate a plan for spending an additional $250 million this \n     year on the anti-drug effort, much of it reprogrammed \n     Pentagon funds.\n       In all, the new Clinton drug policy office will have \n     funding for 150 employees, four more than its high point \n     in the Bush administration. It was these workers that \n     Clinton turned to in large measure when he had to make the \n     cuts in White House operations to meet his campaign pledge \n     to shave the staff by 25 percent.\n       Despite significant misgivings from his own staff and many \n     outsiders, Clinton argued during the campaign that the White \n     House should operate with 25 percent fewer workers than in \n     the Bush era. The pledge was meant to symbolize the \n     president's commitment to make sacrifices himself before he \n     asked other parts of government and the American people to \n     sacrifice in the name of deficit reduction and more efficient \n     government.\n       On taking office, the Clinton team used some creative \n     accounting to readjust the baseline of what is normally \n     considered White House staff so that fewer cuts would produce \n     the 25 percent goal. But they still had to cut 350 slots from \n     a total of 1,394, and the drug office took by far the biggest \n     hit. White House officials argued that other parts of the \n     government, including the Pentagon and the State Department, \n     could pick up the slack.\n       White House officials now say they will try to keep the \n     staff level down for the full year to meet the 25 percent \n     reduction, even with the rush of new workers.\n       And they reject any link between the election year and \n     staffing up anti-drug efforts.\n       ``Our policy has been strong throughout. The president has \n     emphasized anti-drug efforts throughout his administration. \n     It has been an important priority,'' Barry Toiv, a deputy to \n     White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, said yesterday. \n     ``The president obviously has tremendous respect for General \n     McCaffrey's ability, and the general feels that with \n     additional resources he can do an even better job. The \n     president wants him to have those resources.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1595-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1596-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1596-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1596-S1597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:52 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 497.

A bill to prohibit campaign expenditures for services of \nlobbyists, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n                   CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, recently the Congress was \nsuccessful in passing legislation that would ban gifts from Members and \nstaff and put a wall between lobbyists who seek to curry special favor \nby the giving of gifts. Unfortunately, recent news articles have \nexposed a loophole that some have sought to exploit. Specifically, some \nlobbyists have served as fundraisers for Members of Congress and sought \nto increase their influence by means of coordinating campaign \ncontributions\n  Mr. President, this practice must stop. Registered lobbyists who work \nfor campaigns as fundraisers clearly represent a conflict of interest. \nWhen a campaign employs an individual who also lobbies that Member, the \nperception of undue and unfair influence is raised. This legislation \nwould stop such practices.\n  This bill would ban a candidate or a candidate's authorized committee \nfrom paying registered lobbyists. Additionally, the bill would mandate \nthat any contributions made by a registered lobbyist be reported by \nsuch individual when he or she files his or her lobbying disclosure \nreport as mandated by the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not aimed at any individual, but instead \nat a practice that has come to light. It is also not meant in any way \nto impugn anyone's integrity or good name. But it does seek to end a \npractice that is giving the Congress as a whole a bad name.\n  These two small changes in law represent a substantial effort to \nclose any loopholes that exist in our lobbying and gift laws. The \nCongress has begun to make great strides to restore the public's \nconfidence in this institution. We must continue that good work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1591\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to strike the prohibition on the transmission of \nabortion-related matters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                   the comstock clean-up act of 1996\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Snowe, \nMoseley-Braun, Boxer, Feingold, Kerry, Simon, and myself, today I am \nintroducing legislation, the Comstock Clean-up Act, to repeal a law \nthat prohibits the transmission of abortion-related information over \nthe Internet and through the mail.\n  Mr. President, freedom of speech is among the most fundamental of \ndemocratic rights. Yet the recently-enacted telecommunications bill \ninclude a little-noticed provision that directly violates this basic \nprinciple.\n  The provision applies to the Internet an archaic law known as the \nComstock Act. The Comstock Act prohibits the interstate transport of \nmaterials that provide information about abortion, or the interstate \ntransport of drugs or devices that are used to perform abortions. These \nprohibitions were first enacted in 1873, and they have been on the \nbooks ever since. Under the law, first-time violators are subject to a \nfine of up to $250,000 and five years in prison.\n  Mr. President, these prohibitions almost certainly are \nunconstitutional. And, fortunately, President Clinton has said that his \nJustice Department will not enforce them.\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\n  Yet many users of the Internet are concerned, and understandably so. \nAfter all, Bill Clinton is a pro-choice President. But what if Pat \nBuchanan wins the Presidency? Or Bob Dole? Zealous prosecutors in their \nadministrations might well use the new law to harass people who are \npro-choice, and to chill speech about abortion over the Internet.\n  In other words, if you distribute information about abortion over the \nInternet today, there's no assurance that you won't be prosecuted next \nyear.\n  Mr. President, anyone prosecuted under this law almost certainly \nwould be able to successfully challenge its constitutionality. Yet who \nwants to be the one innocent American who's forced to defend hereself \nagainst the power of the U.S. Government? The costs of defending \noneself in a criminal case often are enormous. And many Internet users \nwill be unwilling to risk being a test case. Current law therefore \nthreatens to have a severe chilling effect on abortion-related speech.\n  Over the past few years, numerous pro-choice groups, such as the \nNational Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League and Planned \nParenthood, have established home pages on the world wide web. These \nhome pages provide important information about birth control, women's \nhealth, and abortion.\n  Women can also obtain information about clinics in their area over \nthe Internet. Within the last month and a half alone, over 1,500 people \nhave accessed such an Internet site. Under this new law, these 1,500 \npersons potentially could have been arrested, fiend up to $250,000, or \nsent to prison for five years.\n  Mr. President, this law adversely affects people on both sides of the \nabortion issue. Groups opposed to abortion are at risk when they mail \ninformation about abortion providers, just as are those who support \nabortion rights. All Americans should be able to freely discuss \nabortion-related matters, no matter how they might feel about this \nissue.\n  So this bill would repeal the prohibition against the interstate \ntransportation of drugs and articles that produce abortions and the \ndissemination of abortion-related information across State lines. It \nalso would repeal a prohibiton against mailing information about \nabortions, abortion providers and articles or drugs that produce \nabortions.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and \nboth sides of the abortion debate join me in support of this \nlegislation and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill, and \nrelated materials, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1592\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: On February 7, 1996, a lawsuit was filed \n     challenging the constitutionality of a provision of 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1462, as amended by section 507(a)(1) of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996. Sanger, et al. v. Reno, Civ. \n     No. 96-0526 (E.D.N.Y.). Yesterday, a second lawsuit was \n     filed, raising the same challenge to Sec. 1462 along with \n     claims that several other provisions of the \n     Telecommunications Act are unconstitutional. American Civil \n     Liberties Union, et al. v. Reno, Civ. No. 96-963 (E.D. Pa.). \n     This letter relates solely to the claims regarding Sec. 1462, \n     as amended. Plaintiffs in both cases allege that Sec. 1462, \n     as amended, violates the First Amendment insofar as it \n     prohibits the interstate transmission of certain \n     communications regarding abortion via common carrier or via \n     an interactive computer service.\n       This is to inform you that the Department of Justice will \n     not defend the constitutionality of the abortion-related \n     speech provision of Sec. 1462 in those cases, in light of the \n     Department's longstanding policy to decline to enforce the \n     abortion-related speech prohibitions in Sec. 1462 (and in \n     related statutes, i.e., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1461 and 39 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3001) because they are unconstitutional under the First \n     Amendment.\n       In 1981, Attorney General Civiletti informed the Speaker of \n     the House and the President of the Senate that it was the \n     policy of the Department of Justice to refrain from enforcing \n     similar speech prohibitions in two cognate statutes--39 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3001 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1461--with respect to \n     ``cases of truthful and non-deceptive documents containing \n     information on how to obtain a lawful abortion.'' Letter to \n     Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti to the Hon. Thomas P. \n     O'Neill, Jr., at 2 (Jan. 13, 1981). According to the Attorney \n     General, there was ``no doubt'' that those statutes were \n     unconstitutional as applied to such speech. Id. at 1. The \n     Attorney General left open the possibility that the two \n     statutes might still be applied to certain abortion-related \n     commercial speech. Id. at 3. Two years later, the Supreme \n     Court held that Sec. 3001 cannot constitutionally be applied \n     to commercial speech concerning contraception, at least not \n     where the speech in question is truthful and not \n     misleading. Bolger v. Youngs Drug products Corp., 463 U.S. \n     60 (1983). The holding in Bolger would apply equally with \n     respect to abortion-related commercial speech. See Bigelow \n     v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809 (1975).\n       Section 1462 is subject to the same constitutional defect \n     as Sec. Sec. 1461 and 3001 with respect to its application to \n     abortion-related speech and information.\\1\\ As a result of \n     the Department's conclusion that prosecution of abortion-\n     related speech under Sec. 1462 and related statutes would \n     violate the First Amendment, the Department's longstanding \n     policy has been to decline to enforce those statutes with \n     respect to that speech. What is more, we are not aware of any \n     reported decision reflecting a prosecution of abortion-\n     related speech under Sec. 1462.\n       Nothing in the Telecommunications Act provides any reason \n     to alter the Department of Justice's nonenforcement policy. \n     In his signing statement yesterday, the President stated:\n\n       I . . . object to the provision in the Act concerning the \n     transmittal of abortion-related speech and information. \n     Current law, 18 U.S.C. 1462, prohibits transmittal of this \n     information by certain means, and the Act would extend that \n     law to cover transmittal by interactive computer services. \n     The Department of Justice has advised me of its longstanding \n     policy that this and related abortion provisions in current \n     law are unconstitutional and will not be enforced because \n     they violate the First Amendment. The Department has reviewed \n     this provision of S. 652 and advises me that it provides no \n     basis for altering that policy. Therefore, the Department \n     will continue to decline to enforce that provision of current \n     law, amended by this legislation, as applied to abortion-\n     related speech.\n\n       The principal function of Sec. 1462 is to prohibit the \n     interstate carriage of ``obscene, lewd, lascivious, . . . \n     filthy . . . [and] indecent'' materials. See Sec. 1462(a). \n     The Supreme Court has construed this prohibition to be \n     limited to materials that meet the test of ``obscenity'' \n     announced in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).\\2\\ \n     Congress's express purpose in enacting the amendment to \n     Sec. 1462 in Telecommunications Act Sec. 507 was to \n     ``clarify[]'' that obscene materials cannot be transmitted \n     interstate via interactive computer services.\\3\\ In this \n     respect, Sec. 1462 and its amendment in Sec. 507 are \n     constitutionally unobjectionable, and the Department will \n     continue to enforce Sec. 1462 with respect to the transmittal \n     of obscenity.\n       However, Sec. 1462 also prohibits the interstate \n     transmission of certain communications regarding abortion. As \n     amended by Sec. 507 of the Telecommunications Act, Sec. 1462 \n     provides, in pertinent part, that it shall be a felony to:\n\n     knowingly use[] any express company or other common carrier \n     or interactive computer service . . .  for carriage in \n     interstate or foreign commerce [of] . . .\n       (c) any . . . written or printed card, letter, circular, \n     book, pamphlet, advertisement, or notice of any kind giving \n     information, directly or indirectly, where, how, or of whom, \n     or by what means any [drug, medicine, article, or thing \n     designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion] may be \n     obtained or made.\n\n     Thus, on its face, Sec. 1462 prohibits the use of an \n     interactive computer service for ``carriage in interstate . . \n     . commerce'' of any information concerning ``any drug, \n     medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended \n     for producing abortion.'' \\4\\\n       It plainly would be unconstitutional to enforce Sec. 1462 \n     with respect to speech or information concerning abortion, \n     because the restriction on abortion-related speech is \n     impermissibly content-based. This conclusion is confirmed \n     by the judicial and Executive Branch treatment of similar \n     prohibitions on speech concerning abortion and \n     contraception, contained in two cognate statutes, 39 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3001 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1461. Section 3001 \n     provides that abortion and contraception-related speech is \n     ``nonmailable''; and Sec. 1461 makes such mailing subject \n     to criminal sanctions. In 1972, a district court declared \n     that Sec. 3001 was unconstitutional insofar as it rendered \n     abortion-related speech ``nonmailable.'' Atlanta Coop. \n     News Project v. United States Postal Serv., 350 F. Supp. \n     234, 238-39 (N.D. Ga. 1972).\\5\\ The next year, another \n     district court declared both Sec. 3001 and Sec. 1461 \n     unconstitutional as applied to noncommercial\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\n     speech concerning abortion and contraception. Associated \n     Students for Univ. of California at Riverside v. Attorney \n     General, 368 F.Supp. 11, 21-24 (C.D. Calif. 1973). As the \n     Attorney General later explained to the Congress, the \n     Solicitor General declined to appeal the decisions in \n     Atlanta Coop. News Project and Associated Students ``on \n     the ground that 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1461 and 39 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3001(e) were constitutionally indefensible'' as \n     applied to abortion-related speech. See Letter of Attorney \n     General Benjamin R. Civiletti to the Hon. Thomas P. \n     O'Neill, Jr., at 2 (Jan. 13, 1981). And, as explained \n     above, in 1981 the Attorney General informed the Congress \n     that the Department of Justice would decline to enforce \n     Sec. Sec. 1461 and 3001 in cases of truthful and non-\n     deceptive documents containing information on how to \n     obtain a lawful abortion.\n       Nothing in recent Supreme Court law respecting the First \n     Amendment has affected the conclusions reached by the \n     district courts in Atlanta Coop. News Project and Associated \n     Students, the 1981 opinion of Attorney General Civiletti, or \n     the Supreme Court's decision in Bolger. Indeed, the Supreme \n     Court on several recent occasions has strongly reaffirmed the \n     principle that the First Amendment, subject only to narrow \n     and well-understood exceptions not applicable here, ``does \n     not countenance governmental control over the content of \n     messages expressed by private individuals.'' Turner \n     Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458-59 \n     (1994) (citing R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 \n     (1992); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989)).\n       In the Sanger case, Judge Sifton yesterday denied \n     plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order after \n     the United States Attorney represented that the Department's \n     policy is to decline to enforce the pertinent provision of \n     Sec. 1462. Judge Sifton further ruled that a three-judge \n     court hearing on any dispositive motions will be convened \n     next month, after briefing. In the ACLU case before Judge \n     Buckwalter, the Government is due to respond to a motion for \n     a TRO on February 14, 1996. In accordance with the practice \n     of the Department, I am informing the Congress that in \n     neither case will the Department of Justice defend the \n     constitutionality of the provision of Sec. 1462 that \n     prohibits speech concerning abortion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Janet Reno.\n\n                               Footnotes\n\n       \\1\\ The only material difference between Sec. 1462 and the \n     cognate prohibitions in Sec. Sec. 1461 and 3001 is that \n     Sec. 1462 regulates interstate ``carriage'' of information by \n     common carrier, rather than dissemination of that information \n     through the mail. This distinction is not material to the \n     constitutional issue in this context.\n       \\2\\ See Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 114 (1974); \n     United States v.

I am writing to lend NARAL's \n     strong support to legislation your introducing today which \n     seeks to delete the ban on abortion-related speech from the \n     1873 Comstock Law governing the importation or transportation \n     of obscene matters. A little noticed provision in the \n     recently passed 1996 Telecommunications Act resurrects and \n     expands the 123 year old law, making it a federal crime to \n     use interactive computer systems to provide or receive \n     information about abortion.\n       As an organization committed to ensuring that American \n     women have access to all information relating to reproductive \n     health care services, we and other pro-choice organizations \n     have filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York to \n     block this criminal ban on abortion related speech on the \n     Internet.\n       Millions of Americans use the Internet to communicate with \n     other Americans and to read information on a wide range of \n     topics. The Internet provides an unprecedented opportunity to \n     provide critical information about women's reproductive \n     rights and health. Without swift passage of your legislation, \n     millions of American women could lose access to vital \n     information they need to make informed, responsible decisions \n     about their reproductive health. I applaud your efforts to \n     remove this anachronistic ban on abortion-related speech and \n     your commitment to ensuring that American women have access \n     to vital reproductive health care information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kate Michelman,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       The Center for Reproductive\n\n\n                                               Law and Policy,\n\n                                      New York, NY, March 5, 1996.\n     Hon.

Sec. 1462(c) is an affront to the First Amendment \n     rights of our plaintiffs, as well as all reproductive health \n     care professionals, women's civil rights activists, students, \n     and particularly women seeking information in order to make \n     comprehensive reproductive health care decisions. 18 U.S.C. \n     1462(c)'s ban on abortion information on the Internet is \n     broad enough to encompass a wide range of activities, \n     including advertisement of abortions services; transmission \n     of chemical formulas for drugs that can be used to induce \n     abortion; purchase or sale of medical equipment used in \n     abortion procedures; and computer bulletin boards or World \n     Wide Web sites that tell women where they can obtain \n     abortions.\n       While anti-choice forces promote coercive so-called \n     ``informed consent'' laws requiring health care professionals \n     to recite a litany of unwanted and misleading information to \n     women seeking abortions, they simultaneously enact provisions \n     such as 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1462(c) which deny women access to \n     real health care information about abortion.\n       18 U.S.C. Sec. 1462(c) must be repealed. Not only does it \n     threaten the First Amendment, jeopardize free flow of medical \n     information, and exclude issues critical to women from new \n     communications technology, it also reflects a broader agenda \n     to drive abortion underground by characterizing this health \n     care as an illicit procedure.\n       For these reasons, we applaud your efforts to repeal \n     Sec. 1462(c) as a necessary step toward safeguarding women's \n     health and providing women the information they need to make \n     thoughtful and responsible health care decisions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kathryn Kolbert.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Planned Parenthood\n\n\n                                       of New York City, Inc.,\n\n                                  New York, NY, February 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: We thank you for introducing \n     critical legislation to repeal the ``abortion gag rule'' \n     portion of the Telecommunications Act.\n       We are gratified that pro-choice leaders like you are \n     battling this misguided attempt to turn back the clock 80 \n     years--to 1916, when the Comstock Law was used to jail my \n     grandmother and Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger. \n     It is shocking to realize that I, too, could be jailed for \n     violating the same law, having published on the Internet our \n     brochure ``How to Find A Safe Abortion Clinic.'' At times \n     like these it is reassuring to know that we can count on some \n     voices of reason in Congress: those who understand that the \n     freedom to speak about sexual and reproductive health issues, \n     including information on safe abortion services are rights \n     protected by our Constitution.\n       Planned Parenthood of New York City deeply appreciates your \n     courageous stance to protect and advance the rights of all \n     Americans. We stand ready to help you in any way we can, and \n     hope you will call on us to do so.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alexander C.

Reno, the \n     lawsuit challenging recently enacted restrictions on the \n     dissemination of information and material about abortion. \n     CARLA-North maintains a site on the World Wide Web and uses \n     the Internet to provide information about abortion and \n     reproductive rights--activities proscribed under the Comstock \n     Act as amended by the telecommunications bill recently passed \n     by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton.\n       CARAL-North believes that the protection of women's health \n     and women's rights requires the greatest possible \n     availability of information about where, when and how women \n     can obtain safe and legal abortions. Legislation like 18 \n     U.S.C. 1462(c)--which restricts or prohibits the spread of \n     such information and the transport of materials used\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\n     in performing legal, accepted medical procedures--has no \n     place in this society.\n       CARAL-North commends your work to protect women's rights \n     and health by removing this barrier to reproductive health, \n     and thanks you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ann G.

Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, 506 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: On behalf of the Feminist \n     Majority, I am writing to support your effort to repeal the \n     ban on abortion information on the Internet found in 18 \n     U.S.C. 1462(c). The Feminist Majority is one of the \n     plaintiffs in the Sanger v. Reno case, a federal case \n     challenging this ban.\n       Use of 18 U.S.C. 1462(c) is an affront to the First \n     Amendment rights of the Feminist Majority and the other \n     plaintiffs, as well as all reproductive health care \n     professionals, women's civil rights activists, students, and \n     particularly women seeking information in order to make \n     comprehensive reproductive health care decisions. 18 U.S.C. \n     1462(c) is broad enough to encompass a wide range of \n     activities, including advertisement of abortion services over \n     the Internet; Internet transmission of chemical formulas for \n     drugs that can be used to induce abortion; purchase or sale \n     of medical equipment used in abortion procedures over the \n     Internet; and computer bulletin boards or World Wide Web \n     sites that tell women where they can obtain abortions.\n       While anti-choice forces promote coercive so-called \n     ``informed consent'' laws requiring health care professionals \n     to recite a litany of unwanted and misleading information to \n     women seeking abortions, they simultaneously promote \n     provisions such as 18 U.S.C. 1462(c) which deny women access \n     to real health care information about abortion. The ban must \n     be repealed not only because it threatens the First \n     Amendment, jeopardizes the free flow of medical information, \n     and excludes issues critical to women from new communications \n     technology, but also because it is part of a broader agenda \n     to drive abortion underground by characterizing this health \n     care as an illicit procedure.\n       For these reasons, we applaud your efforts to repeal \n     Section 1462(c) with the Freedom to Choose Internet \n     Information Act of 1996 as a necessary step toward \n     safeguarding women's health and providing women the \n     information they need to make thoughtful and responsible \n     health care decisions. Thank you for your courage in \n     undertaking this repeal effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Eleanor Smeal,\n                                                President.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 1593. A bill to amend the National Security Act of 1947 to provide \nfor the appointment of two Deputy Directors of Central Intelligence, to \nstrengthen the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence over \nelements of the Intelligence Community, and for other purposes; to the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence.\n\n\n               the intelligence organization act of 1996\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition, reasonably briefly, \nto introduce legislation proposed by the Brown Commission on the \nreorganization of the U.S. intelligence community.\n  The Brown Commission, which filed its report last Friday, March 1, \ntoday testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which I \nchair, and, as a courtesy, Senator Kerrey, the distinguished vice \nchairman of the committee, and I are introducing their legislative \npackage.\n  The Brown Commission came to some very important conclusions, many of \nwhich I agree with, some of which I do not agree with.\n  I think they made an important statement on the need for continuing \nU.S. intelligence activities because there are still many dangers in \nthe world, notwithstanding the demise of the Soviet Union. They have \ntaken a step to eliminate secrecy by their recommendation on the \ndisclosure of the total Intelligence Committee budget, a position \nadopted on the floor of this body several years ago but overturned in \nconference. The suggestion, I think, is very, very important as a start \non declassification. My sense has been, in so many documents that \ncrossed my desk as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, many are \nclassified that need not be classified. As we have seen from the recent \nslush fund in the NRO, the National Reconnaissance Office, there is a \nneed for public scrutiny, investigative reporting, so we have a better \nidea as to what is going on in the intelligence community. Where there \nis a need for secrecy--and I think the presumption ought to be in favor \nof secrecy, but it ought not to be absolute--if there is a need for \nsecrecy, then let us maintain that secrecy, but let us not do so as a \nmatter of rote, only as a matter of reason.\n  The Brown Commission came to the conclusion that the Director of \nCentral Intelligence needs to have his or her hand strengthened. \nSenator Kerrey and I agree with that. But there is considerable feeling \non the Intelligence Committee that we need to go further on that \nparticular line.\n  When the Brown Commission says that an enormous amount of \nintelligence community work ought to stay in the Department of Defense, \nI have grave reservations about that. It is true that the Department of \nDefense is the customer and the Department of Defense provides a great \ndeal of the resources. But, if you have agencies like NRO, NSA, and so \nmuch of HUMINT--human intelligence--remaining under the Department of \nDefense, it does not give the Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency the authority that he needs to really be able to operate.\n  One of the very serious problems in the intelligence community today \nis an attitudinal problem. We saw that in the Aldrich Ames matter. We \nhave seen it in the investigation on Guatemala, where, in a hearing, \none of our Members, Senator Cohen, was very blunt in an open hearing \nsaying that the CIA had lied in withholding information from the \noversight committee.\n  Testimony was taken by the committee from a veteran of the CIA on the \nissue of Soviet domination in sending tainted material back to the CIA, \nwhich the CIA had known to be tainted, controlled by Soviet sources, \nand yet that information was passed on to the highest levels, one key \nbit of information going to the White House in January of 1993 for both \nthe President and the President-elect.\n  When questioned by the Intelligence Committee, this ranking, ex-CIA \nofficial said, ``Well, we pass it on. We know better than the \ncustomers. If we told them it was tainted, they wouldn't use it.'' \nReally, an incomprehensible sort of a situation.\n  I think Director Deutch has done a very good job in his few months at \nthe CIA. He faces a very, very difficult situation. When he concurred \nin testimony before the commission as to a Guatemala incident, that \nthere had been willful failure to disclose, he later changed that view \nin a letter to the Intelligence Committee a few days later, showing the \ndifficulties of being the Director of the CIA compared with a more \nindependent role or at least a different role than the Senate \nIntelligence Committee has.\n  We also heard testimony today from former Senator, former majority \nleader Howard Baker of a very important nature, including Senator \nBaker's recommendation that there be a combination of the Senate and \nthe House Intelligence Committees, a recommendation that at least \npreliminarily I agree with. We will have to pursue it and have \nhearings. But it is more than worth considering. It is something that \nreally is an idea whose time, probably, has come. I am just limiting \nthe final decision until we do have a hearing process and collaborate \nwith our counterparts in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, today Senator Robert Kerrey and I are \nintroducing legislation as a courtesy to the Commission on the Roles \nand Capabilities of the United States Intelligence Community. In August \n1994, the Senate adopted a provision establishing this Commission to \n``review the efficacy and appropriateness of the activities of the \nUnited States Intelligence Community in the post-cold-war global \nenvironment.'' On March 1, 1996, the Commission submitted its report, \nentitled ``Preparing for the 21st Century, An Appraisal of U.S. \nIntelligence.'' In addition, the Commission submitted proposed \nlegislation to implement some of its proposals. We are introducing the \nCommission's proposed legislative package today at their request. It is \nour hope that other Members of the Senate and the public at large can \nparticipate fully in the upcoming debate on this important issue. \nMoreover, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence intends to use \nthis legislation, and other Commission recommendations, as a basis for \nadditional proposals of the committee.\n  The legislation proposed by the Commission would make a number of\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\nchanges in the way the intelligence community is organized and managed. \nFirst, it replaces the current Deputy Director of Intelligence with two \nnew Deputies: one to manage the community and one to manage the Central \nIntelligence Agency. In addition, it amends the National Security Act \nto require DCI concurrence with respect to the appointment by the \nSecretary of Defense of the heads of the National Security Agency \n[NSA], the Central Imagery Office [CIO], and the National \nReconnaissance Office [NRO]. In addition, its requires consultation \nwith the DCI by the Secretaries of Defense, State, and Energy, as well \nas the Director of FBI, before the appointment of the heads of the \nintelligence elements within these agencies. This bill also mandates \nthat the DCI provide to the Secretary of Defense an evaluation of the \nperformance of the heads of NSA, NRO and the proposed National Imagery \nand Mapping Agency. The Commission's legislation also replaces the \nNational Intelligence Council with a National Assessments Center that \nwould remain under the purview of the DCI but would be located outside \nthe CIA to take advantage of a broader range of information and \nexpertise.\n  The most extensive aspect of this legislation is that which addresses \npersonnel issues. The Commission is proposing new legislative authority \nfor the most severely affected intelligence agencies, for 1 year, to \n``rightsize'' their work forces to the needs of their organization. \nAgencies wishing to downsize by at least 10 percent over and above the \ncurrent congressionally mandated levels would identify positions to be \neliminated ``in order to achieve more effectively and efficiently the \nmission of the agencies concerned.'' The incumbents of such positions, \nif close to retirement, would be allowed to retire with accelerated \neligibility. If not close to retirement, they would be provided \ngenerous pay and benefits to leave the service of the agency concerned, \nor, with the concurrence of the agency affected, exchange positions \nwith an employee not in a position identified for elimination who was \nclose to retirement and would be allowed to leave under the accelerated \nretirement provisions. This bill also creates a single ``senior \nexecutive service'' for the intelligence community under the overall \nmanagement of the DCI.\n  The Commission did an excellent job identifying the key issues and \nthe Vice Chairman and I agree with some of their recommendations, \nparticularly regarding institutional mechanisms for getting the \npolicymakers more involved in identifying and prioritizing their \ninformation needs and for addressing transnational threats, ways to \nimprove intelligence analysis, and the need to enhance accountability \nand oversight--to include declassifying the aggregate amount \nappropriated for the intelligence budget. The committee also will \nconsider the Commission's recommendation to make the Select Committee \non Intelligence a standing committee. However, I believe that the \nCommission did not go far enough in some areas.\n  The changes brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union have \ndramatic implications for U.S. intelligence efforts. The demands for \nrapid responses to diverse threats in a rapidly changing world \nnecessitate a steamlined intelligence community and a DCI with clear \nlines of authority. This is lacking in the intelligence bureaucracy \nthat emerged during the bipolar world of the cold war.\n  As the Commission noted: ``The Intelligence Community * * * has \nevolved over nearly 50 years and now amounts to a confederation of \nseparate agencies and activities with distinctly different histories, \nmissions, and lines of command.'' Recognizing the pitfalls of \ndecentralized intelligence--less attention devoted to non-Defense \nrequirements, waste and duplication, the absence of objective \nevaluation of performance and ability to correct shortcomings, and loss \nof synergy--the Commission supported centralized management of the \nintelligence community by the DCI. The Commission concluded, however, \nthat the DCI has all the authority needed to accomplish this objective \nof centralized management, if only he spent less time on CIA matters \nand had the budget presented to him in a clearer fashion.\n  It is my sense that the current disincentives for intelligence to \noperate as a community, reduce unnecessary waste and duplication, and \nbecome more effective and efficient in meeting the Nation's needs can \nonly be overcome by enhancing the DCI's statutory authority over the \nbudget and administration of all nontactical intelligence activities \nand programs. A key issue for congressional oversight of the \nintelligence community is accountability. It has become increasingly \nclear that a single manager, the DCI, must be accountable for the \nsuccess or failure of the intelligence community. Therefore, the DCI \nmust be given the authorities he needs to carry out this \nresponsibility.\n  For example, the Commission recommends that the DCI concur in the \nappointment or recommendation of the heads of national intelligence \nelements within the Department of Defense, and be consulted with \nrespect to the appointment of other senior officials within the \nintelligence community. We believe the DCI should recommend the \nappointment of all national agency heads, with concurrence from the \nheads of the parent organizations. Along these lines, the heads of the \nmajor collection agencies should be confirmed to that position; today \nthey are confirmed only with respect to their promotion to the rank \ndesignated for each position.\n  The Commission noted in its report: ``The annual budgets for U.S. \nintelligence organizations constitute one of the principal vehicles for \nmanaging intelligence activities, * * *. How effectively and \nefficiently the intelligence community operates is to a large degree a \nfunction of how these budgets are put together and how they are \napproved and implemented.'' I agree with this assessment and conclude \nthat the DCI must have ultimate control over the formulation and \nexecution of these budgets if he or she is to effectively manage the \nintelligence community.\n  The Select Committee on Intelligence will consider these and other \nalternative proposals over the upcoming weeks as we move toward mark-up \nof legislation to renew and reform the U.S. intelligence community to \nmeet the challenges of our changing world.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Chairman Specter \nto introduce legislation. We are embarking on a course to change the \nU.S. intelligence community, and this legislation is the chart upon \nwhich we will be marking that course.\n  Over a year ago, Congress created a Presidential commission to \nevaluate the intelligence community's ability to respond to a rapidly \nchanging world. Sadly, the commission's first chairman, the Honorable \nLes Aspin, passed away after he had ably established the Commission and \nthey had started their work. We owe many debts of gratitude to Les \nAspin, and this legislation is one more example of the fine work he did \nin the service of his country.\n  Chairman Harold Brown and our former colleague, Vice Chairman Warren \nRudman, quickly took the helm, and the Commission embarked on almost a \nyear's evaluation of the U.S. Government's intelligence needs and the \nintelligence community's ability to meet those needs. We are especially \ngrateful to our able colleagues, Senator John Warner and Senator Jim \nExon, who played important and active roles in the Commission's work. \nTheir broad base of experience coupled with the other Commission \nmembers' outstanding credentials permitted a wide variety of views and \nideas to come together. There are no assumptions here. They looked wide \nand deep. They interviewed over 200 experts and received formal \ntestimony from 84 witnesses. It was a remarkable effort which has \nproduced a significant report. I do not concur with all their \nrecommendations, and there are some areas in which they do not go as \nfar as I would. I look on their report as a solid base upon which \nCongress and the administration can build.\n  For me, one of the most important results of their evaluation is \ntheir reaffirmation of the need for intelligence. Intelligence \ncontributes heavily to most of our national decisions about foreign \npolicy, law enforcement, and military matters. I am convinced \nintelligence is the edge we must have in the face of stiff global \ncompetition for leadership, and as our Government fulfills its \nresponsibility to protect Americans in an increasingly dangerous world. \nThe Brown Commission clearly explains why this is so.\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\n  The Brown Commission recognized the world today is very different \nfrom the world which existed while the Intelligence Community was \ngrowing up. Confronted with the overwhelming military threat of the \nSoviet Union, the intelligence community responded by organizing itself \nto examine every part of that military threat as best as it could. \nWhile some critics argue that the intelligence community missed the big \nones--the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet economy--\nthere is no question the United States was ably informed on the \nSoviet Union's military threat. But that threat, while still capable of \nattacking us, is receding.\n\n  Today, the threats, facing the United States do not initially present \nthemselves as military threats--although if we fail to recognize them \nin time, we have to deploy our military when nothing else works. The \nerosion of nation-state power in many places, the rise of transnational \nmovements and global crime, and the fierce economic competition we \nface, have together created a new set of threats that are not military \nsoluble.\n  Insight and predictive analysis is as important in charting the \nAmerican course in this new world as it was in the old world of \nsuperpower military confrontation. We must make sure the intelligence \ncommunity is optimally organized for this new world. That is why I urge \nconsideration of the Brown Commission report, and why the Intelligence \nCommittee will take up these and other reform proposals in the months \nahead.\n  The Brown Commission establishes three recurring themes about \nintelligence: The need to better integrate intelligence into the policy \ncommunity; the need for intelligence agencies to operate as a \ncommunity; the need to create greater efficiency. These themes are \nclearly discernible and they also are quite consistent with a large \nsegment of the public's view on intelligence: Something is wrong. If \neverything was all right, we wouldn't have a heinous spy like Aldrich \nAmes; we wouldn't have missed the fall of the wall or the collapse of \nthe Soviet Union; we wouldn't have a palace for an NRO headquarters \nbuilding; we wouldn't have unspent billions of NRO dollars sitting \naround unused and waiting for a rainy day. I agree that we need to \nbetter integrate intelligence with policy, enhance the effectiveness of \nthe community and improve its efficiency. The time for reorganization \nis upon us.\n  The Brown Commission has made many important recommendations that \naddress each of these themes. The Intelligence Committee will evaluate \nthem closely. But I have already concluded that in some areas the \nCommission did not go far enough to ensure intelligence is integrated, \neffective, and efficient in a world continuing to evolve. In my view, \nthe authorities of the Director of Central Intelligence need to be \nstrengthened beyond what the Commission recommended, and the many \nagencies of the Intelligence Community need to be pulled into a closer \nrelationship. There is no other way to make sure both the national and \nmilitary customer get what they need, and there is also no other way to \nwring redundancy and excess cost out of the system.\n  I do not want leave the impression that U.S. intelligence is broken. \nSomething is wrong, but the Nation is well-served by the men and women \nof the intelligence agencies serving around the world. Their patriotism \nand technical competence is unquestioned. Moreover, the director of \nCentral Intelligence, John Deutch, has brought outstanding leadership \nto the community. Working closely with Secretary Perry, he already has \nset a new course for intelligence. The corporate culture which allowed \nan Aldrich Ames to continue is being dismembered. Congressional \nnotification of significant intelligence activities has never been more \nprompt and complete. We need to institutionalize these changes and the \nsuperb cooperative relationship that exists between Director Deutch and \nSecretary Perry. Intelligence must and will serve all of its customers \nwith timely, comprehensive, and hard-hitting analysis. The Brown \nCommission's recommendations have provided us with the basis to make \nthis happen.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank Chairman Specter for his leadership on \nthis issue. His close attention to the challenges facing the \nintelligence community and their solutions has created an environment \nwhere the committee can draft this legislation in a thoughtful, \ninformed environment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Simon, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Graham, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Pell, Ms. Moseley-Braun, \n        and Mr. Kerry):\n\n  S. 1595. A bill to repeal the emergency salvage timber sale program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n THE RESTORATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES LAWS ON THE PUBLIC LANDS ACT OF \n                                  1996\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto repeal the emergency salvage timber provisions that Congress enacted \nas part of last year's rescissions bill. I believe that the salvage \nrider is one of the biggest mistakes that Congress has made in natural \nresource management in the last 25 years. We need to admit our error \nand correct it as soon as possible with new legislation.\n  Both consciously and unwittingly, last Spring this body endorsed a \nprogram of logging without laws which undermines environmental \nprotections for precious resources and has slight economic \njustification. Even worse, we passed the original rider with little \nunderstanding of its potential impact, without holding hearings, and \nbased on an ``emergency'' that may not exist.\n  Members thought they were voting to remove dead and dying trees from \nour national forests in order to protect forest health and capture the \nremaining value of trees which had been damaged in a series of \ndevastating forest fires. However, the rationale on which the rider was \nbased, deteriorating forest health conditions, the rationale on which \nthe rider was based, is supported by very little data. We lack even \nbasic information to justify cutting trees on the scale endorsed by the \nrider and under conditions which effectively suspend environmental \nlaws, and terminate almost all avenues for administrative and judicial \nappeal.\n  Members were surprised to find that the courts have interpreted the \nlaw to mandate the cutting of some of America's most valuable trees, \nincluding the healthy, old growth forests of western Oregon and \nWashington which have been off-limits to timber sales for years due to \nenvironmental concerns. These forests support a rich mix of fish and \nwildlife, from endangered bird species to commercially important salmon \nand are valuable as well for their own beauty and uniqueness. Yet under \nthe rider these majestic trees might be sold at bargain prices under \noutdated contracts and using outdated environmental terms.\n  This is not just an issue for the Northwest. The rider also requires \nthat the Forest Service offer salvage sales in all regions of the \ncountry including sales that would otherwise be rejected for legitimate \nenvironmental reasons. Although agencies such as the National Marine \nFisheries Service, Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental \nProtection Agency have objected to many of these sales, courts have \nheld that they must go forward, no matter how devastating, because they \nare required by the letter of the law.\n  In addition, the rider undermines President Clinton's consensus \nNorthwest forest plan which took many months to produce and gave some \nhope for settling the region's longstanding timber wars. Instead, under \nthe rider, the timber wars have resumed at full force.\n  Now we have a chance to reverse the mistakes we made last year and \ntake a more measured approach to timber salvage sales. First, my bill \nreturns forestry law to where it was before the rider was passed. Trees \ncan still be cut but environmental laws must be obeyed. I believe it is \nappropriate to completely repeal the salvage rider, not just modify it \naround the edges and invite further confusion from the courts.\n  Second, my bill calls for a study of the forest health issue by the \nNational Academy of Sciences and the General Accounting Office in order \nto determine the extent of the problem and how it can best be \naddressed, both financially and ecologically.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in reversing last year's mistake. It \nis time\n\n[[Page S1604]]\n\nto restore lawful logging on our national forests.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 1595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Bill Bradley in \nintroducing legislation to repeal the timber salvage rider, a law that \nhas permitted destructive logging of ancient forests because it waives \nimportant environmental safeguards.\n  Let me first say that I do not oppose responsible logging on public \nor private lands, as long as it is done in compliance with our \nenvironmental statutes. The fundamental problem with the timber salvage \nprovision as it is currently written, is that it does not comply with \ncurrent Federal protection laws.\n  During debate of the 1995 Rescissions Act, proponents of the \nemergency timber measure stressed the need to remove dead and dying \ntrees to protect the health of our forests in the Pacific Northwest. We \nwere told that the rider would not cost the federal treasury one dime; \nin fact it would make money. We were told that the measure would not \nharm fish and wildlife and that it was needed only to expedite a small \nnumber of outstanding timber sales.\n  In other words, we were told that this rider would be a simple fix to \na small problem and should be added without a congressional hearing or \nreview to an entirely unrelated bill that was moving quickly through \ncongress. As are all too aware, this was the way many anti-\nenvironmental statutes were being sold by the Republican leadership \nduring the 1995 congressional term.\n  Regrettably, we know of the severe environmental damage that this \nstatute has wrought on some of our most beautiful and oldest forest \nlands.\n  We now know that this statute is being used to clearcut healthy \nforests across the Nation including ancient forests as old as 500 \nyears.\n  We know that this statute will cost American taxpayers billions of \ndollars by requiring them to subsidize bargain basement logging of our \nnational forests.\n  We know that timber is being clearcut on steep slopes next to\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\nstreams of spawning endangered salmon.\n  And we now know that the Federal Government is being forced to enter \ninto far more than just a small number of contracts, and in fact, that \nthe effect of this rider will be felt in the logging of national \nforests across the country.\n  I commend the Senator from New Jersey for his leadership on this \nissue, and I hope that the Senate will act expeditiously to enact the \nbill being introduced today and thereby repeal this extremely harmful \nso-called timber salvage rider.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we need our environmental laws back. Old-\ngrowth trees that have stood for 400 years are falling today, and it \nwill the year 2400 before we get them back. We need to restore the \nlaws.\n  To achieve this goal, I have cosponsored two efforts. One is a \nstraight, fundamental attempt to overturn the salvage law, and one that \nis a practical attempt to stop the lawless logging. No one has worked \nharder than Patty Murray to restore economic and ecological balance to \nthe hoax of a ``jobs versus the environment'' campaign. I am proud to \nbe an original cosponsor of her effort.\n  Senator Bradley, ranking Democrat on the Forests and Public Land \nManagement Subcommittee, has taken the lead to simply overturn one of \nthe worst environmental laws Congress has considered in years. As soon \nas the so-called salvage law passed, industry sued to cut the big old-\ngrowth trees. This will be a difficult bill to overturn, especially \nsince we still have the same Congress through which it originally \npassed. Nonetheless, I am a proud original cosponsor of Senator \nBradley's bill to repeal the salvage rider.\n  Proponents of logging without laws say that they must cut, build \nroads, risk mudslides, threaten fisheries, and scar the forest to \ncreate jobs. The facts don't support this twisted rationale. There were \nmore than 14,200 new jobs in the Rocky Mountain-Pacific Northwest \ntimber industry from 1992 until Congress forced through the rider, and \nthe sector was still growing. Oregon had the lowest unemployment in a \ngeneration. We did not need to derail steady responsible growth with a \nreturn to the conflicts of the 1980's. Unfortunately, some groups have \nbought into the gluttony of the salvage rider, but have forgotten about \nputting food on the table for working families when the salvage free-\nfor-all days are over.\n  Our No. 1 priority should be to restore stability to working families \nin rural communities. No one can tolerate another short-term logging \nbinge. The current rider is bringing conflict. When it is repealed or \nexpires, workers face another round of economic instability while we \nstruggle with environmental triage on the forest resource.\n  But most importantly, we need to restore the environmental laws that \nthis Congress suspended. The Forest Service is poised to release \nhundreds of millions of board feet of timber, and we must not leave the \ndoor open for such abuse. Both bills are steps in the right direction, \nand I hope we can unsaddle the salvage rider very soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

                      CHINA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Simon, and Mr. \nMack) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 43\n\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China, in a clear attempt \n     to intimidate the people and Government of Taiwan, has over \n     the past 8 months conducted a series of military exercises, \n     including missile tests, within alarmingly close proximity to \n     Taiwan;\n       Whereas on March 5, 1996, the Xinhua News Agency announced \n     that the People's Republic of China will conduct missile \n     tests from March 8 through March 15, 1996, within 25 to 35 \n     miles of the 2 principal northern and southern ports of \n     Taiwan, Kaohsiung and Keelung;\n       Whereas the proximity of these tests to the ports and the \n     accompanying warnings for ships and aircraft to avoid the \n     test areas will result in the effective blockading of the \n     ports, and the probable disruption of international shipping, \n     for the duration of the tests;\n       Whereas these tests are a clear escalation of the attempts \n     by the People's Republic of China to intimidate Taiwan and \n     influence the outcome of the upcoming democratic presidential \n     election in Taiwan;\n       Whereas the decision of the United States to establish \n     diplomatic relations with the Peoples' Republic of China \n     rested upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan would \n     be settled solely by peaceful means;\n       Whereas the strong interest of the United States in the \n     peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question is one of the \n     central premises of the three United States-China Joint \n     Communiques and was codified in the Taiwan Relations Act;\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act states that peace and \n     stability in the western Pacific ``are in the political, \n     security, and economic interests of the United States, and \n     are matters of international concern'';\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act states that the United \n     States considers ``any effort to determine the future of \n     Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts, \n     or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the \n     western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United \n     States'';\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act directs the President to \n     ``inform Congress promptly of any threat to the security or \n     the social or economic system of the people on Taiwan and any \n     danger to the interests of the United States arising \n     therefrom'';\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act further directs that ``the \n     President and the Congress shall determine, in accordance \n     with constitutional process, appropriate action by the United \n     States in response to any such danger'';\n       Whereas the United States, the People's Republic of China, \n     and the Government of Taiwan have each previously expressed \n     their commitment to the resolution of the Taiwan question \n     through peaceful means; and\n       Whereas these missile tests and accompanying statements \n     made by the Government of the People's Republic of China call \n     into serious question the commitment of China to the peaceful \n     resolution of the Taiwan question: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the United States deplores the missile tests that the \n     People's Republic of China will conduct from March 8 through \n     March 15, 1996, and views them as a threat to the peace, \n     security, and stability of Taiwan and not in the spirit of \n     the three United States Joint Communiques;\n       (2) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     cease it bellicose actions directed at Taiwan and instead \n     enter into meaningful dialogue with the Government of Taiwan \n     at the highest levels, such as through the Straits Exchange \n     Foundation in Taiwan and the Association for Relations Across \n     the Taiwan Straits in Beijing, with an eye towards decreasing \n     tensions and resolving the issue of the future of Taiwan;\n       (3) the President, consistent with section 3(c) of the \n     Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3302(c)), should immediately \n     consult with Congress on an appropriate United States \n     response to the tests; and\n       (4) the President should, consistent with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), reexamine the nature \n     and quantity of defense articles and services that may be \n     necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-\n     defense capability in light of the heightened threat.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today as the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to submit Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 43, expressing the sense of the Congress \nregarding proposed missile tests in the Taiwan Straits.\n  Yesterday, the People's Republic of China announced that it would \nconduct a series of missile tests from March 8 through March 15, 1996, \noff the coast of Taiwan. While the Chinese have conducted other tests \nwithin close proximity to Taiwan in the past 8 months, these are \nespecially provocative. The People's Republic of China has announced \nthat it will conduct these tests within between 25 and 35 miles of the \nTaiwan port cities of Kaohsiung and Keelung. The effect will be that, \nfor a week, a wide corridor of ocean both immediately north and south \nof Taiwan will be unsafe for commercial traffic. Thus, the People's \nRepublic of China has knowingly created what is in effect a blockade of \nthese two ports--through which flows more than 70 percent of Taiwan's \nship-borne trade--for the duration of the tests. In addition, the tests \ncome just a week before Taiwan's first fully democratic Presidential \nelections on March 23. Clearly, the tests are part of the People's \nRepublic of China's ongoing attempts to intimidate Taiwan and influence \nthe upcoming elections.\n  It is both the proximity to Taiwan and the timing that make these \ntests especially troubling to me, and the signal they send.\n  When we normalized relations with the People's Republic of China in \n1978 and 1979, we did so on the expectation that the future of Taiwan \nwould be settled solely by peaceful means. That expectation underlies \nthe three United States-People's Republic of China joint communiques, \nand is codified in the Taiwan Relations Act, the statute that governs \nour relationship with Taiwan.\n\n  However, these tests and accompanying statements made at the highest \nlevels of the Chinese Government in my mind call into serious question \nthe People's Republic of China's commitment to settle the Taiwan issue \nby peaceful means. As such, they are of grave concern to me and, I \nbelieve, to the United States.\n  I hope that the People's Republic of China would move to diffuse the \nescalating problems in the straits and refrain from further \nprovocations. At the same time, I hope that the Taiwan Government would \ndo its part to reduce tensions. Both sides need to sit down with each \nother, and discuss the issue in a considered and rational manner, \nwithout threats and without the need to continually draw the United \nStates into what is a matter solely for the Chinese on both sides of \nthe straits--and Mr. President, I emphasize both sides--to decide. It \nis not an issue for the People's Republic of China to decide \nunilaterally at the barrel of a gun.\n  Mr. President, the resolution is fairly self explanatory.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me note that I am pleased to be joined \nby Senator Helms, the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senators Murkowski and Simon, two longstanding leaders on \nthe issue of Taiwan in the Senate, and Senator Mack, in submitting this \nlegislation today; I thank them for their support. I hope the rest of \nour colleagues will join us so that we can move this resolution quickly \nthrough the Senate and on the House.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Craig \nThomas, chairman of the East Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee of the \nForeign Relations Committee in offering this resolution that reaffirms \nthe Taiwan Relations Act and condemns the People's Republic of China \nfor their attempts to influence the upcoming Presidential election in \nTaiwan through threats and coercion.\n  The resolution has been submitted to the Chair previously by Senator \nThomas. This resolution makes four important points.\n  First, the United States deplores the missile test scheduled for \nMarch 8 to 15. It appears that these tests will impose a virtual \nblockade of Taiwan's two major ports and threaten international \nshipping lanes in the Taiwan Straits.\n  Second, the Congress calls on the People's Republic of China to cease \nits threats, and instead enter into a constructive dialog with the \nRepublic of China, perhaps through their respective informal \norganizations: the Straits Exchange Foundation in Taiwan and the \nAssociation for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits in Beijing.\n  Third, the resolution directs the President of the United States to \nconsult with the Congress, as required by the Taiwan Relations Act, \nbecause there is a threat to the security and the social and economic \nsystem of the people of Taiwan.\n  Fourth, the President and the Congress should reexamine the nature \nand quantity of the defense articles and\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\nservices that may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a \nsufficient self-defense capability in light of the heightened threat.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that President Nixon must be simply spinning \nin his grave tonight. When Richard Nixon first opened relations with \nBeijing some 20 years ago he believed that Asia could not progress if \nChina remained isolated. His actions promised to help that country \nenter into a new and constructive relationship with the rest of the \nmodern world. But in recent months, the leaders of Beijing have taken a \nnumber of self-defeating actions that can only turn back the pages of \nhistory and cripple China's economic progress.\n  Over the past 8 months, the People's Republic of China has conducted \na series of military exercises, including missile tests, in close \nproximity to Taiwan. Now, we hear reports of the largest and closest \nmilitary exercise to take place next week, just 1 week before the first \ndemocratic Presidential elections on Taiwan. What is more, Beijing has \nreportedly included veiled threats against the United States for \nsupporting the process of free elections. One news report indicated \nthat during an interview, a Chinese leader scoffed at the notion that \nthe United States would defend Taiwan by saying the United States cares \nmore about ``Los Angeles than Taiwan.'' China, of course, produces \nmissiles capable of launching nuclear warheads against both Taiwan and \nLos Angeles, and certainly against my home State of Alaska.\n  I feel confident that these reports, of course, are false, but \nChina's most recent announcement that it intends to conduct massive \ntests near Taiwan, in effect imposing a miniblockade of Taiwan's two \nmajor ports prior to the Taiwan Presidential elections, does little to \ninspire confidence.\n  Some China watchers are inclined to rationalize Beijing's behavior. \nApologists have blamed China's belligerence on the firm stand taken by \nthis Congress. Today it is clear that China, not the Congress, is to \nblame for the current state of United States-China relations. Time and \ntime again, before and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square attack on \nstudent protesters, China's rulers have shown themselves to be almost \noblivious to the fact that a larger world--a world sensitive to human \nrights concerns, one that believes in religious and political freedom, \nand free and fair trade--exists beyond the People's Republic of China's \nborders.\n  People's Republic of China's President Jiang Zemin and his \nlieutenants must understand that this is why the United States finds \nChina's ballistic missile diplomacy unacceptable. We support the \npeaceful settlement of differences between China and Taiwan and cannot \nidly watch a peaceful, democratic ally--which Taiwan is--be threatened.\n  Therefore, it is time for Congress, as set forth in this Senate \nresolution, to recommit the United States to the Taiwan Relations Act \nof 1979, which clearly states that America believes that peace and \nstability in the area are in the political, security and economic \ninterests of the United States.\n  Further, the law of the land, the Taiwan Relations Act, commits the \nUnited States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion \nthat would jeopardize the security or the social or economic system of \nthe people of Taiwan.\n  We must remind Beijing that the decision of the United States to \nestablish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in \n1979 was based upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be \ndetermined by peaceful means.\n  We also must continue selling Taiwan defensive weapons to help \ncounter any thoughts China may have of using military force against the \nisland. Along with these weapons, we must let the leaders in Beijing \nknow that threats are useless as tools of foreign policy and are the \nrusted relics of diplomacy from a bygone and dangerous era.\n  China's leaders must know economic gains will evaporate if continued \nmilitary threats--or worse--create havoc in East Asia. Beijing's \nofficials must understand they cannot conduct business as usual with \nthe world if missiles start falling in the Straits of Taiwan. They also \nneed to know that the fear of war is often every bit as chilling to \ninvestment as the real thing.\n  Mr. President, I also want to add that Congress should congratulate \nthe people of Taiwan for their continued advancement toward democracy. \nCongress should also state our support for the people of Taiwan to \nbecome involved in international organizations. Taiwan has emerged as a \nforce for democracy and stability in Asia, and its people should be \nrepresented. The United States must also continue at the same time to \nencourage a true dialog between Beijing and Taipei that will lead to \nunderstanding and conciliation, rather than threats and confrontation.\n  With this latest round of threats against Taiwan--and the United \nStates--it simply is time to step back and gather forces to support \nreason and dialog rather than the rumblings of hostility and war.\n  President Nixon was certainly correct in seeing the vast potential \nimportance of China as a world economic power. But 25 years later the \nworld still waits for Beijing to abandon its totalitarian ways and \nbehave consistently as a civilized nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1605-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1607-S1608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, once again, terrorists have \ntargeted the heart of Israel. My prayers are with the people of Israel \nas they mourn the latest victims. Over 60 people have died in the \nterror of the last 10 days, and the peace process may die as well.\n  We cannot understand the kind of evil and cowardice that kills \nchildren as they walk to a party; families as they walk down the street \non a holiday; ordinary and innocent people on their way to work. They \ntime their attacks to kill as many civilians as possible. They load \ntheir bombs with nails--to make sure that all injuries are serious. \nTheir goal is to kill Jews and to strike a death knell on the peace \nprocess.\n  Israelis are angry and afraid. Their confidence in the peace process \nis badly shaken--and I don't blame them. They have given up land and \nsecurity in exchange for peace. Yet they still live under constant \nthreat.\n  We must stand by Israel as a friend and ally. I support the \nPresident's plan to provide immediate assistance to Israel. The United \nStates will use our intelligence agencies to help them route out these \nterrorists. We will provide specialized explosive detection equipment \nand technical experts. And America will lead an international effort to \nbetter coordinate the war against terrorism. Only an international \neffort will track down these killers and those who bankroll them. The \ninternational community must also condemn these acts of terrorism--and \nensure that no country provides a sanctuary for these killers.\n  The Palestinian Authority can and must do more to stop Hamas. If they \ndon't show the will to confront terrorism, the chance for peace will be \nlost.\n  I hope that the peace process can continue. But friends do not tell \nfriends what to do. As Americans, we cannot tell Israel what risks are \nworth taking for peace. We can only imagine what it is to live in a \ncountry that is less than 9 miles wide at its narrowest point--and \nstill surrounded by enemies.\n  Israel has defended itself in five wars for survival. But in this war \nagainst terrorism, all ordinary citizens are on the front lines. The \ninternational community must stand with Israel. We must ensure that the \nfanatics do not prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1608-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING THE U.S. TAP TEAM\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Not only has Ms. Blegen been awarded the 1995 \nMinnesota Teacher of the Year, but she has also been selected as one of \nthe four distinguished finalists for the National Teacher of the Year \nprogram. Ms. Blegen arrived in Washington Sunday and has been giving a \npresentation sharing her dedication to the youth of Minnesota, \nattending press conferences, and giving interviews for the National \nTeacher of the Year Award. Despite her rigorous schedule I was \ndelighted to meet with Ms. Blegen to give her my support and of course \nwish her the best in the competition.\n  Mary Beth Blegen a dedicated educator for 30 years, is a teacher of \nEnglish, writing, and humanities at Worthington Senior High School. Ms. \nBlegen illustrates the dedication Minnesotans have to providing quality \neducation for our children. It is also my honor to note that three \nprevious National Teachers of the Year have been from Minnesota and \nonly California has contributed more teachers to this national award.\n  I'd also like to recognize Minnesota's biggest education \norganization, the Minnesota Education Association [MEA], and it's \n48,000 members, who represent over 80 percent of Minnesota's public \nschool teachers.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2778, just received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2778) to provide that members of the Armed \n     Forces performing services for the peacekeeping efforts in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Macedonia, shall be \n     entitled to tax benefits in the same manner as if such \n     services were performed in a combat zone, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the House recently passed legislation to \nprovide much needed tax relief for American troops who are performing \npeacekeeping services in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Macedonia.\n  When our young men and women wear our uniform in these war-torn \nregions, I want them to know that they have my unqualified support. I \nwant them to know that they are there for a reason. They are on \nimportant missions--missions to help free these war-torn areas from \ntheir undemocratic pasts.\n  While I would have preferred to limit our involvement to strategic \nand tactical air and sea support, we must now give our full support to \nour troops. This legislation provides much needed tax relief for our \ntroops in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia.\n  Let me briefly outline the major aspects of this legislation. First, \nthe bill exempts from Federal income tax military pay received by \nenlisted personnel while performing peacekeeping services in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia.\n  Second, the bill exempts military pay received by commissioned \nofficers while serving in those areas in an amount equal to the highest \nmonthly pay for enlisted personnel which is currently $4,104.80 per \nmonth.\n  Third, military pay received by those hospitalized as a result of \ninjuries incurred while performing peacekeeping\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\nservices would be exempt from Federal income tax for up to 2 years \nafter termination of peacekeeping activities in the hazardous duty \narea.\n  Fourth, the bill extends the time for filing tax returns, paying tax \nand other deadlines to allow our troops to focus on their dangerous \ntask rather than on tax deadlines.\n  Fifth, the bill reduces Federal estate taxes and forgives Federal \nincome taxes for those whose lives are taken while performing the \npeacekeeping mission. Let me just say that I am deeply troubled that \nsimilar relief was not provided to Americans killed while serving in \nSomalia.\n\n  Sixth, the bill eliminates tax withholding on military pay earned \ntax-free in these hazardous duty areas.\n  Seventh, the bill provides special rules for surviving spouses and \ncouples who file joint tax returns, as well as an exemption from the \ntelephone excise tax for calls made from the hazardous duty area.\n  Finally, in addition to the tax relief for military personnel in the \nhazardous duty areas, the bill also postpones various tax deadlines for \nsupport personnel. To be eligible for such tax relief, the individual \nmust be deployed away from such individual's regular duty station and \nperforming services outside the United States as part of Operation \nJoint Endeavor. Such relief would be available to Department of Defense \nemployees.\n  I fully support this legislation and encourage the Senate to pass it \nquickly to ease the tax burden and tax filing requirements on our \ncourageous American troops who are serving in these hazardous duty \nareas.\n Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today is a significant day for our \ntroops in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia. Today the \nSenate will pass important legislation that will provide tax relief to \nour military forces deployed in the former Yugoslavia.\n  This relief is essential to ensure that the Internal Revenue Service \ndoes not make life more difficult for our soldiers than the rigors of \ntheir Bosnian duty has already. Speaker Gingrich and I announced in \nDecember our intention to send to the President tax filing and other \nrelief for our soldiers. Earlier this week the House passed the \nlegislation and I am pleased that the Senate is doing so today.\n  I believe that it is critical for Congress to continue demonstrating \nits unequivocal support for our men and women in uniform involved in \nOperation Joint Endeavor and Operation Able Sentry. Our troops have \nmore important things to focus on than compiling records, meeting \npaperwork deadlines, or computing their tax liability. And they should \nreceive income and estate tax relief for participating in the \noperations.\n  I thank my colleagues for voting with me to pass this critical \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. \n2778, a bill designed to provide tax relief for our service men and \nwomen participating in Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia. This bill is \nvery similar to S. 1553, a bill I introduced in the Senate on February \n1, 1996, mirroring the efforts of our colleague in the House, \nCongressman Bunning.\n  I want to convey my thanks to the House for their quick action in \napproving this bill. The amendments of the House incorporated certain \nmodifications and additional provisions which will improve the \nbeneficial impact of the bill for our men and women in uniform.\n  Whether or not we supported the deployment of United States troops to \nBosnia, all Americans are considered for the safety and security of our \nfellow countrymen who are deployed as part of Operation Joint Endeavor. \nAlthough this is a peacekeeping mission, it is clearly not without \nrisk. Land mines and sniper fire will continue to threaten our troops \nthroughout the duration of this operation. As long as our service men \nand women are on the ground, they may come into harm's way.\n  Sadly, we have already experienced the first American casualty in \nBosnia, and we probably have not seen the last. Let us not forget the \nfamily of Sfc. Donald Dugan. While enactment of this legislation will \nnot return him to his family, it contains provisions which will \nalleviate some of the financial hardships his family may be \nexperiencing as a result of his death.\n  Because this is a peacekeeping mission and not a war, the President \nhas not declared the area of operation to be a combat zone. Therefore, \nexisting law does not permit our service members in Bosnia to receive \nany of the tax benefits and relief normally provided to those deployed \nto combat zones. This legislation will extend to American military \npersonnel in Bosnia and their families the same benefits available to \nservice members who were deployed to the Persian Gulf war.\n  The more than 20,000 United States military personnel deployed to \nBosnia are performing their duties in service to their country. On a \nrecent trip to Bosnia, I had the opportunity to personally visit with \nmany of our men and women, and I let them know what a fantastic job \nthey were doing.\n  This bill is a small gesture to show our troops they are not \nforgotten. Its provisions will alleviate their worries about financial \nhardships experienced by their families left at home. It is an import \nexpression of our support for their professionalism and patriotism.\n  I understand the President has indicated he supports this bill. I \nurge my colleagues to support adoption of this legislation, and I hope \nthe President will act promptly to sign it into law.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 2778) was deemed read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1608-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1609-S1610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

The President is requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to \n     observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n[[Page S1610]]\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 497\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, we should not be asked to consider this \nresolution. Senate Resolution 227 is, to my mind, simply a license to \ncontinue a wild goose chase, and to do so at the expenditure of public \nfunds which could well be spent for true public needs.\n  When the Whitewater matter first came before us 2 years ago, I said \nthat it involved distant dealings with marginal involvement of Federal \ninterests, and that it simply did not rise to the level of scrutiny \nappropriate for Senate inquiry.\n  Nothing has happened since to change my initial judgment one iota. \nThe Senate investigation has dragged on for 294 days at a cost of $1.34 \nmillion and has not yielded a single result worthy of further action.\n  This investigation in my view is an exercise in political harassment. \nIts indefinite continuance would be an embarrassment to the Senate. And \nI might add that continuance of the investigation holds little promise \nof benefit to the majority party, given the widespread public \nindifference to the matter.\n  In short, Mr. President, we are being asked to approve not just the \nuse of Senate funds but indeed the exploitation of the full \nconstitutional authority of the Senate to continue a so-called inquiry \ninto matters of little consequence, and to do so for clearly partisan \npurposes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski pertaining to the submission of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 43 are printed in today's Record under \n``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/06/senate-section/article/S1610-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
