Mr. President, 4 months ago Senator Breaux and I asked a \nsmall group of our colleagues to get together on a bipartisan basis to \ndiscuss how we might reenergize the stalled negotiations on a balanced \nbudget. At that time neither the White House nor the congressional \nbudget negotiators were making the compromises necessary to reach a \nfinal balanced budget agreement.\n  You may recall, Mr. President, at that time there could not even be \nagreement on what economic assumptions were to be used as the starting \npoint.\n  In advancing our efforts, Senator Breaux and I hoped to demonstrate \nto the Republican congressional leadership and to the White House, the \nadministration, that a group of Senators--Democrats and Republicans, \nfrom the middle of the political spectrum--were willing to set aside \npartisanship to reach a balanced budget agreement. We strongly believe \nthat the single most important action that this Congress can take for \nthe benefit of our Nation is balancing the budget.\n  The members of our group come to this effort with a wide range of \nperspectives on how we ought to solve the budgetary problems. Each of \nus, if left to our own devices, might come up with a different balanced \nbudget agreement than the one we arrived at. But nonetheless, all of us \nmade concessions and compromises in order to forge our plan.\n  This chart shows the problem that faces the Nation. And by the way, \nthese figures come from the Congressional Budget Office. That is the \nofficial group that provides budget projections to this body. These are \nnot the administration's figures, they come from our own budget office. \nHere is the deficit today, somewhere around $140 billion. Left \nunchecked, it will increase each and every year, until in the year \n2006, which is only 10 years from now, Mr. President, it is projected \nto exceed $400 billion.\n  Those are the bills that we are sending to our children because we \nrefuse to take the steps that are necessary to balance this budget.\n  Senator Breaux and I and our group of some 22 Senators, 11 \nRepublicans and 11 Democrats, have come up with a proposal, and this \nchart compares the different plans. The first column is the Chafee-\nBreaux plan. The second is what the leadership of the Republican Party \nhas presented. The third is what the administration has presented.\n  It is a fairly busy chart so I will not go into all the details, but \nI will point\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\nout one distinct feature in our approach that is different from the \nothers' approach, and that is discretionary spending.\n  What is discretionary spending? Discretionary spending is all the \nnormal things that occur in the budget--defense, libraries, the FBI, \nhighways, the payment for the State Department and our Ambassadors \naround the world, all of those normal things. You will see that we \nbelieve we can save out of this category $268 billion over the next 7 \nyears.\n  How do we do that? We do that by some very, very tough measures. We \nsay that the spending in discretionary will be frozen for the next 7 \nyears, without any increases for inflation. That is tough medicine, and \nwe think that is as far as we can go, and it is unrealistic to suggest \nthat savings can be achieved above and beyond this level.\n  But here you will see the administration and, indeed, the Republican \nproposals go way beyond that. We consider that totally unrealistic, and \nthat when the appropriations bills come up in 1998 and 2000 and 2002, \nCongress will not make those cuts and we will not realize these \nsavings.\n  The point I am making here is the Chafee-Breaux plan is a realistic \nproposal, whereas the other budgets in this particular area are totally \nunrealistic.\n  So how do we make up the money? Others save, as we see in the \nRepublican proposal, nearly $100 billion more than we do. And we do it \nwith an item that you will see at the bottom of this chart called the \nConsumer Price Index.\n  What is the Consumer Price Index? The Consumer Price Index is used as \nan estimate of what inflation is for the year. And the Consumer Price \nIndex, according to studies that have been made, overstates inflation. \nIn other words, the estimate of the inflation for the year is too high. \nIt is not accurate. And we recognize that. So we make a modest \ncorrection in the Consumer Price Index as follows: We lower the \nConsumer Price Index by five-tenths of 1 percent in the first 2 years \nand by three-tenths of 1 percent in every year thereafter. Indeed, the \nAdvisory Committee to Study the Consumer Price Index, which was \nestablished by the Finance Committee to study this issue, has said that \nthe Consumer Price Index is overstated by as much as 2 percentage \npoints. The Commission's range of overstatement is between seven-tenths \nof 1 percent and 2 percent. So we take a more conservative approach. We \ndo not go as far as they do. We are not as tough, if you would. We say \nwe will only reduce it by 0.5 in the first 2 years and 0.3 thereafter.\n  That is a very, very important step, because when you deal with the \ninflation index and take the steps that we have taken in the Consumer \nPrice Index by reducing it by a very modest amount, that yields \ntremendous savings in the outyears. So this is not a budget that we \npresented that only just squeaks into balance in the year 2002 and then \nthe lid comes off in future years; not at all. This is a budget that is \ngoing to produce these savings in future years as well, and the country \nwill thus be in balance, not only in the year 2002, but 2003, 2004, and \nthe outyears as well.\n  Some of these steps are tough steps. The only way these savings can \nbe achieved, particularly in the Consumer Price Index, is through a \nbipartisan effort. We feel very, very strongly that now is the time. \nNow is the time for the Senate to set the pace, to set the standards \nand to adopt a budget that will achieve balance.\n  Others will be talking on particular features of our plan as we go \nalong, but I want to take this opportunity to thank every Senator, all \n22 Senators who participated in this effort. Each of them showed his or \nher commitment to solving this problem. We are driven by the fact we do \nnot want to continue to send bills for expenditures we are making to \nour children and our grandchildren.\n  In particular, I thank Senator John Breaux, who has been tremendous \nin his dedication to this effort. Without his participation and his \nleadership, this would have failed a long time ago. So, for his \nunswerving dedication and invaluable leadership, I thank him. He \ndeserves a tremendous amount of credit.\n  Mr. President, there will be other speakers.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I think we have an agreement of the \nallocation of 1 hour, perhaps half and half. Under that, I yield myself \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to start by recognizing my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Chafee. He was very kind and generous in \nhis remarks about my role. I would say exactly the same thing for \nSenator Chafee. He and I have worked together because I think we were \nable to put aside partisanship, and we were able to say there are a \nnumber of Senators, a large number of Senators, who really do want to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion for what is good for this country. I \nthink, really, the majority of all Senators feel that way.\n  I particularly want to say to Senator Chafee, it is because of his \nleadership on the Republican side of the aisle that our organization \nwas possible. Without his help, it would not have been possible. It is \njust that simple. He has taken some very courageous stands. I think all \nMembers of this body should applaud him for that.\n  They said it could not be done. They said it was impossible, \nparticularly in an election year, when a third of this body was up for \nelection and when both parties have candidates who are now running for \nthe Presidency of the United States. It was said it was absolutely \nimpossible that Members of the Congress, Members of the Senate, could \ncome together in a bipartisan fashion and put together a product that \nactually balanced the budget in a 7-year period, a budget that would be \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office in a way that everybody can \nagree with the figures.\n  It was said that it could not be done because this is a political \nyear and people fight over these things. They sometimes say the best \nway to win the political battle is to blame the other side for not \ndoing enough. We have a centrist coalition of 22 Senators, bipartisan \nin nature, who said that is not the way we want this body to govern. We \ndo want to work toward a balanced budget, and we know it cannot come \njust from the left nor can it come just from the right; that any kind \nof agreement on the big problems of the day has to come from working \nfrom the center out, by forming centrist coalitions in the middle that \ngradually build up enough support to become a majority.\n  That is exactly what we have been able to do. How many times have we \ngone back to our respective States and have had people come up to us on \nthe streets and in coffee shops and before civic clubs and say, ``Why \ncan't you guys in Washington get together? Why can't you sit down and \ndo the job we elected you to do and expected you to do when you took \nyour oaths of office as Senators and Members of the Congress? Why can't \nyou reach out to each other and say, `Yes, I can't have it all my way \nall the time'?'' That we do have to make compromises and that \ncompromise is not a dirty word, that it is the art of being able to \ngovern in a society that is, indeed, a democracy.\n\n  That, I think, is what we have done. Today we are announcing one of \nthe worst-kept secrets in this city, that there has been a centrist \ncoalition that has been working together since our first meeting in \nOctober 1995, when we sat down and made a dedicated effort to try to \ncome up with a compromise budget that got the job done. We were \ndedicated less to which party got the credit and less to which party \ngot the blame and more to trying to get the bottom line achieved in a \nconsensus recommendation. We have done that.\n  I am optimistic, despite all the things we have not been able to do--\nand there have been a lot. There have been two partial shutdowns of the \nentire Government because we have not been able to come together. We \nhad 13 temporary spending bills that have had to pass because we were \nnot able to get the job done. But, despite that, I am optimistic. \nToday, this Congress will pass a budget for fiscal year 1996. That is \nencouraging. It is 7 months late, but it is encouraging that, at least, \nI think today we will have gotten it done. So progress is being made.\n  I am also encouraged by statements in the press. I see the President \nyesterday suggested that it would be a good\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\nidea to reach a balanced budget agreement for 7 years if a centrist \ncoalition of moderate Republicans and moderate Democrats in favor of \ndeficit reductions could get together and work together to come up with \na balanced budget agreement.\n  Guess what? We have done that. We have put together a group of good \nmen and women who, in a bipartisan fashion, have dedicated ourselves, \nand particularly our staffs, to days and hours and months of working \ntogether to try to produce a document which, in fact, meets that very \ngoal that the President has suggested. I think everybody wins when we \nget the job done, and everybody loses when we do not. It is just that \nsimple.\n\n  Our recommendation today addresses some very tough, hard problems \nthat have been out there for a long time. For instance, on Medicare, we \nhave made a Medicare proposal that is real Medicare reform. It reduces \nthe cost of Medicare by almost $154 billion. We have made some real, \nmajor recommendations in Medicaid.\n  We have addressed welfare. We have a program that I think is tough on \nwork and yet is good for children. We have a tax cut in our package \nthat is larger than some would like and is smaller than others would \nlike, but it represents a true compromise.\n  Yes, we have even taken on the very difficult job of saying to the \nAmerican people that the increases you get in entitlement programs will \nbe realistic; they will more accurately reflect what the increase \nshould be. All the economists tell us that the increases have been \nlarger than they should have been. Our budget proposal, I think, takes \nthe correct and, I think, politically courageous step of saying there \nis going to be an adjustment in the Consumer Price Index.\n  Mr. President, for all in this city who have said it could not be \ndone, today we stand and say it can be done. In fact, it has been done, \nwith our recommendation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the summary of the centrist coalition \nbalanced budget plan be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Summary of Centrist Coalition Balanced Budget Plan\n\n       For the past several months, a bipartisan group of 22 \n     Senators has worked to craft a seven-year balanced budget \n     agreement that is fair to all Americans. We have made the \n     difficult choices and compromises necessary to reach an \n     agreement because we are concerned about the effect a \n     continuing deficit will have on the quality of life for each \n     and every American.\n       If we act, we can foster economic growth and prosperity. If \n     we fail to act, we undermine the future of our children and \n     grandchildren. This is an historic opportunity and we should \n     not let it pass.\n       Balancing the budget will spur economic growth, and help \n     families make ends meet by lowering interest rates on home \n     mortgages, car loans, and education loans.\n       Balancing the budget will also brighten our children's \n     future. Last year's report of the Bipartisan Commission on \n     Entitlement and Tax Reform illustrates the magnitude of the \n     problem facing future generations. Left unchecked, by the \n     year 2012, projected outlays for entitlements and interest on \n     the national debt will consume all tax revenues collected by \n     the federal Government, leaving nothing for national defense, \n     roads, or education. We cannot stand by and let this happen.\n       We formed this Centrist Coalition because we believe a \n     balanced budget is possible only if Democrats and Republicans \n     work together. We offer this proposal as a way to bridge the \n     gap between our two parties. We hope our effort will spur the \n     President and our colleagues in the House and Senate to work \n     together to enact a balanced budget this year.\n         Robert F. Bennett, Christopher S.

Snowe.\n\n               medicare (estimated savings: $154 billion)\n\n       Expands choices for Medicare beneficiaries: Beneficiaries \n     can remain in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare \n     program or choose from a range of private managed care plans, \n     based upon individual need. Options include point-of-service \n     plans, provider sponsored organizations and medical savings \n     accounts (on a demonstration basis).\n       Promotes the growth of managed care: By creating a new \n     payment system for managed care--which blends national and \n     local payment rates--the plan encourages growth in the \n     availability and accessibility of managed care. Indirect \n     Medical Education payments would be redirected to teaching \n     hospitals; currently, they are paid to managed care plans.\n       Ensures the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund: By slowing \n     the rate of growth in payments to hospitals, physicians and \n     other service providers, the plan extends the solvency of the \n     Medicare Trust Fund.\n       Higher income seniors should pay more: Through affluence \n     testing, the plan reduces the Medicare Part B premium subsidy \n     to higher income seniors, and asks them to pay a greater \n     share of the program's cost.\n\n\n               medicaid (estimated savings: $62 billion)\n\n       Incorporates a number of NGA's recommendations: The \n     proposal incorporates many of the principles of the NGA \n     proposal regarding enhanced state flexibility, while also \n     maintaining important safeguards for the federal treasury and \n     retaining the guarantee of coverage for beneficiaries.\n       Sharing the risks and rewarding efficiency: Funding is \n     based upon the number of people covered in each state, \n     ensuring federal funding during economic downturns. States \n     will be able to redirect the savings they achieve toward \n     expanding Medicaid coverage to the working poor.\n       Guaranteed coverage for the most vulnerable populations: \n     The plan maintains a national guarantee of coverage for low-\n     income pregnant women, children, the elderly and the disabled \n     (using the tightened definition of disability included in \n     welfare reform legislation).\n       Increased flexibility for the states: States can design the \n     health care delivery systems which best suit their needs \n     without obtaining waivers from the Federal Government. Under \n     this plan, states can determine provider rates (the Boren \n     amendment is repealed), create managed care programs, and \n     develop home and community based care options for seniors to \n     help keep them out of nursing homes.\n\n\n              welfare (estimated savings: $45-$53 billion)\n\n       Includes many of NGA's recommendations: The plan, which \n     includes several prominent features of the NGA proposal, is \n     based upon the welfare reform bill that passed the Senate by \n     a vote of 87-12 in September 1995.\n       Tough new work requirements: States must meet a 50-percent \n     work participation requirement by the year 2002.\n       Time limited benefits: Cash assistance is limited for \n     beneficiaries to a maximum of 5 years.\n       A block grant providing maximum state flexibility: States \n     will be given tremendous flexibility to design welfare \n     programs, in accordance with their own circumstances, that \n     promote work and protect children.\n       More child care funding to enable parents to work: The plan \n     provides the higher level of child care funding ($14.8 \n     billion) recommended by the NGA to enable parents to get off \n     welfare and to help states meet the strict work participation \n     requirements contained in the plan.\n       Extra funds for states to weather recessionary periods: The \n     plan includes a $2 billion contingency fund to help states \n     through economic downturns.\n       Important safety nets maintained: The plan preserves the \n     food stamp and foster care programs as uncapped entitlements. \n     States must provide vouchers to meet the basic subsistence \n     needs of children if they impose time limits shorter than 5 \n     years (states set amount of voucher).\n       Encourages states to maintain their investment in the \n     system: States must maintain their own spending at 80 percent \n     to get the full block grant, and 100 percent to get \n     contingency and supplemental child care assistance funds; \n     contingency and child care funds must be matched.\n       Reforms Supplemental Security Income programs: The plan \n     disqualifies drug addicts and alcoholics from receiving SSI \n     benefits, and tightens eligibility criteria for the \n     children's SSI disability program.\n       Retargets Earned Income Credit: The Earned Income Credit is \n     retargeted to truly needy by reducing eligibility for those \n     with other economic resources. The plan also strengthens the \n     administration of the Earned Income Credit by implementing \n     procedures to curb fraud.\n\n\n       economic growth incentives (estimated cost: $130 billion)\n\n       A three-pronged tax relief program for working families: \n     The plan establishes a new $250 per child credit ($500 per \n     child if the parent contributes that amount to an IRA in the \n     child's name); expands the number of taxpayers eligible for \n     deductible IRAs, creates a new ``backloaded'' IRA, and allows \n     penalty free withdrawals for first time homebuyers, \n     catastrophic medical expenses, college costs, and prolonged \n     unemployment; and provides for a new ``above the line'' \n     deduction for higher education expenses.\n       Encourages economic growth: A capital gains tax reduction \n     based on the Balanced Budget Act formulation (effective date \n     of 1/1/96): 50 percent reduction for individuals; 31 percent \n     maximum rate for corporations; expanded tax break for \n     investments in small business stock; and capital loss of \n     principal residence. The proposal also provides for AMT \n     relief (conformance of regular and alternative minimum tax \n     depreciation lives).\n       Important small business tax assistance: An exclusion from \n     estate tax on the first $1 million of value in a family-owned \n     business, and 50 percent on the next $1.5 million. Increases \n     the self-employed health insurance deduction to 50 percent.\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\n       Extension of expiring provisions: The plan provides for a \n     revenue neutral extension of expiring provisions.\n\n\n           Loophole Closers (estimated savings: $25 billion)\n\n       Closes unjustifiable tax loopholes: The cost of the \n     economic growth incentives is partially offset by the \n     elimination of many tax loopholes, and through other proposed \n     changes in the tax code.\n\n\n           cpi adjustment, (estimated savings: $110 billion)\n\n       A more accurate measure of increases in the cost of living: \n     The plan adjusts the CPI to better reflect real increases in \n     the cost of living by reducing it by half a percentage point \n     in years 1997-98, and by three-tenths of a percentage point \n     thereafter. The proposed adjustment is well below the range \n     of overstatement identified by economists.\n\n\n        DISCRETIONARY SPENDING (estimated savings: $268 billion)\n\n       Achievable discretionary spending reductions: Unlike most \n     of the other budget plans, this proposal provides for \n     discretionary spending reductions which can actually be \n     achieved. The plan proposes a level of savings which is only \n     $10 billion more than a ``hard freeze'' (zero growth for \n     inflation), ensuring adequate funds for a strong defense and \n     for critical investments in education and the environment.\n\n\n       OTHER MANDATORY SPENDING (estimated savings: $52 billion)\n\n       Balanced reductions acceptable to both parties: The plan \n     includes changes that were proposed in both Republican and \n     Democratic balanced budget measures in the areas of banking, \n     commerce, civil service, transportation and veterans \n     programs.\n       Additional mandatory savings: The plan adopts other \n     changes, including a cap on direct lending at 40 percent of \n     total loan volume, extending railroad safety fees, and \n     permitting Veterans' hospitals to bill private insurers for \n     the care of beneficiaries.\n\n\n               MEDICARE (estimated savings $154 billions)\n\n       The plan proposes a variety of reforms to the Medicare \n     program designed to promote efficiency in the delivery of \n     services and strengthen the financial status of the Trust \n     Fund. The proposal retains the traditional, fee for service \n     Medicare program, but also encourages the formation of \n     private managed care options for seniors and the disabled, \n     allowing point of service plans, provider sponsored \n     organizations, and medical savings accounts (on a \n     demonstration basis).\n       The plan's provider payment savings and the expanded \n     availability of managed care delivery of services will lower \n     the cost of the Medicare program over the next 7 years \n     thereby extending the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.\n     Program reforms\n       Increase choice of private health plans. Under the \n     proposal, preferred provider organizations (PPOs), provider \n     sponsored organizations (PSOs), Medical Savings Accounts (as \n     a demonstration project), and other types of plans that meet \n     Medicare's standards are made available to Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       Annual enrollment. The plan allows beneficiaries to switch \n     health plans each year during an annual ``open season'' or \n     within 90 days of initial enrollment.\n       Standards. The Secretary of HHS, in consultation with \n     outside groups, will develop standards which will apply to \n     all plans. These standards will involve benefits, coverage, \n     payment, quality, consumer protection, assumption of \n     financial risk, etc., which will apply to all plans; PSOs \n     will be able to apply for a limited waiver of the requirement \n     that plans be licensed under State law.\n       Additional benefits. Under the proposal, health plans would \n     be permitted to offer their participants additional benefits \n     or rebates in the form of a reduced Medicare Part B premium. \n     Plans would be prohibited from charging additional premiums \n     for services covered by Medicare Parts A\n       Payments to private health plans. Payments to managed care \n     plans will be de-linked from traditional fee-for-service \n     payments and will be computed using both locally-based and \n     nationally-based rates. Future payments will grow by a \n     predetermined percentage and a floor will be established in \n     order to attract plans to the lowest payment areas.\n       Commission on the effect of the baby boom generation. The \n     plan proposes the creation of a commission to make \n     recommendations regarding the long-term solvency of the \n     Medicare program.\n       Conform Medicare with Social Security. The eligibility age \n     for Medicare is increased to 67 at the same rate as the \n     current Social Security eligibility age is scheduled to \n     increase.\n     Part A program savings (hospitals)\n       Hospital market basket update reduction. For hospitals, the \n     proposal sets the annual update for inpatient hospital \n     services at the market basket minus one and one-half \n     percentage points for fiscal years 1997 through 2003.\n       Capital payment reduction. For hospitals, the proposal \n     reduces the inpatient capital payment rate by 15 percent for \n     fiscal years 1997 through 2003.\n       Reduce the indirect medical education reimbursement rate. \n     The proposal phases-in a reduction to the additional payment \n     adjustment to teaching hospitals for indirect medical \n     education from 7.7 percent to 6.0 percent.\n       Reduce DSH payment. The plan reduces the extra payments \n     made to certain hospitals that serve a disproportionate share \n     of low income patients by 10 percent less than current-law \n     estimates.\n       Skilled nursing facility payment reform. The proposal \n     adopts a Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Skilled Nursing \n     Facilities by November 1997. In moving to the new \n     methodology, a temporary freeze on payment increases is \n     imposed and then an interim system is implemented until the \n     full PPS system is implemented.\n     Part B program savings (physicians)\n       Physician payment reform. The proposal adjusts the Medicare \n     fee system used to pay physicians. A single conversion factor \n     would be phased-in for all physicians instead of the current \n     three conversion factors. Surgeons would be phased-in over a \n     2 year period. The conversion factor for 1996 would be $35.42 \n     and the annual growth rate would be subject to upper and \n     lower growth bounds of plus 3 percent and minus 7 percent.\n       Reduce hospital outpatient formula. The proposal adjusts \n     the current Medicare formula for hospital outpatient \n     departments to eliminate overpayments due to a payment \n     formula flaw.\n       Reduce oxygen payment. The proposal would decrease the \n     monthly payment for home oxygen services and eliminate the \n     annual cost update for this service through 2003.\n       Freeze durable medical equipment reimbursement. The \n     proposal eliminates the CPI-U updates for payments of all \n     categories of Durable Medical Equipment for fiscal years 1997 \n     through 2003.\n       Reduce laboratory reimbursement. The proposal lowers \n     expenditures on laboratory tests by reducing the national cap \n     for each service to 72 percent of the national median fee \n     during the base year for that service.\n       Ambulatory surgical center rate change. The proposal lowers \n     the annual payment rate adjustment by minus three percent for \n     fiscal years 1997 and 1998 and then reduces the rate by minus \n     2 percent for remaining fiscal years through 2003.\n     Part A and B program savings\n       Medicare secondary payer extensions. The proposal would \n     make permanent the law that places Medicare as the secondary \n     payer for disabled beneficiaries who have employer-provided \n     health insurance. It also extends to twenty-four months the \n     period of time employer health insurance is the primary payer \n     for end stage renal disease (ESRD) beneficiaries.\n       Home health payment reform. The proposal reforms the \n     payment methodology used to pay home health services by the \n     beginning of fiscal year 1999. While a prospective payment \n     system is developed, current payments are frozen and an \n     interim payment system implemented.\n       Fraud and abuse changes. The proposal includes a number of \n     provisions designed to improve the ability to combat Medicare \n     fraud and abuse by providers and beneficiaries\n       Medicare part B premium reform. The plan retains the pre-\n     1996 financing structure for the Part B program by requiring \n     most participants to pay for 31.5 percent of the program's \n     costs. Premiums for lower income seniors are lowered to 25 \n     percent of the program's costs. In addition, the proposal \n     eliminates the taxpayer subsidy of Medicare Part B premiums \n     for high income individuals.\n\n\n                MEDICAID (estimated savings $62 billion)\n\n       The proposal incorporates many of the principles of the NGA \n     proposal regarding enhanced state flexibility, while also \n     maintaining important safeguards for the federal treasury and \n     retaining the guarantee of coverage for beneficiaries.\n       Payments to States. States are guaranteed a base amount of \n     funds that may be accessed regardless of the number of \n     individuals enrolled in the State plan. Each state would have \n     the ability to designate a base year amount from among their \n     actual Medicaid spending for FY 1993, 1994, or 1995. \n     Approximately one-third of disproportionate share hospital \n     payments would be included in the base year amount, one-third \n     would be used for deficit reduction, and one-third would be \n     used for a Federal disproportionate share hospital payment \n     program.\n       In addition, states will receive growth rates which reflect \n     both an inflation factor and estimated caseload increases. If \n     the estimate for caseload in any given year was too low, \n     states would receive additional payments per beneficiary from \n     an ``umbrella fund'' to make up the difference. Conversely, \n     if the caseload was overestimated, the estimate for the \n     following year would be adjusted downward. Regardless of \n     caseload, a state's allocation never fall below the base year \n     allocation for that state. The plan retains the current law \n     match rates and restrictions on provider taxes and voluntary \n     contributions.\n       Eligibility. The proposal maintains current law mandatory \n     and optional populations with the following modifications: \n     states would cover those individuals eligible for SSI under a \n     more strict definition of disabled (tightened by the welfare \n     reform changes included in this proposal) as well as SSI-\n     related groups; states would have the option of covering \n     current-law AFDC beneficiaries or those eligible under a \n     revised AFDC program (includes one-year transitional \n     coverage); and, states are permitted to use savings in their \n     base year amount to expand health care coverage to \n     individuals with incomes below 100 percent of the Federal \n     poverty level without obtaining a Federal waiver.\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\n       Benefits. The plan maintains current law mandatory and \n     optional benefits except that Federally Qualified Health \n     Center (FQHC) services would be optional rather than \n     mandatory. The proposal also gives the Secretary of HHS the \n     authority to redefine early periodic screening and diagnosis \n     treatment (EPSDT) services.\n       Provider payments. The proposal repeals the so-called Boren \n     amendment as well as the reasonable-cost reimbursement \n     requirements for FQHCs and rural health clinics, thus \n     allowing states full flexibility in setting provider rates.\n       Quality. States would be allowed to set provider standards. \n     States would no longer be required to obtain a waiver to \n     enroll patients in managed care plans, provided the plans met \n     the state's standards developed for private plans.\n       Nursing home standards. The proposal maintains current \n     nursing home standards with existing enforcement. Streamlines \n     certain requirements.\n       Enforcement. Individuals and providers are required to go \n     through a state-run administrative hearing process prior to \n     filing suit in federal court.\n       Set asides. The plan establishes a federal fund for certain \n     states that have high percentages of undocumented aliens, as \n     well as a fund for FQHCs and rural health clinics.\n       Program structure. The reforms are made to the existing \n     Medicaid statute.\n\n\n          WELFARE (estimated savings $45 billion-$53 billion)\n\n       Block grant. The proposal transforms existing welfare \n     programs into a block grant to states to increase program \n     flexibility and encourage state and local innovation in \n     assisting low-income families in becoming self-sufficient. \n     This structure provides incentives to states to continue \n     their partnership with the Federal Government by encouraging \n     states to maintain 80 percent of their current spending on \n     major welfare programs. While the plan provides maximum \n     flexibility, it requires states to operate their programs in \n     a way that treats recipients in a fair and equitable manner.\n       Contingency fund. To protect states facing difficult \n     economic times, the plan calls for the creation of a $2 \n     billion Federal contingency fund.\n       Child care. The plan provides $14.8 billion in mandatory \n     federal funds for child care and ensures that those child \n     care facilities meet minimum health and safety standards so \n     that children are well-cared for while their parents go to \n     work.\n       Maintenance of effort. To encourage states not to \n     substitute these new federal funds for current state \n     spending, a 100-percent maintenance of effort and a state \n     match are required in order to access additional federal \n     money for child care and contingency funds.\n       Work requirement and time limit. The plan requires states \n     to meet tough new work requirements--50 percent by 2002--and \n     limits a beneficiary's cash assistance to five years, so that \n     AFDC becomes a temporary helping hand to those in need, \n     rather than a permanent way of life.\n       Retention of certain safety nets. The proposal retains \n     important protections for welfare's most vulnerable \n     beneficiaries, the children. It allows states to waive \n     penalties for single parents with children under school age \n     who cannot work because they do not have child care, gives \n     states the option to require those parents to work only 20 \n     hours a week, and requires states with a time limit shorter \n     than 5 years to provide assistance to children in the form of \n     vouchers.\n       Out-of-wedlock births. The plan encourages a reduction in \n     out-of-wedlock births by allowing states to deny benefits to \n     additional children born to a family already on welfare and \n     rewarding states that reduce the number of out-of-wedlock \n     births.\n       Curbing SSI Abuse. The proposal repeals the Individualized \n     Functional Assessment (IFA) used to determine a child's \n     eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and \n     replaces it with a tightened definition of childhood \n     disability. It maintains cash assistance for those children \n     who remain eligible for SSI under this new criteria. It also \n     eliminates SSI eligibility for addicts and alcoholics.\n       Foster care and adoption assistance. The federal \n     entitlement for foster care and adoption assistance (and \n     their respective pre-placement and administrative costs) is \n     maintained under the proposal. States are required to \n     continue to meet Federal standards in their child welfare and \n     foster care programs.\n       Food stamp and child nutrition programs. The proposal \n     streamlines the food stamp and child nutrition programs, \n     while retaining this critical safety net as a federal \n     entitlement. The work requirement for single, childless \n     recipients in the food stamp program is toughened.\n       Promoting self-sufficiency for immigrants. The plan \n     establishes a five-year ban on most federal ``needs based'' \n     benefits for future immigrants, with exceptions for certain \n     categories of individuals (such as veterans, refugees and \n     asylees) and certain programs (such as child nutrition, \n     foster care and emergency health care under Medicaid). The \n     plan also places a ban on SSI for all legal immigrants, but \n     exempts current recipients who are at least 75 years of age \n     or disabled; veterans and their dependents; battered \n     individuals; those who have worked 40 quarters; and for a \n     five-year period refugees, deportees and asylees. Finally, \n     future deeming requirements are expanded to last 40 quarters, \n     but do not continue past naturalization.\n       Retargets earned income credit. The Earned Income Credit is \n     retargeted to the truly needy by reducing eligibility for \n     those with other economic resources. The plan also \n     strengthens the administration of the Earned Income Credit by \n     implementing procedures to curb fraud.\n\n\n       TAXES ($130 billion tax cut; $25 billion loophole closers)\n\n       Child credit. The proposal provides a $250 per child tax \n     credit for every child under the age of 17. The credit is \n     increased to as much as $500 if that amount is contributed to \n     an Individual Retirement Account in the child's name.\n       Education incentives. The plan provides two separate \n     education incentives. The first is an above-the-line \n     deduction of up to $2,500 for interest expenses paid on \n     education loans. The second incentive is an above-the-line \n     deduction for qualified education expenses paid for the \n     education or training for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's \n     spouse, or the taxpayer's dependents. Both deductions will be \n     phased out for taxpayers with incomes above a certain \n     threshold. The phaseout thresholds and the dollar amounts for \n     the deductions are subject to revenue considerations.\n       Capital gains: Individuals. The proposal allows individuals \n     to deduct 50 percent of their net capital gain in computing \n     taxable income. It restores the rule in effect prior to the \n     Tax Reform Act of 1986 that required two dollars of the long-\n     term capital loss of an individual to offset one dollar of \n     ordinary income. The $3,000 limitation on the deduction of \n     capital losses against ordinary income would continue to \n     apply. Under the plan, a loss on the sale of a principal \n     residence is deductible as a capital loss. These changes \n     apply to sales and exchanges after December 31, 1995.\n       Capital gains: Corporations. The plan caps the maximum tax \n     rate on corporate capital gains at 31 percent. This change \n     applies to sales and exchanges after December 31, 1995.\n       Capital gains: Small business stock. The maximum rate of \n     tax on gain from the sale of small business stock by a \n     taxpayer other than a corporation is 14 percent under the \n     proposal. The plan also repeals the minimum tax preference \n     for gain from the sale of small business stock. Corporate \n     investments in qualified small business stock would be taxed \n     at a maximum rate of 21 percent. The plan increases the size \n     of an eligible corporation from gross assets of $50 million \n     to gross assets of $100 million, and repeals the limitation \n     on the amount of gain an individual can exclude with respect \n     to the stock of any corporation. The proposal modifies the \n     working capital expenditure rule from 2 years to 5 years. \n     Finally, an individual may roll over the gain from the sale \n     or exchange of small business stock if the proceeds of the \n     sale are used to purchase other qualifying small business \n     stock within 60 days. The increase in the size of \n     corporations whose stock is eligible for the exclusion \n     applies to stock issued after the date of the enactment of \n     this proposal. All other changes apply to stock issued after \n     August 10, 1993.\n       Alternative minimum tax relief. The plan conforms the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax depreciation lives to the \n     depreciation lives used for regular tax purposes for property \n     placed in service after 1996.\n       Individual Retirement Accounts. The proposal expands the \n     number of families eligible for current deductible IRAs by \n     increasing the income thresholds. In addition, the annual \n     contribution for a married couple is increased to the lesser \n     of $4,000 or the combined compensation of both spouses. \n     Penalty-free withdrawals are allowed for first-time \n     homebuyers, catastrophic medical expenses, higher education \n     costs and prolonged unemployment. The plan creates a new type \n     of IRA which can receive after-tax contributions of up to \n     $2,000. Distributions from this new IRA would be tax-free if \n     made from contributions held in the account for at least 5 \n     years.\n       Estate tax relief. The plan provides estate tax relief for \n     family-owned businesses by excluding the first one million \n     dollars in value of a family-owned business from the estate \n     tax and lowering the rate on the next one and one-half \n     million dollars of value by 50 percent. To preserve open \n     space, the plan excludes 40 percent of the value of land \n     subject to a qualified conservation easement.\n       Other provisions. The proposal contains a revenue neutral \n     package extending the expired tax provisions. The plan also \n     calls for increasing the self-employed health insurance \n     deduction to 50 percent.\n     Loophole closings and other reforms\n       The plan includes a package of loophole closers and other \n     tax changes designed to reduce the deficit by $25 billion \n     over seven years. Changes include, for example, phasing out \n     the interest deduction for corporate-owned life insurance, \n     eliminating the interest exclusion for certain nonfinancial \n     businesses, and reforming the tax treatment of foreign \n     trusts. In addition, the Oil Spill Liability tax and the \n     federal unemployment surtax are extended as part of the plan.\n\n\n         CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (estimated savings $110 billion)\n\n       The plan includes an adjustment to the Consumer Price Index \n     to correct biases in its computation that lead to it being \n     overstated. The proposal reduces the CPI for purposes of \n     computing cost of living adjustments and indexing the tax \n     code by one-half of a percentage point in 1997 and 1998. The \n     adjustment is reduced to three-tenths of a percentage point \n     in 1999 and all years thereafter.\n\n[[Page S4100]]\n\n        DISCRETIONARY SPENDING (estimated savings $268 billion)\n\n       The plan holds discretionary spending to an amount that is \n     slightly below the fiscal year 1995 level for each of the \n     next 7 years. This is $81 billion less than the cuts proposed \n     as part of the Balanced Budget Act and $29 billion less than \n     the cuts proposed by the Administration.\n\n\n        OTHER MANDATORY SPENDING (estimated savings $52 billion)\n\n       Housing. The proposal reforms the Federal Housing \n     Administration's home mortgage insurance program to help \n     homeowners avoid foreclosure and decrease losses to the \n     federal government. It also limits rental adjustments paid to \n     owners of Section 8 housing projects.\n       Communication and spectrum. The plan directs the Federal \n     Communications Corporation to auction 120 megahertz of \n     spectrum over a 7-year period.\n       Energy and Natural Resources. The proposal call for the \n     privatization of the US Enrichment Corporation and the \n     nation's helium reserves. It extends the requirement that the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission collect 100% of its annual \n     budget through nuclear plant fees. The proposal allows for \n     the sale of the strategic petroleum reserve oil (SPRO) at the \n     faulty Weeks Island location and leases the excess SPRO \n     capacity. Under the plan the Alaska Power Market \n     Administration, various Department of Energy assets, \n     Department of Interior (DOI) aircraft (except those for \n     combating forest fires), Governor's Island, New York, and the \n     air rights over train tracks at Union Station would be sold. \n     The plan raises the annual Hetch Hetchy rental payment paid \n     by City of San Francisco and authorizes central Utah \n     prepayment of debt.\n       Civil Service and related. The plan increases retirement \n     contributions from both agencies and employees through the \n     year 2002, delays civilian and military retiree COLAs from \n     January 1 to April 1 through the year 2002, and reforms the \n     judicial and congressional retirement. Finally, the plan \n     denies eligibility for unemployment insurance to service \n     members who voluntarily leave the military.\n       Transportation. The proposal extends expiring FEMA \n     emergency planning and preparedness fees for nuclear power \n     plants, vessel tonnage fees for vessels entering the U.S. \n     from a foreign port, and Rail Safety User Fees that cover \n     part of the cost to the federal government of certain safety \n     inspections.\n       Veterans. The plan extends seven expiring provisions of \n     current law and repeals the ``Gardener'' decision thereby \n     restoring the Veterans Administration's policy of limiting \n     liability to those cases in which an adverse outcome was the \n     result of an accident or VA negligence. Pharmacy co-payments \n     are increased from $2 to $4, but not for the treatment of a \n     service-connected disability or for veterans with incomes \n     below $13,190. Also, the increase applies only to the first 5 \n     prescriptions that a veteran purchases per month. The \n     proposal authorizes a veteran's health insurance plan to be \n     billed when a VA facility treats a service-connected \n     disability.\n       Student loans. The proposal caps the direct lending program \n     at 40 percent of total loan volume. It imposes a range of \n     lender and guarantor savings. The proposal does not include \n     fees on institutions, the elimination of the grace period, or \n     any other provisions negatively impacting parents or \n     students.\n       Debt collection. The plan authorizes the Internal Revenue \n     Service to levy federal payments (i.e. RR retirement, \n     workman's compensation, federal retirement, Social Security \n     and federal wages) to collect delinquent taxes.\n       Park Service receipts and sale of DOD stockpile. The \n     proposal raises fees at National Parks. It directs the \n     Defense Department to sell materials in its stockpile that \n     are in excess of defense needs (i.e., aluminum and cobalt)--\n     but not controversial materials such as titanium.\n       Long-Term Federal retirement program reforms. The plan \n     increases the normal civil service retirement eligibility to \n     age 60 with 30 years of service, age 62 with 25 years of \n     service, and age 65 with 5 years of service. Military \n     retirement eligibility for active duty personnel is increased \n     to age 50 with 20 years of service, with a discounted benefit \n     payable to a person retiring before age 50. No changes are \n     proposed for the retirement eligibility of reserve \n     servicepersons. These changes would not apply to current or \n     previously employed federal workers or anyone who is now \n     serving or who has previously served in the military. \n     Although these changes will not produce budget savings in the \n     coming seven years, they do provide significant savings over \n     the long-term.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on one of the most \ncritical issues of this Congress--balancing our Federal budget. I \nsupport the effort to balance the budget over the next 7 years. It is a \ntask that is long overdue, one that we should have tackled long before \nthe Federal debt began to escalate in the early 1980's. Our \ncarelessness in financial planning is a terrible legacy to leave our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  First, I want to commend the two Johns, Senator John Chafee and \nSenator John Breaux. The ability to develop a budget structure \nagreeable to enough Senators in the middle to become a model for \npassage is a daunting task. It has taken hundreds of hours. It has a \nreal chance to be the model to end the balance the budget deadlock. It \nis probably unrealistic to expect we can get the 1996 reconciliation \npackage revised, but there is a real chance it can be used for the soon \narriving 1997 budget.\n  When I voted in the House in 1986 against the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment I stated at the time we could not wait the \nnumber of years required to get it approved by the States. However 10 \nyears later the situation has become much worse. Now I also realize \nthat it is imperative we move forward without the amendment. Any \nfurther delay will greatly increase the damage to national economic \nstability.\n  The basic problem is the increasing cost of entitlement programs. \nThese are programs outside of the appropriations process. They have \nincreased well beyond the growth of revenues and population. In \naddition it appears through generosity or otherwise they have increased \nat a rate greater than the actual cost of living created by inflation. \nOur proposal recognizes this for the future. This will make additional \ncuts in discretionary programs such as education less necessary. But it \ndoes so in a way which may actually protect from a greater decrease \nwhich will be recommended this June by a panel of experts.\n  The entitlements that have provided the greater problems are in the \narea of health care. The increasing projected costs in Medicaid and \nMedicare represent about one-half of the increasing cost problem. We \ncannot continue to run a Federal-fee-for service system. Trying to \ncontrol costs without controlling utilization has not worked. There are \ntoo many ways that costs can be shifted to these programs. Progress in \nthis area will be controlled by more State responsibility. But those of \nus on committees of relevant jurisdiction must work to move to a \nFederal capitated system combined with utilization of private insurance \nmethodologies and Federal guidelines to get these costs under control. \nIt is interesting to note that in 1954 the Eisenhower administration \nintroduced legislation along these lines when it recognized some \nFederal system was required. This was H.R. 8356. The purpose of the \nbill was ``to encourage and stimulate private initiative in making good \nand comprehensive services generally accessible on reasonable terms \nthrough adequate health prepayment plans, to the maximum number of \npeople * * * (b) by making a form of reinsurance available for \nvoluntary health service prepayment plans where such reinsurance is \nneeded in order to stimulate the establishment and maintenance of \nadequate prepayment plans in areas, and with respect to services and \nclasses of persons, for which they are needed.'' I believe this gives \nus a possible route implemented through individual choice to get us out \nof our preset health care cost mess. We must find the way to control \nuncontrolled cost shifts and to spread the cost of the sick over the \nwidest base. Hopefully the Finance Committee and the Labor and Human \nResource Committee will join in achieving this goal.\n  Mr. President, like my colleagues in this bipartisan coalition, I \nwant a Federal budget that is balanced in an equitable manner. In \nreaching a balanced budget we must be careful not to cut those programs \nwhich could be counterproductive to balancing the budget. In other \nwords, cuts in one program can result in increased costs in other \nprograms, thus making it more difficult to balance the budget.\n  The bipartisan budget proposal accomplishes this goal by making the \ntough decisions necessary to balance within 7 years and still maintain \na strong commitment to discretionary and mandatory spending. Unlike \nother budget proposals, this plan provides for cuts to the overall \ndiscretionary spending that are both achievable and modest. If we are \nsuccessful in getting health care costs under control it should be \npossible to actually make needed increases in such accounts.\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\n  Mr. President, there are many important programs within the \ndiscretionary accounts that need to be maintained. The centrist group \nrealizing the importance of discretionary spending provided modest cuts \nto the discretionary account.\n  I would like to highlight just a few examples of the importance of \nmaintaining the discretionary accounts. One example can be seen in \nFederal health research spending. We are nearing discoveries and new \ntreatments to the causes of many illnesses and diseases, such as \nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's. The centrist coalition provides the \nflexibility to maintain spending on medical research. It is well known \nthat for every dollar spent on health research, several dollars are \nsaved by the Federal Government. This spending on health research could \nallow for the potential to eliminate tens of billions of dollars in \nFederal health care costs over the next decade or more.\n  Another example of this group's commitment is in providing adequate \neducation funding. As a group we understand that this Nation faces a \ncrisis--a crisis which is costing us hundreds of billions of dollars in \nlost revenues, decreased economic productivity, and increased social \ncosts, such as welfare, crime, and health care.\n  Mr. President, business leaders warn us that unless improvements are \nmade in our educational system, our future will be even bleaker. The \nrising costs of higher education combined with the lower income levels \nof middle-income families is causing thousands not to finish college, \nand fewer to attend graduate school in critical areas such as math, \nscience, and engineering. As chairman of the Education Subcommittee, I \nam particularly concerned about maintaining funding for education, and \nI have worked with my colleagues in this centrist group to ensure that \nadequate funding will be protected within education programs.\n\n  Finally, in order to help solve the deficit problem, and as \nimportantly, to prevent unnecessary hardship to individuals, this \ngroup's plan protects the Federal commitment to education, health \nresearch and many other discretionary spending areas by providing the \nleast amount of cuts of any plan yet offered.\n  Mr. President, I am committed to balancing this budget, but not on \nthe backs of the poor, the elderly and our children. This budget \nproposal is the only plan that protects the neediest Americans while \nbalancing the budget.\n\n\n     THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING EDUCATION UNDER A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  The Federal role within education is vital to the continued health of \nthis Nation's economy. Therefore, I want to highlight the importance of \nproviding adequate education funding. Recently, the U.S. Bureau of the \nCensus released a report which states that increasing workers' \neducation produces twice the gain in workplace productivity than tools \nand machinery. This simple but powerful finding shows that the \nimportance of educational investments cannot be ignored. In another \neconomic study, entitled ``Total Capital and Economic Growth,'' John \nKendrick corroborates this finding. He shows that education alone \naccounts for over 45 percent of the growth in the domestic economy \nsince 1929.\n  Americans understand intuitively that investing in education is the \nkey to our future success, and the best possible national investment \nthat we can make as a country. The evidence is clear: Countries which \nspend more on education per pupil yield higher levels of per capita \nGDP. Economists estimate the returns to investment in college education \nat over 30 percent in the 1980's. And some institutions, such as \nMotorola University, report corporate savings of $30 to $35 for every \n$1 spent on training. That is a 3000 to 3500 percent rate of return.\n  Several studies have concluded that a more highly educated work force \nis key, if we are going to balance the budget without substantially \nraising taxes. It is a crucial factor for increasing the Federal \nresource base.\n  People, as rational consumers, also realize that investing in their \nown education leads to substantially higher lifetime earnings. A person \nwith a bachelor's degree earns over 1\\1/2\\ times the income of a person \nwith a high school degree only. A professional degree brings over 350 \npercent higher lifetime earnings than a high school diploma in itself.\n  A recent study shows that over the past 20 years, only college \ngraduates have increased their real earning potential, while everyone \nelse lost ground. College graduates have earned 17 percent more in real \nwages, while the earnings of high school dropouts fell by one-third. \nThus, it is clear that education is an important investment for \npersonal as well as national competitiveness.\n  As our economy continues to shift from a manufacturing base toward \ninformation and services, education becomes the single most important \ndeterminant of economic success, for the individual and the country at \nlarge.\n  Finally, the plan recognizes we must delay tax cuts until we have \ntaken the above actions to insure getting entitlements under control, \nand our priorities reordered so they are not counter productive in \ntheir results. This is end increasing the deficit, not reducing it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, this has been a wonderful experience for those of us \nwho have participated with, as they have been referred to, ``the \nJohns,'' John Breaux and John Chafee, that so many of us can get \ntogether from each party and deal with the very difficult issues that \nwe are faced with and come up with a compromise proposal for the budget \nthat will reach the goals took a lot of hard work. Let me just run \nthrough some of the areas that we have tackled and have hopefully come \nup with some solutions.\n  As hard as the vote was on the balanced budget amendment--and I \nsuffered through that, having voted for it. Before, in 1986, I voted \nagainst it, then, because I said there is no way we can wait for the \nlength of time for a balanced budget amendment to go through the \nStates--we have to do it now. It is 10 years later and we are worse off \nthan we were, so I voted for it. That was the easy part. Now it comes \ndown to how to balance the budget.\n  The main problems that we have to deal with are the toughest ones--\nthe entitlements. How do you take entitlements that people have \ndepended upon and bring them in so that you can possibly get through \nthe budget process without totally devastating the discretionary \nspending?\n  The basic one, and the most important one, is health care reform. If \nwe do not have health care reform--and I am dedicated to working to do \nthat--there is no way we can get the budget under control. That is half \nthe problem. But we can get it under control if we get it out of the \nfee-for-service system and get it back to where it ought to be, with \nthe regular private efforts with respect to the insurance and coverage \nand working with providers and ensuring that there are adequate funds \nfor people in Medicaid and Medicare.\n  Other entitlements have to be brought under control, there is no \nquestion about it. Willingness to face that also requires a willingness \nto face the fact that we overstate the CPI and, therefore, create a \nworse problem every year.\n  But the impact upon discretionary spending--and I serve on the \nAppropriations Committee as well as the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee--makes it clear to me we also have to reorder priorities, \nbecause if we just mindlessly cut, we will make the problem worse \nrather than better.\n  I have been working very hard and working with Senator Snowe. We \nbrought this to the Senate this year. We convinced the Senate that you \ncannot cut education because one-half trillion dollars of costs in our \nbudget right now are due to a failing of our educational system. So we \nhave been successful working together. The moderates, I believe, on \nboth sides have brought that one under control. We have agreed not to \ncut education.\n  Other types of things that we have to look at are training and all \nthe other things that go into the losses because of our poor position \nin this world with respect to our competitiveness.\n  Let me just stop and point out that the priorities we must have is \nhealth care reform, and this can be done and we have to work on that, \nand education must be frozen. We have to start making sure that we do \nnot destroy the base any further than it already is. Finally, we have \nmade the difficult decision that you have to put your tax cuts in after \nyou have brought the budget under control, not before, as we did in\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\nthe failure to bring the budget under control in 1981.\n  I am proud to have worked with this group. I know there are many more \nto come forward and support us when they examine what can be and must \nbe done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Breaux.\n  The balanced budget we are presenting today is balanced not only on \nthe bottom line, but it is balanced in its political support, balanced \nin the sacrifices it asks from all of us, and balanced in the benefits \nit bestows.\n  Balance and fairness has not been the hallmark of previous budget \nplans presented to this Senate. Let me put this on a more personal \nlevel. I could not ask the people of Wisconsin to support a budget that \ncut their benefits while it was giving me a big tax break, and I could \nnot ask them to support a budget designed to improve my party's chances \nin the 1996 Presidential election rather than their children's chances \nin the world economy of the 21st century. But I can ask them to support \nthe plan we are releasing today because it is fair, it is smart, and it \nis bipartisan.\n  The budget we present today contains almost $600 billion in proposed \nsavings over 5 years, and that is without calculating the savings in \ninterest costs from reduced debt. Those savings are spread across \nalmost every group in society and almost every Government program. \nMedicare, Medicaid, welfare, Federal retirement programs, and even \nSocial Security are slated for spending reductions. Corporate welfare \nis cut. Payments to chronic individual welfare recipients are \neliminated. Defense and domestic spending are brought below a freeze. \nSavings proposals from both Democratic and Republican balanced budget \noffers, affecting areas from banking to veterans, commerce to \ncommunications, are incorporated in our plan. If our plan was to be \nenacted, most of us would contribute an amount so small that we would \nnot even notice, but our small contributions will add up to a big chunk \nof deficit reduction.\n  Aside from the CPI adjustment, the spending cuts laid out in our plan \nare approximately 60 percent from entitlement programs and 40 percent \nfrom discretionary programs which we pay for through our annual \nappropriations bills. According to the President's budget, our actual \nspending in 1996 was 60 percent for entitlement programs and 40 percent \nfor discretionary programs. So our plan distributes the cuts in exact \nproportion to the size of these programs in the budget. It favors no \ngroup, no special type of program, and no political sacred cow. Again, \nthe cuts are evenhanded, unbiased, nonpartisan--in other words, fair.\n  We believe that the fairness evident throughout our plan is necessary \nin a balanced budget if it is going to win popular and political \nsupport. We need to seek the balance in our fiscal policy that I am \nafraid is too often missing in our economy.\n  It is now a generally accepted fact that our economy is growing more \nunequal. What that means for the average family is that they are \nworking harder, longer hours, and tougher jobs just to maintain the \nstandard of living that their parents enjoyed. Between 1973 and 1993, \nthe productivity of the American worker grew by 25 percent, and over \nthe same period, the hourly compensation of the average American worker \nwas flat.\n  That is not the story of an American opportunity that I, or any of my \ncolleagues, grew up with. We know an American economy that values a \nfair day's work with a fair day's pay, and we know an America that \ncomes together to solve big problems by sharing our burdens. We know an \nAmerica where each generation has the opportunity to leave to their \nchildren a better standard of living.\n  Mr. President, our budget is true to that vision of America. It calls \nfor fair and equal sacrifice. It provides for a small amount of fairly \ndistributed benefits and, most important, it brings our deficit down to \nzero and stops the accumulation of debt that has buried the economic \nopportunities of the next generation.\n  So I ask all my colleagues to take a good look at this plan. Let us \ntake this last, best chance to put aside politics and adopt a balanced \nbudget that is real, bipartisan and fair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise this morning to join more than 20 of \nmy colleagues in presenting our bipartisan balanced budget proposal--\nthe only bipartisan budget plan in Congress. Over the past 5 months, we \nhave all observed the on-again, off-again budget negotiations, the two \nGovernment shutdowns, and several close calls on the debt limit.\n  In the wake of these fiascoes, the unveiling of our budget offers \nreassurance and hope, because, despite everything you have seen or \nheard, this package proves that Republicans and Democrats can work \ntogether and find common ground on this--the most important issue \nfacing our Nation.\n  I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Senators Chafee and \nBreaux for their leadership in bringing this group together. Without \ntheir efforts, it would not have been possible to present this \nbipartisan plan today.\n  Mr. President, we are in danger of becoming the first generation in \nthe history of our Nation that will not leave a better standard of \nliving for the next generation. For nearly 200 years, we took it for \ngranted in this country that those who followed us would have a better \nlife than we did. Well, that is simply not the case anymore.\n  The fact is, the United States has not balanced its budget since \n1969. And today--27 years later--our unwillingness to address its \nproblem in a meaningful way is the ultimate example of politics as \nusual and status quo governing. And as a result of our Government's \ncontinuing failure to live within its means, we are bequeathing a \nlegacy of debt and darkness to our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, the Members of this body who are presenting this \nbipartisan budget plan today believe that this reckless disregard for \nour children's future is unacceptable.\n  Our bipartisan group has been working today with an eye on tomorrow, \nbecause as Herb Stein of the American Enterprise Institute notes, ``The \nproblem is not the deficit we have now, it's the deficit we will have \nin the next century.''\n  Well, Mr. President, the next century is only 3\\1/2\\ years away. And \nevery day we wait, deficit spending continues, interest on the debt \naccumulates, and our economy moves closer to the brink. Consider these \nnumbers:\n  Under current economic policies, the debt will reach $6.4 trillion by \nthe year 2002. And according to estimates from the President's own \nOffice of Management and Budget, the deficit will double in 15 years, \nthen double again every 5 years thereafter. And by the year 2025, OMB \nestimates that the deficit in that year alone will be $2 trillion. OMB \nalso forecasts that if we continue our current spending spree, future \ngenerations will suffer an 82-percent tax rate and a 50-percent \nreduction in benefits in order to pay the bills we are leaving them \ntoday. With those numbers, it's no wonder babies come into the world \ncrying.\n\n  When six Republicans and six Democrats first gathered in Senator \nChafee's office last December, it was out of a shared conviction that \nthis Government has no right to leave such a crushing burden of debt to \nthe next generation. We believe that balancing the budget is not an \noption, it's an imperative.\n  We wanted to show that if we put the interests of the American people \nfirst, our system could work, that we could produce results. And with \nthat vision in mind, we have come together, split the differences \nbetween the President's budget and the Republican plan, and have \nreached agreement on a plan that balances the budget while still \nmaintaining the priorities shared by all Americans.\n  Mr. President, the benefits of passing a balanced budget are \nenormous: Some economists estimate that a balanced budget would yield a \ndrop in interest rates of between 2.5 and 4 percent. In practical \nterms, this means that the average family with a home mortgage,\n\n[[Page S4103]]\n\na car loan, or student loans would save about $1,800 a year. And real \nincome for the average American would increase by an astounding 36 \npercent by the year 2002.\n  Furthermore, the Joint Economic Committee projects that a 2.5-percent \ndrop in interest rates would create an additional 2.5 million jobs. And \nin terms of economic growth, CBO estimates that balancing the budget \nwould lead to a 0.5-percent increase in real GDP by the year 2002, and \nthat over time, national wealth would increase by between 60 and 80 \npercent of the cumulative reduction in the deficit.\n  More than 20 Republicans and Democrats have already agreed that this \nproposal is an acceptable way to reach balance. Bipartisanship was the \nkey to turning our shared commitment for a balanced budget into a \nplan--and bipartisanship will be the key to Congress moving forward and \nenacting a balanced budget proposal this year. And, frankly, our plan \nrepresents perhaps the last, best chance for passing a balanced budget \nin this Congress.\n  As with any balanced budget plan, there are provisions in this \nproposal that can be opposed by just about any person or any group. But \nthe difference between our plan and any other plan being put forward is \nthat this plan has bipartisan support.\n  Our proposal has strong bipartisan support because--unlike some other \nproposals on the table--our plan does more than pay lip service to \nproviding realistic, long-term protection to our shared commitments to \neducation, the environment, and economic growth. While other proposals \nrely on unrealistic cuts in discretionary spending to reach balance, \nour proposal does not.\n  Specifically, at the time our proposal was crafted, our bipartisan \nplan contained $30 billion less in discretionary spending cuts than the \nPresident's budget offer, and $81 billion less in discretionary \nspending cuts than the Republican proposal.\n  As a result, while other proposals would leave future Congresses with \nthe choice of providing adequate funding for some programs while \nutterly eviscerating others, our proposal does not.\n  Mr. President, no issue is more critical to the economic future of \nour Nation--and the economic future of our children and grandchildren--\nthan that of balancing the budget. In the words of John Kennedy, ``It \nis the task of every generation to build a road for the next \ngeneration.''\n  Mr. President, this bipartisan budget plan is the road toward fiscal \nresponsibility that will give our children and grandchildren a better \ntomorrow. We cannot let this moment pass us by. We cannot allow the \nforces of politics to overcome the forces of responsibility. We must \nact now.\n  I am very pleased to rise and express my appreciation to both Senator \nChafee and Senator Breaux for their outstanding leadership. Without \ntheir efforts, it would not have been possible to not only assemble \nthis bipartisan group but also to present the only bipartisan balanced \nbudget plan in this Congress.\n  I think over the past 5 months, we have all observed the on-and-off-\nagain budget negotiations, the close calls on the debt ceiling and also \nthe two Government shutdowns. In the wake of all those fiascoes, the \nunveiling of our budget offers reassurance and hope that despite \neverything you have seen and heard, that Republicans and Democrats can \ncome together and reach common ground on one of the most important \nissues facing this country.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, there is no more important issue to the \neconomic future of this country than that of balancing the budget. \nThere is no more important issue to the future of our children and our \ngrandchildren than that of balancing the budget.\n  Our unwillingness to address this issue really represents, \nunfortunately, the ultimate example of politics as usual and status quo \ngoverning. We, as a bipartisan group, look to the future. As Herb Stein \nof the American Enterprise Institute said recently, the problem we have \nwith the deficit is not now. The problem is the deficit in the next \ncentury, and the next century is 3\\1/2\\ years away.\n  Just consider the numbers. The debt will be $2.4 trillion in the year \n2002. It will double in 15 years. Then it will double every 5 years. \nThen at the point in 2025, in that year alone, the deficit will be $2 \ntrillion. It will require future generations to pay a tax of 82 percent \nand see a reduction in their benefits of 50 percent based on our \ncurrent spending and economic policies of today. Our bipartisan group \nconsidered that a reckless disregard for future generations by \nbequeathing them that legacy of debt.\n  I want to point out, as far as this bipartisan budget plan, a very \nsignificant factor and one which Senator Jeffords touched on, and that \nis the issue of discretionary spending. We have been paying lip service \nto the most important programs we have embraced in this institution, \nones that everybody talks about. That is education and the environment, \nfor example.\n  Take a look at this chart, for example, on discretionary spending. We \npropose very realistic spending levels for discretionary spending. We \ntook a hard freeze, which is $258 billion, and only proposed $10 \nbillion more than that in terms of discretionary spending over the 7 \nyears.\n  But if you look at the GOP offer in January and the President's offer \nin January, we have, for example, the January offer by GOP, $258 \nbillion, and beyond that $90 billion in cuts beyond a hard freeze.\n  The President's offer is $258 billion in a hard freeze and $40 \nbillion beyond that in terms of discretionary spending cuts. It is \nunrealistic. What is worse is that they postpone many of these cuts for \ndiscretionary spending to future Congresses, not even in the next \nCongress. It will be in the year 2001 or the year 2002 that most of \nthose cuts will occur.\n  I do not think it is fair to expect that any future Congress in the \nyear 2001 or 2002 is going to have to cut anywhere between $40 to $90 \nbillion in additional discretionary spending in order to reach their \ngoal of a balanced budget. You know exactly what will happen. It will \nnot happen.\n  So we propose a very realistic level of discretionary spending on the \nvery programs that we consider important to the American people, the \nvery programs that already have been cut significantly over the last 10 \nyears. So I hope that the Members of this Senate will look very \ncarefully at this budget, recognizing that this is a major step \nforward, that it is achievable, that we split the differences to reach \nthis common ground.\n  I hope furthermore that we in this Congress will not allow the forces \nof politics to overcome the forces of responsibility. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I strongly concur in the statements that have been \nmade by each of my colleagues this morning.\n  This is the time for public officials in Washington to stop the \nprocrastination, bickering, the confrontation, to start the process of \ngoverning for the benefit of the people of America.\n  I am encouraged from reports this morning that indicate that we may \nbe on the verge of reaching a resolution to the budget for fiscal year \n1996. I deplore the fact that it took until the 25th of April to reach \na budget resolution which should have been realized prior to October \n1st of 1995. But later is better than never at all.\n  Mr. President, we are at a historic moment in terms of our \nopportunity to balance the Federal budget. The leadership of the House \nand the membership of the House want a balanced budget. The same is \ntrue in the Senate. The President wants a balanced budget. We are on \nthe verge of producing the first balanced budget that we have had in \nalmost two generations.\n  Missing this premier opportunity, muddling along into the election \nbeyond, is a sure path for continued public disdain of our commitment \nand our ability to achieve an important national purpose. It would be a \ntragedy to let this opportunity drift away. In some ways it would be \nmore than a tragedy, it would be a disgrace and an outrage.\n  It is for exactly the avoidance of those negative perceptions that \nthe Centrist Coalition was formed, to see if\n\n[[Page S4104]]\n\nit was not possible to put together a reasonable plan to bring our \nFederal budget into balance and to keep it there and to do so on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  One of our principles was that if you are going to have sustained \nGovernment programs at the domestic or foreign level, that it is \ncritical that they be premised on a foundation of bipartisanship.\n  Let me just mention what I think are a few of the principal aspects \nof this Centrist coalition budget. The budget is honest. It brings us \ninto balance with a reasonable annual movement towards that balance. It \ndoes not postpone all the tough decisions to the last year. The budget \nalso sustains this balance by making critical structural changes. It \nwill help assure we stay in balance into the future.\n  This balanced budget will produce broad economic benefits for the \nNation. Virtually every economist agrees that if we can have a balanced \nbudget plan that we are committed to realizing that it will result in \nnoticeably lower interest rates over the next period than those \ninterest rates will be if we fail in this effort.\n  That will mean every month in the wallets of American families \nadditional dollars that they can spend--rather than spending on \ninterest--for their home mortgage. It will mean for young people coming \nout of colleges, universities, that they will have lower interest cost \nstudent loans. Virtually every American will benefit by this \ncontribution.\n  Mr. President, just briefly in the moments left to me, let me say \nthat I particularly worked on the section of this budget plan that \nrelates to Medicaid. It is a complicated area, which our \nrecommendations will be explained in more detail later.\n  But basic principles that will be preserved in this important area \ninclude the safety net for low-income and elderly Americans. A \ncontinuing Federal role in assuring that safety net is maintained. But \nsubstantial additional flexibility is given to the States in order to \ninnovate and to assist in realizing the significant savings which we \nthink are possible in this program.\n  This balanced budget will help preserve access to health coverage to \n37 million Americans. It gives Medicaid a shot in the arm--while at the \nsame time reducing costs by $62 billion dollars.\n  Some reformers have seized upon this budget debate as a way to \nabolish the Federal role in Medicaid. Others steadfastly defend the \nstatus quo, saying that Medicaid needs no medical attention whatsoever. \nBoth approaches are wrong. Medicaid doesn't need major surgery. But it \ncould use some preventative care to continue its efforts into the 21st \ncentury. Our budget does that.\n  Several months ago, the National Governors Association proposed a \nbipartisan plan to tend to Medicaid's infirmities. We share many of the \nGovernors' goals.\n  First, we agree that mending Medicaid--and balancing the budget--\ndepend on using aggressive therapy to control rising Medicaid costs. \nOur plan's savings will go a long way toward making Medicaid more \nefficient and balancing the budget.\n  We agree that one of the best ways to reduce costs is to give states \nmore freedom to design, create, and innovate. In our plan, that means \nno more waivers for managed care, home care, and community based care. \nIt means repeal of the Boren amendment. And it means dozens of other \nmeasures to encourage flexibility and state innovation.\n  Like the Governors, we feel strongly that the basic health care needs \nof our Nation's most vulnerable populations must be guaranteed. That \nmeans protecting the Federal-State partnership that has so successfully \nprovided for the health care needs of low-income Americans.\n  But we take this goal one step further. Thanks to Medicaid, 18 \nmillion children have access to hospital, physician care, \nprescriptions, and immunizations. We can't throw that away.\n  So even though the Governors' plan scales back coverage to children \nunder 133 percent of the poverty line, we maintain Medicaid's historic \nguarantee to cover children under 185 percent of the poverty line. Our \nchildren deserve healthy and safe lives.\n  We also agree with the Governors that Medicaid must lose its \naddiction to old budgets and old demographics. Most of the Medicaid \nofficials who created the program are no longer around. But their 30-\nyear-old statistics and funding formulas still serve as the basis for \nMedicaid policy decisions.\n  In this new era, we must adopt new thinking. Medicaid funds should \nfollow health care needs. States must be protected from unanticipated \nprogram costs resulting from economic fluctuations, changing \ndemographics, and natural disasters.\n  Because our centrist plan is all about balancing the budget, we adopt \nan additional principle. We protect the Federal Treasury from Medicaid \nfraud and abuse.\n  In the 1980's Medicaid created the Disproportionate Share Hospital \n[DSH] Program to assist hospitals with large numbers of low-income \npatients. Some States saw this as a way to reduce their contributions \nto Medicaid. Others saw it as an opportunity to transfer Federal \nMedicaid dollars to other priorities.\n  As a result of this abuse, Federal Medicaid costs exploded. Congress \nimplemented aggressive defensive therapy and cracked down on Medicaid \nabuse. Yet incredibly, Congress is now considering the repeal of those \nlaws we passed to crack down on abuse. That won't help to control \ncosts. It won't help us balance the budget.\n  It is high time for us to produce the balanced budget the American \npeople deserve. For more than 20 years, Washington has been asleep at \nthe wheel while the Federal budget has headed over the cliff.\n  Let's stop being modern-day Rip Van Winkles. Now is the time for \nreasonable, bipartisan compromise. Now is the time to balance the \nbudget.\n  So, Mr. President, I conclude by commending my colleagues who have \njoined in this effort who have provided such effective leadership. We \ndo not purport that this is Biblical. This is the product of men and \nwomen, fair-minded, trying to develop a compromise in the best \ntraditions of democratic government. We hope that this will serve to \nstimulate others to move forward and bring a plan for a balanced budget \nto the American people in 1996.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, first I would like to pay tribute to \nSenator John Chafee of Rhode Island. Whether the issue is health care \nreform or indeed dealing with a balanced budget, John Chafee has been \nin the forefront. He has demonstrated the kind of leadership that he \ndemonstrated many years ago at Guadalcanal.\n  He has continued to take the lead on tough issues, joined by \nDemocrats who show a similar amount of courage. I am thinking of John \nBreaux, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and so many others who are here on the \nfloor today. Without that kind of leadership, we would not be able to \nforge this bipartisan consensus. I take my hat off to Senator Chafee \nfor the courage he has shown over the years.\n  People are disenchanted with politics and politicians today. I think \nthere is a good reason for that. Because we have been drawing profiles \nin cowardice. We have failed to tell the people, in Walter Lippmann's \nwords, ``What they have to know and not what they want to hear.'' As a \nresult, we have misled them over the years by promising them more and \nmore without the corresponding obligation they have to pay for those \npromises.\n  We are where we are today because we have misled them. And so this \nrepresents a break in that particular tradition. The role of success in \nthe past has been to keep promising more and more and never having to \npay for it. Borrowing from our children, sacrificing their future, all \nthe while paving our way to electoral success. What this group is \nsaying is that has to stop.\n  I was looking at an article last evening in the Atlantic Monthly. I \ncall all of my colleagues' attention to it. It was written by Pete \nPeterson, the president, founder of the Concord Coalition. He has been \nwriting about this for years now. The article--I will just quote a \ncouple of things from it. It is one of the most powerful and persuasive \ncases one could possibly make about the need for this kind of proposal.\n  He quotes from Herbert Stein saying:\n  ``If something is unsustainable, it tends to stop.'' Or, as the old \nadage advises, ``If your horse dies, we suggest you dismount.''\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\n  Then he goes on to cite some really overwhelming statistics. My \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, mentioned some of them. I am just \nsummarizing it. Basically it says that if the Social Security trust \nfund and the Medicare hospital insurance, if they remain as they are, \nthe combined cash deficit in the year 2030 will be $1.7 trillion. In \nother words, the horse will be quite dead. By 2040 the deficit will \nprobably hit $3.2 trillion, and by 2050, $5.7 trillion; and even \ndiscounting inflation, without counting inflation, the deficit that \nyear for these two senior citizen programs will approximate $700 \nbillion or nearly four times the size of the entire 1996 Federal \ndeficit.\n\n  The numbers are staggering. The demographics are overwhelming. \nConsider the fact that in just 4 years 76,000 Americans are going to \nlive to be 100 years old, the baby boomers, out of the baby boomers \nmore than 1 million will reach the age of 100. In just four decades \none-fourth, 25 percent of our population, is going to be over the age \nof 65 and our nursing home population is going the double. The \ndemographics are simply overwhelming.\n  If we are looking at tax increases, while both parties are talking \nabout tax cuts, tax increases by the year 2040, the cost of Social \nSecurity as a share of worker payroll, is expected to rise from today's \n11.5 percent to either 17 or 22 percent. If you add the Medicare \nProgram, the workers will be paying between 35 and 55 percent of their \npayroll just for those two programs, not counting anything else in the \nentire Federal budget.\n\n  The numbers are overwhelming. It is as if, Mr. President, we were \ntold by our scientists that a giant meteor is rocketing its way toward \nEarth. It will arrive in about 10 or 15 years. When it strikes, it will \ndestroy all life in the United States--maybe the entire planet. What \nwould our reaction be? Ignore it? Say it is a lie? Or it is inevitable \nand nothing can be done? Besides, we will be dead and it will not \nmatter. It is our children and our grandchildren's problem; let them \ncontend with it. Or would we exercise the kind of courage and vision \nthat, say, a John F. Kennedy did when he said, ``In the next decade, we \nare going to put a man on the moon.''\n  That is the kind of courage and vision we need to start exercising \nnow. We need to say there is a giant meteor coming and we need to build \nsomething that will destroy it before it destroys us. That is the \nreason we are here today. I commend my colleagues, Senator Chafee, \nSenator Kerrey, who has been a leader in facing up to the issues of the \nneeds of reform in our Social Security system, which is a third rail of \npolitics, and all the other colleagues on the floor. I commend each of \nyou for your effort to reach a bipartisan consensus on what we have to \ndo to destroy that giant meteor that is out there heading this way.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I, like my other colleagues, want to \npraise both Senators Chafee and Breaux for keeping this group on task \nand hope that this proposal, this bipartisan proposal, equally divided \nbetween Republicans and Democrats, will provide a foundation upon which \nthis Congress can act to enact a balanced budget plan sometime yet this \nyear.\n  I will focus my attention on the reforms in this proposal that \naddress the unsustainable growth of entitlements that the distinguished \nSenator from Maine earlier referenced. There are three pieces to this \nproposal that will be regarded by many as controversial and by many as \nimpossible to do.\n  This chart is not a birthday cake here to my left, as the Senator \nfrom Louisiana joked earlier. This represents the kind of cuts that are \ngoing to be required in discretionary spending over the next 7 years. \nIn the agreement just announced last night between the White House and \nthe Congress, rather than cutting or raising taxes, we essentially sold \n4.7 billion dollars worth of assets in order to be able to balance the \nbudget--in order to be able to get an agreement, because nobody wanted \nto cut any deeper. Very few people want to cut deeper in discretionary \nprograms. Next year, we will have to do 28 billion dollars worth of \nasset sales. By the time you get down to the seventh year under the \nPresident's balanced budget plan--let me applaud the President, I \nappreciate very much that he has a plan on the table because I think it \nis helpful--$91 billion in discretionary spending, defense and \nnondefense. It is impossible.\n  I do not think there is anybody in this body that can come up with a \nlist of things they would cut today of $91 billion. What that means is \nwe are kidding ourselves. What it means is if you do not want to raise \ntaxes, you have to go under the entitlement programs to be able to take \nthe pressure off of discretionary spending. Even still, as the \nbipartisan proposal shows, even still we are suggesting substantial \ncuts in discretionary programs that will be very, very difficult to \nimplement.\n\n  My guess is these modest changes in entitlements that will be \nregarded as draconian and difficult, and there will be a wail of \nprotest to change the CPI down one-half of 1 percent. That saves $100 \nbillion over 7 years. We will hear all kinds of rationales and reasons \nwhy that cannot be done. All kinds of numbers will be put forth, and \nhorror stories will be told as to why this change in the Consumer Price \nIndex should not be enacted.\n  In the alternative, you will have to do this sort of thing, or even \nworse. For those who oppose it, those who say, ``No, I do not want to \ndo it,'' the first question for the citizen needs to be, then, does \nthat mean you support these deep cuts in education, these deep cuts in \ninvestment, deep cuts in defense, deep cuts in law enforcement? Is that \nwhat you are supporting?\n  You cannot merely oppose this. You have to come up with something \nthat you will substitute in its place. Perhaps, the Member of Congress \nor the citizen supports a tax increase. Let them. Let them say so. Do \nnot just stand and say, ``Gee, I do not want to adjust the Consumer \nPrice Index because I will have an interest group or individual who \nsays I do not want to take less.'' That is basically the formula here.\n  We are on a course, as the Senator from Maine described, as a \nmeteorite. We are converting our Federal Government into a transfer \nmachine. We have an unprecedented event that begins in the year 2008: \nThe largest generation in the history of the country, the baby boom \ngeneration, begins to retire. It is not like anything we faced in the \npast. We cannot afford to wait until we reach crisis.\n  The second and third things that are done, we adjust the Medicare \neligibility age to correspond with Social Security eligibility age, and \nwe adjust civil and military service retirement age for future \nemployees of the Federal Government of the armed services.\n  I hope to have a chance to come back as the coalition builds. I urge \ncolleagues who will hear from citizens saying ``do not support the \nConsumer Price Index change, do not support Medicare eligibility \nchange, do not support adjusting civil and military service \nprospectively,'' I urge my colleagues to keep the powder dry. In the \nalternative, this is the sort of thing you will end up having to \nsupport.\n\n  I applaud the junior Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, and \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, for their leadership.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with a modest degree of courage and a \ngenerous share of good will, this bipartisan report may well be \nremembered as a landmark in political and economic history of the \n1990's.\n  Personally, I never believed that we would reach the goal of a \nbalanced budget except during the first 6 months of a new Presidency, \nin which that President made it his highest priority. In spite of that \nbelief, last year we almost did so with a Republican proposal that \nwould, in fact, have balanced the budget. That proposal was rejected by \nthe President, but, nevertheless, it moved us forward on the right \nroad. It was followed by a proposal by the President, and another by \nDemocrats in this body, that moved the two sides closer together but \nstill left a great gulf between them.\n  Now, working together, we do have a proposal before the body this day \nfor a very real balanced budget, a very real balanced budget based on \nthe reform of entitlements which are both expensive and expansive and \nwhich will ultimately destroy the financial security of this country. \nModest in some areas, dramatic in other areas, yet, nevertheless, will \ndo the job.\n\n[[Page S4106]]\n\n  Now, Mr. President, to many people in the United States, all of whom \nbasically support a balanced budget, it is, nevertheless, something of \nan abstraction--a good to be sought but not one well understood. \nPerhaps the most important part of this budget proposal is the dividend \nthat it will pay not just to the Government of the United States but to \nthe people of the United States. Perhaps as much as a quarter of a \ntrillion dollars will end up being saved by the Federal Government in \nlower interest payments on the national debt and in greater revenue \ncollections from a more healthy and vibrant American economy.\n  At least three times that much will be paid in a dividend to the \nAmerican people in lower interest rates on their homes and on their \nautomobile purchases and in higher wages from more and better jobs. A \ngood estimate will be that every family, the average family in the \nUnited States, will be $1,000 a year better off if we do this than if \nwe do not do it. Of course, if we do not do it, the downside over the \ndecade will be immense.\n  We owe a great debt of thanks to the two Johns, Senator Chafee and \nSenator Breaux, who have led this effort, but leading it to success \nwill require that courage and that good will.\n  Mr. BREAUX. How much time on our side remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Louisiana and my friend and colleague from Rhode Island for the \nleadership of this group.\n  Mr. President, it has been an honor and a pleasure to participate in \nthis bipartisan group to achieve a balanced budget.\n  This group has been meeting for nearly 6 months in an effort to come \nup with a budget that balances in 7 years.\n  We started with the premise that coming to balance in a bipartisan \nway is not an impossible task. But, it certainly was painful at times. \nThe cost of not pressing ahead to come to balance will hurt even more \nin the long run. And I very much believe the economic benefits of \ntrying to come to balance make those tough decisions about slowing \nspending that much easier.\n  I am particularly pleased with the efforts this group has made to \naddress the growth in entitlement programs in both the short and the \nlong term. Some of these changes will produce no savings in the 7-year \nbudget window we are talking about. But they are much needed reforms \nand they will save a lot of money in the longer run.\n  The package we are discussing here today contains smaller cuts in \ndiscretionary spending than any of the other major budget balancing \nplans that have been presented to date. The discretionary spending cut \nnumber contained in this plan is far more realistic than the numbers \nthat have been floated in other plans. As we all know, these spending \ncut targets will need to be met year by year through the appropriations \nprocess. As any member of the Appropriations Committee can tell you, \nmaking dramatic cuts in discretionary spending is like trying to get \nwater from a stone. There is just not a lot of slack there anymore.\n  We need to go where the money is and that is in the explosive growth \nin entitlement spending. If we don't get a handle on this spending, we \ncan forget about doing all of the things we believe the Federal \nGovernment ought to do. Things like improving education and building \nroads. Like providing for a national defense. Like keeping our air and \nwater clean. As Matthew Miller observed in the New Republic, ``At this \nrate, by 2010, when the baby boom retires, entitlements and interest on \nthe debt will take up all available revenue, meaning there won't be a \ncent left for the FBI, the Pentagon, (or) the national parks . . . Nor \nwill there be a dime to bolster our lagging R, education and \ninfrastructure investments, where we've trailed Germany and Japan for \nyears.'' That is just the beginning. As Miller points out, ``Then if \nit's possible, things get worse.''\n  The critical need to control entitlement spending in this bill is \ngrowing. We learned earlier this week that Medicare's Hospital \nInsurance Program lost $4.2 billion in the first half of this fiscal \nyear. This trust fund, which pays hospital bills for the elderly and \ndisabled, lost money for the first time last year since 1972. But the \nloss last year was $35.7 million for the year, not $4.2 billion for \nhalf the year.\n  The bipartisan plan adds an element of fairness to the voluntary \nportion of Medicare. We ask those who have more to pay more for this \nvaluable benefit. The group has looked at recommendations made by the \nBoskin Commission on adjusting the consumer price index. That \ncommission believed the adjustment should be in the neighborhood of 0.7 \nto 2. By this measure our proposal is cautious in its recommendation of \nless than a 0.7 change in the CPI.\n  We have also consolidated the existing welfare programs into a block \ngrant to States which will give States the flexibility they need to \ncome up with innovative ways to help get the poor out of the welfare \nsystem and into the capitalist system.\n\n  This budget package also contains a number of important tax \nprovisions. We have included $130 billion in tax cuts in our package as \nwell as $25 billion in corporate loophole closers. It is no secret that \nnot everyone believes we need a tax cut at this time. Indeed, not \neveryone in the bipartisan group believes now is the time for a tax cut \nbut we all recognized the need to compromise if we intended to put \ntogether a package that could actually pass. Personally, I think it \nimportant to include tax cuts, particularly in the broader context of \nwhy we want and need to balance the budget. Probably the most \ncompelling reason for us to balance the budget is to minimize the \ndissaving which budget deficits represent. With an unsettlingly low \nsavings rate in this country, the last thing we need is to add to that \nproblem through government deficits. We very much need to boost savings \nand make that money available for investment which is essential to \nimproving productivity, competitiveness and ultimately to creating jobs \nand increasing real wages in this country. I am delighted that the tax \npackage we have put together contains genuine incentives for savings \nand investment and I think such a package adds to, not detracts from, \nthis budget proposal. In the interest of full disclosure, I should also \nreveal that my home State of Connecticut labors under the highest per \ncapita tax burden in the country, making tax relief all the more \nimportant to me.\n  In particular, the bipartisan tax package contains a variation on a \nproposal that Senator Bob Kerrey and I have been working on, called \n``KidSave.'' The bipartisan package allows parents to take a $250 \ncredit for each of their children under the age of 17. However, if a \nparent agrees to set aside their credit in a retirement savings account \nfor their child, that credit is doubled to $500. These retirement \naccounts would follow virtually all IRA rules with one exception: We \nwould allow children to borrow against them for their higher education.\n  Thanks to the wonders of compound interest, $500 a year invested for \n17 years in a child's name at 10 percent growth a year, the average \ngrowth over the last 70 years, will yield over a million dollars by the \ntime the child reaches age 60. That's great news for parents and kids. \nAnd it is also great news for our economy since we need to take strong \nsteps to increase our drastically low savings rates. The bipartisan \nproposal would also allow parents whose income exceeds the income \nlimits on the credit to set aside up to $500 in after-tax dollars in a \nKidSave account and reap the benefits of the tax-free build-up of these \ndollars. Under current law, it is very difficult to set up an IRA for a \nchild since most children do not have the earned income needed to \nqualify for a retirement account.\n  The bipartisan proposal also contains a 50-percent reduction in the \ncapital gains tax for individuals as well as a drop in the corporate \ncapital gains rate to 31 percent. This section also allows for the \ndeduction of a loss on a personal residence sale and a 75-percent \ncapital gains exclusion for qualified small business stock. These \nproposals are very similar to those contained in S. 959, a bill I have \ncosponsored with Senator Hatch from Utah. We should all keep in mind \nthat the benefits of a capital gains cut will flow to millions of \nAmericans of all income groups--to anyone who has stock, who has money\n\n[[Page S4107]]\n\ninvested in a mutual fund, who has property, who has a stock option \nplan at work, who owns a small business. That represents millions of \nmiddle class American families. And these are just the direct \nbeneficiaries, not even counting the many middle and lower income \npeople who will get and keep jobs thanks to the investments spurred by \na capital gains tax cut.\n  In addition, our proposal expands the availability of tax deductible \nIRA's and allows for penalty-free withdrawals from those accounts for a \nnumber of reasons. We have also included two higher education tax \nincentives, some significant AMT relief, estate tax relief, an increase \nin the self-employed health deduction to 50 percent and an extension of \nthe expiring tax provisions.\n  Taken together, these tax cuts will encourage investment and savings \nwhich will in turn stimulate economic growth in this country. That \ngrowth will generate jobs and those jobs will generate greater \nrevenues. And of course, that revenue will make it easier for us to \nbalance the budget.\n  When all is said and done, I believe this is a thoughtful and \nmeaningful set of tax provisions. They are part of a larger budget \npackage which is thoughtful and meaningful as well. I hope that this \nChamber will consider taking up this package, or something quite \nsimilar to it, in the weeks and months ahead. To not do so, would be \npassing up a tremendous opportunity. I hope we won't do that and I \nwould encourage my colleagues to join us in our effort to move this \nbipartisan budget forward.\n  Mr. President, it is April 25, 1996, and we are pleased to note this \nmorning that our respective leadership and the White House have agreed, \n7 months into fiscal year 1996, on a budget for fiscal year 1996.\n  This is unprecedented and obviously regrettable. It has been \ntumultuous for those who work for the Federal Government. But, on the \nother hand, I would like to think that all of us have learned something \nfrom the travails of this year, the long and twisted path that we have \nfollowed, to finally be at a point where we can adopt a budget for \nfiscal year 1996. I hope we will take what we have learned and apply it \nto the broader challenge and opportunity we have to adopt a program to \ntake us to real balance by a date certain.\n  Can we do it? Well, 22 of us are here this morning, Republicans and \nDemocrats who worked side by side, dropping our party labels and \nagreeing that we are all Americans, and that we have a common problem \nhere, which is to take our country out of debt and to thereby help our \neconomy grow. This group of 22 was able to do it. And we hope that this \nproposal that we are presenting this morning will filter out to our \ncolleagues in both parties and up to the leadership of the Congress and \nthe White House to give them the confidence that they, too, can work \ntogether to bring our budget into balance. This is exactly not only \nwhat America's future demands, but what the American people want today.\n  Mr. President, I want to focus for a moment on the provisions of this \npackage that deal with tax cuts. Tax cuts are controversial. Some \npeople say--particularly on my side of the aisle--``Why have tax cuts \nif you are trying to balance the budget?'' But this group, wanting to \npresent our colleagues with a package that had a chance of passage, \nincluded substantial tax cuts--$130 billion in tax cuts over the 7 \nyears. I believe very strongly that these tax cuts are consistent with \nour aim of balancing the budget and, particularly, consistent with the \ndesire that drives the movement to balance the budget. And that is the \ndesire to get America growing--to create and protect jobs for average \nworking Americans.\n  We have in here a capital gains tax cut, a 50-percent cut on the \nindividual side, one that I think will unleash billions of dollars of \ncapital in the private sector and create the kind of momentum that can \nraise our national rate of growth from the anemic place we have been, \nup a half point, up a full point, to create millions of new jobs and \ngreater wealth in our country.\n  Mr. President, we have some incentives here for greater savings, \nexpanded individual retirement accounts. And, Mr. President, we have \nsome relief for the middle class. People talk about wage stagnation of \nthe middle class. What is the best way to help overcome that wage \nstagnation? Put a little more money in the pocket of working families \nwith children. Under our plan, parents can take a $250 credit for their \nchildren or agree to set that money aside in a KidSave account for that \nchild's higher education and retirement and receive $500.\n  Mr. President, this is a good, strong program. These tax cuts are a \nvital part of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, as I stand here today with my \ncolleagues discussing a new plan to balance the budget, I can guess \nwhat many Americans are probably thinking: ``Here they go again.''\n  The budget has been the catalyst driving our agenda for more than a \nyear, from our vote on the balanced budget amendment to the debates \nover the budget resolution, budget reconciliation package, and annual \nspending bills. Haven't every one of us, Republican and Democrat, stood \nup on this floor and professed--repeatedly--our support for a balanced \nbudget? Why then don't we have a balanced budget?\n  I can guess something else Americans are thinking, because I hear it \nfrom many Kansans: We should run Government as we'd run a business, and \nbalance our books. I agree, Mr. President, but it is more complex than \nthat, for better or worse, and it is part of the reason we still do not \nhave a budget agreement.\n  When we discuss the Federal budget, we are discussing more than a \nledger sheet. We are discussing national priorities with real \nconsequences, and we do not all agree on the priorities or their \nconsequences. Finding middle ground becomes a challenge of its own. Yet \nwe cannot allow the enormity of our task--or the controversy \nsurrounding it-- to scare us away from trying to restore sound fiscal \npolicy.\n  Because we are discussing an endeavor of broad national significance, \nI do not think we can overemphasize the importance of fairness. The \nvast majority of Americans say they are in favor of balancing the \nbudget, whether or not they realize what it means for programs they \nmight like. We all talk about tough choices here, but I think we have \nseen that Americans are not likely to accept those tough choices unless \nthey are convinced they also are fair. And that is what this budget \nis--tough but fair.\n  It is tough on welfare, placing a 5-year lifetime limit on benefits. \nBut it also keeps a safety net in place for children. For example, we \nwould allow States to ease work requirements for parents who cannot \nfind child care for children who are not yet school-aged. In my mind, \nMr. President, that's fair.\n  Neither is the plan selective in its toughness. One thing we all hear \nwhen we talk to constituents is that Congress must not exempt itself \nfrom these tough choices. I agree, and have been pleased to see us turn \na discerning eye on ourselves--foregoing, for example, our automatic \ncost-of-living increases for 3 years running, as well as reducing \noverall spending for the legislative branch by 9 percent last year. \nThis budget proposal, which calls for increases in retirement \ncontributions from Federal agencies and employees, also reforms \njudicial and congressional retirement by conforming their accrual and \ncontribution rates to those of all other Federal employees. Once again, \na necessary and fair step.\n  This budget is tough but fair when it comes to discretionary programs \nas well. By holding discretionary spending to a level slightly below \nfiscal year 1995 for the next 7 years, we can achieve savings without \ncrippling important programs, from education and crime control, to \nhousing and transportation. In any case, it is not discretionary \nspending that poses the real long-term challenge to balancing the \nbudget. That challenge comes from rapidly growing entitlement programs.\n  We do not ignore that challenge in this budget, making significant \nreforms to small and large programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. \nBoth of those vital programs would continue to grow, but at a more \nmanageable pace. And the way we would find savings would be fair. From \nMedicare, for example, we have found a balance between reforms that \naffect providers and those that affect recipients. Throughout this \nprocess, I have said that we\n\n[[Page S4108]]\n\nshould not go too far in cutting provider payments. If we do, we cannot \nexpect that Medicare beneficiaries will continue to have access to \nhigh-quality health care services, especially in rural settings.\n  Our budget proposal is tough on taxes, too, eliminating unnecessary \ndeductions and making other tax reforms to save $25 billion. We would \ngive the Internal Revenue Service authority to deduct payments from the \nFederal wages, retirement checks, or Social Security checks of \ndelinquent taxpayers. That is a tough proposal, Mr. President, but it \nis only fair to millions of conscientious Americans who faithfully pay \ntheir taxes.\n  Those reforms and others in our package allow us to propose modest \nbut important tax cuts to middle-class families in the form of a $250-\nper-child tax credit. The credit could be increased to as much as $500 \nif parents contribute to an individual retirement account in their \nchild's name. The package includes deductions for educational expenses \nand the interest paid on student loans, and it also offers important \nincentives to investment and growth.\n  A few years ago, I worked on another bipartisan piece of budget \nlegislation, that time with Senator Grassley and Senator Biden. You \nmight recall that we would have frozen all Federal spending for 1 year. \nWe did so knowing at the time that such a proposal might be viewed as \naustere or even rash, but then, as now, our budget crisis warranted a \nbold step. The idea of fairness, of every program contributing its \nshare toward a goal that eventually would benefit them all, was \nappealing to me, as it was to many Americans.\n  This budget proposal, while not taking the shape of a formal freeze, \nretains that appeal for me. It is a budget that calls for shared \nresponsibility, that neither heaps the burden of that responsibility on \na single group nor exempts others from doing their share.\n  Moreover, the shared responsibility will pay off in the end. The \ntough choices we make today will preserve fundamental programs for the \nfuture. But the longer we delay, the more drastic the steps will become \nto keep even the most essential services viable. Senator Simpson talked \nabout this on the floor earlier this week, as he and Senator Kerrey \nhave many times before. If we do nothing, in less than 20 years our \nchoices will be made for us, because by then, all of our revenues will \nbe consumed by mandatory spending. We will be forced to react with huge \ntax increases or draconian entitlement spending cuts. Then, our choices \nwill not be tough--they will be impossible.\n  We can avoid that impossible situation. There is no denying that this \nbipartisan budget is tough, but it is fair --fair to seniors, fair to \nworking families, fair to people struggling to get back on their feet, \nand above all, fair to our young people and our future. For them, the \nultimate in unfairness is inaction. Let us be fair to them and consider \nthis budget proposal as a serious step toward fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux, who have \nlong been guiding lights in attempting to pull together a bipartisan \neffort for a balanced budget. I am sure there are many eyes that glaze \nover at this point as we talk about a budget once again and a balanced \nbudget and say, ``Here they go again.'' But I would like to suggest, \nMr. President, that this was a missed opportunity. We must pull \ntogether to lay out a roadmap for our country in the future, because \neveryone desires sound fiscal policy and wants to see our goal of a \nbalanced budget. A budget is a catalyst that really sets our agenda. It \nestablishes our priorities. It provides a roadmap.\n  Some people say, ``Well, why can you not get to a balanced budget? We \nhave to balance our budget in our businesses. We attempt to balance our \nbudgets in our homes. Why, then, do we not have a balanced budget?''\n  I think that one of the reasons is that when we discuss the Federal \nbudget, we are discussing more than a ledger sheet. We are discussing \nnational priorities with real consequences, and we do not all agree on \nthe priorities or the consequences. Finding middle ground becomes a \nchallenge to everyone. Yet, we cannot allow the enormity of our task or \nthe controversy surrounding it to scare us away from trying to restore \nsound fiscal policy.\n  What I believe the initiative does that we have before us in this \nbudget presentation is fairness and tough choices. It touches \neverybody, and that, perhaps, is one of the reasons that I think we can \ncome together and say we have not set one group or another group aside. \nIt makes changes that will affect everyone. This takes us to a balanced \nbudget.\n  Is it important to us today, as we struggle with many issues, but all \nissues really are reflected in our budget. I think, most of all, what \nit says is that we can accomplish something here and accomplish it in a \nfair way, a tough way, and a bipartisan way. It will be in the best \ninterest not only of today, as we provide priorities and initiatives in \nour policies, but for the future.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that if we fail now, we will have failed \nfor the future generations. That is why I think this is a monumental \nopportunity and a challenge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to add my words of thanks to the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, and the Senator from \nLouisiana, Senator Breaux, who led this effort to address what I \nbelieve is the most important question facing America.\n\n  What we do here will largely determine the economic future for us and \nfor our children. That is the stakes of the debate that we have \nembarked upon.\n  Mr. President, the hard reality is that we are facing a time bomb in \nthis country. It is a demographic time bomb. It is the time bomb of the \nbaby boom generation. The baby boom generation begins to retire very \nsoon now. They are going to double the number of people who are \neligible for Social Security, for Medicare, and the other entitlement \nprograms.\n  We know what that means. There is no mistaking the future if we fail \nto act. The Entitlements Commission told us clearly, if we stay on our \ncurrent course, by the year 2012, every penny of the Federal budget \nwill go for entitlements and interest on the debt. There will be no \nmoney for roads. There will be no money for defense. There will be no \nmoney for parks. There will be no money for item after item that is \nimportant to the American people.\n  Mr. President, the Entitlements Commission also told us that if we \nfail to act, future generations will face either an 80 percent tax \nrate--an 80 percent tax rate--or a one-third cut in all benefits. Mr. \nPresident, that is a catastrophe. We have a window of opportunity--a \nnarrow window of opportunity--to get our fiscal house in order before \nthat calamity occurs. Our generation will be judged based on how we \nrespond.\n\n  Mr. President, future generations will curse our generation if we \nfail to act. What this group has said is there is a way. We can do it. \nWe have demonstrated the way. On a bipartisan basis, 22 Senators came \ntogether and wrote a plan that will strengthen the economic future of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, it will mean more savings, more investment, stronger \neconomic growth, more jobs, and a brighter economic future for our \nchildren. We can do it. We must do it. We have the opportunity to do \nit, if we have the courage to escape our narrow, political, partisan \ntrenches that have prevented us from doing what must be done.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have a little bit of time. Whatever time \nI have left I yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia. We are going to do this again, I say to my colleagues, \nhopefully on Tuesday morning,\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, having been in this body for 3 years, \none thing has become a truism for me with respect to a balanced budget. \nIf it is a Republican plan, the Democrats are going to oppose it. If it \nis a Democratic plan, the Republicans will oppose it.\n  We have traveled various roads to get there over the last year, but \nwe have\n\n[[Page S4109]]\n\nstumbled in our efforts to make some very difficult choices and there \nwill be a heavy price to pay for these mistakes.\n  But the ultimate price will be paid by the American people--our \nchildren and grandchildren--if we do not put our economic house in \norder.\n  Therefore, it seems to me that, if we believe what the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota just pointed out--and I do--that for the sake \nof our future and our children's future, we must act and act now. If we \nfail to take this opportunity to change the unsustainable present \ncourse, the next generation will face either an 82-percent tax rate or \nwe will be cutting benefits by 33 percent across the board.\n  What is clear to me is that the only way to solve the problem is in a \nbipartisan way. Therefore, I, too, want to salute the Senator from \nRhode Island and the Senator from Louisiana for their leadership \nbecause without it you would not have a document to which 11 \nRepublicans and 11 Democrats now subscribe.\n  The U.S. Government has not balanced its budget since 1969. Since \nthen, the Federal debt has risen to $5 trillion. Interest on the debt \nalone is over $260 billion a year.\n  By one measure, all the personal income tax paid by people living \nWest of the Mississippi wouldn't even pay the interest on the debt.\n  Today, the two fastest growing parts of the budget are: First, \nentitlements, such as Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and Federal \nretirement programs, and second, interest on the debt.\n  I think all one has to do is take a look at expenditures of the \nFederal Government. In 1969, entitlements were 27 percent of the \nbudget. In 1995, entitlements were almost 52 percent of the budget. \nTherefore, in the future, entitlements by the year 2003 and net \ninterest on the debt alone will total more than 70 percent of the \noutlays.\n  Discretionary spending--the budgets for the Department of Justice, \nNASA, Veterans' Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency, to name \njust a few--has shrunk from 21.3 percent of the budget in 1969 to 18.2 \npercent in 1995, and we are continuing to cut. Our discretionary \nspending has been brought under control, but entitlement spending has \nnot.\n  What these charts tell you, is that, if we don't reign in the cost of \nentitlement programs, we could not cut enough discretionary spending to \nbalance the budget.\n  Even if we eliminated the entire Departments of Justice, Health and \nHuman Services, Education, Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, \nTransportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA--we \ncouldn't balance the budget without cutting entitlements.\n  So this is the problem we have been trying to solve. And it's not \nacademic--the budget deficit is a problem that affects people.\n  Increases in the Federal deficit mean higher interest rates. It means \nbuying, or refinancing a home costs more. It means borrowing money for \nbusiness, school or a new car is more expensive.\n  It saps the private sector's ability to borrow funds in order to grow \nand create jobs and when businesses can't borrow money to modernize or \nexpand productivity--the economy and employment suffer. Small \nbusinesses, who don't sell stock to raise money and may have to borrow \nto fuel growth, are the ones who suffer the most.\n  The Centrist Coalition proposal balances the budget from the middle, \ndrawing from Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  The Centrist plan provides targeted tax cuts of $130 billion--not as \nmuch as the Republicans wanted, but more than the administration \noffered--aimed at helping families, such as a ``KidSave'' a child tax \ncredit coupled with an IRA, other IRA reforms, and tax breaks for \neducation.\n  It includes tax provisions to encourage economic growth, like capital \ngains reform for businesses and individuals, and the extension of the \nR tax credit.\n  It provides an estimated $154 billion in savings from Medicare--\nagain, not the steep cuts in the Republican proposal, but farther than \nthe Administration was willing to go.\n  It saves an estimated $62 billion in Medicaid, and $54 billion in \nwelfare spending--providing more latitude for States to further our \ngoals of reform, but retaining Medicaid as the health insurance safety \nnet for elderly, the disabled, AIDS patients and low-income Americans.\n  The Centrist plan maintains Federal quality standards and enforcement \nmechanisms in nursing home care, such as required staff-to-patient \nratios and commitments for patient privacy.\n  Balancing the budget is an exercise in setting priorities. This plan \nmay not have everything I want. It includes some things I do not \nsupport. However, this plan achieves our goal of balancing the budget \nin 7 years, and represents a strong, bipartisan effort to do what s \nright--reigning in spending, protecting our most vulnerable citizens, \nand investing in our future. This is a fair and good plan. I am very \npleased to support it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will try to take less time than that.\n  I congratulate Senator Chafee, Senator Breaux, and others who have \nworked on this proposal. It is truly a bipartisan proposal. This is the \nlast train in town. If this does not go, if we do not get people to \nrally around this, then we are not going to get a deal this year. It \ndoes not have to be every word of this. But this is a framework, and I \nthink our colleagues recognize that.\n  Mr. President, I will add one other word. If we get the balanced \nbudget for 7 years, as this proposal would do, we have still a long way \nto go. This Congress and this country has to look at a 20- to 30-year \nfiscal picture. We will have to set in motion things now that can be \nimplemented very gradually and very slowly. We have to reform Social \nSecurity. We have to reform Medicare. We can do it very gradually where \npeople do not get hurt, and also for those who are near retirement and \ncertainly for those who are already retired. But we have to address it \nfor generations. To balance the budget by the year 2002 is not enough \nbecause it can get out of balance right after that and be back in the \nsame picture.\n  I thank the Chair. I particularly thank Senator Chafee and Senator \nBreaux for their sterling leadership.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, as one of the original 22 members of this \nbipartisan coalition, I support of the Centrist Coalition's 7-year \nbalanced budget proposal as a sound, moderate approach to a problem \nbegging for a solution.\n  Mr. President, this balanced budget proposal came about because evey \nmember of the bipartisan coalition took it upon themselves to find a \nsolution to the budget impasse that grips this country. During last \nyear's budget cycle, responsible spending decisions were buffeted about \nby the winds of political rhetoric. This group of Senators is concerned \nabout the future of this country, and about what failure to balance the \nbudget today can do to burden the lives of our children and \ngrandchildren tomorrow.\n  Our coalition considered a number of balanced budget proposals. We \nlooked at the President's budget proposal, the National Governors \nAssociation's budget recommendations, and at the House and Senate \nversions of the budget bill. We included elements of each proposal in \nour final plan.\n  We took the time to hammer out a bipartisan compromise on every facet \nof the Federal budget. I believe this plan represents the greatest \nchance this country has to enact balanced budget legislation.\n  Our burgeoning Federal debt is the greatest crisis facing our Nation \ntoday. It is gobbling up our savings, robbing our ability to invest in \ninfrastructure and education, and saddling our children with an \nenormous bill that will eventually have to be paid. The interest \npayments on the debt consume dollars that could otherwise go for urgent \nneeds such as infrastructure and education.\n  As late as 1980, our national debt was less than a trillion dollars. \nA decade later it had more than tripled and today exceeds 4.9 trillion. \nSimply limiting the Government's ability to borrow is not enough to \nachieve deficit reduction or to control the compounding interest on the \nnational debt. According to CBO, ``significant deficit reduction can \nbest be accomplished by legislative decisions that reduce outlays or \nincrease revenues.''\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\n  When I took the oath of office in 1983 as Governor of the State of \nNevada, the Nevada State Constitution required a balanced budget. The \nnecessary, excruciating task of balancing the State budget took strong \nexecutive and legislative leadership. Those tough decisions were made, \nand each year the State budget was balanced.\n  Nevada is not alone in requiring a balanced budget; in fact, many \nStates across the Nation require Governors to submit, and legislatures \nto pass, budgets that reconcile revenues and expenditures. It is time \nthat the Congress and the President come together and make the tough \ndecisions that are required for fiscally responsible governance.\n  Not only is the Federal debt itself a problem, but annual interest \npayments on the national debt are devouring precious Federal dollars. \nFor more than a decade, Congress and the President have had a credit \ncard mentality--buy goods and services today, worry about the payment \nlater. The public must share some of this blame as well, because there \nare constant objections to cutting Government programs. When the bill \ncomes due, make that minimum payment and keep charging away. As any \nconsumer knows, if you only make the minimum payment and continue to \ncharge, you will never pay off the balance. The finance charges will \njust keep accruing. Unlike real life, however, the use of this \nGovernment credit card is never denied and the amount of debt continues \nto grow unchecked.\n  History has shown that nothing is more desired and nothing is more \navoided than the will to make tough choices. The last time our Federal \nbudget was balanced was 1969.\n  The Centrist Coalition's balanced budget plan is fair; it \nrestructures and reforms Federal programs that are inefficient, in \naddition to scaling back spending. We want to make sure we get the most \nbang for the Federal buck.\n  For instance, our balanced budget plan preserves Medicare and \nprotects its long-term solvency. We expand the choices for Medicare \nbeneficiaries by allowing them to remain in the traditional fee-for-\nservice Medicare Program or to choose from a range of private managed \ncare plans. By creating a new payment system for managed care and by \nslowing the rate of growth in payments to hospitals, physicians, and \nother service providers, our plan extends the solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund.\n  Our Medicaid reform plan protects the most vulnerable in our Nation. \nWe incorporated a number of the National Governors Association's \nrecommendations regarding enhanced State flexibility, while maintaining \nimportant safeguards for the Federal Treasury and retaining the \nguarantee of coverage for beneficiaries. Our Medicaid funding is based \nupon the population of covered people in each State, thereby ensuring \nadequate Federal funding in economic downturns. Our plan maintains a \nnational guarantee of coverage for low-income pregnant women, children, \nthe elderly, and the disabled. We allow States to design health care \ndelivery systems which best suit their needs without obtaining waivers \nfrom the Federal Government. Under this plan, States can determine \nprovider rates, create managed care programs, and develop home and \ncommunity-based care options for seniors to help keep them out of \nnursing homes.\n  Our welfare reform language includes strong work requirements and \nchild protections. The welfare reform package includes many of the \nNational Governors Association's recommendations; it is also based on \nthe welfare reform bill that passed the Senate overwhelmingly last year \nby a vote of 87 to 12. This package calls for tough new work \nrequirements, a time limit on benefits, a block grant to provide \nmaximum State flexibility while ensuring recipients are treated fairly, \nincreased child care funding to enable parents to work, and a \ncontingency fund to backstop States during recessionary times. Finally, \nour plan preserves the important safety net of food stamp and foster \ncare programs.\n  Included in our plan are provisions for tax relief to hard-working \nfamilies. Our plan establishes a new $250 per child tax credit for \nevery child under the age of 17. We have expanded the number of \nfamilies eligible for tax deductible IRA's. We also provide education \nincentives, the first of which is an income tax deduction of up to \n$2,500 for interest expenses paid on education loans. The second \nincentive is an income tax deduction for qualified education expenses \npaid for the education or training of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's \nspouse, or dependents.\n  We have cut the capital gains tax by 50 percent for individuals, and \nreduced the current maximum rate for corporations to 31 percent. We \nprovide needed economic assistance to small businesses by an estate tax \nexclusion on the first $1 million of value in a family-owned business; \nand by increasing the self-employed health insurance deduction to 50 \npercent. Furthermore, our plan closes 25 billion dollars' worth of \nunjustified tax loopholes.\n  Our plan reforms the Federal Housing Administration's home mortgage \ninsurance program to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and decrease \nlosses to the Federal Government. It also limits rental adjustments \npaid to owners of section 8 housing projects.\n  This budget plan provides for discretionary spending reductions that \ncan actually be achieved. The plan proposes a level of savings which is \nonly $10 billion more than a hard freeze in these programs, ensuring \nadequate funds for a strong defense and for critical investments in \neducation and the environment.\n  Finally, this plan provides for an increase in Federal retirement \ncontributions from both agencies and employees through the year 2002. \nThis plan adopts the judicial and congressional pension reform \nprovisions that were based on a bill I introduced, and that were \nincluded in last year's reconciliation bill.\n  I fully support the Centrist Coalition's 7-year balanced budget plan. \nWhile I may not agree with every provision in it, I have accepted those \nprovisions in the interest of the greater good to come of its passage. \nAfter the disastrous budget standoff of the past year, it is readily \napparent that compromise is the only game in town when it comes to \ngetting real work done in Washington. I am proud of the efforts and \nsacrifices may colleagues have made to put this balanced budget \ntogether.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute and that \nI be able to yield that minute to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am delighted to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \npresenting this particular balanced budget today. I think it is a \nclear, good-faith attempt to make responsible but difficult choices \nthat are going to have a very significant impact on the future of this \ncountry. If we are not willing to make those choices, those difficult \nchoices honestly, the protracted debate and the gridlock that we have \nexperienced is simply going to continue.\n  I commend Senator Chafee, Senator Breaux, and all of those who have \nworked with them in attempting to deal with this extremely difficult \nand challenging matter.\n  I am pleased to be a part of that effort.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in discussing the \nmerits of this bipartisan plan to balance the Federal budget. I believe \nthis plan is an example of what can be accomplished when we put aside \npartisan politics and focus instead on serious questions of public \npolicy.\n  Late last year, in the midst of a prolonged Government shutdown and a \nbreakdown in budget negotiations between the Republican leadership and \nthe Democratic administration, Senators Chafee and Breaux convened a \nbipartisan meeting of Senators who were committed to finding enough \ncommon ground to balance the Federal budget.\n  Finding common ground required Democrats in the group to accept \nlarger entitlement reductions and Republicans in the group to agree to \na smaller tax cut. We had hoped that our coming together on a budget \noutline we could all support would jump-start the stalled negotiations.\n  When it became clear that the Republican leadership and the \nDemocratic administration could not bridge\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\ntheir policy differences, we dedicated ourselves to translating the \nbudget outline we had developed into a full blown legislative plan, and \nthat is what we have presented to our colleagues today.\n  We are not here to suggest that this is the only way to balance the \nbudget. We're here to illustrate that a balanced budget plan can be \ndrafted from the middle of the political spectrum and driven by policy. \nRegardless of the outcome of the balanced budget debate, I think it is \nimportant that we demonstrate to the administration, the congressional \nleadership, and the American people what a bipartisan budget compromise \nwould encompass.\n  One of the biggest differences between this bipartisan plan and \neither the Republican or Democrat plans is that both of their last \noffers reached balance on paper by relying on deep cuts in \ndiscretionary spending--cuts that would require future Congresses to \nmake far tougher choices than any recent Congress has been willing to \nmake. You only have to look at this year's appropriations process to \nrealize that future cuts of the magnitude proposed by the current plans \nare both unwise as a matter of policy and unattainable politically.\n  There's no question that if we make these cuts on the defense side of \nthe ledger, we can't possibly maintain our ability, as the world's sole \nremaining superpower, to protect our own shores, much less help defend \nfreedom, and maintain peace throughout the world.\n  Yet, if these reductions can't be made in defense--far and away the \nbiggest item in discretionary spending--where can we make responsible \nreductions of this magnitude in discretionary spending? In \ntransportation infrastructure? In research and development? In \neducation? In job training? In medical research funding? Do we cut mine \nsafety inspectors, or air traffic controllers or those who ensure the \nsafety of our food and maintain the quality of our air and water?\n  Fortunately, the members of our group have not only chosen a more \nrealistic and achievable discretionary path over the next 7 years, but \nwe have done so to protect these types of important investments, \ninvestments which are critical to raising future productivity, growth, \nand incomes. We are dedicated to the belief that we should not \nsacrifice these investments at the expense of taking on politically \npopular entitlement programs.\n  And protect discretionary spending we must, since entitlements and \ninterest on the national debt are rapidly edging out discretionary \nprograms in the battle for scarce federal dollars. Entitlements and \ninterest on the national debt are projected to account for 70 percent \nof our budget by the year 2002, up from 30 percent in 1963. Most \ndisturbing of all, it is projected that entitlements and interest on \nthe debt will consume the entire Federal revenue base by the year 2012.\n  With such staggering expansions of entitlements on the horizon, \nsignificant entitlement reform has to be at the heart of any serious \nbalanced budget effort. This budget makes meaningful--but fair--\nreductions in entitlements like Medicare, Medicaid and welfare while \nalso seeking to protect our most vulnerable citizens. And it requires \nMedicare beneficiaries who can afford to pay more to make a larger--and \nmore reasonable--contribution to the Medicare Program.\n  For many of us, the most important part of this plan is its downward \nmodification of the consumer price index, which controls cost-of-living \nadjustments for entitlement programs and tax bracket indexing.\n  A report of the Senate Finance Committee indicates that the present \nvalue of the CPI overstates the actual rate of inflation by somewhere \nbetween 0.7 and 2.0 percent. By making a CPI adjustment, we are better \nable to control the future costs of entitlement programs, including \nSocial Security, which has up until now been left off the table by both \nRepublicans and Democrats alike.\n  From a policy perspective, a CPI modification is absolutely the right \nthing to do since it restrains future entitlement costs, thus helping \nto protect the discretionary side of the budget from unwise reductions \nin the future. But it is understandable, given the approaching \npolitical season, that the modification has become a political hot \npotato for both sides, subject to an attack from Republicans as a \nbackdoor tax increase and from Democrats as a Social Security cut.\n  As I look back on the events of the last 6 months and ahead to the \nPresidential campaign, I sense that political considerations are again \ncosting us an important and historic opportunity to begin to address \nour long-term budget problems.\n  And if we are ever to make serious headway on these matters, I am \nmore convinced than ever that the American people don't need to see \nimportant issues of public policy demogogued anymore. They don't need \nto see interest groups fired-up to wage war against responsible change. \nThe American people need to hear and understand the truth about the \nsources and seriousness of our long-term budget problems.\n  Patrick Henry once said, ``for my part, whatever anguish of spirit it \nmay cost, I am willing to know the whole truth--to know the worst and \nprovide for it.''\n  Only by separating the truth from the rhetoric can we balance our \nFederal budget the right way. And the anguish will be a lot less if the \nsacrificed is shared--and if we summon the courage to act now. For if \nwe fail to act--and if we continue down the path of cowards--we will \nguarantee for our children, not the bright future we inherited, but the \ndark responsibilities we refused to accept.\n  I thank my colleagues for the time to speak and the chance to be a \npart of the Centrist Coalition. I hope that this will be the start, not \nthe end, of our efforts to bring bipartisan and common-sense solutions \nto the legislative issues of our day.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to make very brief comments, and I \nwill make them extremely brief because I know my friend from \nConnecticut has been here waiting, with regard to the Chafee-Breaux \nbudget proposal.\n  Mr. President, as I see it, the simple facts are these. This country \nurgently, desperately needs legislative action to ensure the soundness \nof the Medicare funds, to ensure the soundness of a variety of other \ntrust funds. I do not think anyone objects to that. I should say more \nprecisely I do not know that anyone disputes that fact, that we need \nstrong and urgent action to put those on track.\n  Second, I do not think anyone doubts that we have an enormous problem \nwith the deficit. We are not just the world's biggest debtor, but we \nsee a problem that seems very difficult for Congress to solve.\n  Third, I think it is quite clear to everyone involved that we need a \nbipartisan budget. The simple fact is this Congress acted in what I \nthought was a responsible way, in I think a moderate way, in trying to \naddress the budget problems. We passed a budget last year. We passed a \nreconciliation act that had enormous progress for the country in moving \nthese funds into solvency, and it was vetoed by the President. We have \nbeen unable to reach an agreement with the President.\n  Whichever side you take in that controversy, the reality is nothing \ngot done in terms of long-term reconciliation. It is my belief that \nnothing is going to get done unless we have a bipartisan approach. So I \nrise to speak for that budget, not because I like it better than what \nthis Congress did. I do not. I think what this Congress did in \nreconciliation is much better and much more responsible. As a matter of \nfact, I\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\ndo not think it went near far enough. But the only way we are going to \nhave progress in that area, the only way we are going to begin to \naddress these problems with this Congress and this President is to go \nwith a bipartisan budget. It is my belief that will put the President \nin a position where he has to go along with the Congress if we have a \nbudget that has strong bipartisan support.\n  The Chafee-Breaux budget's value is it is real. The numbers are real, \nand the savings are real. Second, it has a very significant long-term \neffect in dealing with the trust funds, perhaps even better than other \nalternatives we have looked at. And third, Mr. President, it is the \nonly game in town. It is the only bipartisan effort that we have on the \ntable. It is the only way we are going to make progress.\n  Is it less than what I would like to see? Absolutely. I do not think \nit goes near far enough in dealing with our problems. It is clear, \nsignificant progress.

Mr. President, last Friday, the majority leader, Senator \nDole, took to the floor and made a rather critical speech of our \npresent policy in Haiti. He introduced at that time a report which was \nprepared by a Republican staff delegation that had gone down to Haiti \nduring the Easter recess. I think the report probably could have been \nwritten a week or two in advance of the trip and the trip might not \nhave even been necessary since there was not any real effort to examine \nthe issues in Haiti and what has happened there over the past 18 months \nor so.\n  This morning I wish to take a few minutes to apprise my colleagues of \nhow I see the present situation in Haiti. Where we have come over the \npast number of months in making real progress there. The good news is, \nof course, that Haiti is not in the headlines on a daily basis but \nthere has been significant progress.\n  I think it is important that my colleagues and others who have heard \nSenator Dole's remarks have an opportunity to hear another point of \nview, and that is what I would like to do this morning.\n  I am no stranger to Haiti. I have visited the country many times over \nthe years. When I was a Peace Corps volunteer 30 years ago, I lived \nvery close to the Haitian border in the Dominican Republic. I visited \nHaiti often in those days and still have many close friends in the \ncountry of Haiti.\n  Most recently, I visited Haiti this past January to make my own \nfirsthand assessment of the political situation. Based upon that visit, \nand the many others that I have made over the years, one thing is \ncrystal clear. President Clinton's decision in September 1994 to \nsupport democracy in Haiti was the right thing to do. Whatever else one \nmight say about United States policy, Haiti is a far, far better place \ntoday than it was 19 months ago.\n  Remember what those days were like. The reign of terror was the order \nof the day. Murder, rape, and kidnaping were daily occurrences in \nHaiti, all in an effort to intimidate the Haitian people. Those days \nare gone now. And, despite the fact that Haiti is a long way, a long \nway from becoming a Jeffersonian democracy, we are not going to rewrite \nalmost 200 years of Haitian history in less than 2 years--I believe \nthat today the Haitian people are one step closer to fulfilling their \naspirations of living in freedom and dignity without fear of their \nGovernment.\n  An important phase of our Haiti policy came to a close just a month \nor so ago. U.S. forces are no longer participants in the United Nations \nmandated mission. In fact, last week the final contingent of United \nStates forces left Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\n  When President Clinton dispatched United States forces to Haiti in \nthe fall of 1994, he set a deadline of February 29, 1996, as the date \nwhen United States military participation in the mandated mission of \nthe United Nations would terminate. He has stood by that situation and \nit has been fulfilled.\n  The goals of the United States policy have been clear from the \noutset, that is, to restore the democratically elected President of \nHaiti to office, to provide a secure and stable environment within \nwhich Democratic elections could be conducted, to protect international \npersonnel and installations, and to facilitate the creation of a \nHaitian national police force.\n  Despite what some might have you believe, we have made tremendous \nstrides toward fulfilling those goals. The duly elected president was \nrestored to office. Municipal, congressional and presidential elections \nwere successfully conducted. A civilian national police force has been \nestablished. The army no longer exists. The dreaded Haitian military \nhas been dissolved.\n  During my January visit to Port-au-Prince, Mr. President, it became \nvery apparent to me that there was a shared consensus across the \nbroadest segment of Haitian society for a continued United Nations \npresence after February 29. President Aristide, then President-elect \nPreval, members of the Haitian Congress, the business community, the \nUnited States Embassy, U.N. officials, virtually everyone with whom I \nmet, expressed the strong view that a follow-on presence by the United \nNations was vital to solidifying the very real gains that have been \nmade in Haiti over the last many months. Fortunately, the United \nNations Security Council concurred with the prevailing wisdom in Haiti \nand extended the U.N. mission for an additional 4 months until June 1 \nof this year. The Canadian Government, not the United States \nGovernment, has assumed the leadership role in the extended, albeit \nsmaller, United Nations mission. I for one have expressed my \nappreciation to Canadian authorities for their willingness to do so.\n  No one is saying that the job is complete in Haiti. Far from it. Much \nremains to be done on the economic front, on the judicial front, on the \nhuman rights front, and on the migration front.\n  Public security, for example, continues to be a major challenge to \nthe current Haitian administration, as it was to its predecessor. In \nthat regard, some critics of Haiti have singled out the performance of \nthe newly formed Haitian national police as an example of how United \nStates policy has failed. That was included in the majority leader's \nremarks last Friday.\n  Mr. President, I could not disagree more. It does a great injustice \nto the real progress that has been made in this area in less than a \nyear's time. Let us remember that until last June a civilian police \nforce did not exist in Haiti. It had to be built from scratch while \ndissolving the army, the dreaded military.\n  In less than 8 months, a force of 5,000 freshly recruited and trained \nHaitians has been deployed throughout the country. Yes, they are green. \nThey have made mistakes. But it is really quite a remarkable feat, when \nyou think of it. Can you imagine establishing something like a 5,000-\nperson force from the ground up, going through all the training, in a \nmajor city in this country overnight?\n  Haiti is not the only place we have endeavored to support the \ncreation of a new professional civilian force to replace corrupt and \nbrutal militarily justice. In Panama and in El Salvador, we joined with \ntheir government leaders to do something similar. In those cases, we \nhad bipartisan support. Unfortunately, bipartisanship seems to be \nabsent in the case of Haiti.\n  Some of the same problems in Haiti did, in fact, existed in these \ncountries as well, Panama and El Salvador, and continue, I point out, \nto confront us to today.\n  Continued international assistance and support at this juncture is \nterribly important for this little country. These are critical to \nensuring the strengthening and permanency of still fragile democratic \ninstitutions in Haiti. I believe the United States must remain engaged \nin Haiti.\n  U.S. humanitarian and democracy-building programs will continue to be \nimportant to future progress in a wide array of areas: the national \npolice, the judicial and legislative branches, economic reforms, human \nrights and migration. If we do not remain engaged, I predict the \nprevious problems that confronted both the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations with respect to Haiti will\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\nbe right back in the laps of some future administration, and much more \nso.\n  Last Friday, in the course of his remarks, Senator Dole stated it \nwould be wrong to make Haiti a political football. Mr. President, I \ncould not agree more. In that regard, the endless congressional holds \nthat have been placed on purely humanitarian assistance--we have had \nholds, now, in some cases that have been in place since late last year, \non proposed humanitarian assistance to Haiti. These holds in my view \nthreaten to make Haiti the political football that the Majority leader \nhas warned about. These United States assistance programs for \nvaccinations, for AIDS prevention, for textbooks, for primary schools, \nare targeted at the weakest and most vulnerable sectors of Haitian \nsociety. It is deplorable that we have held up these funds that were \nvoted and appropriated by this Congress.\n  In my view, the administration has more than adequately addressed the \nquestions about specifics of most of these programs--in briefings of \ncongressional staff and written responses to questions submitted from \nthe Congress. If the Republican majority mean what they say about not \nmaking Haiti a political football, then the time has come for these \ncongressional holds to be lifted so the continuity of these programs \ncan be maintained.\n  Again, I do not mean to suggest that all of the questions and \nconcerns raised about the implementation of certain U.N. and U.S.--\nsponsored programs have not been without merit. There is merit to those \nquestions. But let us remember that when the President and the \ninternational community decided to restore democracy to Haiti, they \nwere navigating in unchartered waters. After all, this was the very \nfirst time in our history that international action would be utilized \nin an effort to restore a democratically elected government to power \nfollowing a military coup.\n  United States officials, United Nations officials, and most \nespecially Haitian officials had to learn on the job. So, not \nsurprisingly, mistakes were made. But I would also say that \nadministration, United Nations and Haitian officials have bent over \nbackwards to answer questions and to make adjustments in programs as \nnecessary.\n  Despite those efforts, criticism continues and the holds persist. As \nI mentioned earlier, these Republican holds placed on United States aid \nprograms are jeopardizing some terribly important programs. One wonders \nif these aid programs have been put on hold, not so much because \nanswers are wanted, but in the hope that policy successes that have \noccurred to date will be undermined. If so, this is very cynical and \nshortsighted and most certainly contrary to United States interests.\n\n  While I acknowledge that some criticism about events in Haiti have \nhad merit, others have been far off the mark. For example, some have \ncharged that last year's Haitian elections have produced a one-party \nstate in Port-au-Prince. Nothing could be further from the truth. I can \ntell you from my meetings with leaders of the Haitian Parliament that \nthey are no rubber stamp for an executive branch. In fact, during my \nvisit in January, the Haitian Senate overwhelmingly rejected President \nAristide's controversial nominee to head the national police force. \nPresident Preval subsequently nominated, and the Haitian Senate \nconfirmed, a very able individual to head the police force in the \ncountry. All that to say the political process is working.\n  Turning to another area of concern, the possibility of politically \nmotivated killings. There has been a great deal of misinformation, I \nwould say, Mr. President, about these so-called politically motivated \nmurders. The number is much smaller than the 20 to 25 that some have \nalleged. As to the lack of Haitian cooperation, it is my sense that the \nFBI did not make a lot of friends in the manner in which it first went \nabout conducting its initial investigations in Port-au-Prince. I was \namazed to find out the FBI never bothered to meet with the members of \nthe U.N./OAS civilian mission, the mission that had been monitoring \ncases since 1993. This is particularly troubling, I would say, since \nrepresentatives from the civilian mission would have been of enormous \nassistance to the FBI's investigation. You will recall that most often \nthey were the first ones at the crime scene to gather evidence and \ninterview onlookers.\n  Nor, apparently, did the FBI seek advice from the U.S. Embassy or \nutilize its expertise and local contacts. Do not misunderstand what I \nam saying. I am not condoning these or other acts of violence in Haiti. \nOne politically motivated killing is one too many. But I did not notice \nquite the same level of outrage in some quarters when the military \ndictatorship of Haiti was killing hundreds--hundreds--of Haitians, many \nthem prominent political figures, in plain view of international \njournalists and cameras. Certainly, Haitian authorities need to \nconfront the problems of impunity head on and to put together a \ncredible investigation of the various suspicious murders and bring the \nmatter to closure, but this should not become an excuse for walking \naway from Haiti or putting every other initiative in the deep freeze.\n  There has been a great deal of focus on the police and the security \nsituation in Haiti, and rightfully so. These are important areas of \nconcern, but they are not the only ones that will determine Haiti's \nfuture. Haiti, like many developing countries, suffers from serious \nbrain drain, with many of its most talented citizens leaving the \ncountry. We need to try to redouble our efforts to help them find \ncapable people to fill upper and middle management positions throughout \nthe government, particularly with respect to the police force. Haitians \nliving abroad need to take some responsibility for their country's \nfuture as well.\n  The economy is also pivotal to Haiti's future. In fact, what happens \nwith respect to the Haitian economy is perhaps more important than any \nother single issue we could mention. Economic growth and investment \ncreate jobs. Jobs mean hope and opportunity for the Haitian people. \nThat is what gives people a stake in their country and their \ngovernment. The economic policies that the Preval administration \ndecides to implement will determine whether the Haitian economy will \nrebound and grow or simply stagnate.\n  Privatization of certain key State-owned enterprises--power, \ntelecommunications, flour and cement--can play an important role in \ncreating a favorable economic climate in Haiti as well, and should \nserve, I would add, to attract badly needed foreign investment in \ncritical sectors.\n  Last month, the Committee on Foreign Relations had the honor of \nhosting a working coffee for the recently inaugurated President of \nHaiti, His Excellency Rene Preval. We had a very useful and, I think, \ncandid discussion about issues of mutual concern to our two countries. \nIt was a very helpful session. Surprisingly, many of those who have \nbeen the harshest critics of Haiti did not bother to attend this \nmeeting or to give President Preval an opportunity to address some of \nthe concerns that they have raised. I wonder why?\n  Among other things, they would have heard President Preval----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator his 15 minutes \nhas expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Among other things, they would have learned from President \nPreval about his commitment to helping keep Haiti on its course toward \ndemocracy and about the high priority he accords to implementing \nsignificant economic reforms.\n  President Clinton has fashioned our policy toward Haiti as he has \nbecause he wants to give the Haitian people a chance, a chance to live \nwithout intimidation and fear, a chance to make choices and decisions \nabout their own destiny. Our policy is making that possible, perhaps \nfor the first time in Haitian history.\n  As I said earlier, I could not agree more with our distinguished \nmajority leader that Haiti should not become a political football. \nSadly, for most of that country's history, it has been somebody's \npolitical football. The people of Haiti deserve a lot better.\n  Mr. President, President Preval seems determined to do whatever he \ncan to ensure the people of Haiti have a brighter future, but he alone \ncannot make that happen.\n  He needs and deserves the support of the United States in that \nendeavor, and I hope that he will receive it.\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\n\n\n                        MENTAL HEALTH AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am extremely gratified that the Senate \nhas unanimously approved the Health Insurance Reform Act, S. 1028, with \nthe inclusion of Senator Domenici's amendment relating to mental health \ncoverage. Specifically, this amendment prevents insurers from imposing \nlimits on benefits for mental illness that are not imposed on benefits \nfor physical illness. This bill requires insurers to treat consumers \nfairly. It guarantees that insurers do not drop people's coverage when \nthey change jobs or for pre-existing health conditions. It also \nprevents insurers from imposing arbitrary coverage limits on persons \nwho need services for mental illness.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of nondiscriminatory coverage for \npersons suffering mental illness. In the last Congress, I sponsored, \nwith Senators Dole and Simon, a resolution, Senate Concurrent \nResolution 16, that called on Congress to ensure that persons with \nmental illness receive equitable coverage with that afforded for \nphysical illness. Our resolution received strong bipartisan support, \nand the Senate has included nondiscriminatory coverage for mental \nillness in S. 1028.\n  Americans with mental illness deserve to have equitable access to \nhealth coverage. Because these Americans often cannot find adequate \ncoverage under private coverage, they are frequently forced to resort \nto coverage in public programs. Without jobs and coverage, many are not \nadequately treated. This legislation will permit many mentally ill \npersons to have the coverage they need to hold down jobs and to lead \nproductive and fulfilling lives.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that mental illness can strike at any \ntime, to anyone. Many of us know someone who has suffered mental \nillness. This amendment will provide nondiscriminatory coverage for a \nrange of mentally ill disorders, including schizophrenia, manic \ndepressive disorder, or panic disorder.\n  I believe that this amendment will make for a more productive and \nefficient work force. American businesses lose more than $100 billion \nper year due to lost productivity of employees because of substance \nabuse and mental illness. We can reduce this drain on employers by \npermitting employees access to nondiscriminatory mental illness \ncoverage.\n  I strongly support S. 1028 with inclusion of nondiscriminatory \ncoverage for persons with mental illness. Inclusion of this provision \nis not only the right and compassionate thing to do, but it will also \nreduce overall mental health spending and make our health system more \naccessible for persons with mental illness. I urge my fellow Senators \nto support this provision in conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4112-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4114-S4115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CENTRIST COALITION BUDGET PLAN\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senators Chafee \nand Breaux and the rest of the Centrist Coalition in announcing this \nbipartisan proposal for a balanced budget. This is a comprehensive plan \nthat confronts our budget problems head on. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to take a serious look at it.\n  I am particularly pleased that our plan partially corrects the \ninaccuracy of the Consumer Price Index [CPI]. What we propose is to \nreduce the CPI by one-half of a percentage point in 1997 and 1998--and \nby three-tenths of a percentage point thereafter--for purposes of \ncomputing cost of living adjustments [COLA's] and for indexing the Tax \nCode.\n  While the AARP and other seniors groups will shriek and wail to the \nhigh heavens about this being some backdoor effort to cut Social \nSecurity benefits, that is not what is driving this issue. What we are \nstriving to do is to have a more accurate CPI that reflects the true \nlevel of inflation.\n  Last year, the Senate Finance Committee heard compelling testimony \nfrom Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and others \nwho believe the CPI may be off the mark by as much as two percentage \npoints. A commission appointed by the Finance Committee issued an \ninterim report which estimates the CPI to be overstated in the range of \n0.7 to 2.0 percentage points.\n  The Coalition has selected the figure of 0.5 percentage points--which \nis a conservative estimate of how much the CPI is overstated--precisely \nbecause we want to avoid any perception that we are being unfair or \nunduly harsh. This modest step achieves $110 billion in savings over 7 \nyears. This is not a popular proposal, but it is understood by us as a \ncritically important component of our plan.\n  Before I discuss other elements of our plan, let me join my \ncolleagues in underscoring the importance of our product being received \nas a total package. Any balanced budget plan will have elements that we \ndo not like. But we will all have to accept some of the undesirable in \norder not to lose all that is so necessary.\n  Accordingly, this bipartisan budget plan also includes some very \nappropriate first steps toward slowing the growth of Medicare spending. \nThese reforms would achieve $154 billion in savings over 7 years. From \na long-term perspective, the most important reform is a provision that \nwould conform the Medicare eligibility age with the Social Security \nretirement age. By gradually increasing the eligibility age to 67, this \nplan acknowledges that life expectancies are certainly higher now than \nwhen Medicare was first enacted in 1965.\n  We also impose an affluence test on Medicare Part B premiums, \nbeginning with individual seniors who have annual incomes exceeding \n$50,000 and couples who have incomes exceeding $75,000. I personally \nbelieve we should begin this affluence test at much lower \nincome thresholds, but I realize that we simply do not have the votes \nto do that at this time.\n\n  The Coalition plan also limits the future growth of Medicaid \nspending, saving $62 billion over 7 years. While our plan does not give \nthe States as much flexibility as I would like to give them, I am \nwilling to swallow these Medicaid reforms in the context of this \ncomprehensive budget package, even though I might not be able to \nsupport them if they were to be considered separately in isolation from \nthe broader package. I am absolutely convinced that the positive \naspects of the total package are so critically important that they \noverwhelmingly outweigh certain concerns I have about the Medicaid \nprovisions.\n  On another front, our plan also calls for meaningful welfare reforms, \nincluding tough work requirements for welfare recipients and a 5-year \ntime limit on cash assistance. At the same time, we include additional \nfunds for child care assistance--thereby recognizing the importance of \nchild care in helping recipients make the transition from welfare to \nself-sufficiency. Overall, these welfare reforms achieve another $45 \nbillion in savings.\n  In the area of taxes, many of us had to bite the bullet--and hard--on \nspecific issues in order to reach consensus on the broad package. What \nwe have here is a tax package that provides $130 billion in tax cuts. \nOn the child tax credits, I have a personal concern about just giving \naway $250 for every child under the age of 17. But in the spirit of \ncooperation and consensus, we were able to address some of my \nobjections by offering a real savings incentive if parents contribute \n$500 toward an individual retirement account established in the child's \nname.\n  The tax package has something for everyone to like--and to dislike. I \nurge my colleagues to look at this package in its entirety. If we start \npicking it apart, the package will fail and the Coalition that worked \nso hard to bring this all together will collapse. This plan brings us \nto the goal we have all been working so hard to achieve--a balanced \nbudget and tax cut package that ends deficit spending by the year 2002.\n  Again, I urge all of my colleagues to consider this plan. Those who \nautomatically reject the notion of a bipartisan budget will have no \ntrouble finding one or two reasons to oppose it. But I am convinced \nthat anyone who approaches this plan with an open mind--and a \nrecognition that bipartisanship always requires some degree of \ncompromise--will conclude that this is an impressive plan. It does not \nrely on gimmickry or smoke and mirrors. Instead, it makes the tough, \npolitically unpopular decisions that Republicans and Democrats alike \nhave been putting off for too long. It deserves our earnest support.\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

The Chair, therefore, recognized the Senator from Nevada.\n  Further, it is the understanding of this Chair that there is no rule \nin the U.S. Senate that provides for alternating back and forth.

Mr. President, tomorrow, April 26, is the 10th anniversary \nof the most dramatic ecological disaster of the 20th century--the \nexplosion of reactor No. 4 at the V.I. Lenin Atomic Power Plant in \nChernobyl, Ukraine.\n  On that day, 10 years ago tomorrow, a combination of poor design, \nhuman error--or, more accurately, human negligence and incompetence--\nled to a massive explosion within the core of reactor No. 4--an \nexplosion that blew off the 2,000-ton reactor chamber roof, spewing \nmassive amounts of radiation into the surrounding area and the Earth's \natmosphere in a radioactive cloud that eventually reached as far away \nas California.\n  It was not until several years after the disaster occurred that the \ntruth about Chernobyl, the crown jewel of the Soviet nuclear power \nindustry, began to emerge--that following the explosion, reactor No. 4 \nexperienced what has long been considered the worst-case scenario in \nnuclear power--a full reactor meltdown. The core material burned, \nexposed to the atmosphere, for nearly 10 days, and resulting in a total \nmeltdown.\n  Our colleague, Senator Kennedy, summed it up shortly after the \ndisaster, when he said ``The ultimate lesson of Chernobyl is that human \nand technological error can cause disaster anytime, anywhere.'' That \nhas particular residence for us in Nevada.\n  The ecological and economic consequences of Chernobyl were massive, \nimmediate, and will last for tens of thousands of years.\n  Thirty-one people died as an immediate result of the explosion, 200 \nwere hospitalized, and 135,000 were evacuated from 71 nearby towns and \nvillages. High doses of radiation spread over at least 10,000 square \nmiles, affecting 5 million people in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. The \nexplosion spread more than 200 times the radiation released by the \nHiroshima and Nagasaki blasts combined. Anywhere from 32,000 to 150,000 \npeople could eventually die as a result of the blast. Millions of \npeople have had their lives permanently disrupted by the accident. \nBelarus and Ukraine now report a broad rise in respiratory illness, \nheart disease, and birth defects. Scientists are still waiting to see \nwhat the role may be of the radiation exposure in leading to the many \ncancers that take longer than 10 years to develop, but expect it to be \nsignificant.\n  The children of Belarus have been particularly hard hit. Seventy \npercent of the Chernobyl fallout landed in Belarus--a nation that \nitself has no nuclear reactors. Huge tracts of land in Belarus were \ncontaminated with radioactive cesium, strontium, and plutonium. Prior \nto 1986, Belarus's thyroid cancer rate for children under 14 was \ntypical--2 cases in a nation of about 10 million. By 1992, the rate was \nup to 66, and by 1994, the rate had increased to 82--an increase that \ncan only be explained by the Chernobyl fallout.\n  One quarter of the land of Belarus, home to one-fifth of the nation's \npopulation, has been severely contaminated by the Chernobyl explosion.\n  The power plant complex is surrounded by an 18-mile radius exclusion \nzone--an area of very high contamination that is off-limits to for \nresidence and entry without a special permit.\n  Lying outside of the exclusion zone is a much larger area with \nlesser, but still very high, contamination. Despite official government \npronouncements that this area is unsafe, it is still home to 237,000 \nresidents of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, who simply cannot afford to \nlive anywhere else.\n  The remains of reactor No. 4, still highly radioactive, are contained \nin a hastily erected sarcophagus--a highly unstable structure, \nconsidered by many the most dangerous building on earth. As concerns \nregarding the possibility of collapse of the sarcophagus or the reactor \nentombed inside increase, it is unclear if the technological or \nfinancial challenges of stabilizing and cleaning up reactor No. 4 can \never be met.\n  Mr. President, If Chernobyl has taught us anything, it is that when \ndealing with such high-risk matters as nuclear power, or nuclear waste, \nsmall mistakes can have enormous consequences.\n  Next week, the Senate may turn to a bill aptly dubbed the ``Mobile \nChernobyl Bill''--S. 1271, the Craig nuclear waste bill.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, this establishes, on an \naccelerated schedule, a so-called interim high-level nuclear waste dump \nin Nevada.\n  I want to be clear on what this interim storage program means. Tens \nof thousands of tons of high-level nuclear waste will be removed from \nreactors, loaded on over 16,000 trains and trucks, and shipped cross \ncountry to Nevada, a State with no nuclear power. The\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\nwaste will travel through 43 States on transportation routes that bring \nthe waste within one mile of over 50 million people.\n  Mr. President, I know the nuclear power industry is lobbying hard for \nthis bill. I know there is a lot of pressure on Senators to support \nthis legislation. I also know that the nuclear power industry has \nspread a massive amount of disinformation about the bill.\n  By any objective evaluation, this legislation is completely \nunnecessary. In fact, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, a \nFederal agency created by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and comprised \nof the Nation's most respected scientists, said just 1 month ago that \nthere is simply no need for an interim storage facility at this time.\n  This is not the first time the industry has cried wolf. In 1980, a \nsupporter of the industry asserted:\n\n       We are running out of reactor space at reactors for the \n     storage of the fuel, and if we do not build what we call \n     away-from-reactor storage, another type of interim storage, \n     and begin soon, we could begin shutting down civilian nuclear \n     reactors in this country as soon as 1983.\n\n  Of course, Mr. President, no U.S. reactors have closed due to lack of \nstorage. Thirteen years have passed since the prediction that in 1983 \nthere would result the closure of reactors.\n  Despite the crisis mentality created by the nuclear power industry, \nthere is no nuclear reactor in America that will be forced to close \ndown due to lack of storage. Every nuclear utility, if it so chooses, \ncan take advantage of existing, NRC licensed, off the shelf dry cast \nstorage systems to meet its spent fuel storage needs. Should the mobile \nChernobyl bill come to the floor next week, I will have a lot more to \nsay about the lack of any compelling need for this legislation.\n  There are, however, plenty of other reasons to oppose this bill. The \nbill preempts nearly every local, State, or Federal environmental \nprotection. It creates a taxpayer liability of billions of dollars to \nsolve the private industry's waste problem. It eliminates EPA authority \nto protect the health and public safety.\n  Mr. President, I do not know when the Senate may consider this bill. \nIt is my hope that it never comes up. Nevertheless, I urge my \ncolleagues to fully consider the many legitimate public health safety \nconsequences raised by this legislation, particularly as they relate to \ntheir own constituents, and to oppose the mobile Chernobyl bill. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized to speak in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, this is the first of two amendments that \nare in order this morning that will make the very modest and very \ntemporary reduction in legal immigration to the United States. This \nfirst amendment deals with family immigration. The other amendment \nconcerns employment-based immigration.\n  Under these amendments, legal immigration to the United States will, \nfor 5 years, be held at a level of 10 percent below the current total \nof regular nonrefugee admissions. This does not have anything to do \nwith refugees or asylees. Under the amendment I am proposing there will \nbe immediate family numbers of 480,000--27,000 for diversity visas \nunder a previous proposal we passed in 1990, with a reduction from the \noriginal 55,000 the House has accepted this figure of 27,000. Mr. \nPresident, 100,000 on employment-based visas. That is a total of \n607,000 per year. That is the total of regular nonrefugee admissions \nunder the amendment. Under current law it is 675,000. So, 607,000 under \nthe amendment, a reduction of 68,000, a reduction of 10.1 percent.\n  The first amendment will also, during the 5-year breathing space, \nestablish what is really a true-priority system for family immigration \ncategories, giving visas first to the closest family members. I cannot \ntell you how many times I have heard in the last months, ``We should \nfirst take care of the family.'' That is exactly what this amendment \ndoes, giving visas first to the closest family members who are the most \nlikely to live in the same household with a U.S. relative who petitions \nfor them. Only if there are visas unused by these closest family \nmembers will the visas then go down or fall down to the next lower \nlevel priority family category and so on.\n  Under this amendment, all 480,000 family visas will be available \nfirst to the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. I think everyone \nwould want that. That is a spouse and minor children, the so-called \nnuclear family, plus parents. After this highest category and priority \nis established, the remaining visas will be available to the second-\npriority category.\n  Unlike current law, there will be no guaranteed minimum number for \nthe lower priority category. That is what we established in 1990 with \nthe so-called pierceable cap, that we had to do a certain amount for \nthose in those categories.\n  According to the INS estimates, immediate relatives--and we do think \nwe can rely on the INS estimates, but after yesterday it makes one \nwonder a bit if we can believe them in totality--but they are telling \nus that immediate relatives will range from 329,000 to 473,000 in the \nnext 7 years with an average of about 384,000.\n\n  Under my proposal, if immediate relatives are admitted at that level \nin a particular year, there will be about 100,000 visa numbers \navailable for the other family category. We are not shutting them out. \nThe visas available after admission of immediate relatives of U.S. \ncitizens will flow down to the second priority--that is the nuclear \nfamily of lawful permanent residents. In other words, going to their \nspouses and minor children.\n  We have 1.1 million people in America who are here under our laws and \ntotally legal who are unable to bring to this country their spouses and \nminor children, while we continue to give visas to adult brothers and \nsisters. I hope that people will understand what we do here while we \ntalk about spouses and family and the categories of family values and \nall those things. So they\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\nwill go to lawful permanent residents--in other words, as I say, \nspouses and minor children. Any visas that are not needed in that \ncategory will flow down to the third priority, which is then the \nunmarried adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, then to the fourth \npriority, this is married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, then to \nthe fifth priority, unmarried adult sons and daughters of permanent \nresidents, and finally to the sixth and last priority, brothers and \nsisters of citizens.\n  Now, you have just heard something which sounds like Egyptian. \nActually, it is English, but much in the INA, the Immigration and \nNationality Act, is not in English. It is a most difficult system to \nunderstand for the layman because it then gets into situations where \npeople can play upon it and use emotion, fear, guilt, and racism. They \nhave done it magnificently in this instance--magnificently.\n  So, here we have a situation where the only ones that really strive \nin the present language of preference systems and the confusion in the \nINA are actually the immigration lawyers of America. They are very \nadept, I can promise you that and they have been very adept here, very, \nvery adept.\n  Under my proposal, family admissions will continue to be 480,000 per \nyear. That is the current level. No reduction. That is over the next 5 \nyears. Remember, after the next 5 years, it spikes right back up. We \nare not doing anything 5 years out. Back to business.\n  So the INS estimates that family admissions under the committee bill \nfor fiscal years 1997 through 2001 are 723,000, 689,000, 643,000, \n620,000, 579,000, an average of 651,000, which is a substantial \nincrease over the current level.\n  I want to be very clear about these numbers. Immigration will not be \nreduced under the committee bill. If anyone in this country or this \nChamber is interested in reducing legal immigration, which 70 percent \nof the American people say they favor, it will not be under the \ncommittee bill that is at the desk.\n  Let us be absolutely clear of another thing. I am not here to \nrecombine anything. I have not combined or recombined anything. I am \nnot here to join or link. I am here to do a single amendment, which was \nthe work product of the Barbara Jordan commission. That is my mission--\nto see that the American people deal with an issue that has been dealt \nwith now for 20 years, which was the Select Commission on Immigration \nand Refugee Policy, and the Jordan Commission. And to completely ignore \nthe work of that remarkable woman is something that I was not going to \nsee happen. So there will be two amendments by the Senator from \nWyoming--one on legal immigration and a very short one on employer-\nbased immigration--and that is it.\n  So whatever has been expressed to the colleagues about this \n``sinister'' effort of recombining--I have never understood the meaning \nof it, actually. It has always been together. We have dealt with it \ntogether in all the 18 years I have been dealing with it. Sometimes we \nwould divide it for certain purposes. Sometimes we would not divide it. \nBut always, it was very clear.\n  So under the committee bill there is no reduction on legal \nimmigration. It will increase under the Kennedy-Abraham amendment, \nwhich the committee agreed to by a rollcall vote. Immigration will \nincrease at a very slightly lesser rate than under current law. I hope \nyou can hear that. It will increase at a very slightly lesser rate than \nunder current law. But it will increase substantially. There will be no \nreduction for at least the next 10 years.\n  Now, blend into that what happened with the figures that were given \nto us by the INS. We are now confronted with news reports and \ninformation that we have a 41-percent increase. Here is the morning \nline--and not at the track, but the Washington AP. ``New projections \nanticipating a whopping 41 percent increase in legal immigration to the \nUnited States this year are bound to heat up debate as the Senate \nconsiders its immigration bill.''\n\n  I think it will heat up the debate because you are going to have to \ngo home and tell people that you sat by and watched legal immigration \ngo up 41 percent. The Immigration and Naturalization Service's \nprojections of a boom this year follow a 10.4-percent decline in lawful \nimmigration last year. My good colleague from Texas--and how I admire \nLamar Smith and his ranking member, too--said, ``We have all been \nduped. I take this as an intentional misrepresentation to the public, \nand, to Congress. It is inexcusable.''\n  The interesting thing about that is it came about the day we were \ndebating this bill in the Senate with regard to the committee action. \nAt that time at the press conference, which in essence was very clear, \nit was said simply that you do not need to do anything about legal \nimmigration because we are doing it already. You can count on us. We \nknow you are interested in it. The President is interested in it. The \nPresident is interested in the Barbara Jordan commission report. And I \nhope you can understand that, too.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Anyone, at the end of this debate, who \nsays that somehow this is going to be the destruction of the Republican \nParty must find new work somewhere. This is not about the destruction \nof the Republican Party. You are going to see votes today that will \nmake you scratch your head until you have less hair than I have. You \nwill say, ``I never dreamed that I would be voting on that issue with \nthat person.'' So join the fun. You will find it to be so.\n  Here we are trying to do something with illegal immigration. Let me \ntell you, we are going to do something with illegal immigration. I \nmean, we are really going to do something with illegal immigration. We \nwill have these two amendments, and we will not be splitting or \nblending or pureeing anything--nothing. But we will be dealing with \nsomething that is not the concoction of the Senator from Wyoming but is \nthe work product of the Jordan Commission on Immigration Reform, \nconsisting of a remarkable group of Democrats and Republicans.\n  So there we are with some figures which certainly concern all of us, \nwho are trying to use honest numbers as we deal with a very complex \nissue. I think that does taint the previous debate.\n  But during the 5-year breathing space created by my amendment, visa \napplications will not be accepted for any priority category if fewer \nthan 10,000 visas were provided for that category in the prior year. \nThat provision is intended to avoid any further build-up in the \nbacklog.\n  There are more than 3.7 million persons on the family waiting list \ntoday, and 1.7 million are in the brother and sister category alone. \nNow, those long waiting lists, those backlogs, in some cases, arrive \nand result in a wait of over 20 years for a visa. It is believed by \nsome experts to encourage illegal immigration. Why would it not? \nBecause a person on the waiting list that is told they are going to \nhave to wait 12, 14, 16 years is going to come here illegally. They are \nnot going to wait because somebody has petitioned for them. That person \nis here, and they are going to say, ``Why should I wait? I am going to \ngo and join them because I love them and I want to be with them.'' Does \nanybody believe that is not happening? So they live illegally in the \nUnited States while waiting for their name to come up.\n  In the second amendment--I will address that briefly, and I have a \nbrief chart, and then we can get on with the debate--the employment-\nbased visa limit will be reduced to 100,000, which is still well above \nthe number of visas now being actually used for employment-based \nimmigration. The employment visas will continue to be allocated under \nthe preference system in current law.\n  We will look, also, at the issue of unskilled numbers, which we took \ncare of in the committee bill, on legal immigration, which is not \nbefore you today, but is at the desk, and which is not to be \nincorporated into it by an amendment by me or anyone else. There are a \nlot of things in that legal immigration bill. When we are through with \nthis caper here, whether it goes or does not go, we might deal with \nthat, since that passed the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 13 to 4. I \nwould think that might well be addressed by us at some future time, \nwith appropriate unanimous-consent agreements, or whatever may be, so \nthere would not be too much chicanery involved.\n  The committee bill reduced diversity visas from 55,000 to 27,000. My \namendment retains the committee provision of the 27,000 diversity \nvisas. At the end of 5 years, under these amendments,\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\nthe temporary reduction will end and terminate, and the immigration \nnumbers and the priority system will automatically return to current \nlaw.\n  You say, ``Well, what is the purpose of that? You are going to lower \nit 10.1 percent for 5 years, and at the end of 5 years, it is going to \ngo right back where it was--same heavy numbers.'' That is right. That \nwill give the Congress an opportunity to look at where we are going, \nbecause, obviously, people are not paying attention to where we are \ngoing, and we watch these continual frustrations arise and finally come \nto a volcanic ferocity like proposition 187.\n  If anybody believes that you do not deal with this issue and pretend \nthat there will not be more of those in every State in the United \nStates, we are all somewhat remiss.\n  If the Congress does not pass a bill that includes a reduction in \nimmigration, then our refusal to address the very real and very \nreasonable concerns of our constituents will contribute even more to \nthe general cynicism about Congress and our detachment to what the \npeople who elected us think.\n  Mr. President, this is not merely a problem of how Congress is \nperceived, of our reputation, because, if we ignore what the people \nthink and feel, we are not likely to legislate in ways that have a \nfavorable real-world, commonsense impact on the people's lives.\n  It is very interesting. As I look at the material circulated by those \nwho do not concur with my view, there are, remarkably, only two or \nthree things outlined in there. The one that is most interesting is \nthat it will shut out nearly 2 million relatives of U.S. citizens--\nrelatives of voters. Get the word underlined ``voters.'' Let me tell \nyou, ladies and gentleman, there are a lot more voters out there who \nwant to do something with illegal immigration than voters who want to \nprotect a certain group in society. If you are missing what voters do \nhere, do not miss that one. I can promise you that is the way that is.\n  So I do not see any other way to be sure we are reforming immigration \npolicy in a way that will actually make the American people better off \nas they themselves judge to be better off than to try to find out the \nextent to which they actually like and embrace what is happening.\n  As I noted earlier, I proposed a very modest reduction--only 10 \npercent for the next 5 years. But this would be in sharp contrast to \nthe substantial increase that would otherwise occur during this period \nunder either the committee bill or current law.\n  This first amendment will provide a true preference in the granting \nof visas to those family members most likely to live with their \nrelatives in the United States. That is what people say they want. We \nwant the nuclear family. We want the numbers to go to the nuclear \nfamily. It will do that. It will assure that that occurs. It will \nreduce the availability of visas for relatives who are likely to have \ntheir own separate households. That is the source of so much of the \nphenomenon of chain migration.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by showing you, since we seem to be so \nenamored of charts--especially charts which I think have some devious \nvalue that I have noticed in the past months--but since we like charts, \nthen you are going to be fascinated with this one.\n\n  Here is what is happening in our country with regard to legal \nimmigration. I am not talking about illegal immigration. This is a \nhypothetical illustration of chain migration which I have been speaking \nabout now for about a year. This is what the Jordan Commission was \nspeaking about for much longer than that--chain migration through the \nfamily preference system for two generations of parents and their \nchildren. Here the process begins when the immigrant arrives. The \nimmigrant arrives with a spouse and a child. All of them become \ncitizens after 5 years--father, mother, child. These people are \nimmediate relatives, and they come without ``number.'' Under my \nlegislation, there would be a cap at 480,000, which has never been \nachieved as yet.\n  So then this person, the father, has brothers who wish to come, one \nof whom is married. They then immigrate as siblings of a citizen. This \nperson has siblings who are married. She also has a widowed mother. \nThey petition to come to the United States when she becomes a citizen. \nSo when a spouse becomes a citizen, he petitions for his siblings who \nare married who wish to come.\n  From this branch we go here to a spouse petitioning for her parents. \nNow go back to the man, the husband. His mother immigrates after she \nbecomes a widow.\n  Go then to this spouse. Her parents immigrate as immediate relatives \nof a U.S. citizen. That is very valid. She has married siblings who \nwish to immigrate. They immigrate as adult children of U.S. citizens \nafter the parents naturalize.\n  Go on up from that. Their spouses have siblings who wish to come, \nsome of whom are married.\n  This is all under the current preference system--two generations. \nThey ultimately petition to immigrate as siblings of citizens. When \nsome of these immigrants naturalize, they petition for their parents.\n  But here is the one you want to watch if you are talking about family \nand bloodlines, this kind of thing that has a good ring. Right here, I \nam going to circle the people who have no blood relationship with the \noriginal petitioner--none, no blood relationship. They are not uncles, \naunts, nieces, nephews, married brothers, sisters, unmarried. This \nperson is not is not related by blood. This person is not related by \nblood. This person is not related. This person, nor this person is \nrelated by blood to this petitioner. This person is not related by \nblood. This one, this one, this one--all of them not related by blood \nto the petitioner. These two persons are not related by blood to the \npetitioner. We hear this about the immediate family, family, brothers, \nsisters, on and on.\n\n  This one is not related by blood. This one, nor this one not related \nby blood. These two are. This one is. These here --this person is not \nrelated by blood. This one, this one, nor this one. None of these are \nrelated by blood. Not one of these are related by blood. Not one, not a \nsingle one, and down here two are not related by blood. These two are.\n  You are wondering what is happening? If that is not as graphic as I \ncan give it to you, I do not know how it can be presented any more \nclearly.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. You are going to hear the story about joining the \nfamily, keeping the family together, and all of this. I think it is \nimportant to see what happens with the phenomenon of chain migration.\n  Yes, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. SIMON. How long does it take this to take place?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. It is clear here--two generations; about 45 years; two \ngenerations. This is it. That is happening now.\n  But you ought to remember what we did. We did legalization. The \nSenator from Illinois was part of that. I always appreciated his \nremarkable interest in that. We then ``legalized'' people who were here \nillegally living in a subculture of America. That was in 1986. Then \nthere was a temporary period. Those people have now begun a full range \nof petitioning. They are U.S. citizens. They are filing, and they are \nfiling under the present system. They are big numbers down the road. \nBut we also have big numbers on the road right now, according to the \nINS, where they short-informed us, or short-sheeted us by 100,000 to \n150,000 in number this year.\n  So when I get up--and I have a tendency to rant lightly from time to \ntime. But when I say what we are trying to do is eliminate the issue of \npersons bringing in 30, 40, 50, 60, the all-time record was 83 persons \non a single petition, that is what we are trying to do.\n  So, if we are going to continue to talk about family and treating \nthose fairly who are here and those who play by the rules--I understand \nthat and all of those things--then this is where we are. Even the most \nardent proimmigration advocates cannot with credibility oppose \nlegislation to control illegal immigration. That will not happen. But \nthis, at least for me, is a presentation of where we are in this \ncountry, and we will just see where the amendment goes.\n  If it is gone, it is gone. But I do not intend to come this far in \nthe immigration debate in the United States and\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\nnot deal with something that the Jordan Commission report felt was very \nmuch a concern. Others have different views. But if you are talking \nabout reducing immigration, you cannot just talk about illegal \nimmigration.\n  The reason I am talking about it here so I will not hear about \ncombining and pureeing and splitting again is--and you must hear this--\nhalf of the people in the United States who are illegal came here \nlegally. Over half of the people in the United States who are here \nillegally came legally. So how in God's name do you pretend that you \ncan separate the issue? You cannot separate the issue. They came here \non tourist visas and they came here on student visas or they came here \non any kind of legal visa. They went out of status. They went into the \ncommunities. They went with their relatives, and they are here.\n  That is the way it works. The length of time--and I will throw it \nopen--the length of time for chain migration, I say to my friend from \nIllinois, does not change the effect. It displaces the entry of spouses \nand unmarried minor children. If you continue this ritual--and it is \nalready at 1.1 million. Remember, 1.1 million permanent resident aliens \ncannot bring their spouses and minor children because the numbers are \ngoing here, to someone who is not part of the blood line, not part of \nthe ``immediate family'', and that is what is happening.\n  And the mystery--that this is something that is anti-American, we are \ndoing something to those who play by the rules--is extraordinary.\n  But there are some players out in the land, not in this Chamber--I \nhave had the greatest and richest regard for Senator Abraham and \nSenator DeWine and Senator Feingold. They are doing yeoman work on the \nposition they feel very strongly about. But there are some groups in \nthe United States that are doing yeoman distortion, groups that send \nout stuff like this.\n  Oh, I love this one. You must see this one. This is big Grover \nNordquist. He is really a dazzler. We hope Grover will come into the \nChamber with us on this ghastly exercise. This is the Simpson-Smith bar \ncode tattoo, compliments of Uncle Grover, who is getting paid 10,000 \nbucks a month by Mr. Gates of Microsoft to mess up the issue. And he \nhas done a magnificent job of messing up the issue and should for \n10,000 bucks a month. I think he should be very active.\n  So here is Grover. This is the Lamar Smith-Simpson tattoo. This is on \nillegal immigration.\n\n       How to do your tattoo.\n       Clean skin with alcohol pad.\n       Place tattoo ink side down on skin.\n       Dab with pad until design shows thru.\n       Lift paper off while still wet.\n       Dust design with baby powder for longer wear. Stays for \n     days.\n       Remove instantly with alcohol or oil.\n\n  That is Uncle Grover's little caper, and for 10,000 bucks a month you \ncan afford to do a lot of those, which they have. They are in a \ndeceptively difficult looking packet, I will admit that. I will not go \ninto that.\n  Well, now, there we are. The situation on this chart is a \nhypothetical situation. It says right here, so that you do not be \ndeceived: ``Hypothetical illustration * * * chain migration through the \nfamily preference system for two generations.'' No tricks. It is what \ncan and frequently does occur as a result of our current preference \nsystem. And my proposal will change that temporarily--and horribly--for \n5 years so that we can stop the action, stop the carousel, let \neverybody get on and get off, and in 5 years decide what we are going \nto do. If we do nothing, the spike goes right back into existence.\n  I will yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We start off on our second day, really the third day on \nthe issue of illegal immigration, and we want to be able to move \nthrough this process. We went through yesterday with a rather peculiar \nprocedure by which individuals were denied recognition if they were \ngoing to deal with any issue that was not going to be relevant to the \nmatter at hand.\n  Generally, we have to invoke cloture to follow that procedure. That \nis a time-honored process for this body. And so we circumvented that \ntime-honored process, and the only matters that we could vote on would \nbe those that were going to be understood or cleared beforehand not to \ninclude, for example, the minimum wage. So even if you stood on your \nfeet, prior recognition and the way that the proposals are at the desk \nvirtually excluded that possibility.\n  As I mentioned last evening, and I wish to mention to all of those \nwho will be involved in the course of the day, just as the minority \nleader mentioned, that issue is still of currency, perhaps more so \ntoday, after the statements that have been made by Mr. Gingrich and Mr. \nArmey that there will not be any vote on the minimum wage in the House \nof Representatives this year.\n  The idea that there has somehow been some willingness to try to work \nthe process, to try and find some common ground, compromise on this \nreceived its answer yesterday with the clear statement of Mr. Gingrich \nand Mr. Armey that there will not be a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  That does not surprise us because that has been their position for \nsome period of time, although as recently as 2 days ago Mr. Armey \nthought they might be willing to consider the effective elimination of \nthe earned-income tax credit that reaches out and provides help and \nassistance to children and workers at the lower levels of the economic \nladder, and that some new entitlement that would be administered by the \nInternal Revenue Code would be set up by which the taxpayer would \nsubsidize a number of the industries that hire $4.25-an-hour Americans, \nthat would be costly to the taxpayers. It would be an entitlement \nprogram, a new entitlement program with new bureaucracy, I think \ncompletely unworkable, as a way of helping and assisting the industries \nwhich are employing the minimum wage worker.\n  Mr. President, I make this point now and then I will move toward the \nissue at hand, that we are still intent upon offering this amendment. \nWe have an opportunity to offer it. We will during the course of this \nday and every day. So we want to just make sure that our friends and \ncolleagues are aware of that. That is our intention. I am quite \nconfident that sometime in the very near future we will have the \nopportunity to do so.\n  The bottom line is our Republican friends honor work. They say they \nhonor work. They want to encourage Americans to work, and yet they \nrefuse to provide them a living wage so that they can receive a just \ncompensation to keep them out of poverty. That is the issue. That is \nthe issue. No matter how you slice it, that is the issue.\n  That issue is a matter of fundamental justice and fairness in our \nsociety, and the fundamental issue of justice and fairness will not go \naway.\n  I see a number of our colleagues on the floor who wish to address \nthis issue, but I want to try to put this whole issue into some \nperspective. The question that is before the Senate deals with illegal \nimmigration. That is the matter of greatest concern. These are \nindividuals who violate the laws, effectively take American jobs, come \nhere unskilled and, in many instances, take scarce taxpayer dollars to \nsupport their various activities in this country. That is an entirely \ndifferent profile from those who are legal immigrants.\n  We will have an opportunity to debate that issue when we address the \nlegal immigration. But I can tell you, the studies that have been done \nabout what happens with legal immigration demonstrate these are hard-\nworking people, overwhelmingly successful. They are contributors to our \nsociety. We ought to be debating today illegal immigration.\n  The issues of families go to the core of legal immigration. The basic \nconcept, in terms of what immigration policy has been about since the \nMcCarran-Walters Immigration Act is, No. 1, the reunification of \nfamilies. The reunification of families--that has been No. 1. It has \nonly been in recent years that we have talked about the issues of \nbringing in special skills.\n  I still support the special skills that will enhance American \nemployment. To me, it makes sense. I think, when we have the \nopportunity to talk about legal immigration we will find there is a \ndifference here between the very special skilled and others who are \ncoming in, but that is the heart of legal immigration.\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\n  It is illegal immigration here, which is burdening many of our \nStates, eight States that have the 85 percent of the illegal \nimmigration, taking American jobs. In too many instances, they are \nindividuals whose lives have been complicated by crime and violence. \nThat is the major concern. In order to address that issue, we ought to \nfocus on that issue and just that issue today.\n  If we are going to get off on the legal immigration, which this \namendment is all about--because what we are talking about are total \nnumbers, the numbers we are going to be seeing here. We will have a \ngood opportunity to talk about that during the time we have legal \nimmigration. Some of the provisions that were on the Simpson amendment \nabout reducing the numbers of skilled workers and the diversity issues \nmay have some appeal at some time, but not as a part of this particular \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to reject the Simpson proposal.\n\n  Senator Simpson talks about who is closer to the Jordan Commission. \nThe fact of the matter was, when Senator Abraham and I offered the \namendment in the Judiciary Committee, we were closer to the Jordan \nnumbers than the author of this amendment. We were closer.\n  One of the important points my friend from Wyoming left out in his \npresentation was the fact that the Jordan Commission said we ought to \naddress the backlog of children and loved ones, members of the family \nwho have been trying to be reunited with their families--permanent \nresident aliens.\n  She suggested we have some kind of process and procedure to permit \nthose families to be reunified. But not this proposal--absolutely not \nthis proposal. This proposal effectively excludes and cuts out all of \nthose. But this proposal would go even further. It would say, if you \nare a permanent resident alien and you have a son, that individual \nmight not come here to the United States for 5 more years; let alone \nthe hundreds of thousands of people who have been playing by the rules, \nwho have signed up, their relatives signed up to be able to take their \nturn to come to the United States, to be reunified with their family--\nthey are off the charts.\n  Now you have a new group. I am interested about that red pen going \naround those individuals. What about, do I care less about my son's \nwife than I do about my son? We will have an opportunity to talk. We \nare talking about real people, real people who are going to be \naffected, and real families. It is not just the ones who are under that \nroof. The nuclear family you talk about includes the brothers and the \nsisters and the fathers and the children of those families.\n  With all respect to my colleague, talking about chain migration, it \nis a problem, but it is not the problem that has been described here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  If you look back at the GAO report on chain migration--and we address \nthe issue of chain migration in the Abraham amendment. We are committed \nto addressing it when we have the legal immigration issues. But one \nother important fact that has been missing is that we here in the U.S. \nSenate passed one bill in 1986 and another one in 1990, one to deal \nwith illegal, one to deal with legal. We had two separate commissions, \nunder Father Hesburgh, one to deal with legal, one to deal with \nillegal, and that is the way we have proceeded.\n  The Jordan Commission had one report for legal and another for \nillegal. Interesting. Why? Because she understood, and the commission \nunderstood, that you should keep those issues separate. That is what we \nare doing here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\n  Let us debate the issues on illegal and then debate the issues on \nlegal. Barbara Jordan recommended it. Barbara Jordan suggested it. \nBarbara Jordan suggested we deal with the backlog of family members, \nbut that has not been included in the amendment of the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  On the issues of chain migration, which we address in our amendment \nand which we will continue to address, we have to put this in some \nproportion. Senator Simpson solves it, all right, but is hitting a tack \nwith a sledgehammer. How much of a problem is this?\n  Here is the GAO: ``64 percent of petitioners who were exempt-\nimmediate-relative immigrants * * * were native-born United States \ncitizens. Among the remaining 36 percent of petitioners who were once \nimmigrants, the average time between their arrival and the arrival of \ntheir exempt-immediate-relatives was about 12 years.'' Twelve years. \nThe way this was presented is they come in the morning and they bring \neverybody else in in the afternoon--12 years.\n  Let us look at how much of a problem this really is. ``Only about 10 \npercent of former immigrant petitioners were admitted under the \nnumerically restricted fifth preference category, brothers and \nsisters.'' Ten percent, total numbers, 12 years. We ought to address \nit. We did address it in our program. We will address it when we have \nthe opportunity to deal with the legal immigration.\n  This amendment, as I mentioned, is basically about families. It is \nimportant that we not lose sight of that particular issue. What this \namendment does to American families is exactly why we should separate \nlegal and illegal. The key difference between the proposals of Senator \nSimpson and what Senator Abraham and I propose in the committee is that \nSenator Simpson's amendment does not allow for fluctuation in family \nimmigration.\n  We have heard about the changes that have taken place as a result of \nthe 1986 act, where we provided a period of amnesty in order to clear \nup the problems with illegal that we had in this country at that time, \nand then we put in the employer sanctions provisions to try to start \nwith a clean slate.\n  Now, what we have here in the United States as a result of that \namnesty of 1986, we have some bump because of that one particular \naction. That will mean, over the next 5 years, some increase beyond \nwhat we expected and beyond what was testified to by Doris Meissner, \nalthough Doris Meissner did indicate, in September of last year, that \nthere would be further naturalizations and was unable to detect exactly \nat that time what that increase might be. As a matter of fact, Barbara \nJordan did not know what that increase would be. Barbara Jordan had the \nsame figures that Senator Abraham and I had, and others had, in terms \nof this. Those are the same thing.\n\n  She had a staff of experts that have complete access to all of these \nstudies and figures, and she basically had the same kind of figures \nthat all of us had when we were dealing with this issue in the \nJudiciary Committee. Now we have the blip that will come for the period \nof the next 5 years, and we will offer the amendments at the time we \nget to legal immigration. We do not have that opportunity now. I \nthought we were going to do just the illegal immigration, but now we \nhave the legal immigration issues, in terms of family, that we are \nfaced with.\n  So we have been operating in good faith. We are committed to act \nresponsibly with a reduction that also respects the members and \nchildren of the families, in a very limited program, in terms of the \nreunification of brothers and sisters.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out a few other items. I see others \nare on the floor who want to address this issue. The effect of this \nprogram on families will be in 1997 a 33-percent reduction below the \ncurrent law; in 1998, 28 percent; 23 percent in 1999; 18 in the year \n2000; 12 percent in the year 2001.\n  It basically will say that adult children of American citizens will \nget no numbers for the next 5 years--of American citizens, adult \nchildren will get none.\n  Let me give you what this has meant in terms of some of those in my \nown State. This means someone who immigrates to the United States while \nhis daughter is still studying abroad, marries an American, becomes a \ncitizen in 3 years and then wants his daughter with him once she \nfinishes college abroad, and he cannot bring her here.\n  That means the Bosnian refugee I met in Boston who left his adult \nchildren behind because of the conflict in Bosnia could not bring them \nhere once he becomes a citizen. It says to brothers and sisters of \ncitizens that you will effectively be zeroed out. It says, ``Take a \nhike,'' to those Americans who paid money to the Government to get \ntheir brothers and sisters here and have been waiting patiently for \nyears.\n  Under the Abraham-Kennedy proposal, we at least try to reduce part of \nthe current backlog; not all of it, but\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\npart of it. For some Americans, a brother or sister is all they have. \nThere is a Cambodian woman in Lowell, MA, who thought her entire family \nwas wiped out by Pol Pot's terror. She then found out she had a sister \nwho survived. That is her only family left, and she wants her sister \nwith her in America, but this amendment says no brothers or sisters for \nthe next 5 years.\n  The other evening, we adopted a proposal by Senator Conrad for \ndoctors to come to medically underserved areas. It was unanimously \naccepted here. Last week, we accepted 20 foreign doctors per State to \ngo into underserved areas. This amendment says they cannot bring their \nchildren and they will not have their adult children here or brothers \nor sisters. They just cannot do it, and it ignores the big priority the \nJordan commission gave to reducing the backlog of spouses and children \nof permanent residents.\n  Mr. President, I believe the final point I want to make is we have to \nlook at what is happening in the House of Representatives. The House \nJudiciary Committee bill capped families at 330,000, and the conferees \nwill be itching to make the cuts in this category. We are going to see \nsignificant reductions on whatever we do over here based upon what is \nhappening over in the House. The U.S. Senate should not fall into that \nkind of a situation.\n\n  We are saying that we want your skills and ingenuity, but leave your \nbrothers and sisters behind. We want your commitment to freedom and \ndemocracy, but not your mother. We want you to help rebuild our inner \ncities and cure our diseases, but we do not want your grandchildren to \nbe at your knee. We want your family values but not your families.\n  Mr. President, this amendment should not be on this bill. We should \nhave an opportunity to debate these issues when legal immigration comes \nup, and I hope the amendment will not be accepted.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I hope by the tenor of this debate \nthis morning that further amendments are not being closed out. I would \nbe very upset and very concerned if they are, coming from a State that \nhandles 40 percent of the immigration load, whether it be illegal or \nlegal, in the United States and 40 to 50 percent of the refugees and 40 \nto 50 percent of the asylees in the United States of America. It would \nseem to me that the voices of the two Senators from California and \namendments that they might produce in this area are worthy of \nconsideration by this body. If I judge the tenor of the debate, it will \nbe to close out other amendments, and I very much hope and wish that \nthat will not be the case.\n  In any event, I am going to take this time now to explain what I have \nin mind and to explain that I would like to send a compromise amendment \nto the desk. This compromise amendment is between the Kennedy proposal \nand the Simpson proposal.\n  The debate has been changed. I appreciate what the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts said, that this debate is not about legal \nimmigration. But the fact of the matter is that we have received in \ncommittee incorrect numbers on legal immigration, and those numbers are \nso dramatically different from the fact of what is actually happening, \nwe learned from the press, that it does, by its own weight, changes the \ndebate.\n  When we hear in committee--and I serve on the Judiciary Committee and \non the Immigration Subcommittee--that legal immigration numbers have \nbeen going down and will continue to go down--and that has been the \ntestimony--and then yesterday I read press that says, ``Immigration \nNumbers to Surge,'' and from one of the most distinguished journalists, \nMarcus Stern of the San Diego Union Tribune: ``Border Surprise, Outcry \nGreets INS Projection of Soaring Legal Immigration,'' and when the \nDepartment's own numbers indicate that immigration in fiscal year 1995 \nwas 1.1 million and in fiscal year 1996 will be very close to that 1 \nmillion mark, what we thought we were dealing with in the vicinity of \n500,000 or 600,000 is clearly not the reality.\n  Now, reports are one thing, numbers are another. Numbers affect \nclassroom size, they affect housing markets in States that have major \nimpact from legal immigration. California is on a tier of its own in \nthis regard.\n  So I am very hopeful that this body will not make it impossible for \nthe Senators from California to put forward a compromise proposal. I am \nhaving copies of that proposal at this time placed on the desk of every \nMember of this House.\n  Essentially, what the proposal would do is control increases in total \nfamily numbers and control chain migration. We would allow reasonable \nlimits in family immigration totals for the next 5 years by placing a \nhard cap at the current law total of 480,000, without completely \nclosing out adult-children-of-citizen categories and providing for the \nclearance of backlogs without creating chain migration.\n  Every Member will shortly have a chart which will show the difference \nbetween the Feinstein proposal with the hard cap of 480,000 and the \nSimpson amendment with a hard cap of 480,000 and no backlog reduction.\n  Also distributed to you will be a chart which will show current law. \nWe now know that although current law is 480,000, it is going to be \nclose to 1 million. The Kennedy proposal of 450,000, which is in the \nbill, with increases in the immediate family with an anticipated \nadditional increase of 150,000--the Kennedy proposal numbers will be \nclose to 1 million. It will be a major increase in legal immigration, \nif one is to believe the figures that INS has just put out.\n  We will also distribute to each Member the new figures of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. Under current law, INS \nprojected 1,100,000 family immigration last year; and what they say \nwill be in fiscal year 1996, is 934,000, similar to the figures under \nthe Kennedy proposal which is now in the bill.\n  I voted for the Kennedy proposal in committee. I did so with the \nassurance that the numbers were not going to be increased. The first \ntime I knew that was not the case was when I saw a New York Times \narticle saying that in fact these numbers swelled legal immigration \ntotals. And then of course yesterday we saw that the numbers were off \nas given to us by INS by 41 percent.\n  Current law has increased the numbers, due to the naturalization of \n2.5 million people whom are legalized under IRCA. The spouse and minor \nchildren of citizens is going to increase for the next 4 years, \nincreasing an anticipated average of between 300,000 and 370,000 or \nmore per year for the next 4 years. I would suspect that even these \nnumbers are going to be higher.\n  Under current law the spouse and minor children of citizens are \nunlimited. The family total of 480,000 is a pierceable cap, which means \nthe additional increases in this category due to IRCA legalization, \npierces the cap and increases family immigration numbers over the \n964,000 in fiscal year 1996.\n  So that number, even the projected numbers, are going to be low. Also \nunder current law, another source of increase in family numbers is the \nspillover from unused visas in the employment base category. In fiscal \nyear 1995, 140,000 visas were available and only 85,000 were used. This \nmeans 55,000 spilled over to the family category.\n  What my compromise amendment does, what the Feinstein amendment would \ndo, is stop the pierceable cap, place a hard cap on the 480,000 that \nare theoretically allowable today. That is the current law, but without \nthe anticipated increases, because the hard cap would stop that. It \nwould also stop the spillover from the unused employment visas, the \nloophole in the current system that no one talks about.\n  Fairness, I believe, dictates that we do not close out the preference \ncategories. Let me tell you why. I think Senator Abraham and others, \nSenator Feingold, understands this. Under our present system, if you \nclose out the family preferences, there is no other way for these \nmembers of families to come to this country--no other way--not in the \ndiversity quotas, no other way. So if you close them out, you foreclose \ntheir chances of ever coming to this country. And they are on a long \nwaiting list now. So I think the fair way to do it is to place a hard \ncap on the numbers and then allocate numbers within each of the \npreference categories.\n  So I do that. I do not close out the preference categories. I would \nhave\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nparents and adult children guaranteed to receive visas every year, \nremaining consistent with the goal of family reunification.\n  I would allocate visa numbers on a sliding scale basis for parents \nand adult children of citizens, allowing for increases in visas when \nthe numbers fall within the unlimited immediate family category. \nHowever, they must always remain within that 480,000 hard cap.\n  I would allow the backlog clearance of spouses, minor children of \npermanent residents by allowing 75 percent, with any visas left over \nwithin the family total to be allocated to this category's backlog \nclearance.\n  I would also control chain migration, where one person ends up \nbringing in 45 or 40 other people, often not blood relatives. \nCommissioner Doris Meissner has told me that what permits chain \nmigration is the siblings of the citizen category. I would place a \nmoratorium for the next 5 years on this category. However, if there are \nany visas left over within the hard cap of 480,000 our family amendment \nallows 25 percent of the leftover to be used for backlog clearance of \nsiblings, those who have been waiting for many years.\n  The problem with the Simpson amendment is that in its operation it \nwould provide no visas for adult children of citizens. It would provide \nno guarantee of visas for children of citizens. All the numbers left \nover from Simpson's hard cap family numbers go to spouses and minor \nchildren of permanent residents, where the 1.1 million backlog remains. \nThis means no one else who has been waiting to reunite with their \nchildren will be able to do so in the next 5 years.\n  The Simpson amendment provides no backlog reduction plan. The \namendment is a simple, straight spillover, giving preference to \npermanent residents over U.S. citizens' families.\n  The problem with the Abraham-Kennedy provision, which is currently in \nthe bill, is that there is no cap on the numbers. With an anticipated \n2.5 million IRCA legalized aliens expected to naturalize in the next 5 \nyears, the unlimited family numbers would result in a family \nimmigration total of 1 million a year.\n  Recognize, 500,000 of these people are going to go to California a \nyear. We do not have enough room in our schools. We have elementary \nschools with 2,500, 3,000 students in them, in critical areas where \nthese legal immigrants go. There is no available housing. There is a \nshortage of jobs. So why would we do this, if the numbers are swollen \n41 percent over what we were told when we considered this bill in \ncommittee?\n  The Kennedy-Abraham amendment also has a spillover provision from \nunused employment-based immigration visas. The current limit is \n140,000. The actual use in 1995 was only 85,000, which means in \naddition to the increasing numbers in family immigration, there would \nbe an additional 55,000 visas totaling up to 1 million in family \nimmigration in 1996.\n  Third, the Kennedy-Abraham amendment increase chain migration by \nguaranteeing 50,000 visas for siblings of citizens in the next 5 years, \nwhich increases to 75,000 per year for the subsequent 5 years. INS \nCommissioner Doris Meissner has confirmed that the chain migration \ncomes from the siblings category. Under Kennedy-Abraham, the bill would \nallocate 50,000 to 75,000 for siblings, more numbers in certain years \nthan current law which allows 65,000 per year.\n  I believe that the Feinstein amendment is a reasoned balance between \nSimpson and the Abraham-Kennedy provision. It places a hard cap on the \ncurrent level of 480,000 family total per year. It closes the loophole \nwhere the unused employment-based visas spills over to the family \nimmigration numbers.\n  Third, it guarantees that close family members of citizens get visas \neach year with flexible limits, allowing increases in allocation of \nvisas with decreases in the immediate family categories, which INS \nanticipates will flatten out in about 5 years.\n  The Feinstein amendment is about fair allocation of scarce visa \nnumbers to protect reunification of close family members of citizens, \nwhile controlling the daunting increases in family immigration due to \nthe increase in naturalization rates for the next 5 years.\n  Every member, Mr. President, has three pages. The first page would \nhave current law, Feinstein and Kennedy; the second page, Feinstein and \nSimpson in the numbers in each of the categories. I can only plead with \nthe chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee to please give me an \nopportunity to send this amendment to the desk so that the Senators, at \nleast of the largest State in the Union affected the most by \nimmigration, would have an opportunity to vote on it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I begin by clarifying a point here. I \nbelieve we are on the Simpson amendment here to the illegal immigration \nbill. References made by the Senator from California to the Abraham-\nKennedy amendments being in this bill are not accurate. There is no \nprovision related to the Abraham-Kennedy amendment in this bill because \nthis is the illegal immigration bill we are dealing with.\n  The legal immigration bill, which we also passed in the Judiciary \nCommittee, is at the desk and can be brought to the floor of the \nSenate. I believe and hope it will be brought to the floor of the \nSenate for discussions of the matters that pertain to legal \nimmigration, including debate over how the allocation of visas ought to \nbe made.\n  I am going to speak right now about the amendment that is pending, \nthe effort by the Senator from Wyoming, the Simpson amendment, to \ninject legal immigration issues into this illegal immigration bill.\n  Mr. President, I have only been involved with this issue during my \nbrief tenure in the Senate. I am very deferential to the Senator from \nWyoming, who has worked on this issue for 17 years. I applaud his \nefforts. My efforts, which have been with a slightly different \nphilosophical approach, are not meant to in any way suggest that what \nhe has done has not been based upon sound thinking on his part.\n  However, I say from the outset, he indicated there were a lot of \nfunny things that came up during immigration, a lot of intriguing \ntwists and turns. I agree with him completely. The one thing that I \nlearned more than anything else during our experience in the committee \nwas the very real need to keep illegal and legal immigration issues \nseparate rather than joining them together.\n  I also learned it was imperative that in discussing whether it was \nthe illegal immigration issues or the legal immigration issues, they be \ndone in a total and comprehensive way. Indeed, our committee \ndeliberations on this lasted almost a full month, Mr. President.\n  That is why I think it is important that we continue the pattern \nwhich was set in that committee of dealing with illegal immigration \nissues in one context, the bill before us, and reserving the legal \nimmigration issues, issues of how many visas are going to be provided, \nhow those visas will be allocated, and so on, the legal immigration \nbill, which is also at the desk. It is wrong to mix these two.\n  As a very threshold matter in this whole debate about immigration, \nSenators should understand the very real differences between the two. \nIllegal immigration reform legislation, the legislation before the \nSenate right now, aims to crack down on people who break the rules, \npeople who violate the laws, people who seek to come to this country \nwithout having proper documentation to take advantage of the benefits \nof America, people who overstay their visas once they have come here, \nin order to take advantage of this country. That is what this bill is \nall about. It does an extraordinarily good job of dealing with the \nproblems surrounding illegal immigration. It is a testament, in no \nsmall measure, of the Senator from Wyoming's long-time efforts that \nsuch a fine bill has been crafted.\n\n  But there is a very big difference between dealing with folks who \nbreak the rules and break the laws and seek to come to this country for \nexploitative reasons, and dealing with people who want to come to this \ncountry in a positive and constructive way to make a contribution, to \nplay by the rules, and, frankly, Mr. President, to make a great, great \naddition to our American family. It is wrong to mix these.\n  It would be equally wrong to mix Food and Drug Administration reform \nwith a crackdown on sentencing for drug dealers. Yes, they both involve \ndrugs, but one deals on the one hand\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\nwith people breaking the law and using drugs the wrong way, and the \nother deals with a reasonable approach to bringing life-saving \nmedicines and pharmaceuticals into the marketplace. Those should not be \njoined together and neither should these. Anybody who watched the \nprocess, whether in our Judiciary Committee here or over on the House \nside, I think would understand that these issues have to be kept \nseparate.\n  Let me say in a little bit more detail, let us consider what \nhappened. In the Judiciary Committee, on the committee side, we had a \nvote. It was a long-debated vote over whether or not legal and illegal \nimmigration should be kept together. The conclusion was very clear: a \nmajority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats in the Judiciary \nCommittee voted to divide the issues and to keep the legal immigration \ndebate and issues separate from the illegal immigration issues. That, I \nbelieve, is what we should also do on the floor of the Senate.\n  It was not just at the full committee that that was the approach \ntaken, Mr. President. It was also how the Immigration Subcommittee \nitself addressed these issues. It did not start with one bill on legal \nand illegal immigration. It recognized the very delicate and very \ncomplicated nature of each of these separate areas of the law. First it \npassed a bill on illegal immigration, and then it passed a bill on \nlegal immigration. Only then did it seek to combine the two, which the \nJudiciary Committee felt was a mistake, and separated the two later on.\n  On the House side, Mr. President, we had the same thing take place. \nOn the floor of the House of Representatives, a bill that included \nlegal and illegal immigration reforms was tested. Overwhelmingly, the \nHouse of Representatives voted to strike those provisions such as the \none or similar to the ones contained in the Simpson amendment which is \nbefore the Senate, provisions which dealt with legal immigration and \ndramatic changes to the process by which people who want to play by the \nrules come to this country and do so legally.\n\n  In the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have kept legal and illegal \nimmigration separate. In the House of Representatives, they have kept \nthem separate. The bill, which is sitting in the House side waiting to \ngo to conference with us, does not have these legal immigration \ncomponents that will be discussed today.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, as a threshold matter, I think that \nthe amendment that is being offered should not be accepted. I believe \nthat it improperly puts together two very different areas of the law \nthat should be kept and dealt with and considered separately, and I \nthink we should not move in that direction.\n  I make a couple of other opening statements. I know there are other \ncolleagues who want to speak, and I will have quite a bit to say on \nthis and intend to be here quite a long time to say it. Even if there \nwas a decision to somehow merge these together, Mr. President, I think \nthe worst conceivable way to do it is to do it piecemeal as we are now \ntalking about doing in this amendment.\n  If we were to consider these together, the notion of taking just one \ncomponent--and a very significant one at that--out of the legal \nimmigration bill and to try to tack it on to the illegal immigration \nbill before us, would be the worst conceivable way to address the \nissues that pertain to legal immigration in this country and the \norderly process by which people who want to come and play by the rules \nare allowed into our system.\n  It is wrong, I think, as a threshold matter, to mix the two. It is \neven wronger to take a piecemeal approach to it as would be suggested \nby this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I say it would be wrong for this body to pursue this \ntype of amendment offered by the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I also make another note. The Senator from Wyoming in his comments, \nas a threshold matter, suggested because visa overstayers constitute a \nlarge part of the illegal immigrant population in this country and \nbecause they at one time came to this country legally, we should \nsomehow bring in the entire legal immigration proposal, misses the \npoint.\n  With this legislation, once these folks have overstayed their visas, \nthey are no longer legal immigrants. They are illegal immigrants. We \nhave dealt with that effectively in the bill.\n  So, Mr. President, my initial comments today are simply these. As a \nthreshold, it is wrong to mix the two. As a threshold, it is even \nwronger to mix them on a piecemeal basis. If we are going to consider \nlegal immigration, the appropriate way to do so is to bring the full \nbill that was passed by the Judiciary Committee, which sits at the \ndesk, to the floor of the Senate. I have no qualms about having a \ndebate over that bill. I have a lot of different changes that I might \nlike to consider, including some in light of the INS statistics that \nare being discussed. But that is the way to do it, not by tacking on \nthis type of provision to a bill that should focus, in a very directed \nway, on illegal immigration and the problems we confront in that \nrespect in this country today.\n  Mr. President, I know others are seeking recognition. I have quite a \nbit more to say, but I will yield the floor and seek recognition \nfurther.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from California \ntemporarily. She wishes to introduce an amendment that will be held at \nthe desk.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside so that I might send a substitute \namendment to the desk on behalf of Senator Boxer and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I, with all due respect, differ with my \ncolleague from Wyoming on this. Were I to vote on the Feinstein \namendment regarding this, I would vote against that, also. I think our \ncolleague from Michigan is correct that we have to keep legal and \nillegal separate.\n  Now, it is true, as Senator Simpson has said, that the majority of \npeople who are here illegally came in legally. But we have to add that \nthis amendment will do nothing on that. These are people who came in on \nvisitors' visas, or student visas. This amendment does not address \nthat.\n  A second thing has to be added that somehow has escaped so far this \nmorning, and that is, the majority of the people who come in as \nimmigrants to our society are great assets to our society. Illinois is \none of the States that has major numbers in immigration. But a smaller \npercentage of those who come into our country legally are on various \nGovernment programs, such as welfare, than native-born Americans, with \nthe exception of SSI. That is an exception. And there are some problems \nwe ought to deal with. There are problems we ought to deal with in \nillegal immigration. But not on this particular bill.\n\n  Let me also address the question of the numbers. There is some \nconflict, apparently, in the numbers that are going around. I think, in \npart, it is because the Immigration Service--and I have found them to \nbe very solid in what they have to say--are projecting what is going to \nhappen. And there is a bubble because we have this amnesty period. And \nso there is going to be a period in which the numbers go up, and then \nthey will go back down. I do not think it is a thing to fear.\n  And then, finally, Mr. President, yesterday on this floor, I heard \nthat we are going to be facing real problems in Social Security. We all \nknow that to be the case. The numbers who are working are declining \nrelative to the numbers of retirees, in good part, because of people in \nthe profession of the occupant of the chair, Mr. President, who have \nadded to our longevity. One of the things that happens in the fourth \npreference, where you bring in brothers and sisters, is that you bring \nin people who will work and pay Social Security. It is a great asset to \nour country, not a liability.\n  So I have great respect for our colleague from Wyoming. I think he is \none of the best Members of this body, by any gauge. But I think he is \nwrong on\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\nthis amendment. I think we should separate these two insofar as \npossible, the illegal and the legal immigration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in very strong opposition to the \nSimpson amendment. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his leadership \non it.\n  First of all, I think that this amendment is an unfortunate attempt \nto circumvent the will of the majority of this Congress, which has \nclearly indicated its strong desire to keep the issue of legal \nimmigration separate from the issue of illegal immigration.\n  The other body has already sent a very strong message on a strong, \nbipartisan vote not to have any cutbacks, Mr. President, in current \nlegal immigration levels.\n\n  Just a few weeks ago, after a very, very long process, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, again on a very strong, bipartisan vote, voted by \na large margin to keep these two areas of law separate--legal and \nillegal immigration.\n  Groups and organizations from across the political spectrum have \nunited behind the common goal of keeping legal immigration separate \nfrom the issue of illegal immigration.\n  This includes a lot of business groups, such as the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers; labor groups, such as the AFL-CIO; \nreligious groups, such as the American Jewish Committee and the \nLutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, and liberal and conservative \ngroups ranging from Americans for Tax Reform to the National Council of \nLa Raza.\n  They are all opposed to this attempt to rejoin the issues of legal \nand illegal immigration. That is why, Mr. President, with this immense \namount of support for considering legal immigration reform as a \nseparate piece of legislation, I am disappointed that the Senator from \nWyoming has chosen to offer this amendment today.\n  Just to review, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted by a 12 to 6 \nmargin to split the two issues. Nonetheless, that vote did not prevent \nthe committee, nor will it prevent the whole Senate from considering \nboth issues. Indeed, after the committee had dealt with, at length, the \nillegal immigration bill and disposed of it, the committee very shortly \nmoved on to discuss and consider and vote out a separate bill on legal \nimmigration.\n  Mr. President, I am also somewhat troubled by what has been suggested \nboth privately and publicly, that cutbacks in legal immigration cannot \npass unless they are riding the coattails of strong illegal immigration \nreform. I think that is a very troubling notion.\n  If there are not enough votes in this Congress to pass a bill that \nreduces legal immigration, it should not be piggybacked onto a separate \npiece of legislation that has far more support.\n  If a particular proposal cannot pass based on its merit, what other \npossible justification could there be for its passage?\n  We have heard the argument that the issues of legal and illegal \nimmigration are intertwined because so many immigrants come here on \ntemporary visas and remain here unlawfully after their visas have \nexpired. Fair enough. This is known as the visa overstay problem. But \nbefore the Abraham-Feingold visa overstay provision was adopted by the \nJudiciary Committee last month, there was not a single word in this \nbill about that issue, about the significant number of people who are \nhere illegally because they overstay their visas.\n\n  Let me emphasize that point, Mr. President. It is important for all \nSenators to understand that the visa overstay problem represents \nroughly one-half of our entire illegal immigration problem. We are not \ntalking here about people who jump the fence along the Mexican border \nin the dead of the night and disappear into the American work force. We \nare talking about people who come here on a legal visa, usually a \ntourist or a student visa, and then refuse to leave the country when \nthe visa expires.\n  That problem alone represents one-half of illegal immigration. The \nSenator from Wyoming is suggesting that the only way to combat that \nproblem is to tie reductions in legal immigration to an illegal \nimmigration bill.\n  Mr. President, that theory has already been discredited. The new visa \noverstayer penalties, authored by the Senator from Michigan and myself, \nare not contained in the legal immigration bill.\n  They are contained quite appropriately in this bill. They are in the \nillegal immigration bill and that is where they belong because the \nissue of visa overstay has to do with illegality. But this amendment \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming has nothing to do with illegality. \nIt has to do with questions of levels of legal immigration and who \nshould come in and when. But what was offered in committee--and what is \na part of this bill--are targeted penalties and reforms against those \nlegal immigrants who break the rules and, therefore, have conducted \nthemselves illegally. It does not represent the approach of the Senator \nfrom Wyoming which is to clamp down on all of these immigrants whether \nthey are playing by the rules or whether they are breaking them.\n  So the proposition that we need to tie the legal provisions to the \nillegal provisions so we can clamp down on the visa overstayer problem \nis just plain false. We have clamped down in visa overstayers, who are \nillegal aliens, in the illegal immigration bill.\n  As I indicated yesterday in my opening remarks, there has \nunquestionably been some abuse of our legal immigration system.\n  I will not, of course, deny that. But much like you wouldn't stop \ndriving your car if you had a little engine trouble, we should not pass \nsuch harsh and unnecessary reductions in lawful immigration simply \nbecause a few have chosen to abuse the system.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear about my position on this issue; I \nwill oppose any amendment that prevents a U.S. citizen from bringing a \nparent into this country.\n  I will oppose efforts to eliminate the current-law preference \ncategory that allows a U.S. citizen to reunite with a brother or \nsister.\n  And, I will oppose any proposal that would effectively prohibit a \nU.S. citizen from bringing their child into this country, whether a \nminor or an adult child.\n  And that is essentially what the proposal before us, offered by the \nSenator from Wyoming, would accomplish. It would redefine what a \nnuclear family is.\n  Supporters of this amendment assert that in terms of allocating legal \nvisas, we should place the highest priority on spouses and minor \nchildren, both of U.S. citizens and of legal permanent residents.\n  I agree with this, Mr. President. And we can accomplish that goal and \nstill permit sufficient levels of legal immigration of other family \nrelatives. That is why a bipartisan amendment was adopted by the \nJudiciary Committee to place a stronger emphasis on the immigration of \nspouses and minor children while still providing visas to parents, \nadult children, and brothers and sisters.\n  That is what is currently in the bill. Unfortunately, the amendment \nbefore us would essentially terminate the ability of a U.S. citizen to \nbring these other family members into the country.\n  Parents would no longer be part of the nuclear family. Children, if \nthey have reached the magic age of 21, would no longer apparently be \nchildren in the sense of being part of the nuclear family for purposes \nof the very strong desire of families to be reunited. The goal of \nwanting to be reunited with your children I do not think cuts off when \nthe child reaches the age of 21.\n  Mr. President, in a sense that raises the question, What happened to \nfamily values? This proposal would turn the family friendly Congress \ninto what in many cases would be a family fragmenting Congress.\n  So I think it is clear that we have two very distinct issues at play. \nWe should not deal with this issue in a manner that suggests that those \nwho abide by our laws are as much a problem as those who break them. I \nthink that is an injustice to the millions and millions of immigrants \nwho over the years have come to this country, and who have played by \nthe rules and have become productive and contributing members to our \nsociety.\n  Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Michigan, the Senator \nfrom Ohio, and others in urging my colleagues to join the majority of \nthe House, to join a majority of the Senate\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\nJudiciary Committee, to join numerous business, labor, religious, and \nethnic organizations, and to join the overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people who do not want to see such dramatic legal immigration \ncutbacks tacked on to a piece of legislation that seeks to punish those \nwho break our laws.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment.\n  The first thing that I want to say is that I have the greatest \nrespect for my colleague from Wyoming, and I know that no one has \nworked harder or longer on this issue. As he knows as well as anybody, \nit is not an issue that is very beneficial politically for anyone. But \nit has been something that the Senator has done out of a sense of duty, \na sense of obligation to perform that function for the U.S. Senate, but \nmore importantly for the people of this country for many, many years. \nHe has done a very good job.\n  I rise, however, to oppose the amendment, and I rise to oppose it for \ntwo reasons.\n  First, I believe it is a fundamental mistake to mix the issue of \nlegal immigration and illegal immigration. I will explain in a moment \nwhy I think that is a mistake.\n  Second, I rise to oppose the amendment because I believe on substance \nit is a mistake.\n  Let me start with the first reason. Let me start with why I believe \nit is a mistake to mix two very different issues.\n  As my colleague from Michigan has pointed out, this is an illegal \nimmigration bill. That is what is in front of us today. It is important \nI think that we keep it that way. It is also important I think that we \ndo what we said we were going to do, and that is after this bill is \nover with bring a legal immigration bill to the floor and battle that \nout and talk about that. But I think we need to keep the two separate.\n  Why? First of all, for historic reasons. These issues have always \nbeen divided by this Congress. Go back to 1986. The Simpson-Mazzoli \nbill was an illegal immigration bill. A few years later Congress dealt \nwith the legal aspects of that, a legal immigration bill. And in fact, \njust this year when these bills started off in Senator Simpson's \nsubcommittee they were separate bills. It was only at the end of the \nsubcommittee's deliberations that they were combined. The full \nJudiciary Committee by a vote of 12 to 6 decided to separate them and \nto go back to the way this matter has always, or at least for the last \n15 years or so, been dealt with.\n  So on historical grounds it is very clear this precedent is to keep \nthem separate. There is absolutely no precedent to combine the two \nissues. It is interesting that the House of Representatives basically \nmade the same decision when they deleted the significant portion, the \nportion of the illegal bill that had to do with illegal immigration, \nand they made that same decision. The House of Representatives did, and \nthey did it by a fairly lopsided margin.\n  The second reason that it is important to keep these issues apart is \nI believe that a yes vote on this amendment does in fact merge the two \nissues and does in fact make it much more difficult and more unlikely \nthat we will be able in this session of Congress to deliver to the \nPresident of the United States for his signature an illegal immigration \nbill.\n  If any of my colleagues who are in the Chamber or who are watching \nthis back in their offices have any doubt about this, reflect on the \ndebate of the last 2 hours and fast forward to later on today with more \nand more and more debate. I think the longer you observe this and how \ncontentious some of these legal immigration problems are and the \ndisputes are, it will be clearly understood that by taking a relatively \nclean illegal immigration bill and dump the legal issues into it makes \nit less likely that we will ever been able to pass a bill and send it \non to the President of the United States.\n\n  I think there are clearly votes in this Chamber to pass a good \nillegal immigration bill. I am going to have an amendment later on to \nchange a provision of the illegal bill. My colleague from Michigan is \ngoing to have a separate amendment to change it. We are going to vote \nthose up or down. We are going to argue those out. But ultimately we \nare going to be able to pass the illegal bill.\n  If we start down this road of amendments that are clearly dealing \nwith the legal aspect of this, I am not as confident that we are going \nto be able to pass a bill. I am not as confident that we are going to \nbe able to do what my friend from Wyoming wants to do, and I think the \nvast majority of the American people want to do; that is, to pass a \ngood illegal immigration bill and send it to the President of the \nUnited States.\n  The third reason I believe it is a mistake to combine these issues, \nthese issues that we have historically not combined, is that once you \nbegin to do that, it makes good analysis more difficult and we begin to \nconfuse the two very distinct issues.\n  We have in this country an illegal immigration problem, and we all \nagree on that. I think there is pretty broad consensus about what to do \nabout it. There are a lot of good provisions in this bill. I do not \nbelieve we have a legal immigration problem. Illegal immigrants are \nlawbreakers. They are lawbreakers. And no country can exist unless it \nenforces its laws. We absolutely have to do that.\n  Legal immigrants, on the other hand, are by and large great citizens. \nThey are people who care about their families. They are people who work \nhard. They are people who played by the rules to get here, got here \nlegally, and add a great deal to our society.\n  The linkage of the legal and illegal bills, which is what this \namendment really is going to end up doing, brings about a linkage and I \nthink many times a distortion of the correct analysis. Let me give two \nexamples, two examples of what failure to keep the distinction between \nthe illegal issue and the legal issue does.\n  I have heard many times the statement made that aliens use social \nservices more than native-born Americans. They are on welfare more; \nthey use up social services; they are a burden to society.\n  The reality is that statement may be technically true, depending on \nhow you state it, but if you talk only about legal immigrants, that \nstatement is totally wrong. In fact, the facts fly in the face of that \nbecause the facts show that legal immigrants are on welfare less than \nnative-born citizens. Although I have not seen any studies or empirical \ndata about this, just from observation--admittedly, it is anecdotal--it \nwould seem to me that the legal immigrants, citizens now, care very \nmuch about their families and have intact families and work very, very \nhard. The fact is that they are on welfare less. The fact is that they \ndo consume social services less than native-born citizens. That is the \ntruth. So you can see how the mixing of the rhetoric and the mixing of \nthe issues causes problems.\n  The second example of how mixing these issues causes a problem: The \nstatement is made--and it is a correct statement--that one-half of all \nillegal immigrants came here legally. Let me repeat that. One-half of \nall illegal immigrants came here legally. That is true. That is a \ntrue statement. But these are not legal immigrants. ``Immigrant\" is a \nterm of art. They are not legal immigrants. They did not come here \nexpecting or being told that they could become citizens. These are, as \nmy friend from Wyoming pointed out, students who overstay their visas. \nThese are people who come here to work who overstay. As my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin correctly pointed out, the Simpson amendment does not \ndeal with this issue. It does not deal with this problem. And it is a \nproblem.\n\n  The bill does. We took action in the bill and in committee to try to \nrectify this problem. Again, you have a difficulty when you confuse the \nterminology. Yes, these individuals came here legally, but they were \nnever legal immigrants. They never came here with the expectation they \nwould become citizens. They have no right to expect that. So when we \nanalyze legal immigrants and we talk about the burden they place on \nsociety, we talk about where the problem of illegal immigration comes \nfrom, it is important to keep the distinction correct and to watch our \nterminology.\n  Therefore, I believe for practical reasons, for historic reasons, and \nalso for\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\nreasons of good analysis, we should vote no on this amendment. A yes \nvote links these two issues. It takes an illegal immigration bill that \nwe can pass and shoves into it issues that should be kept separate and \ndealt with distinctly, and I would say I clearly believe that they \nshould be dealt with later on on this floor in a separate bill.\n  Let me turn, if I could, for a moment, Mr. President, to the merits \nof this bill, and I am going to return to this later; I see several of \nmy colleagues who are patiently waiting to talk.\n  If you look at the merits, I think you have to look at the big \npicture. I believe that, unfortunately, the effect of the Simpson \namendment is to go against some of the best traditions of our country. \nIt really flies in the face of what our immigration policy should be \nand has been, at least has been throughout a great portion of our \nhistory. That immigration policy in its best days, most enlightened, \nhas been based on two principles. One is that the United States should \nbe a magnet, a magnet for the best and the brightest, yes, but also a \nmagnet for the gutsiest, the people who have enough guts to get up, \nleave their country, get on a boat or get on a plane or somehow get \nhere, come into this country because they want a better future for \ntheir children and their grandchildren and their great grandchildren.\n  The second basic tenet of our immigration policy at its best has been \nfamily reunification. We talk in this Congress a lot about family \nvalues. We talk about how important families are. They are important. \nOur immigration policy at its best has put a premium on family \nreunification. I believe that the net effect of this amendment, however \nwell-intentioned, is to fly directly in the face of those traditions. \nIt is antifamily. It is antifamily reunification and goes against the \ntradition of trying to attract the best people in this country, people \nwho are the most ambitious, the people who are willing to take a \nchance.\n\n  Let me just give a couple of examples, and I will come back to this \nlater.\n  The net effect of this amendment is to exclude adult children. Let me \ntake my own example. We all relate things to our own lives. My wife \nFran and I have had eight children. Let us assume that I just came to \nthis country. Let us assume that I became a U.S. citizen. The effect of \nthe amendment would be to say, some of your children, a part of your \nnuclear family--part of them are part of your nuclear family--our \nyounger child, Anna, who is age 4, she could come. Mark, who is 9, \ncould come. And Alice could come; she is 17. Brian, who just turned 19, \nhe could come, too. But John, who is 21, he is not part of your nuclear \nfamily. You could not bring him over. He is going to college. You could \nnot bring him. He could not become a citizen. It would say about my \nolder children, Patrick and Jill, they could not come. I think that is \na mistake. I think, again, it goes against the best traditions and the \nhistory of this country.\n\n  The amendment even goes further, the net effect of it does. It says, \nif you have a child and that child happens to be a minor, but if that \nchild is now married, that child is not going to get in either. Again, \nI think that is a mistake. We hear talk about brothers and sisters. It \nis easy to say it is really not important that brothers and sisters \ncome. My colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has given a \ncouple of examples of what impact that would have. Maybe you can argue \nthe brothers and sisters issue either way. Let me make a couple of \ncomments about it. One of the ways legal immigrants have been able to \nsucceed when they come here--you see it, you certainly see it in the \nWashington, DC, area. You see it in other parts of the country, too. \nYou see, in small businesses that have been started, you see whole \nfamilies in there working, people who are hustling, people who are not \nlooking to the State or Government for handouts, but rather people in \nthere trying to make it. They are making it because everybody in the \nfamily is working. Somehow, I do not think that is bad. Somehow, I \nthink that is really in the best tradition of this country. It is in \nour history, each one of us on this floor.\n  I will make another point in regard to this. Whatever you think about \nwhether brothers and sisters should be able to come in, this amendment \nwould close the door to brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens who have \nalready--these are brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens--who have \nalready paid their fees, applied for admission and been admitted; who \nwaited in line, many times for years, who have done the right thing, \nwho have done everything we told them to do--``Be patient, wait in \nline, your turn will come.'' They get right up to the door and with \nthis amendment we will say, ``No, that is wrong, we have changed the \nrules.'' We can do that. We have every right to do that. I just do not \nthink we should do it. I do not think it is the right thing to do.\n  Let me at this point yield the floor. I do want to address some of \nthe issues my friend from Wyoming has brought up, but I see my friend \nfrom Alabama is on the floor. Several other Members are waiting. Mr. \nPresident, in just a moment I am going to yield the floor.\n  Let me briefly summarize by saying that any Member who thinks these \nissues should not be joined, who thinks we should keep the issues \nseparate and apart and distinct, any Member who is really concerned \nabout increasing the odds of passing and seeing become law an illegal \nimmigration bill, should vote ``no'' on this amendment. You should vote \n``no'' if you want to keep the issues separate. You should vote ``no'' \nif you want to increase the odds of finally getting an illegal \nimmigration bill on the President's desk and signed into law this year.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Simpson \namendment which, I believe, is a first step in restoring common sense \nto our Nation's immigration system.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be added as a cosponsor of the Simpson \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, there has been substantial debate recently \nregarding the connection between legal and illegal immigration. Those \nwho favor increased legal immigration have argued there is no link \nbetween legal and illegal immigration. In their view, these matters are \ncompletely unrelated and should be treated separately, as you just \nheard.\n  I disagree. It is simply impossible, I believe, to control illegal \nimmigration without first reforming our legal immigration system. One-\nhalf of all illegal immigrants enter the country legally and overstay \ntheir visa. No amount of effort at the border will stop this. The only \nway, I believe, to effectively prevent illegal immigration is to reform \nour legal immigration system. Thus, I believe there is a clear link \nbetween legal and illegal immigration. I support Senator Simpson's \nproposals to reform the legal immigration system, but I am concerned \nthat even his efforts to reduce legal immigration do not go far enough.\n  With all the misinformation and misunderstanding surrounding this \nissue, it does not seem possible for this body to pass legislation \nwhich will, in my view, bring the number of legal immigrants into line \nwith our national interests. The central question, as I see it, is not \nwhether we should continue legal immigration; we should. The problem is \nnot that legal immigrants or legal immigration are bad per se--they are \nnot. We are a Nation of immigrants, and immigrants have made great \ncontributions to our country, as you have heard on the floor. \nImmigration is an integral part of our heritage, and I believe it \nshould continue. The real issues that Congress must face, however, are \nwhat level of legal immigration is most consistent with our resources \nand our needs. Yes, and what criteria should be used to determine those \nwho will be admitted. I am convinced that our current immigration law \nis fundamentally flawed and I want to share with you some charts to \nillustrate this point.\n\n  First, the law has long been allowing the admission of excessive \nnumbers of legal immigrants. Let me show you this chart. This chart \nhere shows that the average number of immigrants in this country \nadmitted per year has climbed to about 900,000. You can look at the \nchart. From the 1930's to the 1990's, it is just in an upward spiral.\n  Additional legal immigration levels averaged about 300,000 per year \nuntil the 1965 Immigration Act. As this chart\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nindicates, this is the bulk of immigrants in our country. Three-fourths \nof the immigrants are legal immigrants. This is three times our level \nof illegal immigration. There is no other country in the world that has \na regular immigration system which admits so many people. Current law \nfails to consider if such a massive influx of foreign citizens is \nneeded in this country. It also fails to recognize the burden placed on \ntaxpayers for the immigrants' added costs for public services.\n  Excessive numbers of legal immigrants put a crippling strain on the \nAmerican education system. Non-English speaking immigrants cost \ntaxpayers 50 percent more in educational cost per child. Schools in \nhigh immigration communities are twice as crowded as those in low \nimmigration areas, as this next chart indicates.\n  Immigrants also put a strain on our criminal justice system. Foreign-\nborn felons make up 25 percent of our Federal prison inmates--25 \npercent, much higher than their real numbers.\n  Immigrants are 47 percent more likely to receive welfare than native-\nborn citizens. In 1990, the American taxpayers spent $16 billion more \nin welfare payments to immigrants than the immigrants paid back in \ntaxes. At a time when we have severe budget shortfalls at all levels of \ngovernment, our Federal immigration law continues to allow aliens to \nconsume the limited public assistance that our citizens need. Moreover, \nhigh levels of immigration cost Americans their jobs at a time when we \nhave millions of unemployed and underemployed citizens, and millions \nmore who will be needing jobs as they are weaned off of welfare. It is \nthose competing for lower skilled jobs who are particularly hurt in \nthis country. Most new legal immigrants are unskilled or low skilled, \nand they clearly take jobs native citizens otherwise would get.\n  Second, criteria to select who should be admitted does not \nincorporate, I believe, our country's best interests. As the next chart \nshows, who are the legal immigrants? Employment based is only 15 \npercent. Immediate relatives, 31 percent; other relatives, 27 percent; \n4 percent is relatives of people who were given amnesty under other \nlegislation. The others are refugees and asylees, 15 percent. The \ndiversity lottery, 5 percent.\n  But look at it again: Immediate relatives, 31 percent; other \nrelatives, 27 percent. Relatives predominate the immigration.\n  The 1965 Immigration Act provisions allow immigrants to bring in not \nonly their immediate family, Mr. President, such as their spouse and \nminor children, but also their extended family members, such as their \nmarried brothers and sisters who then can bring in their own extended \nfamily. The brother's wife can sponsor her own brothers and sisters, \nand so forth. This has resulted in the so-called chain migration we \nhave been talking about, whereby essentially endless and ever-expanding \nchains or webs of distant relatives are admitted based on the original \nsingle immigrant's admission. This can be 50, 60, or more people. I \nbelieve this is wrong, and it must be stopped.\n  Immigrants should be allowed to bring in their nuclear family--that \nis, their spouse and minor children--but not, Mr. President, an \nextended chain of distant relatives.\n  Some opponents of reforming legal immigration who are fighting \ndesperately to continue the status quo will say that only a radical or \neven reactionary people favor major changes in the immigration area. \nHowever, bringing our legal immigration system back under control and \nmaking it more in accord with our national interest is far from \nadequate, I submit.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the bipartisan U.S. Immigration \nReform Commission, under the leadership of the late former \nCongresswoman Barbara Jordan, recommended fundamental reforms in the \ncurrent legal immigration system, and the overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people want changes in our legal immigration system. I \ncertainly would not consider mainstream America radical or reactionary.\n  The next chart shows that the results of a recently released national \nRoper Poll on immigration are dramatic:\n  More than 83 percent of Americans favor lower immigration levels: 70 \npercent favor keeping immigration levels below 300,000 per year; 54 \npercent want immigration cut below 100,000 per year; 20 percent favor \nhaving no immigration at all;\n  Only 2 percent--only 2 percent, Mr. President--favor keeping \nimmigration at the current levels.\n  I believe we should and I believe we must listen to the American \npeople on this vital issue. If we care what most people think, and we \nshould, and if we care about what is best for our country, I believe we \nwill reduce legal immigration substantially by ending chain migration \nand giving much greater weight to immigrants' job skills and our own \nemployment needs.\n  Mr. President, I support the Simpson amendment, which I am \ncosponsoring, to begin reducing legal immigration.\n\n\n                           Only Initial Step\n\n  I emphasize ``begin'' because the amendment is but a first step \ntoward the fundamental reform and major reductions in legal immigration \nthat we need. I would like us to do much more now. Congress should pass \ncomprehensive legal immigration reform legislation this year instead of \nadopting only a modest temporary reduction. Even as an interim step, I \nwould prefer tougher legislation, like S. 160, a bill that I proposed \nearlier. That bill would give us a 5-year timeout for immigrants to \nassimilate while cutting yearly legal immigration down to around \n325,000, which was roughly our historical average until the 1965 \nImmigration Act got us off track.\n  Nevertheless, I am a realist and have served in this body long enough \nto know that the needed deeper cuts and broader reforms cannot be \nadopted before the next Congress. This is a Presidential election year \nand the time available in our crowded legislative schedule is quite \nlimited. Most attention has been focused until recently on the problems \nassociated with illegal immigration, and many Members have not yet been \nable to study legal immigration in the depth that is needed to make \ntruly informed and wise decisions. The House has already voted to defer \naction on legal immigration reforms. Moreover, the separate legal \nimmigration bill recently reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee is \ncontroversial and fails to provide a proper framework for real reform. \nThe committee's bill disregards most of the widely acclaimed \nrecommendations of the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform \nmade under the able leadership of the late former Congresswoman Barbara \nJordan.\n  Let me take a moment to comment on the history of the committee's \nlegal immigration bill, S. 1665, because it is relevant to this \ndiscussion. Originally, Senator Simpson, chairman of the Immigration \nSubcommittee, took many of the key recommendations of the Jordan \nCommission, which spent 5 years studying every aspect of U.S. \nimmigration policy, and turned them into S. 1394, the Immigration \nReform Act of 1996. The bill, as Senator Simpson drafted it, set out \nmany very sensible reforms--reforms proposed by the Commission and \nwhich the American people overwhelmingly support. It would have \ninstituted a phased reduction in legal immigration, ended extended \nfamily chain migration and placed greater emphasis on selecting \nimmigrants based on their job skills and education while taking our \nlabor market needs more into account.\n  Unfortunately, the legal immigration bill that has been reported to \nus is radically different than the original Simpson legislation and the \nJordan Commission's recommendations. The American people want \nfundamental immigration reform, and yet the committee's bill gives us \nthe same old failed policies of the past 30 years, albeit in a \ndifferent package. Mr. President, supporters of that bill ought to be \nthankful that truth in advertising laws do not apply because what they \nare selling to the American people as immigration reform is anything \nbut. That bill not only fails to make such much needed recommended \nsystemic reforms, it actually increases legal immigration levels.\n  Given these circumstances, it is clear that major cuts and \ncomprehensive legal immigration reform will have to wait until the next \nCongress. Nevertheless, I believe that it is important to begin the \ndebate and to begin making at least some reductions in the numbers of \nlegal immigrants. This amendment's modest temporary reductions in\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\nlegal immigration appear to be about all that might be done this year. \nTherefore, I am supporting this amendment.\n\n\n                        Reform In 105th Congress\n\n  I want to make it clear, however, that in the next Congress I will \nfight very hard to ensure the enactment of the fundamental reforms \nneeded to restore common sense to our immigration system and to best \nserve our national interests. I intend to push for legislation \nincorporating many of the changes recommended by the Jordan Commission \nand other immigration experts.\n  I believe that while we must allow immigration by immediate nuclear \nfamily members of citizens and legal permanent residents, we must \nsignificantly reduce legal admission levels by eliminating many \npreference categories, especially those for extended relatives, as \nproposed by the Commission. Most of our legal immigrants are admitted \nthrough the family preference system put in place by the misconceived \n1965 Immigration Act. Admission is not on the basis of their job skills \nor our labor market needs. Only about 6 percent of our legal immigrants \nare admitted based on employment skills.\n\n\n                            Chain Migration\n\n  The 1965 act's provisions allow immigrants to bring in not only their \nimmediate family members--such as their spouse and minor children--but \nafter they become citizens they also may sponsor their extended family \nmembers--such as their married brothers and sisters--who then \nsubsequently can bring in their own extended family. For example, the \nbrother's wife can sponsor her own brothers and sisters, and so on. \nThis has resulted in the so-called ``chain migration'' effect whereby \nessentially endless and ever-expanding chains or webs of more distant \nrelatives are admitted based on the original single immigrant's \nadmission. This can be 50, 60 or more people. This is wrong, and it \nmust be stopped. It creates ever-growing backlogs because the more \npeople we admit, the more become eligible to apply. Immigrants should \nbe allowed to bring in their nuclear family (e.g., spouse and minor \nchildren), but not an extended chain of more distance relatives. In \naddition, we must give greater priority to immigrants' employment \nskills and our labor needs when we reform admission criteria.\n  Proponents of high immigration levels argue that we must retain \nextended family admission preferences in order to protect family \nvalues. Well, let us remember, Mr. President, that when an immigrant \ncomes to this country, leaving behind parents, brothers, sisters, \nuncles, aunts, and cousins, it is the immigrant who is breaking up the \nextended family. Why does it become our responsibility to have a \nmechanism in place to undo what the immigrant himself has done? Why is \nit the responsibility of the American taxpayer who picks up the tab for \nso many legal immigration costs to have to let the immigrant bring more \nthan his or her immediate nuclear family here? Where do our obligations \nto new immigrants end? Apparently they never do in the minds of \nimmigrationists who advocate continuing an automatic admission \npreference for this ever-expanding mass of extended relatives. Each \ntime we admit a new immigrant to this country under our present system, \nwe are creating an entitlement for a whole new set of extended \nrelatives. For most, this means being added to the admission backlogs.\n\n\n                   Chain Migration Increases Backlogs\n\n  In that regard I want to observe that proponents of bringing in \nbacklogged relatives at an even faster rate claim that family chain \nmigration is largely a myth. I find this an astounding contention. The \nvery fact that in recent years we have developed a massive, ever \nincreasing backlog of extended relatives proves the point that chain \nmigration is a reality. As the committee's report on its legal \nimmigration bill, S. 1665, notes: ``Backlogs in all family-preference \nvisa categories combined have more than tripled in the past 15 years, \nrising from 1.1 million in 1981 to 3.6 million in 1996.'' Family chain \nmigration is real, and it's a real problem.\n\n\n             Confusion Between Legal And Illegal Immigrants\n\n  Mr. President, even the very modest reductions made in the pending \namendment are viewed as unnecessary by those who favor retaining high \nlevels of legal immigration. They have been saying that legal and \nillegal immigration provisions should not be considered together \nbecause there is confusion between legal and illegal. They say that \nCongress might let concerns over illegal immigration taint its view on \nhow legal immigration should be handled, and that this could lead \nunjustly to reductions in legal numbers.\n  Well, after talking about immigration with many citizens in Alabama \nand elsewhere, I must admit that I have found that there is in fact \nconsiderable public confusion about legals and illegals. Furthermore, I \nagree that this is affecting how Congress is dealing with these issues, \nbut the effect is not what immigrationists think. Ironically, the \nconfusion is greatly benefiting the special interest immigration \nadvocates and their congressional allies and undercutting the efforts \nof those of us who believe that major cuts in legal immigrant numbers \nand other reforms must be made. Concerns and confusion over illegal \nimmigration actually are keeping Congress from making the large cuts in \nlegal admission that otherwise clearly would be made this year. Let me \nexplain why.\n  What I have found in repeated discussions with citizens from all \ntypes of backgrounds is that they are overwhelmingly concerned about \nthe high numbers of new immigrants moving to our country. However, most \npeople are under the mistaken impression that almost all of the recent \nimmigrants came here illegally. When you explain to them that in fact \nthat about three-fourths of the immigrants in the last decade are legal \nimmigrants they are shocked. At first, they can't believe that Congress \nhas passed laws letting millions of new people come here legally. Then, \nI have found that the shock and disbelief of most individuals I talked \nto quickly turns to outrage and anger, and they start demanding that \nCongress change its policy and slash legal admissions.\n  Thus, Mr. President, what I have found convinces me that most of our \nconstituents are really just as upset about legal immigrants as they \nare about illegal ones. However, they frequently have only been voicing \ntheir concerns in terms of illegal aliens because they did not realize \nthat the people they are upset about actually were here legally.\n\n\n                Legal And Illegal Immigration Are Linked\n\n  High immigration advocates also have argued that there is no link \nbetween legal and illegal immigration and that amendments relating to \nlegal immigration are not appropriate to the illegal reform bill we are \nnow debating. I strongly disagree. Legal and illegal immigration are \nclosely linked and interrelated.\n\n\n                     Legal Provisions Now Included\n\n  First, with respect to the linkage of legal and illegal immigration, \nMr. President, let me also remind my colleagues that the so-called \nillegal immigration bill that we are debating already contains \nimportant provisions relating to legal immigration like those imposing \nfinancial responsibility on sponsors of legal immigrants. Thus, it \nclearly is appropriate to consider the pending amendment to reduce \nlegal immigration.\n\n\n                         Legal Fosters Illegal\n\n  Our current legal admissions system makes literally millions of \npeople eligible to apply, and therefore causes them to have an \nexpectation of eventual lawful admission. But, the law necessarily \nlimits annual admission numbers for most categories and massive \nbacklogs have developed. By allowing far more people to qualify to \napply for admission than can possibly be admitted within a reasonable \ntime under the law's yearly limits, the present law guarantees \nbacklogs. It can take 20 years or longer for an immigrant's admission \nturn to come up. This then encourages thousands of aliens to come here \nillegally. Some come illegally because they know that under current law \nthey either have no reasonable chance for admission or they will have \nto wait many years for admission given the backlogs.\n\n\n                 Illegals Can Legalize Without Penalty\n\n  It is important to note that our current law does not disqualify \nthose who come illegally from later begin granted legal admission. \nTherefore, illegals often feel they have nothing to lose\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\nand everything to gain by jumping ahead of the line. In short, our \nlegal immigration process has the perverse effect of encouraging \nillegal immigration. Even though we granted amnesty to legalize over 3 \nmillion illegal aliens in 1986, today well over 4 million--and quite \npossibly over 5 million--illegal aliens now reside in the United States \nHundreds of thousands of the new illegal immigrants later will be \ngetting a legal visa when their number eventually comes up through the \nextended family preference system. Many of these illegals--ho I remind \nyou have broken the law, and who everyone in Congress seems to be so \nconcerned about--thus will become legal immigrants. Magically, it would \nseem the bad guys become the good guys and all problems go away. Mr. \nPresident, how can this be? How can anyone honestly say the legal and \nillegal issues are not very intertwined and linked together?\n\n\n                        Illegal Increases Legal\n\n  In another paradoxical result of our current flawed system, illegal \nimmigration also tends to increase legal immigration. How? Well, look \nat the situation under the 1986 amendments. The 3 million illegals who \nreceived amnesty were allowed to become legal, thereby increasing the \nnumber of legal immigrants. And, after becoming legal residents and \ncitizens, what have these former illegals done? After being transformed \ninto good guys by legalization, they have played by the rules, as \nflawed as the rules are, and petitioned to bring in huge numbers of \nadditional legal immigrants who are the relatives of these legalized \nillegal aliens. This greatly increases the backlogs. The Jordan \nCommission found that about 80 percent of the backlogged immediate \nfamily relatives are eligible because of their relationship with a \nformer illegal alien. And, as the backlogs grow, Congress is asked to \nraise admission levels by special backlog reduction programs, which \nwill then increase the number of legal aliens.\n  Thus, we have an integral process here where the legal system works \nso as to guarantee backlogs which in turn lead to special additional \nadmission programs and to more illegals who, after a while, may be \nlegalized and then become eligible to bring in more relatives legally. \nMany of the new legal applicants in each cycle are then thrown into the \nbacklogs so the process can repeat itself. Many of the applicant's \nrelatives also will come here illegally to live, work and go to school \nwhile waiting to legalize.\n\n\n                       Legal Has Similar Impacts\n\n  Legal immigration is also linked to illegal immigration because it \nhas many of the same impacts. Both legal and illegal immigration \ninvolve large numbers of additional people, with legal in fact \naccounting for nearly three times more new U.S. residents every year \nthan illegal immigration. Many of my colleagues have expressed grave \nconcerns about illegal immigrants taking jobs from Americans, or these \nimmigrants committing crimes, or costing taxpayers and State and local \ngovernments millions for public education and welfare and other public \nassistance. Well, as I will point out later in detail, it is time to \nrecognize that legal immigrants often cause these same types of adverse \nimpacts. Congress must stop overlooking or disregarding this patently \nobvious fact. Let there be no mistake we will not solve most of our \nnational immigration problem by just dealing with illegal immigration. \nLegal immigration is in many ways an even greater part of the problem.\n\n\n                            Florida Example\n\n  Often, the adverse impacts of legal immigration actually will be much \ngreater than illegal because so many more people are involved. For \nexample, consider the situation in the State of Florida. As my \ncolleagues know all too well, especially those who are concerned with \nunfunded Federal mandates, the Governors of high immigration States \nlike Florida have been coming to Congress for the last several years \ndemanding billions of dollars in reimbursements for their States' \nimmigration-related costs. Governor Lawton Chiles, a former \ndistinguished Member of this body, presented testimony in 1994 to the \nSenate Appropriations Committee asking for such reimbursement. Governor \nChiles' detailed cost analysis showed that in 1993 Florida's State and \nlocal governments had net--not gross--immigration costs of $2.5 \nbillion. About two-thirds of this cost--$1.6 billion--came from legal \nimmigration. That's right, listen up everyone, legal immigrants were \nresponsible for two-thirds of Florida's immigration costs. Florida's \npublic education costs alone from legal immigrants came to about $517 \nmillion that year. So, my colleagues, we must face the facts that many \nconcerns being raised apply with equal or greater force to legal \nimmigration and that legal and illegal immigration are interrelated.\n\n\n              Neither Immigrant Bashing Nor Glorification\n\n  While I do not condone unjustified immigrant bashing, neither do I \nsubscribe to much of the one-sided emotional immigrant glorification \nand mythology that so often permeates the legal immigration debate. \nSupporters of high immigration levels often appear to be saying that \nlegal immigrants are much smarter than citizens and that almost all are \nharder working, more law abiding and have stronger family values than \nnative-born Americans. They imply that we do not support family values \nif we do not support allowing every immigrant who comes here to later \nbring his or her entire extended family of perhaps 50 or more \nrelatives. Immigrationists also tend to see only positive benefits from \nlegal immigration and to disregard or downplay any negatives.\n\n\n           Both Positive And Negative Impacts Must Be Weighed\n\n  Well, Mr. President, this Senator believes that Congress has the \nresponsibility to weigh both the positive and negative aspects of \nimmigration and to factor in our national needs and citizens' interests \nwhen setting legal admissions levels and procedures. Yes, we should \nconsider the positive contributions made by immigrants, and the fact \nthat legal immigrants pay taxes to help defray some of our immigrant-\nrelated costs. However, we also need to consider the impacts on \nAmerican families when one or both parents loses job opportunities to \nlegal immigrants, or when a parent's wages are depressed by cheap \nimmigrant labor. We need to consider the impacts on American \nschoolchildren of having hundreds of millions of dollars diverted from \nother educational needs to pay for special English-language instruction \nor scholarships for children from recent immigrant families. We need to \nconsider the impacts on America's senior citizens and our needy native-\nborn people who are unable to obtain nearly the level of public \nassistance they require because billions are going to pay for benefits \nfor millions of legal immigrants. We need to consider the impact of \nlegal immigration-related unfunded mandates on State and local \ngovernments and taxpayers, especially in high immigration areas like \nFlorida and California. And, we need to remember that many immigrants \nwho do pay taxes are paying relatively little because they are making \nvery low wages, and thus do not necessarily pay taxes at a level that \nwill cover nearly all of their costs.\n\n\n                   Legal Immigration Should Continue\n\n  The central question that Congress must decide is not whether we \nshould continue legal immigration. Of course we should. The problem is \nnot that legal immigrants or legal immigration are bad per se. They are \nnot. We are a Nation of immigrants, and immigrants have made great \ncontributions to our country. Immigration is an integral part of our \nheritage, and it should continue. However, while immigrants bring us \nmany benefits, but they also bring certain added costs and other \nadverse impacts. Furthermore, we do not have unlimited capacity to \naccept new immigrants.\n\n\n                      What Level And What Criteria\n\n  The ultimate question that Congress must face here is what level of \nlegal immigration is most consistent with our resources and needs, and \nwhat criteria should be used to pick those who are admitted. After \nstudying this question, I am convinced that our current legal \nimmigration law is fundamentally flawed. The heart of the problem is \ntwofold: First, the present law has for years allowed the admission of \nexcessive numbers of legal immigrants; and second, the selection \ncriteria are discriminatory and skewed so as to disregard what's in our \ncountry's overall best interests.\n\n\n                        Dramatic Legal Increases\n\n  The current immigration system, based on the 1965 Immigration Act, \nhas allowed legal immigration levels to\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\nskyrocket. Legal immigration has grown dramatically in recent decades \nafter the 1965 Immigration Act. We have been averaging 970,000 legal \nimmigrants--that's nearly 1 million people legally every year--during \nthe last decade! When you add in the 300,000 plus illegal immigrants \nwho move here every year, this means we are taking well over a million \nimmigrants a year.\n  We now have over 23 million foreign-born individuals residing in the \nUnited States, both legally and illegally. This translates to 1 in 11 \nU.S. residents being foreign-born, the largest percentage since the \nDepression. Immigrants cause 50 percent of our Nation's population \ngrowth today and will be responsible for 60 percent of the U.S. \npopulation increase that is expected in the next 55 years if \nour immigration laws are not reformed.\n\n  Before commenting further on our high levels of immigration, let me \nbriefly explain why the 1965 act is discriminatory. Most immigration \nunder the act occurs through the family preference system. In the early \nyears after the act was passed, a few countries were then the primary \nimmigrant sending countries. After a few years, immigrants from those \nnations were able to petition for admission of more and more relatives. \nThese relatives from those countries came and in turn sponsored other \nrelatives from those countries, further expanding the immigrant flow \nfrom these sending countries. As a practical matter, few immigrants can \nnow be admitted other than on the basis of a family relationship so new \nimmigrants tend to come from the same countries where their earlier \nfamily members came from.\n  This means that there is a de facto discrimination both against \nadmitting immigrants from other countries and against immigrants from \neven the favored nations unless they happen to be a relative of other \nrecent U.S. immigrants. Would-be non-relative immigrants can be much \nbetter educated and higher skilled, but unless they qualify under the \nmuch more limited employment categories, they need not apply because \nunder the 1965 act's nepotistic system the admission quotas go to \nrelatives.\n  Well, Mr. President, I strongly believe that it's long past time for \nCongress to recognize the 1965 act's flaws and to readjust the \nstatutory process so that we have far lower legal admission levels and \nfairer admission criteria that are more closely keyed to our national \nneeds and interests. Some of my colleagues and I will probably disagree \nat least on the numbers of immigrants to be allowed, but I would hope \nthat most will at least agree that an issue of such overriding and \nstrategic importance to the future of our country merits their careful \nand detailed consideration. Our Nation should not be changed so \nfundamentally without Congress debating the issue and making a \nconscious, informed decision on how immigration should be allowed so as \nto best promote and protect our national interests.\n\n\n                Not Like Traditional Immigration Levels\n\n  Historically, except for a brief 15-year period around 1900, our \nlegal immigration levels have been much lower than what we have \nexperienced after the 1965 act and its subsequent amendments. Many of \nmy colleagues may be surprised by this fact because immigration \nmythology may have led them to believe that high levels of immigration \nlike we have experienced in recent years are typical or traditional \nthroughout American history. Well, quite the opposite is true.\n  During the 50-year period from 1915 through 1964, for example, legal \nimmigration levels averaged only about 220,000 annually. From 1820 when \nour formal immigration records were begun until 1965, it averaged only \nabout 300,000, including the unusually high years around 1900. From \n1946 to 1955, it averaged about 195,000 annually; then from 1956 to \n1965, it was averaging roughly 288,000 yearly. With the passage of the \n1965 Act, the numbers began to skyrocket: from 1966 to 1975, the yearly \naverage became 381,000; then from 1976 to 1985 it hit 542,000; and for \nthe last decade from 1986 through 1995, legal immigration on average \nhit about 970,000 yearly.\n  The post-1965 act constant high legal immigrant influx is radically \ndifferent than our historical pattern. Another important aspect of our \nlegal immigration problem is that there have been no immigration \ntimeouts or break periods for the last 30 years to give immigrants time \nto assimilate and be Americanized.\n  Even with the ending of legalizations under the 1986 amnesty law, the \nlegal numbers are still very high. And, this huge wave of immigrants \nhas helped fuel the application backlogs which now run around 3.6 \nmillion. Some apologists for high immigration numbers say that since \nlegal immigration has averaged somewhat lower for the last couple of \nyears, we are on a significant new downward trend. Well, we are not. \nRecent INS projections call for a large increase in legal immigration \nin fiscal year 1996, thanks largely to the current law's provisions \nallowing immigration by extended relatives of recent immigrants and the \neffects of family chain migration.\n\n\n                           Times Have Changed\n\n  Mr. President, not only are such extremely high immigration levels \nnot traditional, but it is important to realize that today times and \ncircumstances have changed dramatically so that it is far less \nappropriate to have either such high immigration or the limited skills \nmost current immigrants now bring us.\n\n\n                                  Then\n\n  In the good old days of yesteryear, we had a much smaller U.S. \npopulation and many more people were needed for settling the frontier \nand working in our factories. In earlier times, our economy also needed \nmostly low-skilled workers. We still had plenty of cheap land and \nresources. Quite significantly, we had no extensive taxpayer-funded \ngovernment safety net of public benefit programs for unsuccessful \nimmigrants to fall back on. Not surprisingly, 30 to 40 percent of our \nimmigrants returned to their homelands. Furthermore, our domestic \npopulation's cultural and ethnic heritages were more similar to those \nof new immigrants. More Americans then had large families because the \nhigh domestic birthrate was similar to that of new immigrant families. \nAnd, the melting pot concept was generally accepted and fostered \nassimilation. In addition, there were periodic lulls in immigrant \nadmission levels so as to allow for assimilation.\n\n\n                                  Now\n\n  Today, circumstances are quite different. Land and resource \navailability are much more limited and expensive. The United States now \nis a mature nation with a host of serious domestic difficulties, \neconomic problems, chronic unemployment, crime, millions of needy, and \nso forth. Our population has grown many times over. In fact, the United \nStates now doesn't need more people--we have no frontier to settle, and \nwe have plenty of workers. And, our economy has been undergoing \nfundamental structural changes. We have been restructuring toward a \nhigh-technology economy that needs higher skilled, more educated \nworkers to compete in the new global marketplace instead of unskilled \nor low-skilled immigrant labor. We now have a costly taxpayer-funded \nsafety net of government assistance that immigrants can rely on such as \nwelfare, AFDC, SSI, health care, and other benefit programs. Not \nsurprisingly, now only 10 to 20 percent return to their home country. \nAnd, multi-culturalism is favored over the ``melting pot\" concept by \nmany immigrant groups, making assimilation often much more difficult \nand slower. Instead of following our traditional course of enhancing \nour strengths by melding a common American culture out of immigrants' \ndiversity, multiculturalists now push to retain newcomers' different \ncultures.\n  Mr. President, yes, times and circumstances have changed. How many \nSenators would be willing to vote today to start voluntarily admitting \nthree-quarters of a million, or more, new people--most of whom are \npoor, unskilled or low-skilled and don't speak English--every year? I \ndare say that most of those who did so would face serious reelection \nproblems when outraged voters learned of their actions. Perhaps, this \nis why the Judiciary Committee's legal immigration bill uses admission \nassumptions that are much lower than recent INS projections. Perhaps, \nsome people hope to escape voters' wrath by claiming that they did not \nknow what's happening and what's obviously going to happen if we don't \nmake big cuts and other reforms. Whatever their reasoning, what\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\nwe are experiencing is legislative business as usual, catering to the \nhigh immigration and cheap labor lobbies when it comes to legal \nimmigration.\n\n\n                Time To Face Legal Immigration Realities\n\n  Well, my colleagues, we are paying a high price now for years of \nexcessive Federal spending and for using smoke and mirrors accounting \nto understate our budgetary problems. We are facing an analogous \nproblem here for having allowed both legal and illegal immigration \nlevels to be excessive for years, and for failing to acknowledge \ndifficulties caused by high legal immigration.\n  We simply must begin facing up to the real numbers and the problems \nassociated with admitting far too many new people through legal \nimmigration. About three-fourths of our immigration comes from legal \nimmigrants. That's three times our level of illegal immigration. Why \nare we trying to close the backdoor of illegal immigration and \nlamenting about all the impacts illegals are causing, but at the same \ntime disregarding the fact that the front door is open wider than ever? \nCongress must stop giving little or no thought to the obvious \ninterconnection between legal and illegal immigration and their similar \nadverse impacts. In the last Presidential campaign, there was a popular \nsaying ``It's the economy stupid!'' Well, with respect to the heart of \nour immigration problems it can be said ``It's the numbers stupid!''--\nwe get three times more numbers from legal immigration than illegal.\n\n\n                       Legal Immigration's Costs\n\n  Our current legal admissions policy fails to take into account \nwhether such a massive influx of newcomers is needed, or the burdens \nplaced on taxpayers for the immigrants' added costs for public \neducation, health care, welfare, criminal justice, infrastructure and \nvarious other services and forms of public assistance. Let me highlight \nsome of these costs:\n  Education--For example, excessive numbers of legal immigrants are \nputting a crippling strain on America's education system. About one-\nthird of our immigrants are public school aged. Immigrant children and \nthe children of recent immigrants are greatly increasing school \nenrollments and adding significantly to school costs in many areas.\n  Schools in many high immigration communities are twice as crowded as \nthose in low immigration cities.\n  In 1995, the Miami public school system was getting new foreign \nstudents at a rate of 120 per day, and as I noted earlier, Florida's \ncosts in 1993 for legal immigrant education came to over half a billion \ndollars.\n  Hundreds of thousands of children from immigrant families speak \nlittle or no English. This causes a tremendous increase in education \ncosts and diverts limited dollars that are needed elsewhere in our \nschool systems. English as a Second Language programs are very \nexpensive. Non-English speaking immigrant children cost taxpayers 50 \npercent more in education costs per child.\n  Welfare--Legal immigrants, who make up the largest part of our \nforeign-born population, also are costing billions for various forms of \npublic assistance:\n  According to the GAO, about 30 percent of all U.S. immigrants are \nliving in poverty. The GAO has found that legal immigrants received \nmost of the $1.2 billion in AFDC benefits that went to immigrants.\n  Immigrants now take 45 percent of all the SSI funds spent on the \nelderly according to the GAO. In 1983, only 3.3 percent of legal \nresident aliens received SSI, but in 1993 this figure jumped to 11.5 \npercent; 128,000 in 1983 vs. 738,000 by 1994. This is a 580 percent \nincrease in just 12 years.\n  The House Ways and Means Committee indicates that in 1996, around \n990,000 resident aliens--who are non-citizens--are receiving SSI and \nMedicaid benefits, costing $5.1 billion for SSI and another $9.3 \nbillion for Medicaid, for a total of $14.4 billion. The committee \nprojects that this cost for legal immigrants will jump to over $67 \nbillion a year by 2004.\n  As our colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, has pointed out, \nonly about 40 percent of our immigrants are covered by health \ninsurance, and therefore immigrants have to rely heavily on taxpayer \nfunded public health services.\n  Recent analysis by Prof. George Borjas of Harvard University of new \nCensus Bureau data also has confirmed immigrants are using more public \nbenefits. Borjas points out that immigrant households were less likely \nthan native-born Americans to receive welfare in 1970. However, his \nanalysis shows that today immigrant households are almost 50 percent \nmore likely to receive cash and non-cash public assistance--they are \nabout 50 percent more likely to receive AFDC; 75 percent more likely to \nreceive SSI; 64 percent more likely to receive Medicaid; 42 percent \nmore likely to receive food stamps; and 27 percent more likely to \nreceive public housing assistance.\n  Borjas also notes that 22 percent of the California's households are \nimmigrants, but they get 40 percent of the public benefits; that 9 \npercent of Texas' households are immigrants, but they get 22 percent of \nthe public assistance; and that 16 percent of New York's households are \nimmigrants, but they get 22 percent of the public assistance benefits.\n  Jobs--At a time when we have millions of unemployed and underemployed \nAmerican citizens--and millions more who will be needing jobs as they \nare weaned off welfare--our Federal immigration law continues to allow \nin a flood of foreigners to depress wages and take jobs that our own \ncitizens need. While corporate cheap labor interests profit, it is \nAmerican workers who suffer, especially those who are competing for \nlower skilled jobs. Most new legal immigrants are unskilled or low-\nskilled, and they clearly take many jobs native citizens otherwise \nwould get.\n  Dr. Frank Morris, a noted African-American professor, pointed out in \nHouse testimony last year that immigration is having disproportionate \nadverse impacts on American blacks as follows:\n\n       There can be no doubt that our current practice of \n     permitting more than a million legal and illegal immigrants a \n     year into the US into our already difficult low skill \n     labor markets clearly leads to both wage depression and \n     the de facto displacement of African American workers with \n     low skills. . .. The American labor market is not exempt \n     from the laws of supply and demand. If the supply of \n     labor, especially unskilled labor, increases in markets \n     where significant numbers of African Americans reside for \n     any reason, you have either a wage depression or labor \n     substitution effect upon African Americans, who because we \n     have less education, work experience and small business \n     creation rates than other Americans, are \n     disproportionately negatively impacted in those markets. . \n     .. America is the only country in the world that has mass \n     immigration at a time of slow growth, and industrial \n     restructuring of the economy. African Americans are \n     disproportionately hurt by this process because almost \n     half of all immigrants head for cities that also have a \n     large number of African American residents searching and \n     fighting for better low rent housing, better low skill \n     requirement but high paying jobs, and better public school \n     education for their offspring.\n\n  Secretary of Labor Reich in testimony regarding needed immigration \nreforms on September 28, 1995 before the Senate's Subcommittee on \nImmigration commented on the ``fundamental question of what purpose our \nemployment- or skill-based immigration policy is meant to serve'' as \nfollows:\n\n       This nation of immigrants always has and always will \n     welcome new members into the American family, though at a \n     different pace and in different ways to suit the times. . .. \n     Employment-based immigration to fill skill shortages, as well \n     as the temporary admission of selected skilled foreign \n     workers, is sometimes unavoidable. But I firmly believe that \n     hiring foreign over domestic workers should be the rare \n     exception, not the rule. And I believe such exceptions should \n     be even rarer, and more tightly targeted on gaps in the \n     domestic labor market than is generally the case under \n     current policy. . .. If employers must turn to foreign labor, \n     this is a symptom signaling defects in America's skill-\n     building system. Our system for giving employers access to \n     global markets should be structured to remedy such defects, \n     not acquiesce in them. And it should progressively diminish, \n     not merely perpetuate, firms' dependence on the skills of \n     foreign workers.\n\n  Crime--Immigrants also put a strain on our criminal justice system--\nover 25 percent of the Federal prison inmates are foreign-born. This is \nclearly very disproportionate to immigrants' percentage of our general \npopulation, which is about 9 percent. Large numbers of these criminal \naliens were admitted legally. It cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of \ndollars just to incarcerate them.\n  After an extensive study, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations reported in April 1995 that:\n\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\n\n       Aliens now account for over 25 percent of Federal prison \n     inmates and represent the fastest growing segment of Federal \n     prison population. A conservative estimate is that there are \n     450,000 aliens who have been convicted of a crime and who are \n     in prison, in jail, on probation or on parole in the United \n     States. Criminal aliens not only occupy beds in our prisons \n     and jails, they also occupy the time and resources of law \n     enforcement and our courts.\n\n  Mr. President, I say that we must recognize such negative impacts \nfrom excessive levels of legal immigration, and that we have a moral \nobligation to take care of American citizens first. We certainly cannot \ndo so without making drastic cuts in legal immigration numbers. We also \nmust change the criteria to give much more emphasis to immigrants' \nskills and our changing labor needs.\n\n\n           Responsible, Reasonable Legal Immigration Reforms\n\n  Many opponents of reforming legal immigration who are fighting \ndesperately to continue the status quo say that only radical or even \nreactionary people favor major changes in this area. Their contentions \nare erroneous. Bringing our legal immigration system back under control \nand making it more in accord with our national interests is far from \nradical.\n  Let me remind my colleagues again that the bipartisan U.S. \nImmigration Reform Commission, under the leadership of the late former \nCongresswoman Barbara Jordan, has recommended fundamental reforms in \nthe current legal immigration system. The Commission's recommendations \nincluded substantial reductions in legal admission levels and \nabolishing a number of admission categories including brothers and \nsisters of citizens and adult children of permanent residents. Surely, \nproposing such fundamental changes because they concluded this would be \nin our national interest does not mean that distinguished Americans \nlike Barbara Jordan are radical or reactionary.\n  Moreover, the overwhelming majority of the American people certainly \nare not radical or reactionary, and they clearly want Congress to \ndramatically reduce legal immigration numbers. And dramatic is perhaps \nthe best way of describing the results of a recently released national \nRoper Poll on immigration. This Roper Poll found over 83 percent of \nAmericans favor lower immigration levels. Seventy percent favor keeping \noverall immigration below 300,000 per year, and this view is supported \ngenerally across racial, ethnic, and other lines--52 percent of \nHispanics, 73 percent of blacks, 72 percent of Democrats and 70 percent \nof Republicans. A majority of the public--54 percent--want immigration \ncut below 100,000 per year; and 20 percent favor having no immigration \nat all. Even reform opponents were surprised to learn that only 2 \npercent favor keeping the current levels. It should be noted that the \nquestions used in this poll specifically advised respondents that \ncurrent levels of legal and illegal immigration totaled over 1,000,000 \nnew immigrants per year. The people's answers stated the immigration \nlevels they favored for all immigration, including both legal and \nillegal. While this new Roper Poll is consistent with many earlier \npolls, it shows even stronger public sentiment on these issues. Thus, \nit is clear that the public wants dramatically lower legal immigration.\n  Mr. President, we must listen to the American people on this vital \nissue. If we care what our constituents think, if we truly want to \nrepresent their views, and if we care about doing what's best for our \ncountry, we will cut legal immigration substantially and we will make \nother fundamental changes in the system to end chain migration by \nextended family members and to give much greater weight to immigrants' \neducation and skills and our employment needs. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment to begin to make the responsible, \nreasonable reforms needed in our legal immigration policies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several articles showing \nthe need for immigration reform be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the San Diego Union Tribune, Apr. 24]\n\n                            Border Surprise\n\n       Washington.--Despite contentions by President Clinton's \n     administration that legal immigration is tapering off under \n     existing law, the flow is expected to soar by 41 percent this \n     year over 1995 and remain substantially above last year's \n     level for the foreseeable future.\n       This forecast comes from unreleased data compiled by the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).\n       The projections, obtained by Capley News News Service, \n     triggered an outcry yesterday from advocates of tougher \n     restrictions on legal immigration. They responded to the \n     disclosures by charging that the INS had intentionally misled \n     Congress and the public during this year's stormy debate over \n     whether to cut legal immigration.\n       The projections show immigration rising from 593,000 last \n     year to 835,000 this year and 853,000 in 1997. The overall \n     numbers actually will be about 100,000 higher because the \n     projections do not include refugees and several other groups \n     of people admitted legally.\n       For that reason, the overall number for next year is \n     expected to be closer to 1 million than to 853,000.\n       At a key moment in the congressional debate the INS held a \n     press conference during which it stressed the downward trend \n     in the immigration levels during the past two years. The \n     officials failed to disclose the agency's forecast showing \n     the huge surge beginning this year.\n       If the law remains substantially unchanged as appears \n     likely at this point, the average annual level of legal \n     immigration over the next eight years would be about 29 \n     percent higher than in 1995.\n       They clearly misled the American people and Congress, \n     knowing they were telling part of the truth but not the whole \n     truth,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith R-Texas, chairman of the House \n     Immigration subcommittee.\n       ``It's inexcusable, and what it really says is, `How can we \n     believe what they say again when it comes to immigration \n     figures?' ''\n       Smith led a failed 16-month drive in the House to cut legal \n     immigration. It was defeated earlier this month.\n       A White House spokeswoman said she could not comment on \n     internal INS projections she had not seen. But she said the \n     notion that legal immigration would rise sharply was \n     inconsistent with what INS officials had told her.\n       A senior INS official denied any effort on the part of the \n     agency to mislead Congress, saying agency officials had \n     testified on Capitol Hill that they expected immigration \n     levels to rise--not fall--under current law.\n       Robert Bach, executive associate commissioner for policy \n     and planning of the INS, briefed reporters hours before a \n     pivotal March 28 Senate vote and stressed the declines in \n     immigration during fiscal years 1994 and 1995. The report he \n     released that day also was circulated widely on Capitol Hill.\n       Yesterday, Bach said there had been no effort to mislead \n     reporters.\n       He said that ``we reported on what was'' in the two \n     previous years.\n       ``We didn't spin the future,'' Bach said.\n       He said that ``it was a straightforward report'' on what \n     happened in 1994 and 1995.\n       But Smith disagreed.\n       ``They (INS officials) justified their position in \n     supporting an amendment to take out legal immigration reform \n     by saying the numbers were coming down anyway,'' he said. \n     ``And they knew the numbers would be jumping up as they were \n     speaking.''\n       Restrictionsists including Smith argue that current levels \n     of legal immigration have placed economic burdens on states \n     such as California, Texas, Florida, New York and New Jersey \n     where most immigrants reside. They also say immigrants \n     increase the competition that low-skill domestic workers face \n     for low-wage jobs.\n       Immigration advocates argue that the burdens of legal \n     immigration are exaggerated and that, overall, it is good for \n     America. Some of them attribute restrictionist sentiment to \n     racism and xenophobia.\n       Clinton had endorsed a controversial 1995 recommendation by \n     the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform to significantly \n     cut legal immigration. But his administration has quietly \n     lobbied against the congressional initiatives, saying they go \n     too far. And it provided a crucial and possibly fatal blow to \n     reform efforts in the House by coming out in support of the \n     amendment that killed legal immigration reform there earlier \n     this month.\n       An effort by Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., chairman of the \n     Senate immigration subcommittee, also was defeated. Instead, \n     the Judiciary Committee approved an amendment by Sens. \n     Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.\n       Their proposal is the only legal immigration legislative \n     initiative that remains alive in Congress. No date has been \n     set for it to be debated on the Senate floor.\n       The INS predicts that immigration under the Abraham-Kennedy \n     provision would decline by 4,000 from current law, or less \n     than .5 percent. That means the 29 percent higher levels \n     forecast for the next eight years would occur even under the \n     Abraham-Kennedy plan. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., voted \n     for the amendment after being assured by its authors that it \n     would entail significant cuts.\n       Feinstein has said California needs cuts in legal \n     immigration. But she was unavailable Monday or yesterday to \n     comment on the INS projections.\n       Those projections show that legal immigration even under \n     the scuttled Simpson provisions--the most restrictive of the \n     proposals--would have been 7.5 percent higher over the next \n     eight years than last year's level.\n       The immigration surge is attributed to the rougly 3 million \n     people legalized under the\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\n     1986 overhaul of the nation's immigration laws. Many have \n     become citizens and are petitioning for the immediate and \n     unlimited admission of their spouses, minor children and \n     parents.\n       ``It's very clear that INS is trying to play down these \n     (rising immigration) numbers as much as possible,'' said \n     Rosemary Jenks of the Center for Immigration Studies. ``It's \n     just amazing what information the INS decides to leave in or \n     leave out or present or not present. And there's no reason \n     for it other than to affect the current congressional \n     immigration debate.''\n       Immigration advocacy groups, which were allies with the INS \n     in the effort to defeat the legislative reforms, said they \n     had been waryed how the INS used its figures.\n       ``We never made a big deal about the declines (in 1994 and \n     1995); the INS did,'' said Frank Sharry, head of the National \n     Immigration Forum, which has played a key role in the \n     campaign to block substantial cuts in legal immigration. ``We \n     always knew the numbers would spike up.''\n       But Sharry insisted that the INS projections overstated \n     both the extent and the duration of the surge. He called the \n     INS projections ``laughable.''\n       ``This will be a one-time blip that will occur over the \n     next few years,'' he said. ``We're quibbling over rather \n     small differences based on questionable projections that are \n     being (politically) spun by restrictionists to bring about a \n     major reduction in immigration levels.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 19, 1996]\n\n                    Too Many Engineers, Too Few Jobs\n\n                       (By Michael S. Teitelbaum)\n\n       Is there such an acute shortage of skilled scientists and \n     engineers that America's computer industry and research \n     laboratories must recruit thousands of foreign workers yearly \n     in order to compete globally?\n       That's what Sun Microsystems, Intel, Microsoft, the \n     National Association of Manufacturers and the American \n     Immigration Lawyers Association would have you believe. They \n     successfully lobbied Congress to drop immigration reform \n     proposals that would have held down increases in the number \n     of highly skilled foreign workers. Statistics, however, \n     contradict them. There is no shortage of scientists, \n     engineers or software professionals. If anything, there is a \n     surplus.\n       Claims of an impending dearth of scientists and engineers \n     began a decade ago, when Erich Bloch, then the director of \n     the National Science Foundation, declared that unless action \n     was taken, there would be a cumulative shortfall of 675,000 \n     over the next two decades.\n       Congress responded. The National Science Foundation \n     received tens of millions of additional dollars for science \n     and engineering education. And in 1990, Congress nearly \n     tripled the number--to 140,000 per year--of employment-based \n     visas for immigrants with certain skills.\n       Not surprisingly, the number of science and engineering \n     doctorates reached record levels. From 1983 to 1993, the \n     annual number of Americans earning such Ph.D.'s increased 13 \n     percent. But the number of slots for graduate students grew \n     even more dramatically during that time--about 40 percent. \n     The excess spaces were filled by foreign students, who often \n     stayed in America to compete in the job market. Meanwhile, \n     the United States sharply increased the number of foreign-\n     born scientists and engineers it let in; 39,000 were \n     admitted in 1985, 82,000 in 1993.\n       The labor shortage never materialized. But global \n     competition rose and the cold war ended. High-tech \n     corporations and defense contractors were forced to downsize; \n     state budget crises forced large universities to sharply \n     reduce their hiring of new faculty.\n       Unemployment among scientists and engineers remains much \n     lower than for low-skilled workers, as it does for all highly \n     educated workers. Nonetheless, tens of thousands of highly \n     skilled professionals have been laid off. For instance, from \n     1991 through 1994, I.B.M. laid off 86,000 workers; AT, \n     Boeing and Hughes Aircraft laid off a total of 135,000 \n     workers.\n       It is an employer's market; stagnant or declining salaries \n     have been the trend. For instance, from 1968 through 1995, \n     the median annual salary, including benefits, for an engineer \n     with 10 years of experience declined 13 percent in constant \n     dollars, to $52,900. Meanwhile, salaries in other professions \n     like medicine and law greatly increased.\n       Job prospects for recently minted scientists and engineers \n     have plummeted. A 1995 study by Stanford University's \n     Institute for Higher Education Research concluded that ``too \n     many doctorates are being produced in engineering, math and \n     some sciences,'' not including biological and computer \n     sciences. It said: ``Overproduction, estimated to average at \n     least 25 percent, contradicts predictions of long-term \n     shortages, given current demand.''\n       Engineers and software professionals who have lost their \n     jobs could be easily retrained to the big high-tech \n     companies. However, there is no incentive to do so, as long \n     as they can easily hire from U.S.-educated foreign nationals.\n       As one software professional let go by a computer company \n     reported, he and his colleagues are ``disposable'' rather \n     than ``recyclable.''\n       In short, the situation is out of balance. A record number \n     of Ph.D.'s, but a weak job market. Claims of a labor \n     shortage, but stagnant or declining wages. Thousands of laid-\n     off professionals, but increased foreign recruitment. \n     Shortage or surplus? Ask any downsized engineer or computer \n     professional for the answer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the National Review, Mar. 11, 1996]\n\n                           The Welfare Magnet\n\n                           (By George Borjas)\n\n       The evidence has become overwhelming: immigrant \n     participation in welfare programs is on the rise. In 1970, \n     immigrant households were slightly less likely than native \n     households to receive cash benefits like AFDC (Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children) or SSI (Supplementary \n     Security Income). By 1990, immigrant households were more \n     likely to receive such cash benefits (9.1 per cent v. 7.4 per \n     cent). Pro-immigration lobbyists are increasingly falling \n     back on the excuse that this immigrant-native ``welfare gap'' \n     is attributable solely to refugees and/or elderly immigrants; \n     or that the gap is not numerically large. (Proportionately, \n     it's ``only'' 23 per cent).\n       But the Census does not provide any information about the \n     use of noncash transfers. These are programs like Food \n     Stamps, Medicaid, housing subsidies, and the myriad of other \n     subsidies that make up the modern welfare state. And noncash \n     transfers comprise over three quarters of the cost of all \n     means-tested entitlement programs. In 1991, the value of \n     these noncash transfers totaled about $140 billion.\n       Recently available data help provide a more complete \n     picture. The Survey of Income and Program Participation \n     (SIPP) samples randomly selected households about their \n     involvement in virtually all means-tested programs. From \n     this, the proportion of immigrant households that receive \n     benefits from any particular program can be calculated.\n       The results are striking. The ``welfare gap'' between \n     immigrants and natives is much larger when noncash transfers \n     are included [see table]. Taking all types of welfare \n     together, immigrant participation is 20.7 per cent. For \n     native born households, it's only 14.1 per cent--a gap of 6.6 \n     percentage points (proportionately, 47 per cent).\n       And the SIPP data also indicate that immigrants spend a \n     relatively large fraction of their time participating in some \n     means-tested program. In other words, the ``welfare gap'' \n     does not occur because many immigrant households receive \n     assistance for a short time, but because a significant \n     proportion--more than the native-born--receive assistance for \n     the long haul.\n       Finally, the SIPP data show that the types of welfare \n     benefits received by particular immigrant groups influence \n     the type of welfare benefits received by later immigrants \n     from the same group. Implication: there appear to be networks \n     operating within ethnic communities which transmit \n     information about the availability of particular types of \n     welfare to new arrivals.\n       The results are even more striking in detail. Immigrants \n     are more likely to participate in practically every one of \n     the major means-tested programs. In the early 1990s, the \n     typical immigrant family household had a 4.4 per cent \n     probability of receiving AFDC, v. 2.9 per cent of native-born \n     families.

Borjas and Lynette, Hilton, ``Immigration and the     \n  Welfare State: Immigrant Participation in Means-Tested Entitlement    \n  Programs,'' Quarterly Journal of Economics, forthcoming, May 1996.    \n\n       And that overall ``welfare gap'' becomes even wider if \n     immigrant families are compared to non-Hispanic white native-\n     born households. Immigrants are almost twice as likely to \n     receive some type of assistance--20.7 percent v. 10.5 \n     percent.\n       The SIPP data also allow us to calculate the dollar value \n     of the benefits disbursed to immigrant households, as \n     compared to the native-born. In the early 1990s, 8 percent of \n     households were foreign-born. These immigrant households \n     accounted for 13.8 percent of the cost of the programs. They \n     cost almost 75 percent more than their representation in the \n     population.\n       The disproportionate disbursement of benefits to immigrant \n     households is particularly acute in California, a state which \n     has both a lot of immigrants and very generous welfare \n     programs. Immigrants make up only 21 percent of the \n     households in California. But these households consume 39.5 \n     percent of all the benefit dollars distributed in the state. \n     It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that the welfare \n     problem in California is on the verge of becoming an \n     immigrant problem.\n       The pattern holds for other states. In Texas, where 89 \n     percent of households are\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\n     immigrant but which has less generous welfare, immigrants \n     receive 22 percent of benefits distributed. In New York \n     State, 16 percent of the households are immigrants. They \n     receive 22.2 percent of benefits.\n       The SIPP data track households over a 32-month period This \n     allows us to determine if immigrant welfare participation is \n     temporary--perhaps the result of dislocation and adjustment--\n     or long-term and possibly permanent.\n       The evidence is disturbing. During the early 1990s, nearly \n     a third (31.3 percent) of immigrant households participated \n     in welfare programs at some point in the tracking period. \n     Only just over a fifth (22.7 percent) of native-born \n     households did so. And 10.3 percent of immigrant households \n     received benefits through the entire period, v. 7.3 percent \n     of native-born households.\n       Because the Bureau of the Census began to collect the SIPP \n     data in 1984, we can use it to assess if there have been any \n     noticeable changes in immigrant welfare use. It turns out \n     there has been a very rapid rise.\n       During the mid-1980s, the probability that an immigrant \n     household received some type of assistance was 17.7 percent \n     v. 14.6 percent for natives, a gap of 3.1 percentage points. \n     By the early 1990s, recipient immigrant households had risen \n     to 20.7 percent, v. 14.1 percent for natives. The immigrant-\n     native ``welfare gap,'' therefore, more than doubled in less \n     than a decade.\n       Thus immigrants are not only more likely to have some \n     exposure to the welfare system; they are also more likely to \n     be ``permanent'' recipients. And the trend is getting worse. \n     Unless eligibility requirements are made much more stringent, \n     much of the welfare use that we see now in the immigrant \n     population may remain with us for some time. This raises \n     troubling questions about the impact of this long-term \n     dependency on the immigrants--and on their U.S.-born \n     children.\n       There is huge variation in welfare participation among \n     immigrant groups. For example, about 4.3 percent of \n     households originating in Germany, 26.8 percent of households \n     originating in Mexico, and 40.6 per cent of households \n     originating in the former Soviet Union are covered by \n     Medicaid. Similarly, about 17.2 per cent of households \n     originating in Italy, 36 per cent from Mexico and over 50 \n     per cent in the Dominican Republic received some sort of \n     welfare benefit.\n       A more careful look at these national-origin differentials \n     reveals an interesting pattern: national-origin groups tend \n     to ``major'' in particular types of benefit. For example, \n     Mexican immigrants are 50 per cent more likely to receive \n     energy assistance than Cuban immigrants. But Cubans are more \n     likely to receive housing benefits than Mexicans.\n       The SIPP data reveal a very strong positive correlation \n     between the probability that new arrivals belonging to a \n     particular immigrant group receive a particular type of \n     benefit, and the probability that earlier arrivals from the \n     same group received that type of assistance. This correlation \n     remains strong even after we control for the household's \n     demographic background, state of residence, and other \n     factors. And the effect is not small. A 10 percentage point \n     increase in the fraction of the existing immigrant stock who \n     receive benefits from a particular program implies about a 10 \n     per cent increase in the probability that a newly arrived \n     immigrant will receive those benefits.\n       This confirms anecdotal evidence. Writing in the New \n     Democrat--the mouthpiece of the Democratic Leadership \n     Council--Norman Matloff reports that ``a popular Chinese-\n     language book sold in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Chinese \n     bookstores in the United States includes a 36-page guide to \n     SSI and other welfare benefits'' and that the ``World \n     Journal, the largest Chinese-language newspaper in the United \n     States, runs a `Dear Abby'-style column on immigration \n     matters, with welfare dominating the discussion.''\n       And the argument that the immigrant-native ``welfare gap'' \n     is caused by refugees and/or elderly immigrants? We can check \n     its validity by removing from the calculations all immigrant \n     households that either originate in countries from which \n     refugees come or that contain any elderly persons.\n       Result: 17.3 per cent of this narrowly defined immigrant \n     population receives benefits, v. 13 per cent of native \n     households that do not contain any elderly persons. Welfare \n     gap: 4.3 percentage points (proportionately, 33 per cent). \n     The argument that the immigrant welfare problems is caused by \n     refugees and the elderly is factually incorrect.\n       Conservatives typically stress the costs of maintaining the \n     welfare state. But we must not delude ourselves into thinking \n     that nothing is gained from the provision of antibiotics to \n     sick children or from giving food to poor families.\n       At the same time, however, these welfare programs introduce \n     a cost which current calculations of the fiscal costs and \n     benefits of immigration do not acknowledge and which might \n     well dwarf the current fiscal expenditures. That cost can be \n     expressed as follows: To what extent does a generous welfare \n     state reduce the work incentives of current immigrants, and \n     change the nature of the immigrant flow by influencing \n     potential immigrants' decisions to come--and to stay?\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to oppose the \npending amendment, but at the outset, I want to compliment my \ncolleague, Senator Simpson, for the outstanding work that he has done \nfor so many years on this very important subject, and similarly to \ncompliment my colleague, Senator Kennedy, for his work in the \nimmigration field and for his work in Judiciary in general.\n  Senator Simpson has been intimately involved in immigration work for \nmore than a decade, going back to Simpson-Mazzoli. In my tenure in the \nSenate, Senator Simpson has taken on some of the toughest jobs which we \nhave had in this body. I talk about Senator Simpson in particular \nbecause he will be leaving us at the end of this year. It will be an \nenormous loss for the Senate and for the country.\n  The first extensive contacts I had with Senator Simpson were on the \nVeterans' Committee where we had a disagreement or two. I would \nfrequently cite the experience of my father, Harry Specter, who was a \nWorld War I veteran.\n  When Senator Simpson came to talk to me recently about the \nimmigration legislation that he has worked on judiciously, two private \nvisits to talk to me, he noticed a grouping of photographs on the wall \nand said when he had been in my office occasionally for lunch he had \nnever taken the time to look at the pictures.\n  So I introduced him to my mother's father, Mordecai Shanin, who came \nfrom a small town on the Russian border when my mother was 5 and \nsettled in St. Joe, MO. And I reintroduced Senator Simpson to my \nfather, Harry Specter, who was in his uniform, and I recounted that he \nemigrated from Ukraine, walking across Europe with barely a ruble in \nhis pocket.\n  At that point, Senator Simpson said to me he did not think he and I \nwould agree too much on the pending immigration legislation.\n  I come to this issue from a somewhat different vantage point. My \nsense is that America is a big, broad, growing country and that we do \nhave room for immigrants. I grew up in Kansas. I was born in Wichita \nand grew up in the small town of Russell, with wide open spaces like \nWyoming. My sense is that it is not in the national interest to reduce \nimmigration from 675,000 to 607,000. Both categories of immigrants--the \nfamily-based and the employment-based--will make a great contribution \nto our country. This is a country of immigrants. When we had the debate \nin the committee, Senator Abraham started off with his immigrant \nbackground. Senator Feinstein talked about her immigrant background and \nI talked about mine, and everybody on the committee could talk about it \nin one way or another because we are a country of immigrants.\n  I understand the priorities for minor children and spouses, and, of \ncourse, these groups have to be the first priority. But I believe that \nwhen you talk about siblings and adult children, talk about family \nvalues and talk about having room for the families, that the figures \nare relatively modest.\n  When we talk about illegal immigration, there is no doubt about the \nneed to control our borders and to control illegal immigration. But \nwhen we talk about legal immigration, I think we are talking about \nsomething that is very, very different.\n  When there is a proposal to reduce employment-based visas by some \n28.5 percent, from 140,000 a year to 100,000 for a period of 5 years, I \nmust say that this is a fundamental mistake.\n  In Pennsylvania, I have had many of my constituents come to me and \nsay that there is a real need for these visas; that the immigrants who \ncome here legally are very highly skilled, are Ph.D.'s, are \ntechnicians, and they will be instrumental in creating more jobs, not \nin taking jobs. I have worked on the bill in committee to be sure that \npeople who come in on these visas do not take existing jobs; that there \nhas to be a premium payment and there has to be a care and \nconsideration so they do not displace existing workers, but these \nhighly skilled people will create more jobs.\n  I was involved in this issue back in 1989 and 1990 on behalf of the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce where I think we increased the number by about \n40,000. The situation is so acute in my State, Pennsylvania, that I \nhave held meetings in both Pittsburgh and Philadelphia which were very, \nvery well attended. At these meetings various companies having \nimmediate needs for\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nhighly skilled people came in to comment to me about their opposition \nto the reduction in the number of visas.\n  There is no doubt that there is concern about displacing U.S. \nworkers, and I think we have to be careful not to do that, to make sure \nthat does not happen by requiring a premium payment for those who come \nin as legal immigrants.\n  I wanted to make these few brief comments. It is not an easy matter. \nWhen Senator Simpson and Senator Kennedy are the managers and go \nthrough this bill and have very protracted hearings and a markup before \nthe Judiciary Committee, it is a very large job.\n  So, again, I compliment my colleagues on their work and do express my \nview that this legal immigration is something which will build a \nstronger America and provide more jobs. The humanitarian aspects have \nto be considered as we have the families who ought to have an \nopportunity to come into this country. Currently, the waiting period to \nenter the country is as long as 10 years for some family members. We \nought not to extend that waiting period. I thank the Chair and yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, throughout the years legal immigration has \nhelped to make our Nation great. America has attracted and continues to \nattract the best and the brightest--each year many highly skilled and \nexceptionally talented individuals legally migrate to the United \nStates. In addition, many hard-working individuals who have come to \nthis Nation and contributed their skills, ideas, and cultural \nperspectives. We must remember that we are and always have been a \nnation of immigrants.\n  Illegal immigration is an entirely different matter and presents a \nwhole host of problems that need to be addressed. We must pull together \nour resources to enforce our borders, streamline deportation of illegal \naliens and increase penalties on those who traffic in illegal \nimmigration.\n  In doing all that we should to combat illegal immigration, however, \nwe must be careful not to unfairly punish those who have entered this \ncountry legally. By dealing with the very separate issues presented by \nlegal and illegal immigration separately, we can go a long way to \nensuring that our desire to stop illegal immigration does not result in \npenalizing those who have abided by the law to enter the country.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has already considered the very issue \nof whether legal and illegal immigration legislation should be \naddressed separately. They voted by a margin of 2 to 1 to keep the two \nseparate. We should stay that course and give well-reasoned \nconsideration to legal immigration apart from the discussion of the \nserious national problems presented by illegal immigration.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues wish to reduce the numbers of \nlegal immigrants in order to eliminate the backlog of spouses and minor \nchildren waiting to enter this country. But we should address these \nissues when the matter before us is legal immigration. Otherwise, legal \nimmigrants who have long enriched this Nation, may be unfairly impacted \nby the negative views which understandably are associated with illegal \nimmigration.\n  In addition, we cannot give appropriate consideration to employment-\nrelated provisions of a bill discussing both legal and illegal \nimmigration. Legal immigration has helped to strengthen America's \neconomic base, providing our Nation's businesses with highly skilled \nindividuals to meet critical needs in special fields and disciplines. \nAmerican businesses who employ legal immigrants already must comply \nwith a series of rules and regulations which can be very costly. Also, \nas a recent Cato Institute study makes clear, legal immigration does \nnot increase the rate of native unemployment.\n  Obviously, illegal immigration poses a different set of employment-\nrelated issues such as what appropriate sanctions should be levied \nagainst employers who hire illegal immigrants and the best and most \nefficient way to verify citizenship of potential employees.\n  Again, I hope that my colleagues will remember that we are a nation \nof immigrants and that legal immigration has been a source of great \nstrength and diversity. We can best and most fairly address any \nproblems associated with legal immigration by discussing that issue \nseparately from the far greater problems illegal immigration presents. \nThus, I urge my colleagues to vote to keep illegal and legal \nimmigration provisions separate.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Simpson amendment. \nMr. President, what the Senator from Wyoming has recommended to this \nbody is that we try to consider the immigration questions together, \nboth legal and illegal. There have been some very sincere Members who \nhave worked in committee to separate the bills. I understand their \ninterest in considering them separately. But I hope the membership of \nthe Senate will consider the question of joining these together, for \nseveral reasons. The first is simply that these questions are \nintegrated. Illegal and legal immigration questions do overlap. It is \nlogical to consider them all in one bill. It makes the most sense.\n  The second reason, Mr. President, is, frankly, I think we are much \nmore likely to get a bill through and passed if we have them together, \nas well. That is a judgment on my part. Others may have a different \nview. But I think there is, one, a need to move ahead with legislation \nin this area, and, two, that need is much better accomplished if we \nhave those measures together. So it makes sense to have them together, \nmakes it better to legislate, more cohesive. Second, I think it makes \nit much more likely we will pass a bill.\n  In ascribing motives to lobbyists who have worked to separate the \nbills, I want to make it clear that I do not attribute those to the \nMembers who have risen on this floor to speak. I think they are \nsincere. Mr. President, it is my impression that those Members have \nmade a very enormous, positive contribution to this debate. But it is \nalso my impression that some of the groups that have lobbied for \nseparation of the bills have done it because they did not like \nprovisions of one or either of the particular measures. Many business \ngroups lobbied very hard against having the bills considered together.\n  Mr. President, I think the reason for their interest in separating \nthe bills no longer exists, frankly. There were provisions in the \noriginal bill, as it came to the Senate Judiciary Committee as a full \ncommittee markup, that caused concern. There were provisions of it that \nI thought were quite antibusiness. There were provisions, in my view, \nthat should be stricken from the bill.\n  But, Mr. President, that original reason, that reason that had caused \nthe interest groups to try to separate the bills no longer exists. \nLiterally, the harmful provisions, at least almost all of them in my \nview, have been taken out of the bills. The very reason for separating \nthem has been done away with. It came about because we had in the \nJudiciary Committee what I consider the most positive markup I have \never been involved in in 16 years in the Congress. It was very akin to \nthe kind of markup that occurs in State legislatures all across this \ncountry.\n\n  The difference? The difference is it was bipartisan. The difference \nis that people listened to each other. The difference was that the \naccommodation was reached. I am sure Members will reflect that is not \nalways the case in markups. I came out of that Senate Judiciary \nCommittee markup feeling very positive, not only about our results, \nbecause I think the bill was dramatically improved in that process, but \nabout the process itself.\n  I hope, as Members deliberate this question, they will look for a \nlogical way to legislate, which is to combine these subjects, and they \nwill look for a reason to get both of these bills passed because, Mr. \nPresident, there is not a Member who comes to this floor who does not \nunderstand and does not share the view that we need to change the laws \nin this area, that we are not accomplishing the purposes that both \nparties agree on. So it is a logical way to do it and a way to make \nsure we get good legislation.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I simply add this. It is important that we \nmove on this subject. As we explored this subject in markup, what we \nfound is that there were a great many areas that both liberals and \nconservatives, Democrats and Republicans agreed on--that\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\nthere are errors and loopholes in our current laws, and there are many \nareas where the common purpose of all people in the United States are \nnot being met. They are not being met because our laws are deficient in \nthat area.\n  I simply believe this subject is compelling and the need to act is \ncompelling. That need, that purpose that I believe almost all Americans \nshare, can be much better accomplished if we move to join these two \nmeasures rather than keep them separate. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I do thank my friend from Colorado. This \nSenate will miss him, and certainly I will miss him. He is a very \nspecial friend and one for whom I have come to have the highest respect \nand admiration and affection.\n  I want to thank Senator Shelby. Such a fine ally. I admire him so, a \nvery steady, thoughtful, extremely authentic man when he deals with the \nissues of the day.\n  I just say to my friend from Colorado that I think my colleague from \nMichigan was a bit shocked when the Senator said we were talking about \njoining these issues. My amendment is not about joining the issues. I \nwant to express that. This is a singular amendment based upon the \nmajority recommendations from the Jordan commission. We have seen fit \nto see that it is an issue that will be discussed, voted on, whichever \nway it goes, and then move on. I think once we finish this amendment, \nthings will move in a swifter fashion.\n\n  But just let me say this to kind of summarize some things that have \noccurred during the debate. Please understand that I think what my \nfriend, Senator Feingold, was talking about--parents--there is no \nchange in my amendment in the definition of ``immediate family,'' none. \nParents, minor children, spouses, no change. That, I think, is \nunfortunate; and perhaps it may have been misconstrued. But there is no \nchange in the definition of ``immediate family'' in what I am doing.\n  I say, too, that in the debate I have heard the phrase that these \npeople come here to work. I agree with that totally. There was another \nreference to the fact that they are a tremendous burden on the United \nStates. I have never shared that view. I have never shared the view \nthat these people who come here are a tremendous burden.\n  But there are some touching stories here I just have to comment on. \nYou knew that I would not completely allow that to slip away.\n  We can all tell the most touching stories that we can possibly \nconjecture. My friend from Ohio tells those stories. My friend from \nMassachusetts tells those stories. I can tell those stories, for I have \na brother who is just about the most wonderful man you can ever \nimagine. I would like to have him here. But the problem is, nobody will \nraise the numbers, no one will come to this floor and say, ``I think \nlegal immigration should be 1,000,002.'' I do not know of anybody who \nis going to come here and do that. Unless you do that, then I have to \nmake a choice, which is not quite as dramatic as Sophie's choice. That \nwould be a poor illustration. But I have to decide whether I want to \nbring my spouse and minor children or my brother or raise the numbers. \nThat is where we are. So you either deal with the priorities or you \nlift the numbers. There is not much place to go.\n  When Senator DeWine talks about this gutsy guy, this gutsy, hard-\nworking guy--and that I will remember for a long time because I know \nthat story now--that gutsy, hard-working guy cannot come here, ladies \nand gentlemen, because 78 percent of the visas have been used by family \nconnection. This gutsy, hard-working guy, the people we all think about \nwhen we talk about immigration, these people who come and enrich our \nNation, as memorialized on the Statue of Liberty by Emma Lazarus, are \nnot going to get here, ladies and gentlemen, because 78 percent of the \nvisas are used by family connection, period. That is where we are. You \ntake more or give more. I have the view, which is consistent, that we \nought to give the precious numbers to the closest family member. That \nis the purpose of my amendment.\n\n  Senator Kennedy talks about the adult child who will have to wait, \nand it is a poignant story--or the only sister of the Cambodian who \nwill not be able to come for 5 years. I ask my colleagues if you really \nprefer to admit brothers and sisters or adult children while husbands \nand wives and minor children are standing in line, who want to join \ntheir family here, who can be described as ``little kids,'' ``little \nmothers, little fathers.'' That is what this is. What kind of a policy \nis that?\n  I tell you what kind of a policy it is, it is our present policy. The \npresent policy of the United States is that there is a backlog on \nspouses and minor children of permanent resident aliens, which is 1.1 \nmillion. There is a backlog of brothers and sisters in that fifth \npreference, of 1.7 million people. No one is going to wait that long, I \ncan assure you. No one is going to wait that long. They will come here. \nWho would not?\n  There are two choices: Raise the numbers, or give true priorities. \nThere is no other choice. None. Americans will not put up with the \nfirst one, which is to raise the numbers. You can see what they say. \nThey do not want new numbers. The Roper Polls, the Gallup Polls down \nthrough the years, ever since I have been in this issue, ask the people \nof America, do they want to limit illegal immigration. The response is \n``Yes,'' 70 to 75 percent. And the second question, do you want to \nlimit legal immigration, and the answer is ``Yes,'' 70 percent \nconsistently throughout my entire time in the U.S. Senate.\n  You cannot do both. You cannot lower numbers and keep the current \nnaturalization system, so you have to raise the numbers or else go to a \ntrue priority. There is nothing about persons, human beings, and all \nthe rest of that. That is one we can all tell. It is about if you \nreally care, if you really, really care about what we are all saying \nhere, then raise the numbers. If you want to do that, we should have \nthat debate--raise the numbers. If you do not raise the numbers, you \nare going to continue to see a 40-year-old brother of a U.S. citizen \ntaking away the number of a spouse, a little spouse or a minor child, a \ntiny child--we can all do that. That is why we do not get much done and \nprobably will not get much done here. At least we will have a vote. \nThat is what this is about.\n  What about my spouse and minor children that I love? Why not both of \nthem? Why cannot my spouse, minor children and my brother come? It is \nbecause they will not raise the figures. Raise the figures and then \nthey can all come. Make your choice. I can tell you, in grappling with \nthis issue and all the issues of emotion, fear, guilt, and racism--I \nkeep using it again and again and again--and Emma Lazarus, I know all \nabout Emma Lazarus. I read up on that remarkable woman years ago. Of \ncourse, the Statue of Liberty does not say, ``Send us everybody you \nhave, legally or illegally.'' That is not what it says.\n\n  The most extraordinary part of it all is that the people who want to \ndo everything with illegal immigrants and do something to ``punish \nthem'' and do something to limit them and do something here, here and \nthere, are the very people who will also not allow us to do anything \nwith a proper verification system that will enable us to get the job \ndone. We will have a debate on that one and see where that goes. That \nis an amendment of mine on verification.\n  You cannot do anything in the illegal immigration bill unless you do \nsomething with the gimmick documents of the United States. When we try \nto do that one, here comes wizards like the Cato Institute talking \nabout tattoos and people who have found an enclave there, to reign down \nand give us no answers, not a single answer about what you do with \nillegal immigration, if you do not do something with the documents, \nverification or the gimmick Social Security and the gimmick driver's \nlicenses and all the rest. What a bunch. What a bunch.\n  I am still waiting for the editorial from one of their wizards over \nthere to pour out for me what happened to the slippery slope here. When \nI go to the airport and get asked by the baggage clerk for a picture \nID, I did not really think about that being the slippery slope, but I \nguess it must be the slickest slope we can ever imagine if this other \nstuff is the slippery slope. This is bizarre. Get asked by a baggage \nclerk for a picture ID will not do something to keep illegal, \nundocumented people\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\nout of the United States and keep them from working in the United \nStates so the American citizens can have the job and do the work. It is \na curious operation, but things I needed to say. That is why this \namendment is here. We will just see where it goes. Let her rip.\n  Somebody can come and look at what the debate was and say, ``How did \nit ever reach that point? Hundreds of thousands of people playing by \nthe rules will have to wait?'' Under the current system which would be \nperpetuated by the present committee language, 1.1 million spouses and \nchildren of permanent residents, must wait for up to 5 years. While the \nclosest families members are waiting for years, now we admit under our \ncurrent system 65,000 siblings of citizens and their families every \nsingle year.\n\n  Finally, Barbara Jordan did know about the figures that have been \npresented in this debate. The INS statistics, their division of \nstatistics sent one of their experts to the commission to help with \ntheir deliberations, to help the commission, and they certainly did \nknow about these figures. The magnitude is alarming, but they knew.\n  So the important link between legal and illegal immigration, many of \nthose we are often told are waiting patiently in the backlog and some \nin fact are not waiting patiently in the backlog. In fact, they are not \nwaiting at all. Why should they? They have entered this country legally \nor illegally. Legally they are residing here. When their place on the \nbacklog is reached they apparently feel a sense of entitlement there \nbecause their visa has been approved. They say, ``Gosh, I have been \napproved to come to the United States of America, but I cannot come for \n10 or 15 years because some brother is taking up the slot. Some 30-, \n40-year-old brother down the road has taken my slot and I want to be \nwith my spouse and minor children or some closer relative, an unmarried \nson, a daughter, a married son or daughter.'' But no, because we have \nthis huge line of preferences and we meet them all and we are required \nto meet them all with a total of 226,000 people. We are required to do \nthat.\n  They certainly feel they have a technical ability to come here. How \nmany are in that group? Let me tell you how many are in that group--1 \nmillion people in that group. Let me tell you who are these people \nwaiting to come in who are currently in the United States who are not \nplaying by the rules. Here are people who are, I hope my colleagues \nwill hear, who are not playing by the rules. We have in the family \nfirst preference, the estimated percent of people, waiting list \napplicants, who are currently in the United States, should not be in \nthe United States, but are in the United States because they have been \napproved, but they have not been approved for entry. But they are here. \nMr. President, 25 percent are in the family first category. Sixty-five \npercent of spouses and children in the family second category are not \nplaying by the rules. They are here. Where do you think they would be? \nThey have been approved. They are on the list, and they have not been \nfinally adjudged, and they are here, and 65 percent are not playing by \nthe rules. Adult sons and daughters, 25 percent are not playing by the \nrules. Third preference, 8 percent. Family, 5 percent--all not playing \nby the rules. I will enter into the Record that estimate of the waiting \nlist and family sponsored preferences as of February 1996.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be printed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  ESTIMATED IV--WAITING LIST IN THE FAMILY-SPONSORED PREFERENCES AS OF  \n                              FEBRUARY 1996                             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       Estimated                        \n                                       February     January    Increase \n              Category                   1996        1995      from 1995\n                                        totals      totals              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFamily first........................      80,000      69,540     +10,460\n                                     ===================================\nFamily second:                                                          \n  Spouses/children..................   1,140,000   1,138,544      +1,456\n  Adult sons/daughters..............     550,000     494,064     +55,936\n                                     -----------------------------------\n      Pref. total...................   1,690,000   1,632,608     +57,392\nFamily third........................     285,000     260,414     +24,586\nFamily fourth.......................   1,700,000   1,592,424    +107,576\n                                     -----------------------------------\n    Family total....................   3,755,000   3,554,986    +200,014\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Estimated percent of waiting list applicants who are currently in the \n                             United States\n\nFamily first.........................................................25\nFamily second:\n  Spouses/children...................................................65\n  Adult sons/daughters...............................................25\nFamily third..........................................................8\nFamily fourth.........................................................5\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Perhaps the debate is drawing to a close. It has been a \ngood debate. I very much have enjoyed it. I enjoy my colleagues. I have \nworked with them and am learning to know them. It will be a great \ninfluence on the debate in years to come. That is very important. The \npurpose of this amendment is simply to try to stabilize what is \npresently totally out of control, unless you raise the numbers.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming. I was \nnot as surprised as he was at the remarks of the Senator from Colorado \nabout this effort to bring legal immigration into the illegal \nimmigration bill. As I said in my earlier comments, and as I think the \nremarks of the Senator from Colorado also reflect, this is a very \nsubstantial joining together of two very, very, in my judgment, \ndifferent issues that ought to be dealt with independently of each \nother, as we were able to do so in the Judiciary Committee, and as the \nHouse did in their consideration of immigration already this year.\n  The fact of the matter is that these issues that pertain to the \nnumber of legal immigrants who can come into this country are very \ncomplicated, significant, and weighty issues. Mr. President, I say to \nyou that anybody who has been watching the discussions today, who has \nbeen following this debate, I hope they recognize already what we \nrecognized on the Judiciary Committee, that these are not simple \namendments. These are not amendments that should be considered in the \nflash of the day here. These are, in fact, deserving of being \nindependently considered in a much broader context that looks at the \nwhole range of matters that pertain to legal immigration at the same \ntime.\n  To take the illegal immigration bill--an outstanding piece of \nlegislation, in most respects already--and suddenly inject into it \nconsiderations of legal immigration on the basis of one amendment at \nthe very end of this process is not the way the full Senate should take \nthis up today. In my judgment, Mr. President, anybody watching this \ndebate would recognize that the Senate deserves to have a full and \ncomplete consideration of legal immigration, rather than to attach one \nhighly controversial and very complicated element of it on the illegal \nimmigration bill.\n  That said, Mr. President, let me move on to address some of the \nsubstantive components of the Simpson amendment, which is at the desk \nright now. I think it is important for our colleagues to understand \nexactly what would happen if this amendment were to pass. First of all, \nMr. President, I think the priorities in this amendment are out of \nline. Under this amendment, the practical effect of priorities that \nhave been set is that virtually no visas will be available for people \nwho fall into categories such as the adult children or the married \nchildren of U.S. citizens.\n\n  Given the backlog of spouses and children of permanent residents, \ngiven the anticipated numbers by the INS, the normal categories of an \nunlimited immigration of the spouses and children of legal citizens, it \nis clear that, for the 5-year period the legislation contemplates, \nthere will not be any visas available, in my judgment, for anyone who \nis the child, married child, or adult child, of a U.S. citizen.\n  What that means, Mr. President, and what our colleagues have to \nunderstand is that if the Simpson amendment were to pass, we would \nestablish the following priority. The children of noncitizens would \nhave a greater priority in terms of gaining access to this country than \nthe children of U.S. citizens. Let me repeat that. The children of \nnoncitizens would be given a higher priority than the children of \ncitizens. In fact, virtually no adult children or married children of \ncitizens would, under this amendment, have a chance to come here during \nthis 5-year period.\n  Let me reflect further on the point I am making, because it turns \nout, as Senator Simpson indicated, and as we have discussed here \nalready today, that\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\na substantial portion of those people who are in this category of \npermanent residents, were themselves amnestied here in 1986 by the \nlegislation that this Congress passed and which was signed into law. \nPrior to that, they entered the country illegally. They were illegal \naliens. And so if we place, as a priority, the children of these \npermanent residents on the basis that the Simpson amendment does, above \nthe adult children and married children of U.S. citizens, we would not \nonly be placing priority on the children of permanent residents, \nnoncitizens over the children of citizens, we would be placing as a \nhigher priority the children of illegal aliens over the children of \nU.S. citizens.\n  Now, several Members have tried to differentiate between adult \nchildren of U.S. citizens and minor children, between married children \nof U.S. citizens and minor children, between married or adult children \nof U.S. citizens and minor children of noncitizens; but I have a hard \ntime believing that any Member of the U.S. Senate or Congress wants to \nexclude virtually every adult or married child of U.S. citizens and, \ninstead, propose such a substantial priority on the children of \nnoncitizens, indeed, so many of whom were at one point illegal aliens.\n\n  It just seems to me that these are not the priorities we, as a body, \nought to follow. In addition to that, as was alluded to also by Senator \nSimpson, there are a huge number of children and siblings of U.S. \ncitizens who are on this backlog list, people who have been waiting \nfor, in some cases, as many as 10 years to come here. The Simpson \namendment would virtually wipe out anybody on that list from having \naccess over these 5 years that the amendment would seek to apply.\n  These people have been waiting already a long time. They have paid \nthe dollars that are involved in securing applications and a variety of \nother things that are part of this process. Now they will be told that, \nbasically, for at least 5 years, the door is going to be shut. I think \nthat is a huge mistake. These are the people that all of our offices \nhear from all the time. These are the people whose fathers and mothers \ncontact us and ask us, ``What can be done? How can we get our children \nhere?''\n  Well, many times we have had to say ``no.'' Now we are going to, with \na vote today, say ``no'' for an additional 5 full years, Mr. President. \nI think that is a terrible delay to continue.\n  But let me talk, also, Mr. President, about some of the other \ncomments that have been made with respect to exactly who is affected by \nthis legislation. We have heard a lot today about the concept known as \nchain migration. It is always said in a very kind of threatening way \nand a worrisome-sounding way--chain migration. That is something we, \napparently, do not like. But let us just talk a little bit about these \nfolks who were on the charts we saw earlier today--the sons and \ndaughters of U.S. citizens, who we seek to keep the door open to. Are \nthese really people we want to keep out, Mr. President? Are these \nreally people we want to put at a lower priority? Are these really \npeople who, as some described, are taking from our system? It is \nexactly those people who Senator DeWine referenced when he talked about \nthe gutsy guys who have come here. Who are those people who have come \nhere over the years to make a contribution? That is exactly these \npeople.\n  The notion of chain migration has been dramatically exaggerated here \ntoday. As the General Accounting Office study indicates, the average \ntime between a person's arrival and their effort to sponsor somebody is \n12 years. The chart, which attempts to depict huge influxes of people \ncoming as a result of one person's immigration--in fact, that covers \nhalf a century. That, I believe, is exaggerated at that point as well.\n  The fact is that, under the law that we are considering, the illegal \nimmigration bill, countless provisions have been placed in that \nlegislation to prevent this--sponsorship agreements that can be \nenforced, so that before people come over here, there has to be a \nsponsorship agreement by the person sponsoring, and that agreement can \nnow be enforced under this legislation.\n  That is not going to encourage immigration; it is going to advertise \ncourage. It is a dramatically exaggerated contention. To the extent it \nexists, the illegal immigration bill will discourage it. To the extent \nthat anybody is trying to exploit the system, this bill discourages it.\n  This bill contains sponsorship provisions, deeming provisions, \nprovisions which limit access to the Government services by illegal \naliens and by noncitizens that are going to discourage any advantage \ntaken of the system, which will leave instead the kind of country that \nso many people sought over its history, the kind of nation where people \ncame here to play by the rules and make a contribution, and, indeed, \nthey have.\n  An earlier speaker talked about immigration places a huge strain on \nthe process. The type of immigration we are talking about, the ability \nof U.S. citizens to bring their children to this country, which this \namendment would dramatically reduce, is not a strain on this system. To \nthe extent any strain might exist, we have already addressed it in this \nillegal immigration bill by cutting off access to the kinds of services \nthat may have been exploited.\n  So, although I have several other things that I will bring back to \nthe floor so other speakers get their chance, let me just conclude by \nrestating two fundamental points.\n  First, the Simpson amendment is an attempt, no matter how it is \ncharacterized, to bring very weighty, very complicated legal \nimmigration issues and inject them into the illegal immigration bill. \nThose issues should be considered separate and very comprehensively in \nthe bill that is before the Senate that is already at the desk on legal \nimmigration. To bring them in now, especially to bring them in \npiecemeal, is a mistake.\n  The practical effect of the Simpson amendment, were it to be enacted \nhere today, would be to place a higher priority on access to coming to \nthis country on the children of noncitizens versus the children of \ncitizens. It would place a higher priority on the children of illegal \naliens versus the children of citizens. If we are to address, and \neffectively address, issues of legal immigration, then at least we \nshould address them in a way that puts the priority the way it ought to \nbe. Citizens of this country and their children should have a higher \npriority than noncitizens and certainly than those who are illegal \naliens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I will continue my discussion of \nthis amendment after others have spoken.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me again strongly associate myself \nwith the comments of the Senator from Michigan. Although it is \nsuggested that somehow this amendment does not violate the distinction \nbetween the illegal and the legal immigration issue, I do not know how \nelse you can say it. It is indisputable that this amendment is not only \nabout people who may at one time be illegal immigrants. But they are \nlegal immigrants. It is not about people engaged in any kind of \nactivity that is illegal.\n  I made this point in my earlier remarks. Senator Abraham and I did \noffer an amendment that was approved in committee for those situations \nwhere someone has come here legally and then overstays their visa. We \nincreased the penalties for that. That is appropriately in an illegal \nimmigration bill. But this amendment has nothing to do with that issue \nat all. It has to do with which family members and which relationships \nand in what order people should be able to come to this country in a \nstrictly legal context.\n  So I am troubled by the attempt here to, on the one hand, suggest \nthat, of course, we should separate these two issues and then come \nright here at the beginning of this bill and offer an amendment that \nclearly goes over the line, that clearly goes into legal immigration, \nand to somehow suggest it is just one little amendment. It is not one \nlittle amendment. It is a big deal that is going to affect thousands \nand thousands of families, of people who are acting completely legally, \nand they are going to be forced into a bill that is all about the \npublic anger and concern having to do with illegal immigration. I think \nthat paints the issue.\n  That is why I think an overwhelming majority of people in this body, \nif they are given a simple opportunity to vote,\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nwhether they wanted to consider illegal and legal immigration \nseparately would vote to separate the issue.\n  Mr. President, what I am going to suggest, since the amendment came \nup in this order, is that this is going to be the key vote on whether \nor not you really think the issues of legal and illegal immigration \nshould be separated. I talked to a number of Senators about this issue. \nThey think it is very clear. There is no question in their minds that \nthe illegal and legal issues should be separate. Make no mistake. This \nis the amendment that will decide whether that is really their \nposition.\n  Those who vote for the Simpson amendment cannot possibly argue that \nthey have kept the faith of keeping the legal and illegal issues \nseparate. It is impossible. It is too big of an issue. In fact, I would \neven argue that it is worse than just straightforwardly saying, ``We \nare going to merge legal and illegal immigration.'' It is just \npiecemeal. It takes one very significant aspect of legal immigration, \nfamily immigration, and somehow decides it in the context of an illegal \nimmigration bill while leaving other important issues having to do with \nlegal immigration to this side, presumably to be dealt with when we \nbring up the legal immigration bill.\n\n  This is the worst of all worlds because it does not allow people to \nlook at the legal immigration issue in its context. It just separates \none thing, puts it in the illegal bill, and in my view it is a \ndisingenuous attempt to have the cake and eat it, too--that you respect \nthe split, but, nonetheless, we are going to resolve the very basic \nissue at this time.\n  Whatever the merits of the issue, I think the Senators from Michigan, \nOhio, and others have done a wonderful job of explaining the problems \nwith the extreme limitations that this amendment brings forward. \nWhatever your view on the merits, I hope Senators will realize that \nthis is the vote about whether you want to keep the issues of illegal \nand legal immigration separate. There may be other related amendments \nlater. There may be a sense of the Senate. But if you go ahead and pass \nthis amendment, you have already broken the line between the two \nissues, and you cannot put it back together.\n  Mr. President, I hope all Members realize the importance of this, not \njust from the point of view of the merits, which are terribly \nimportant, but also from the integrity of this whole process, which the \nvast majority of the House and the vast majority of this body believe \nit would receive by separating and keeping separate the issues of legal \nand illegal immigration.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that it is very, very important that we \nreject this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like at this point to try to \nrespond to my friend and colleague from Wyoming and to some of the \ncomments that he has made. I think we are engaging in a good debate \nhere. This has gone on for a few hours. It is probably going to go on \nfor a few more hours. But I think these are very, very important \nissues.\n  I believe that the Simpson amendment is in fact antifamily, anti-\nfamily reunification, and goes against the best traditions of this \ncountry.\n  Let me explain why I say this because this can get very, very \nconfusing, and you have to really spend some time. It has taken me some \ntime to get into it. I certainly do not today pretend to be any kind of \nexpert. But let me explain what I understand the facts to be.\n\n  The Simpson amendment would have the effect of pushing aside adult \nchildren of U.S. citizens. It would have the effect of pushing aside \nthe minor children of U.S. citizens who happen to be married. It would \nsay to a U.S. citizen--let me again emphasize ``a U.S. citizen''--you \ncannot bring in your adult child. We are not going to consider that \nperson part of your nuclear family anymore. That is going to be your \nextended family, those of us who have children over a wide range of \nages. Try to tell that to your older children, my son Patrick, or Jill, \nor John, that they are no longer part of our family; you cannot come \nin.\n  It says to a U.S. citizen, if your minor child has made the decision \nto get married, well, you cannot even bring your minor child in. It \nsays that to the U.S. citizen. It pushes these children aside in favor \nof--let us be very careful how we state this--the spouses and minor \nchildren of illegal aliens, people who were illegal aliens, who came \nhere illegally and who were ultimately granted amnesty in the Simpson-\nMazzoli bill.\n  That is the choice. That is what it is doing. But when you get into \nit further, what you also find out is that the vast majority of these \npeople, which this amendment purports to help, with children, with \nspouses, people who were illegal aliens, who came in here then because \nof the amnesty provision of Simpson-Mazzoli, were legalized, we say \nthat is OK--their children.\n  The facts are the vast majority of their children and their spouses \nare already here. They are already in the country. They are not leaving \none way or the other, no matter what this bill does. That is the \nreality. No one can come to this floor and say this is going to impact \nit one way or the other. So we are pushing aside family members of U.S. \ncitizens purportedly for the reason to help other people, the vast \nmajority of whom are already here anyway. That is antifamily. It is \nwrong. It is wrong. It is wrong. We should not do it.\n  How did this all come about? Let us look at the facts. Let me cite \nthe Jordan commission because my colleague from Wyoming very correctly \ncites the Jordan commission for many things. Let me cite the Jordan \ncommission. It is stated, stated by proponents of the Simpson \namendment--it was talked about in our committee--that there are 1.2 \nmillion spouses and children of permanent resident aliens who are \nwaiting to come in. That is the people the Simpson amendment purports \nto help. Let me repeat it--1.2 million spouses and children of \npermanent resident aliens who are waiting to come in. End of quote. \nHere is what the Jordan Commission says about this group of people. The \nJordan commission said that at least, at least 850,000 of these people, \nat least 850,000 of them are already here. They are already in the \ncountry.\n  Who are they? Again, they are the children, they are the spouses of \npeople who this Congress in the Simpson-Mazzoli bill in 1986 granted \namnesty to.\n  So I think it is very important that we keep this in mind.\n  Now, no one can come to this floor and say these people are going to \nbe kicked out. That is not happening. It is not going to happen. In \nfact, the husbands, the mothers, people who are granted amnesty, once \nthey were granted amnesty, were on the road to citizenship if they \nwanted it. Now, many of them for any number of reasons that I cannot \nfathom have decided not to become citizens, but no one is talking about \nkicking them out. INS is not deporting them, nor is INS deporting their \nchildren, nor is INS deporting their spouses. And there is no one who \ncan come to this floor and say anybody is talking about doing that. So \nI think it is very, very important to emphasize who these people are. \nAnd again I would cite the Jordan Commission. Mr. President, the \n850,000 of this group of people the Simpson amendment purports to \nhelp--it purports to help family members--get help only on paper \nbecause they are here already. The fact is that when a legalized person \nbecomes a U.S. citizen after 5 years, the spouses and children are \nlegalized immediately. They can do that. All that person has to do is \nbecome a citizen. And even if that person does not elect to become a \ncitizen, no one is going to kick those kids out and no one is going to \nkick the parents out. So I think, while what is said about the Simpson \namendment makes sense and is technically correct, we have to look \nbehind that and look at who these people really are and what the real \nfacts are.\n\n  Let me turn, if I could, to another issue but it is related. It is \nrelated to Simpson-Mazzoli that passed in 1986, and it is related to \nthe overall rhetoric about the extent, number of legal immigrants who \nare coming into this country. The statement is made that we are at an \nall-time high. That is simply not true. It is not even close to being \ntrue. It is not accurate.\n  We are at the rate of approximately, talking about legal immigrants, \nof 2 per thousand of our population. We have been at roughly this rate \nfor 30 years. We have been at higher, we have been at lower during our \nhistory. Just to take one example, though, if you go\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\nback to the turn of the century we were at about 10 per thousand. We \nare at roughly 2 per thousand now.\n  What about my colleagues who may say, well, we just heard the \nargument made that we have new statistics out from INS that show the \nnumbers are up. Yes. What it shows is that we got what we expected. \nWhen we decided to grant amnesty in 1986, we knew there was going to be \na spike, and we knew there was not only going to be a spike but there \nwas going to be additional spiking as a result of that because of the \nchildren that could be legalized, could become U.S. citizens of those \npeople who are granted amnesty.\n  That was expected. So I think you have to put this again in its \nhistorical perspective, and we have to understand that this should be a \nshock to no one. It was totally expected. It is an increase that we \nhave seen as a direct result of the amnesty that was granted in 1986 \nand it is basically just as the amnesty was a one-time shot, the \nresults of that amnesty are also a one-time occurrence.\n  Let me talk, if I could, about another argument that my friend from \nWyoming made. He had a very interesting chart. I walked over to take a \nlook at it. It was something that I heard him talk very eloquently \nabout a great deal and that is the chain migration problem.\n\n  Just a couple comments. As my friend from Michigan said a moment ago, \nthat chart may be accurate, it may be accurate for a family. I can come \nup with a hypothetical. It might be accurate--might be. But if it was \naccurate, assuming it was accurate, assuming that is a real case, it \ntakes about a half a century for that all to take place. So I think we \nneed to put that in perspective.\n  My colleague from Wyoming agreed with me; we should favor the gutsy \npeople, gutsy people who picked up and came here. What is to say those \npeople on that chart are not gutsy? What is to say they are not people \nwho contributed to society? What is to say they are not people who work \nwith their family, maybe work in a business to make things happen? That \nchart is almost the history of this country, almost a reflection of our \nown, not just the history of this country but a reflection of many of \nour own families, if we go back a generation or two or three.\n  I wish to return to another issue because this issue keeps coming up. \nI just want to return to it because it shows I think how many times the \nmixing in our bills and in our mind of the issue of legal immigration \nand illegal immigration leads not only to what I think would be bad \nlegislation but I think bad thinking and confusing thinking and \nconfusing rhetoric. Let me give one example. It has been stated time \nand time again one-half of the people who come here--let me get the \nprecise language. I wrote it down. One-half of the people who are \nillegally here came here legally. One-half of the people who are \nillegally here came here legally. Yes, that is true. But these are not \nthe people we are talking about when we talk about legal immigrants. \nThese people were never immigrants, immigrants meaning someone who is \nhere on the path to becoming a citizen.\n\n  Rather, these are people who came here--yes, legally--but who came \nhere with absolutely no expectation that they would ever become a U.S. \ncitizen. These are people who came here to work on visas. These are \npeople who came here as students. Frankly, they overstayed; they \noverstayed their welcome, they overstayed the law, and they are a \nproblem. This bill begins to address the problem, the bill as currently \nwritten. The Simpson amendment does not do anything about this problem.\n  In all due respect to my friend from Wyoming, I think the only thing \nthis rhetoric does is confuse the issue because people then make the \njump and say you have to combine the two issues. They are separate and \ndistinct. Legal immigrants is a term of art. People who are here--that \nis not the problem. There are some people, a lot of them, who overstay \nthe law. They came here legally but they were never legal immigrants. I \nthink it is important to keep those two things in mind.\n  The statement is also made that aliens use social services more than \nnative-born Americans. Again, every statistic, every study that I have \nseen, as well as anecdotal evidence that I think most of us have seen \nin our home States, would indicate that you have to look beyond that \nstatement. That statement may be technically true, but if you break out \nlegal immigrants, people who came here legally, people who have become \ncitizens, people who got in line the way they were supposed to get in \nline, people who are now naturalized citizens or who are legal resident \naliens, in line to become citizens--if you look at that group, and that \nis the group that the Simpson amendment is going to affect, what you \nfind is statistically they are on welfare less than native-born \nAmericans; less. Again, I think it shows the problem when we try to mix \nthe arguments and when we try to combine legal and illegal.\n  This vote is a vote not just on the merits of the Simpson amendment. \nIt is also a vote on whether or not this Senate is going to take an \nillegal immigration bill that I do not think is perfect--in fact, I \nhave a couple of amendments. One amendment I am going to offer; another \namendment from Senator Abraham I am going to support. We are going to \nfight about those and vote on them. But it takes an illegal immigration \nbill that I think is a very good bill, a bill that addresses the \nlegitimate concerns that honest Americans have that their laws be \nenforced, that we play by the rules and that people who come here \nillegally are dealt with--it it takes that concern and superimposes on \nit--this is what the Simpson amendment does--a whole other issue, an \nissue that this Senate should debate, should talk about. But on a \ndifferent day. It confuses the two issues, puts them together, and I \nthink that is a mistake.\n\n  For those of my colleagues who are concerned, and I think virtually \neverybody in this Senate is, about passing an illegal immigration bill \nand getting it signed and having it become law, the best way to do this \nis to defeat the Simpson amendment.\n  Do not take us down the path of getting in the swamp, getting in the \nmuck of all the other issues we are going to be into if, in fact, the \nSimpson amendment passes. Legal and illegal, they simply, I believe, \nhave to be kept separate.\n  I am going to have a few more comments later on. I do see several of \nmy colleagues who are on the floor waiting to speak. I will, at this \ntime, yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Simpson amendment. \nFirst of all, let us understand something very clearly. The discussion \nabout separating the bills, the legal and illegal bills, boils down to \none simple political fact. Those who do not want any changes in the \nlaws relating to legal immigration in this country, who do not want to \nchange the numbers, who want to continue to see the number of legal \nimmigrants in this country continue to rise, as the charts that were \nshown earlier indicate--those people who do not want to see any \nconstraints on legal immigration also do not want to see the issues of \nlegal and illegal immigration combined into one bill because they \nunderstand that there is a very strong political desire to deal with \nthe problem of illegal immigration. This body will not refrain from \ndealing with the problem of illegal immigration. Therefore, if we are \ntalking about the same subjects in the same bill--there is going to be \na bill and there could be a change in the law relative to legal \nimmigration--so they do not want to see that. They would rather see the \nlegislation regarding illegal immigration pass and then do nothing with \nrespect to legal immigration.\n  The Jordan Commission made some very substantial recommendations \nabout both legal and illegal immigration. Specifically, it determined \nthat our law should be changed to put some caps on the numbers of \npeople legally immigrating to the United States. The basis for the \nrecommendation was what has occurred in the last 10 years, both with \nrespect to illegal immigration and the increases in legal immigration. \nTen years ago or so when the law was changed, the assumption was that \nwe would stop illegal immigration. How naive, I guess, everyone was. We \nthought by making it illegal to hire those who were here illegally, we \nwould remove the magnet and people would stop coming here illegally. We \nwould\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nnot employ them. Therefore we would not have as many illegal entrants. \nAnd, therefore, we could afford to raise the number of legal entrants.\n\n  So the Senate and the House in their wisdom, before the occupant of \nthe chair and I came to the Congress, decided that what they would do, \nsince we were going to have so many fewer illegal immigrants, was to \nsimply raise by almost a quarter of a million the number of people who \ncould come here legally.\n  Of course not only have we had more legal entrants every year, but \nillegal immigration has also risen. It is the combination of both of \nthese numbers increasing that has resulted in the substantial \nmajorities of people surveyed, regardless of which survey you look at, \nwho say we need to do something about the problem, both problems. We \nneed to get a handle on controlling our borders. We need to make it \nharder for illegal immigrants to be employed and receive welfare \nbenefits. And we also need to reduce somewhat the number of people \ncoming into the country legally.\n  You can argue about where the numbers should be. My own view is that \nat least it ought to be taken about to the level that it was 10 years \nago. It is still about a quarter of a million people a year. The Jordan \nCommission actually recommended fewer than that. The Simpson amendment \nactually recommends more than the Jordan commission did, but it \nrecommends it as a true cap. It says this is a real number; 480,000 \nwill be it. Period. That is, each year, how many people can come in \nlegally.\n  The bill, as it came out of the Judiciary Committee and as it is here \non the floor, however, does not really limit the numbers. It provides a \ncap but it is called a pierceable cap, meaning you can actually have \nmore numbers than that. And, because of a phenomenon which I will \ndiscuss in a moment, the net result is that there really is no cap at \nall. So let us speak very plain English here. Nobody is trying to cut \noff legal immigration. Nobody is trying to cut it in half. Nobody is \ntrying to cut it even by 25 percent. But what we are saying is that \nthere should be some limit on it, as opposed to the bill, which will \nenable it to escalate substantially.\n  Those who favor basically open, legal immigration, will say, ``Oh, \nno, the bill actually has a cap in it.'' That is true. But, as I will \npoint out in a minute, the cap does not mean anything. It can be \npierced and it will be pierced because of the large number of people \nwho are awaiting their turn to become legal citizens, just precisely as \nSenator Alan Simpson pointed out during his remarks about an hour ago.\n  Let me return to a point that I made just a second ago and actually \ncite some numbers. A recent ABC poll showed that 73 percent of the \npeople in the country want reduced immigration. A recent Roper poll \nshowed that only 2 percent of the respondents supported the current \nlevels of immigration; only 4 percent of blacks and Hispanics supported \nthe current level. There is overwhelming view in our country that \nimmigration numbers should be somewhat reduced.\n  If I look at the actual survey numbers, as was pointed out before, \nmost of our citizens would reduce those numbers far below what any of \nus are talking about doing here today.\n  We ought to be responding to what our constituents are asking, but as \nhappens so much here inside the beltway, with various lobby groups \nputting pressures on Members, we are not even going to come close to \nwhat the majority of the people in this country are asking. We are not \ngoing to reduce the number of legal immigrants in the country to \n100,000 per year, as a majority of Americans would like to see. We are \nnot going to call a time out on any legal immigration. We are not going \nto reduce it to 200,000 or 300,000 or 400,000.\n  The most that we are going to do is to get it about at the level that \nit was 10 years ago, somewhere in the neighborhood of 480,000. So all \nof the great speeches about how we are shutting off immigration and we \nare keeping people from coming to this country obscures the fact that \nwe would be allowing about one-half million legal immigrants into the \ncountry every year. Of course, this bill applies only to 5 years, and \nthen we go back to the levels that exist today. The Simpson amendment \nis just a temporary 5-year breathing space to establish a true priority \nsystem for family immigration.\n  As Senator Simpson pointed out, one of two things has to happen here. \nEither we have to change the priorities so that instead of spouses and \nminor children, the two groups that we want to grant the top priority \nto--that is existing law; I think that is what all of us would agree \nto--we are either going to have to change that priority so that \nbrothers and sisters or others could come in ahead of them or, if we \nare going to do what the proponents of more immigrants want, we are \ngoing to have to increase the total numbers, because the current \npriority system will result in far more people coming in than the \ncurrent numbers allow. That is why this pierceable cap--it is only a \ncap in name, because the fact is the proponents of more immigration \nunderstand that if you leave the priority system as it is, inevitably \nthere will be far more legal immigrants than there are today.\n  The goal with the Simpson amendment is reunification of the nuclear \nfamily to ensure that the spouses can come in, that they have a top \npriority and that the minor children have a top priority.\n  One of my colleagues made this argument, ``Well, Senator Simpson is \nactually giving a greater priority to the children of permanent \nresidents than to the children of citizens.'' That is not true, Mr. \nPresident. Minor children of citizens are the first priority. Minor \nchildren of permanent residents are the second priority. It is true \nthat minor children of permanent residents have a priority above adult \nchildren of either citizens or permanent residents.\n\n  I ask my colleagues who made the argument, would they change that \npriority? Would you put a higher priority on the adult children of \ncitizens than on the minor children of permanent residents? Because, \nremember, permanent residents are legal, too. They have a right to live \nin this country as long as they live, and if we are talking about \nkeeping nuclear families together, we have to be very straightforward \nabout this, and I do not think there is anyone here who would not agree \nthat the current priority, which is for spouses and minor children, \nshould be the top priority.\n  So let us not hear discussion about how we are putting the children \nof permanent residents above the children of citizens. We are putting \nthe minor children of permanent residents above the adult children of \nthose who become citizens.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, just for a moment.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Does the Senator agree with the Jordan Commission when \nthey said that of those individuals that you just referenced, there are \nat least 850,000 of them who are not waiting to come in but who are \nalready, in fact, here?\n  Mr. KYL. As has been noted earlier, that statistic could well be \naccurate, and about 65 percent of those people who are here are here \nillegally, if Senator Simpson's statistics are correct, which would \nsuggest to me that we should not be granting a priority to people who, \nthough they are here, got here illegally. I will be happy to yield for \nanother question.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If you will yield for an additional comment or additional \nquestion.\n  Mr. KYL. Sure.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If the figures of the Jordan Commission are true, that \n850,000 spouses and children are here, would you agree that no one is \nseriously talking about kicking them out of the country? So, in other \nwords, when we talk about it is important to reunify these families, \nthat may be true on paper but in reality they are already reunified. \nThey were never apart because they are here together.\n  Mr. KYL. My colleague makes a point. I think he proves too much by \nhis argument, though. Nobody is going to kick them out. That is the \nwhole point. So all the bleeding heart stories about how these people \nare not going to be reunified is, frankly, beside the point. They are \nhere. Many of them are here illegally, but they are here. What they \nwill have to wait for is simply their opportunity in line to have their \nstatus recognized as legal. So in point of fact, they are not being \nhurt one iota.\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me finish making this point. Because what we are talking \nabout with the backlog requires two points of clarification.\n  One, that backlog will be cleared up; those people will get their \nlegal status eventually and, in the meantime, as my colleague points \nout, they are here already, they are already unified, they are not \nsuffering apart from each other.\n  Second, it is important to note that the Simpson amendment \ngrandfathers all of those people who came, I believe it is before May \n1988--the exact date Senator Simpson can clarify--so that we are really \nnot talking about in any real numbers creating a hardship for those \nadult children who would want to be reunified under the third priority.\n  Mr. President, I really would like to get on.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield for just one more?\n  Mr. KYL. I will yield one more time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Then I will sit down and get my own time. I appreciate my \nfriend's generosity with his time.\n  I wonder if he could just respond to this. Is it not true that the \nindividuals he just described who are already unified, who are \ntogether, are the people that Senator Simpson says his amendment is \nintended to benefit and who, I argue, because of that amendment, are \npeople who really do not need to be unified anyway; they are already \nunified. They, with his amendment, would be pushing out adult children, \nyes--adult children--of U.S. citizens who could not come in and minor \nchildren of U.S. citizens who happen to be married?\n  I want to clarify for the membership who we are really talking about. \nThese are people--850,000 of them--who are already here. My colleague \nsays no one is talking about kicking them out. They are already in the \ncountry. So to me it is a little misleading, or maybe it does not tell \nthe whole story, to use the term we are ``reunifying'' these people--\nand that is the purported sense of the Simpson amendment--when, in \nfact, they are already physically unified. They may not be on paper \nunified but they are here and living together. That is who he intends \nto benefit.\n  I appreciate the Senator's generosity.\n  Mr. KYL. It is a point well made, but I believe the point relates to \nall the categories. As Senator Simpson related before, in all four \ncategories of priorities, there are people here illegally who are \nsimply waiting for their turn to become officially recognized as legal. \nThe largest number is in the first category, and then it goes down in \nnumber to the point in the bottom category it is the fewest.\n  So in each of these categories there are people who are here \nillegally who will have to wait a while before their status can be made \nlegal and who, as my colleague from Ohio rightly points out, are not \ngoing to be kicked out.\n  It is important for us, however, therefore, to focus on this question \nof priority. Senator Simpson and I and others simply believe that the \nfirst priority should be the priority of the Jordan Commission and of \nthe existing law that minor children and spouses are the first to \nreceive their legal status. In some cases, it will be legal status for \nthe first time reunifying the family because the rest of the family is \nnot in the country. In other cases, they are already here, and it is \nsimply legalizing the status quo.\n  The next priority and the priority after that would then come into \nplay. In each case, there are some people who are already here \nillegally who would become legal, and there are others who were abroad \nand would be allowed to come to the country, reunify with the family, \nand eventually become legal. It is all a matter of priorities, Mr. \nPresident.\n  As Senator Simpson noted, one of two things is true: Either we change \nthe priorities--and, again, I do not really think anybody is really \nsuggesting that--or we have to recognize that there are so many people \nwho are eligible that the numbers are going to increase dramatically. I \nthink there is an interesting story.\n  By the way, may I just go back and point out when I talked about \npierceable, I meant to describe what we mean by that. The Simpson \namendment provides for 480,000 admissions per year. The question is \nwhether or not that number is pierceable or not. The Simpson amendment \nis a true number. What you see is what you get. What the Jordan \nCommission recommended was a far lower number, 400,000, but theirs was \npierceable, as is the current bill. ``Pierceable'' means that, because \nadmission of nuclear family members of citizens is unlimited, the \nadmission limit can be pierced. That is the top category, the citizen \ncategory. It is actually two categories, because the citizen's both \nminor children and spouses and then also other relatives of citizens.\n  Because the number of relatives of citizens is unlimited, when we say \nthere is a cap of 480,000 or 400,000 or whatever it may be, that is not \nreally true. It is that number plus however many additional relatives \nof citizens are allowed to come in.\n  The Simpson number is a true number: 480,000, period. Over time, that \nwill accommodate all of the categories that they want to come in. Some \nwill simply have to wait longer than others. We say the ones that \nshould have to wait longer are the more distant relatives, not the \nspouses and the minor children.\n\n  What are the official estimates of how many numbers we are talking \nabout? According to the official INS estimates, immediate relatives \nwill range from 329,000 to 473,000. Mr. President, let me read those \nnumbers again for the benefit of my colleagues. Remember, the Simpson \namendment calls for 480,000 family members--additional employment and \ndiversity numbers--but 480,000 family members. INS' official estimates \nare there will be from 329,000 to 473,000 immediate relatives over the \nnext 7 years, with an average of about 384,000 for immediate relatives.\n  So the number of 480,000 is plenty to accommodate these immediate \nrelatives. There would be about 100,000 additional slots for family-\nbased categories other than the immediate relatives, the people who my \ncolleagues from Ohio and Michigan have primarily addressed, 100,000 a \nyear.\n  It does not provide additional slots for the legalization backlog \nreduction. It is assumed those individuals will be absorbed in the \nimmediate relatives category of U.S. citizens, many of whom, as my \ncolleague noted, are now eligible for naturalization. As I noted, at \nthe end of 5 years this limitation of 480,000 ends anyway. So under the \nofficial INS statistics, there is plenty of room for all of the people \nwho have been talked about here to become legal in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The facts, however, are somewhat different than the official story. \nHere is where we find out the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would \nsay. It appears that there are some informal INS estimates that differ \nfrom the formal estimates. In fact, according to the San Diego Union-\nTribune article that has been mentioned here, there will be a \nsignificant increase, a 41-percent increase in legal immigration that \nthe INS now says will enter the United States over the next 2 years. \nThey have undercalculated or miscalculated too low for the next 2 \nyears, and the fact of the matter is, we are going to see about a 41-\npercent increase in the next 2 years.\n  The article provides details about unreleased data from the INS \nshowing that immigration will rise 41 percent this year and next year \nover 1995 levels. This is the result of an approximate 300,000 \nadministrative backlog of relatives of individuals who have not \nrealized applying for alien status. Therefore, the fact is, under the \nbill as currently written, we are not going to see a slight decrease. \nAs the proponents like to say, we are going to see a huge increase.\n  As Senator Simpson noted, you cannot have it both ways: Either you \nchange the priority, which nobody wants to do, or recognize there have \nto be a whole lot more numbers. The truth is, as the INS-reported \nnumbers in the San Diego paper show, that will be substantially \nincreased over 1995: 41 percent in both years.\n\n  As I said, the Simpson amendment is important because it provides a \ntrue temporary limit. In 1990--in 1990--the level of immigration was \nincreased substantially, by 37 percent. There was an increase because \nit was thought that the new employer sanctions would reduce illegal \nimmigration, as I mentioned before. That has not occurred. We know that \nthere are approximately 4 million illegal immigrants in the country and \nabout 300,000 to 400,000 new\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\nillegal immigrants entering the country each year. So that number has \nto be added to the numbers that we are talking about for legal \nimmigrants.\n  Mr. President, the United States has always been--and, as long as I \nhave anything to say about it, is going to be--a land of opportunity \nboth for U.S. citizens and certainly for all of those who come here \nlegally. But as much as we are a nation of immigrants, we are also a \nnation of laws. We cannot afford, as a nation, to continue to incur the \nunrestrained costs of both legal and illegal immigration in jobs, \nwelfare, education and health care. Senator Simpson is trying to get a \nhandle on this by limiting immigration very slightly over a very \nlimited period of time, 5 years, as the American people have demanded.\n  Unless we reform our legal and illegal immigration laws, I believe we \nwill undermine the United States as a land of opportunity for all, both \nforeign and native born. Everybody has a story to tell how they got \nhere.\n  My grandparents emigrated here from Holland. My grandmother hardly \nspoke English. I am very proud of my Dutch ancestry and the traditions \nthat we have maintained, but I think that my grandparents, who \nassimilated into our society and became Americans, would be rather \nshocked and somewhat disappointed at the way that the system has grown \nover recent years. My guess is that they would be supporting attempts \nof people like Senator Simpson to try to bring the right kind of \nbalance and to try to provide opportunity for all of those who are here \nalready and who we will invite legally to come here in the future.\n  That is why I support the Simpson amendment. I think it is a very \nreasonable amendment. It is even more liberal, if you want to use that \nterm, than the Jordan Commission recommendation. I know that we all \nregret that the chairman of the Jordan Commission, Barbara Jordan, \nherself is not here, cannot be here, because of her untimely death, to \ndefend the rationale for the Jordan Commission report, which, as I \nsaid, is even more conservative in this regard than the Simpson \namendment. But I think we ignore that report at our peril, and we \nignore the sensible arguments that Senator Simpson has made here at our \nperil. As I said, that is why I support and hope that others will \nsupport the Simpson amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have made some \ncomments with regard to the underlying legislation, with regard to the \namendment that is before the Senate, and also in reference to the \nJordan Commission. I will make a brief, brief comment about those \ncomments and also come back to the underlying reason why I am opposed \nto the Simpson amendment.\n  Mr. President, we can talk about numbers, and I will get back to \nwhere we are in terms of numbers, but for the purpose of understanding \nin family terms--in family terms--what this amendment is really all \nabout: If you are an American citizen today, you can bring your wife \nin, you can bring minor children in, you can bring parents in without \nany limitation at all. That is the same with the Simpson proposal and \nthe underlying amendment. That will not change under this particular \nproposal.\n  Under the current law, if you are an American citizen, you can bring \nyour adult children and your brothers and sisters in. There are numbers \nfor those. Today the demand on that does not overrun the numbers which \nare available. We are talking about 23,000 adult children that come in \nand some 65,000 brothers and sisters. All of those get in now \ncurrently. Under the Simpson amendment, there would not be the \nguarantee that those would get in. I think it is highly unlikely they \nwould be admitted.\n  Today, if you are an American citizen, you can bring in the adult \nchildren and the brothers and sisters of American citizens. Beyond \nthat, we also have for the permanent resident aliens, slots for minor \nchildren and spouses. There are numbers for them, but they get in now. \nThey are able to rejoin. We are talking about the minor children and \nthe wives of the permanent resident aliens that are coming in here \ntoday. They are all at risk. There are some 85,000 of those. They get \nin today.\n  Now, what does the Simpson proposal basically do? It provides for a \nlimitation on the overall numbers. Then there is what is called the \nspillover. There are 7,000 slots for that spillover. Mr. President, \n7,000 slots for the spouses and minor children of permanent resident \naliens. It was 85,000 last year. Those wives and those children were \nable to get in here. Under the Simpson proposal, there will only be \n7,000 available.\n  Then the Simpson proposal says if the wives and small children all \nget in here, we will spin what else is left over to take care of the \nadult children and brothers and sisters. That is just pie-in-the-sky if \nyou look at what the numbers are and what the demands are.\n  Effectively, what the Simpson amendment does, by his own description: \nWe will say, OK, we will permit citizens to bring their spouses and \nminor children and parents in here but virtually no one else, at least \nin the first year, because the other groups now, the adult children, \nwhich are 23,000 that are coming in here, and the brothers and sisters, \nwhich are 65,000 that are coming in here, and the children and wives of \nthe permanent resident aliens that are coming in here, Simpson will say \nall of those together will get 7,000 visas.\n  Effectively we are closing the door on those members of the family. \nThat is the principal reason I oppose it. No. 1, it is dealing with \nlegal immigration and not illegal. If we are interested in legal, we \nhave a variety of different additional issues. This is the heart of the \nlegal immigration, the numbers of families. It is the heart of the \nwhole program. Always has been. It is the heart of it. That is what he \nis changing.\n  We say that the reason we have this slight blip in the flow line of \nthe increase is because of a set of circumstances that were put in \nmotion by Senator Simpson, myself, and others who voted for that 1986 \nact and the amnesty. It has taken 12 years or so for those individuals \nto get naturalized that were under the amnesty and now are joining \nmembers of the family. After a couple of years, it begins to go down.\n  As a matter of fact, for example, the total immigration for 1995 in \nthe family preference was 236,000; in the year 2001, it will be \n226,000. These are the latest figures. We have the blip now on personal \nfamily members. We are committed, even with that, when we get to legal \nimmigration, to lower those numbers in a way that is going to be fair \nin terms of the different groups that are coming in here. We are not \nreducing the numbers on the real professionals that are coming in here. \nSenator Simpson reduces it to 100,000. The fact is they are not using \n100,000. Do we understand that? We are not using the 100,000 that is \nincorporated in the Simpson amendment. There is no cutback there. No \ncutback there, my friends. Mr. President, 32 percent in families--no \ncutbacks in the permanent numbers.\n\n  Where are some of those permanent? We are talking about cooks, auto \nmechanics. They will be able to come in here. But the reunifications of \nbrothers and sisters--no, they are not.\n  Mr. President, I do think that what we ought to do is say, Look, on \nthis issue, we had tried. Senator Abraham and myself had offered an \namendment in the Judiciary Committee to reduce the overall numbers by \n10 percent on that. We have found out in recent times that the numbers \nhave bubbled up. Doris Meissner testified in September of last year \nthat the numbers were increasing. Barbara Jordan had highly \nprofessional staffers, and they had access to the same information. \nThey did not identify this kind of a bubble. Senator Abraham \nindicated--and I join with him--when we get to legal immigration, we \nwill see a fair reduction across the board in terms of these visas, 32-\npercent reduction for brothers and sisters and the wives and small \nchildren of permanent residents. Now, that is not fair.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think the argument that has been made by my \ncolleagues and friends about not addressing this issue at this time but \naddressing it at the time we were going to deal with the legal \nimmigration is the preferable way of proceeding.\n  I listened to the presentation of my friend and colleague from \nAlabama,\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\nSenator Shelby, and I watched those charts go up and come down. The \nfact about the presentation was that we had the mixture of legal and \nillegal. He points out that 25 percent are in jail. The problem is \nabout 85 or 90 percent of those are illegals that are in jail. When he \nsays on the chart, looking at this foreign born, ``They are in jail, \nthey are using the system,'' those are illegals. Most are involved in \ndrug selling in the United States. They ought to be in jail. They ought \nto be in jail. They are violating our laws. They are the ones who are \nin jail.\n  The fact of the matter is, as others have pointed out during the \ncourse of this debate, when you are talking about illegal, you are \ntalking about people who are breaking the rules, talking about \nunskilled individuals who are displacing American workers, you are \ntalking about a heavier incidence in drawing down whatever kind of \npublic assistance programs are out there. That is the fact. That is why \nwe want to address it.\n  When you are talking about legals, you are talking about individuals \nwho, by every study, contribute more than they ever take out in terms \nof the tax systems, who do not overutilize any more than any native \nAmerican the public programs for health and assistance--with the one \nexception of the SSI where they have greater use, primarily because of \nthe parents who have come here for children after a period of time are \nolder and therefore need those services. We have addressed that with \nour deeming provisions. We will have an opportunity to go through the \nprogress that has been made in saving the taxpayer fund.\n  We are asking, why are we getting into all of those issues suddenly? \nWe will take some time, when we address the legal immigration issue, to \ngo over what has happened in terms of the deeming provisions for senior \ncitizens. That makes a great deal of sense.\n  Finally, I heard a great deal about the Jordan Commission. The fact \nof the matter, on the Jordan Commission numbers it is recognized it \nwould be 400,000 that would come here with families. They had another \n150,000 in backlog which would be added on to that. They did not even \ninclude refugees, which they cited would be 50,000. You add all of \nthose up and you are talking about 400,000 for family, 100,000 in \nemployment, 150,000 in backlog, and 50,000 in refugees. That comes to \nbetween 700,000 to 750,000. All of these figures are virtually in the \nballpark.\n\n  The point my friend from Arizona left out is that one of the central \nprovisions of the Jordan Commission was to do something about the \nbacklogs of spouses and children. It is out there now. With this \namendment, you are going to make it even worse. You are going to say to \nany spouse or child of any American citizen, ``You are not coming in \nhere for 5 years, and you will be lucky if you get in after that \nbecause of the way this is structured.'' No backlog reduction, ignoring \none of the basic facts.\n  Mr. President, I think the family issue is the most important. We can \nwork out our numbers in ways that it is going to be fair and balanced \nalong the way. We are seeing the tightening of the screw, a 32-percent \nreduction with the Simpson proposal, if this measure is adopted, for \nimmediate members of the family. Nothing in terms of the employment. \nThey were down to 83,000 last year. Senator Simpson allows for 100,000. \nThose numbers can continue to grow. I think that is absolutely wrong.\n  Even if we were dealing on the merits of it, I do not know why we \nshould tighten the belt on families quicker than on those that are \ncoming in and displacing American workers, and, in many instances, they \nare, as I mentioned, auto mechanics and cooks and other jobs. I think \nfamilies are more important than those, if you have to choose between \nthem.\n  Mr. President, we have had a good discussion. Many have spoken about \nthis. I hope the Simpson measure will not be accepted.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, while we are debating the Simpson \namendment on legal immigration, let me stress the need to address the \nproblem of illegal immigration as part of Senate bill 1664. I support \nS. 1664. Madam President, stopping illegal immigration is one of the \nmost difficult problems facing the United States.\n  A recent study concluded that, since 1970, illegal immigrants have \ncost the American people over $19 billion in both direct and indirect \npublic assistance.\n  None of us doubt that illegal immigration is soaring in the country. \nSome estimate that the number of illegal aliens in the United States is \nover 4 million people. Moreover, the number of illegal immigrants \ncoming into the United States is growing by over some 300,000 a year.\n  During the recent recess, I visited many counties in North Carolina. \nIt was very interesting that each county I went into, the county \ncommissioners and the health officials all said, ``We have a particular \nproblem in this country that does not apply to other counties. We are \nbeing inundated with illegal immigrants.'' Well, it became almost a \njoke because each county was of the assumption that they were the only \none that had the problem. The truth of it is, the problem is not only \nstatewide, but it is nationwide. We need to stop it.\n  Illegal immigrants are not supposed to be able to get public \nbenefits; yet, over time, this has been changed. The Supreme Court \nruled that children of illegal immigrants are entitled to a public \neducation. Illegal immigrants are entitled to Medicaid benefits under \nemergency circumstances--which are most circumstances. Further, illegal \naliens may receive AFDC payments and food stamps for their children. \nThis is simply another burden on the working, taxpaying people of this \ncountry. In defiance of all common sense, it seems that only in America \ncan someone who is here illegally be entitled to the full benefits that \nthe Federal Government has to provide.\n  We are stripping the money out of the paychecks of the working \npeople, to support 4-million-plus illegal immigrants. Is it any wonder \nthat they are pouring into the country at an enormous rate of something \nlike 30,000 a month?\n\n  What does this say about the breakdown in the welfare system--that it \ncan provide benefits for illegal aliens? We simply should not be doing \nit. That was not the design of the welfare system. We are bankrupting \nit and corrupting it by continuing to sponsor and support illegal \naliens in this country.\n  Madam President, we have people coming into the United States \nillegally for higher-paying jobs, free schools, food stamps, and \nGovernment-sponsored health care. By flooding the United States, the \nillegal immigrant population is taxing fewer and fewer public \nresources. We simply cannot afford the continuing rise in illegal \nimmigration.\n  Madam President, this bill is not perfect, but at the very least it \nwill attempt to control the flow of illegal immigrants coming into this \ncountry by providing additional enforcement and personnel and by \nstreamlining the deportation procedures, so that they can be removed.\n  Further, this bill will stop the practice of people entering the \ncountry legally--and then going onto our welfare rolls. Anyone who goes \non welfare within 5 years after arriving here can be deported. This is \nnot as much as we ought to be doing, but it is a start.\n  Madam President, we need to pass this bill to stem the flow of \nillegal immigrants. We cannot let this become another issue that the \nDemocrats in the Senate stop. It is too important to stop. For that \nreason, I hope the Senate can act on this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I think we may be nearly ready to \nproperly proceed to a rollcall vote on this issue. And then I think \nthat will remove greater delay, as we move into the other items that \nare in the amendments that we are presently aware of.\n  I hope that people with amendments will submit those, giving us an \nopportunity on both sides of the aisle to see what amendments there may \nbe yet forthcoming, because at some point in time--maybe today--we can \nclose the list of amendments so that at least we would have some \nperspective. I have given up one or two of my amendments--one that \nSenator Feingold and\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\nI debated in committee. I have withdrawn that. I hope that that \nmarvelous, generous act will stimulate others to do such a magnanimous \nthing as to take one of their ``babies,'' one of their very wonderful \nthings, and lay it to rest, perhaps.\n  In any event, I think that we are nearly ready to proceed to a final \nvote on that. I think anything else I would say would be repetitive, \nother than to say that the choices are clear. To do all the things we \nwant to do, which play upon your heartstrings, you have to raise the \nnumbers. If you do not raise the numbers, then you have to make \npriorities. If you are making priorities, it was my silly idea that you \nought to have the priorities as minor children and spouses, and not \nadult brothers and sisters. That is where my numbers would come from. \nNo mystery. That is where they would come from. They would go to \nspouses and minor children and come from adult brothers and sisters, \nwho, in my mind, are removed from the immediate family category. That \ncomes with wife, children, mother, father. All of us surely will \nremember that that is from whence we all sprang.\n\n  We can proceed, hopefully. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I have a couple of more issues that I \nwant to inject at this point relative to this amendment.\n  I know there is at least one, or maybe two, of our colleagues who \nhave come by this morning and indicated they wanted to speak. So I urge \nthem, if they are in their office, or if their staff is watching, at \nthis point to please proceed here if they are still interested. I do \nnot have any intent to prolong the debate much further. But I want to \nmake sure that some people who we had promised to find a time for will \ncome here for that opportunity.\n  I would like to comment again on a couple of points I have been \nmaking today but also on some other issues that have been raised by \nprevious speakers. One is the issue of polls and polling data.\n  I think certainly it is a responsibility of elected officials to be \nobservant of public opinion and constituent views. But I think it is \nalso important to understand that polling and the use of polls is \noftentimes quite contradictory and quite confusing. We all know that \nthe polls have said for years that Americans overwhelmingly want a \nbalanced budget. But then, as we have learned, if they are told it \nmeans something specific that affects them, they all of a sudden have a \nlittle different opinion.\n  In that vein, I say that some of the polling related to immigration \ncan be both, on the one hand, telling and, on the other hand, \ncontradictory. Yes, it is true, overwhelmingly people want to deal with \nthe immigration problems. The polling I have seen suggests, though, \nthat the first priority they have is to deal with illegal immigration. \nThat is why the first bill before us is a bill on illegal immigration.\n  I also suggest that those who say they want to see the number of \npeople who are permitted to come to the country legally reduced, those \nwho say that would have different opinions if they understood the \nramifications that might affect them or their communities. I have not \nseen polls go to that kind of extent. But I suspect if people \nunderstood that the children of U.S. citizens would have a lower \npriority than the children of noncitizens, they would surely not favor \nthat form of legal immigration changes.\n  I also would like to comment just as a postscript to the comments of \nthe Senator from North Carolina. He is deadly accurate in his comments \nabout the impact this bill has on the welfare access that noncitizens \nwill have. Indeed one of the foremost objectives of this bill on \nillegal immigration has been the objective of trying to address the \nissuance of public assistance to noncitizens. One of the reasons we \nthink this is a major problem with regard to immigration has been that \npeople have--some people at least--tried to come here illegally to gain \naccess to benefits. This bill attempts to address it. I think it \nforcefully will.\n\n  The point I would like to touch on now very specifically is the broad \nquestion of numbers because the comments of the Senator from Arizona a \nfew moments ago in the dialog between him and the Senator from Ohio--I \ndo not know how many Members were watching--I thought that was perhaps \nas telling as any other discussion we have had here today on the \nquestion of exactly what really is going to happen if this amendment \npasses.\n  As has been pointed out, the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nhas noted that there will be a spike, an increase, in the number of \npeople who become able to become legal immigrants in the next couple of \nyears under the so-called family preference categories of spouses and \nchildren of U.S. citizens. That is an unlimited category. That is going \nto go up. But what the Senator from Ohio, I think, has said and which I \nthink is important, is that all Senators considering this amendment \nshould understand that increase does not mean new people coming into \nthe United States. What it reflects overwhelmingly is a group of people \nwho, because of the 1986 act which gave amnesty to those in the country \nillegally and a subsequent action by the Congress in 1990 which gave \nquasi-legal status to the spouses of minor children of those who gained \namnesty, these people are largely overwhelmingly already in the United \nStates. Consequently, the increase that has been alluded to is not an \nincrease in people coming to the country; it is a shifting of people \nalready in the country from one category to another, from a quasi-legal \nstatus category to a legal status category. It does not mean a lot more \npeople coming as immigrants to the United States.\n  That said and acknowledged--I might add, by everybody who has spoken \nhere today--let us think about the ramifications of the Simpson \namendment before us. What that amendment will do is basically preclude \nothers who are not already here from coming in huge numbers and in what \nI consider to be appropriate priorities, as I said in my last \nstatement. In other words, people who are noncitizens will be able to \nbring their children to this country and people who are citizens will \nnot be able to bring their children if their children are either \nmarried or adults. That will be the ramification, because the use of \nthese 480,000 visas that are part of this amendment will be exhausted \nby the first categories of the relatives; that is, spouses and minor \nchildren of U.S. citizens and permanent resident noncitizens.\n\n  In short, we will be placing priorities, in my judgment, in the wrong \nbay. We will be giving the children of citizens a lower priority than \nthe children of noncitizens. We will be giving the children of citizens \na lower priority than the children of people who came here as illegal \nimmigrants. We will be giving children of U.S. citizens a lower \npriority simply because of making a paper transaction in the status of \nfolks who are already in the country. That, in my judgment, is not the \nway we should be dealing with legal immigration issues.\n  I also point out that the impact of this is really quite profound. We \nare talking about, I think, turning away from in many ways, really, the \nhistoric basis on which this country was built. Legal immigrants, the \nchildren of U.S. citizens, have been great contributors to this \ncountry. They have come here and made contributions. Literally hundreds \nof this Nation's Medal of Honor winners were legal immigrants. Hundreds \nof people who make contributions in the sciences, high-tech industries, \nand so on, and built our great cities are the children of legal \nimmigrants. This amendment will basically shut the door on them--those \nchildren of legal immigrants who are not minors.\n  Much has been made of this distinction between minors and so-called \nadult or married children, that somehow they are no longer part of the \nnuclear family. Maybe that is true for some families in this world, but \nit is certainly not the case in my mind. It is not the case for the \nSenator from Ohio, as he pointed out. I do not think it should be the \npolicy of the U.S. Government to distinguish in that fashion. I think \nthat would be a huge step in the wrong direction.\n  So, Madam President, I stress that the priorities in the Simpson \namendment in terms of who has access to immigration are wrong. Even if \nyou think there should be changes in legal immigration, these are not \nthe priorities that we should establish.\n  Let me now move on to the point that I made a little earlier in a \nlittle different way. The complexities of\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\nthese issues, the sorting out of what ought to be the priorities, the \nsorting out of what ought to be the method by which people gain legal \naccess to the country ought not be dealt with in this type of vacuum, \nought not to be dealt with as an amendment to the illegal immigration \nbill.\n\n  This Senate should focus--and I would be perfectly happy to have the \ncomments made by an earlier speaker--I would be happy to have the legal \nimmigration at the desk be brought up for full consideration and \npassed. But let us deal with these issues in their totality, not a \nsmall part of them. I think that approach is the wrong way to go.\n  That is why we, from the beginning of this discussion in the \nJudiciary Committee, urged that these issues be divided. It is how the \nHouse did it. It is how the Judiciary here did it, both in the full \ncommittee and in the subcommittee, and that is how the full Senate \nought to do it as well.\n  Finally, we should not lose sight of the fact that countless \norganizations and groups who represent the most directly affected in \nall of this strongly believe in maintaining the separation.\n  It is interesting to note the many organizations that share this \nopinion: The American Electronics Association, American Council on \nInternational Personnel, the American Business Software Alliance, the \nElectronic Industries Association, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Information Technology \nAssociation of America.\n  They believe we should not try to merge these issues of legal \nimmigration into the bill before us, the bill on illegal immigration. \nTheir opinion is the same whether the amendment is one pertaining to \nbusiness immigration or an amendment, as the current one is, that \npertains to family immigration.\n  They believe we should continue the distinction we have made here all \nthe other times we have considered immigration questions, and separate \nthese legal immigration issues that are very weighty and very \ncomplicated from issues of illegal immigration, which are equally \ncomplicated and weighty. And that I strongly urge, Madam President, be \nthe approach we take today.\n  I am perfectly willing to have Senator Simpson's proposals and the \nproposals to be offered later by Senator Feinstein, from California, on \nlegal immigration debated fully here the way that we did in committee \nalong with the rest of the issues that are all around legal \nimmigration.\n  That is the way we should proceed. I do not fear that debate, and I \nsuspect a bill such as was the case in the Judiciary Committee can be \npassed, but the sequence ought to be illegal immigration is the top \npriority. We have a good bill. Let us pass it and conference it with \nthe House bill that is already out there on this topic, and then let us \nbring legal immigration from the desk to the floor and have at that \nissue as well.\n  I know the Senator from Wyoming would like to speak, and there is one \nother Senator on the way here, so I am going to yield the floor at this \ntime.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I believe Senator Gramm is coming to indicate his \nsupport against the amendment so we certainly will withhold. I just \nwant to say to my friend from Michigan, I think what happens in issues \nlike this is you establish a degree of trust. You may have your own \nviews, but we do not lay snares on each other. That is a very important \npart of legislating--to establish trust, and then you get in there and \nbelt it around and then you move on. That is what I do and have always \ndone in 30 years of this work. I have been in some that are much, much \nmore intense than this particular one.\n\n  However, I do have to comment on the one thing that keeps coming back \nlike a theme.\n  Oh, then I wanted to say that there is one group the Senator left off \nof that list, the American immigration lawyers. You would not want to \nleave them off the list. They have messed up more legislation in this \narea than any living group, and they will continue to do it forever. \nThis is their bread and butter. The bread and butter of the American \nimmigration lawyers is confusion. And when you try to do something, you \nuse families, children, mothers, sons and daughters, and violins. That \nis the way they work, but they never give us many other options, nor do \nthe opponents ever give us many options.\n  What priorities would you, I say to the opponents, like to take away \nif you do not raise the numbers? If you do not raise the numbers, what \npriorities of the preference system would you reduce? You cannot have \nit both ways. It cannot be. That is really one of the big issues.\n  Then the argument is we need to separate legal and illegal \nimmigration because legal immigration reform is so important that it \ndeserves our full and separate consideration on the Senate floor. That \nis the theme of all of those who are opposed to this amendment.\n  It is curious, very curious, that many, in the House at least, who \nsupport no benefits at all for permanent resident aliens, none, are \ntalking about that as if it were separate and apart. I do not see how \nthat can be. You are talking about permanent resident aliens. That \nmeans you are talking about illegal immigration and legal immigration. \nYou cannot separate them.\n  It is a purpose of the original measure--and I compliment those who \ncreated this remarkable--not the Senator from Michigan. Some of the \nthink tanks, whoever, some of the Government reps. Give them the \ncredit. When you see it work, give them the credit. I compliment them \non that issue because here we are--and this is the curious part. They \nsay out there, down the street, wherever they are, in support of the \nargument, that the House voted to divide the legal and illegal issues. \nThat is very true. The House voted to split their bill, and I assume \nthe same arguments were made about the importance of legal immigration \nand the need to deal with that separately.\n  What actually occurred in the House is quite instructive. Legal \nimmigration in the House is dead--dead. That is exactly what the \nmessage was in the House--dead. It will never get the careful and \nseparate consideration that this body wishes to give to the issue--\nperiod. That is exactly what many of those who complain about combining \nthe issues want--death. They want to kill legal immigration in all of \nits reforms, in every form of reform as suggested by the Commission on \nImmigration Reform. They want to kill legal immigration reform in any \nform, in any incubation, in any rebirth, in any form in the Senate just \nas it has happened in the House. They do not want a reduction of \nnumbers. They do not want reform of the priorities. They want death, \nand that has worked very well in the House.\n\n  In the Senate, I appreciate the remarks of those in opposition \nbecause they are telling me they want a separate and careful \nconsideration. I think that is great. I am going to wait for that. I am \nwaiting for the separation. I will wait after this bill is finished to \nhear the separate and careful consideration of legal immigration. It is \nvery pleasing to me to know that we will have that debate, I take it. I \nam overjoyed. Perhaps we can work out a time agreement. Perhaps we can \nwork up the amendments. I would certainly drop away from some of the \nthings. But to know that these things should be separated and to know \nwith a heartening of my bosom that we will have that separate and \ncareful consideration of legal immigration, that will be a very \nappropriate response at some future time. I think that all of us then \nwill be looking forward to that because we know that in the House it \nwas simply the death knell, and to hear it is not here is quite \nheartening.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I would like to reiterate the sincerity of my comments \nwith respect to having the legal immigration bill considered \nseparately. I was under the impression--during the April recess, in \nfact, I was approached, I know, by the majority leader and asked if \nthat was an acceptable approach. I know that the people who are here \ntoday arguing that these issues be maintained separately, approved and \nsigned off and said they were fully supportive of having that bill come \nto the floor.\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\n  It was my understanding that the Senator from Wyoming had opposed \nthat, and so I am a little bit uncertain right now exactly what did \nhappen a couple of weeks ago. But I would just reiterate, from my point \nof view, our sincerity, and I guess my understanding was that a \nproposal to bring the legal bill to the floor had been rejected by the \nchairman of the Immigration Subcommittee.\n  Maybe I got the wrong story, but it is my understanding that offer \nwas already extended and rejected. That is why, instead, we are here \ntoday trying to merge these issues, notwithstanding the fact that the \nHouse sought to split them, notwithstanding the fact that the Senate \nJudiciary Committee sought to split them. But I will reserve further \ncomments for the moment. I see other speakers here.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I guess I remain somewhat skeptical--not of the Senator. \nOf course there is no House conference, but we will hold the debate. I \nthink that is good. It will be good for America. I yield to the Senator \nfrom Texas--I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the pending \namendment. There is something in American folklore that induces us to \nbelieve that America has become a great and powerful country because \nbrilliant and talented people came to live here. There is something in \nthe folklore of each of our families that leads us to believe that we \nare unique. We all have these stories in the history of our families, \nof how our grandfathers came here as poor immigrants who did not speak \nthe language.\n  I love to tell the story of my wife's family. My wife's grandfather \ncame to America as an indentured laborer, where he signed a contract to \ncome to America with a sugar plantation where he agreed to work a \nnumber of years to pay off that contract. And, when he had worked off \nthat contract, he looked in a picture book and picked out the picture \nof a young girl and said, ``That's the one I want.'' And he tore that \npicture out of the book and sent for her to come to America to be his \nwife.\n  His son became the first Asian American ever to be an officer of a \nsugar company in the history of Hawaii. And his granddaughter--my \nwife--became Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nwhich, among other commodities and commodity futures, regulates the \nmarket for cane sugar in the United States of America.\n  I could have told much the same story about Spence Abraham, and about \nhis grandfather coming to this country, and about my own grandfather, \nwho came from Germany. But the point is, each of us in our own family \nhas a folklore that basically tells a story, and the story is partly \ntrue but it is not totally true.\n  Folklore holds that America became a great country because of us; \nthat America is a great and powerful country because these brilliant \npeople from Lebanon and from Korea and from Germany and from everywhere \nin the world came to live here and their innate genius made America the \nrichest, freest and happiest country in the world.\n  And because we believe that, we believe that America became great \nbecause we were unique and this miracle only worked for us, but it is \nnot going to work for other people; that is, if people come here and \nthey look different than we do or they sound different than we do or if \ntheir customs are different than ours or if their native clothing is \ndifferent than ours, somehow they are different where we were unique \nand made America great by our coming, they are ``different'' and it \nwill not work on them. That is a myth, and this amendment is based \nfundamentally on a belief in that myth.\n  America is not a great and powerful country because the most \nbrilliant and talented people in the world came to live here. America \nis a great and powerful country because it was here that ordinary \npeople like you and me have had more opportunity and more freedom than \nany other people who have ever lived on the face of the Earth. And, \nwith that opportunity and with that freedom, ordinary people like us \nhave been able to do extraordinary things.\n  While it is somehow not so reassuring about ourselves to say it, it \nis very reassuring about our country to know it. Most of us would be \npeasants in almost any other country in the world. We are extraordinary \nonly because our country is extraordinary.\n  Now, with the best of intentions, this amendment says that we have \nimmigrants coming to America and by getting here and getting a foothold \nand getting a job and building a life, that they are reaching out as \neach of us would do if we came from somewhere else, and they are trying \nto bring their mama and their daddy and their sisters and brothers and \ntheir cousins and their aunts to America. So what?\n\n  Let me just take that one point and develop it for a moment, if I \nmay. Of all immigrant groups in America, to the best of my ability to \nascertain, the identifiable group that uses things like the fifth \npreference in the immigration laws, the people who are the most focused \non their extended family, the people, as immigrants to America, who \nhave reached out the most to try to bring their families to America, \nare people who are from the Indian subcontinent.\n  Probably more than any other immigrants, at least if one looks at the \nuse of things like the fifth preference--and I am not an expert in this \narea, but a fifth preference is a preference where you are trying to \nbring somebody in who is not, by the conventional definition, that \nclose kin--this is a group that has used this provision of law that \nthis amendment tries to reduce.\n  Let us look at a subsample of this group--Indian Americans. No. 1, of \nall identifiable ethnic groups in America, Indian Americans have the \nhighest per capita income. Some people might find that shocking. The \naverage Indian American in this country makes more money than does the \naverage Episcopalian--which, if you break down by religious groups, is \nthe highest income group in America. The average Indian American makes \nsubstantially more money than the average American who traces his or \nher lineage back to Great Britain. Madam President, 50 percent of all \nmotels in America are owned by Indian Americans. In fact, 80 percent of \nthem have the same family name. If you go to a hotel and you see an \nIndian American working there, and the chances are you are going to, \nand you want to guess at his name or her name, say, ``Mr. or Mrs. \nPatel,'' and you are going to be right 80 percent of the time. Now, \nthis is not the same family, but it is a very common name.\n  The point being, why in the world are we trying to keep out of \nAmerica an ethnic group that has the highest per capita income and the \nhighest average education level in the country? It struck me as I was \nwalking over here for this debate, I was talking to my youngest \nlegislative assistant, named Rohit Kumar, Indian American, honor \ngraduate from Duke University, that his family story is a perfect \nexample of why we ought to crush this amendment. Let me just tell his \nfamily story.\n  His father and mother came to this country in 1972. They did not come \non any kind of family preference. They were original immigrants. They \nboth became medical doctors.\n\n  They then started the process of bringing their family to America. \nThey brought their brother. He became a doctor. In fact, he is an \noncologist in northern California. He brought his wife, who became an \ninterior designer. They brought their nephew, who is a computer \nengineer. And they brought their father.\n  My point is, and I am a conservative as many of you know, but if we \nadd up the combined Federal income tax that was paid 10 days ago by the \npeople who came to America as a result of this first Kumar who came in \n1972, this little family probably paid, at a minimum, $500,000 in \ntaxes. Our problem in America is we do not have enough Kumars, working \nhard and succeeding. We need more.\n  Why do we want to stop this process? We want to stop it because \nsomehow we believe that people are changing America instead of America \nchanging people. We could have had this debate in the early 1900's. In \nfact, my guess is if we went back somewhere, we would find we did have \nthe debate, because in\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\nthe years between 1901 and 1910, we had, on average, 10.4 immigrants \ncome to America each year for every 1,000 Americans. From 1911 to 1920, \nwe had 5.7 immigrants per year per 1,000 Americans; from 1921 to 1930, \nwe had 3.5. Today, even though the number of immigrants in 1995 was \njust 2.8 per 1,000 Americans, some would have us believe we are just \nbeing flooded, we are being overrun by these people who become doctors \nand engineers and pay all these taxes, and I could mention win Nobel \nPrizes.\n  I could read the list of foreign-born Americans who have won the \nNobel Prize, except the list is too long. I could read down the list of \npeople who have become historic names in the scientific history of our \ncountry, names that we now think about and the world thinks about as \nAmerican names, including Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 \nin economics, and Franco Modigliani, who won the Nobel Prize for \neconomics in 1985. As a graduate student, I had no idea that they were \nforeign born.\n  The point is, the list goes on and on, full of people who have come \nhere, who have caught fire, who have unleashed creative genius that has \nmade America the greatest country in the world, and they may have \nbrought their mothers. Great. May it never end. Could America be \nAmerica without immigrants?\n  I know there are people who say, ``Well, they're taking our jobs.'' I \nwant to make just one point about that. Go out in Washington today, go \nto a shoe store where they are repairing shoes, go to a laundry, go \ninto a restaurant, in the kitchen of a restaurant, go any place in \nAmerica where people are getting their hands dirty, and do you know \nwhat they are going to discover? They talk funny.\n  People who work for a living in America often talk with distinct \nforeign accents. Do you know why? Because we have a welfare system that \nrewards our own citizens for not working. A lady in Washington, DC, \nwith one child on welfare, if she qualifies for the four big programs, \nearns what $21,000 of income would be required to buy. I do not think \nit is fair to say because people come to America and they are willing \nto work, when some Americans are not, that they are taking jobs away. I \nthink that is our problem; that is not their problem. I know how to fix \nthat. The way to fix it is to reform welfare and, at least on my side \nof the aisle, there is unanimity we ought to do that.\n  Let me also say that there is a provision in the bill--and I am a \nstrong supporter of the underlying bill--that changes law, a change \nthat is needed, and I congratulate our distinguished colleague, Senator \nSimpson, for his leadership in this. He and I worked on this together \non the welfare bill. It is part of this bill, and it is vitally \nimportant.\n  We change the law to say that you cannot come to America as an \nimmigrant and go on welfare. We have room in America for people who \ncome with their sleeves rolled up, ready to go to work. But we do not \nhave room for people who come with their hand out.\n  Let us remember that when people come to America legally and go to \nwork, and with their energy and with the sweat of their brow they build \ntheir life, they build the future of our country.\n\n  A final point that I want to address is this whole question about the \nchanging nature of immigration. There is something in each of us that \nleads us to believe that we are the unique Americans, that somehow we \nmade the country what it is, that somehow it was because American \nimmigration in the early days was basically drawn first from northern \nEurope and then from southern Europe that it made us somehow unique.\n  I think it was the system that made America, and we might have had \nthis debate in the year of 1900 when the immigration patterns of the \ncountry had shifted to southern Europe and eastern Europe. I am sure at \nthe turn of the century there were those in corporate boardrooms who \nwere wondering what was going to happen in America with the changing \nmakeup of the country when they, as people from British stock who had \ncome to the country on the Mayflower or in some historic voyage, had to \nshare their America with Americans who had come from Germany or from \nItaly or with Americans who had come from all over the world who were \nof the Jewish faith. I do not doubt somebody in 1900, and maybe a lot \nof people, worried about it.\n  But look what happened. Did those of us who came from other places \nprove less worthy of being Americans than the colonists? Did we find \nourselves less worthy successors of the original revolution? I do not \nthink so.\n  I believe we have room for people who want to come and work because \nAmerica could not be America without immigrants. The story that is \nuniquely American is the story of people coming to America to build \ntheir dream and to build the American dream. I have absolutely no fear \nthat by people coming to America legally and to work--no one should \ncome to America to go on welfare--that America's future is going to be \ndiminished by that process. I believe their new vision, their new \nenergy will transform our country, as it has always transformed it, and \nwe will all be richer for it.\n  The bill before us tries to stop illegal immigration. We have an \nobligation to control the borders of our country.\n\n  I am proud of the fact that in my year as chairman of Commerce, \nState, Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, we began the process to \ndouble the size of the Border Patrol and we enhanced the strength of \nthat action in this bill. We deny people who come to America illegally \nwelfare benefits, and we deny those benefits to people who come here \nlegally. We do not want people coming to America to go on welfare.\n  But I do not believe we have a problem today in America with people \nwho have come to this country and succeeded and who want to bring their \nbrother or their cousin or their mother here. When you look at the \npeople who are doing that, you find that they are the ones who are \nenriching our country.\n  A final point, and I will yield the floor. It has struck me as I have \ncome to know ethnic Americans that many ethnic groups fight an unending \nand losing battle to try to preserve their identity in America. It is a \nlosing battle because what happens is that young people who grow up in \nthis country become Americans. There is no way that can ever be \nchanged. Any differences that concern us very quickly vanish in this \ncountry with great opportunity, where people are judged on their \nindividual merit.\n  What we are talking about today is trying to stop illegal \nimmigration, which is what we should do, but we should not back away \nfrom our commitment to letting people come to America to build their \ndream and ours. We should not close the door on people who want to \nbring their relatives to America as long as their relatives come to \nwork, as long as they continue to achieve the amazing success that \nimmigrants have achieved in America.\n  There are a lot of things we ought to worry about before we go to bed \nevery night. We ought to worry about the deficit. We ought to worry \nabout the tax burden. We ought to worry about the regulatory burden. We \nought to even worry about the weather. But as long as we preserve a \nsystem which lets ordinary people achieve extraordinary things, we do \nnot have to worry that our country is somehow going to be diminished \nwhen an immigrant has gotten here, succeeded, and put down roots and \nthen wants to bring a sister or mother to America. If that is all you \nhave to worry about, you do not have a problem in the world. Let me \nassure you, I do not worry about it. I do not want to tear down the \nStatue of Liberty. There is room in America for people who want to \nwork.\n  I remember, as a closing thought, 3 years ago I was chairman of the \nNational Republican Senatorial Committee, and we had a big event where \nwe invited our supporters from all over the country. I do not know \nwhether it just happened to be the letter I sent out that time or what, \nbut for some remarkable reason, about 80 percent of the people who came \nto this particular event were first-generation Americans. As a result, \nthey all talked funny.\n  So we were about a day into the meeting and this sweet little lady \nfrom Florida stood up in the midst of this meeting and with all \nsincerity said to me, ``Senator Gramm, why do all the people here talk \nfunny?'' Boy, there was a collective gulp that you could have heard 100 \nmiles away. So I thought for a minute, and in one of the better answers \nthat I have given in my\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\npolitical life I said, ``Ma'am, 'cause this is America.''\n  If we ever get to the point where we do not have a few citizens who \ntalk funny, if we ever get to the point where we do not have a new \ninfusion of energy and a new spark to the American dream, then the \nAmerican dream is going to start to fade and it is going the start to \ndie. It is not going to fade and it is not going to die on my watch in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am glad to.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I just want to compliment my colleague from Texas for one \nof the most eloquent statements I have heard since I have been in the \nU.S. Senate, a little over a year. His story of his family, but frankly \nmost particularly his story of Wendy Gramm's family, his lovely wife, \nis America's story. I have heard him, because he and I have been out \ncampaigning before together, I have heard him tell that story I think \neight or nine times. Each time I hear it, I am still touched by it \nbecause it is truly America's story.\n  I will also compliment him on his comments about chain migration. \nWhen you look at the chart of chain migration, that is America's story, \ntoo. Those are people who are trying to bring their families here. You \nsee it--and, again, it is anecdotal--but you see it when you go into \nrestaurants in Ohio or you go into dry cleaning stores or you go into \nany kind of establishments in Ohio, Washington, or Texas.\n  You see people in there who, you just assume they are all family. You \ndo not know whether they are brothers or cousins or who. They are all \nworking. They are working. That is what is the American dream. That is \nwhat has made this country great. I just want to compliment him on \nreally, after kind of a long, difficult debate, coming over to the \nfloor and really cutting through some of our rhetoric and just getting \nright down to it. I compliment him for that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I think we have had a good debate. I listened \nattentively to the remarks of my friend from Texas. I heard him speak \nof a woman who is remarkable, Wendy Gramm. I can only tell him that \npeople have told me many times in the past years that anyone who knows \nSenator Phil Gramm and Senator Al Simpson and knows Wendy Gramm and Ann \nSimpson, knows that the two of us severely overmarried--severely. In \nfact, a lot of people do not vote for us; they vote for them. But that \nis just an experience that I share.\n\n  As we close the debate, I hope we can keep this in perspective. We \nwill continue to have the most open door of any country in the world, \nregardless of what we do here. The numbers in my amendment are higher \nthan they have been for most of the last 50 years. We will continue to \nhave the most generous immigration policy in the world. We take more \nimmigrants than all the rest of the world combined. We take more \nrefugees than all the rest of the countries in the world combined. That \nis our heritage. We have never turned back.\n  An interesting country, started by land gentries, highly educated \npeople, sophisticates who came here for one reason--to have religious \nfreedom. The only country on Earth founded in a belief in God. That is \ncorny nowadays, but that is what we have in America. And it will always \nbe so. People who came here were not exactly ragamuffins. They read \nLocke and Montesquieu and Shakespeare and the classics. Interesting \ncountry. No other country will ever have a jump-start like that in the \nhistory of the world, period. So it is unique, it is extraordinary.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3737\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Let me have a call for the regular order. I alert my \nfriend, Senator Kennedy, that I call for the regular order with respect \nto the Coverdell amendment of last night. That was 3737. It was laid \ndown. There was debate. It was held back, the Coverdell amendment.\n  Mr. President, I call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The amendment is now before \nthe Senate.\n  (The text of amendment No. 3737 was printed in the Record of April \n24, 1996.)\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I know of no other speakers on that \namendment. I believe the managers are prepared to accept that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3737) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3739\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3739.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second. There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment N0. 3739. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Is this a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it is not a unanimous-consent request. It \nwas felt that the parties had resolved this and so it was presented on \nthat basis. There was to be little debate, as I understood it, and I \nwas told that there would be a motion to table within 20 or 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding there is no \ntime agreement.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, that is correct. I think we will see it \ntake place in its ephemeral form, somewhat obscure but nevertheless \nquite appropriate, I think.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3740 to amendment No. 3725\n\n (Purpose: To limit and improve the system for the admission of family-\n                         sponsored immigrants)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have 10 \nminutes on amendment 3740. I should like to take 5 minutes of that time \nand then have 5 minutes accorded to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator send the amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I call up the amendment. The amendment is at the \ndesk. The amendment is No. 3740.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3740.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will explain the amendment this way.\n  Essentially, the amendment is a compromise between the Simpson \namendment and what is in the bill as a product of the Abraham-Kennedy \namendment.\n  I believe we need to stop the pierceable cap, and my amendment would \nplace a hard cap on family totals of 480,000, which is the current law, \nwithout the anticipated increase. It would stop the spillover from the \nunused employment visas, the loophole in the current system. And it \nwould not close out the preference categories.\n  Under my family amendment, parents and adult children are guaranteed \nto receive visas every year, remaining consistent with the goal of \nfamily reunification. The amendment allocates visa numbers on a sliding \nscale basis for parents and adult children of citizens, allowing for \nincreases in visas when the numbers fall within the unlimited immediate \nfamily category, always remaining within the hard cap of 480,000. It \nwould allow a backlog clearance of spouse and minor children of \npermanent residents by allowing 75 percent of any visas left over \nwithin the family total to be allocated for this category's backlog \nclearance.\n\n  Now, to control chain migration, which Commissioner Doris Meissner \ntold me is created by the Sibling of Citizens category, it places a \nmoratorium on that category for 5 years, but if there are any visas \nleft over with the hard cap of 480,000, the amendment would allow 25 \npercent of the leftover to be used for the backlog clearance of \nsiblings, those who have been waiting for many, many years.\n  The point of this is that if we do not address this issue, the \nnumbers swell 41 percent over what we were indicated they would be in \ncommittee to nearly a million. This creates the hard total of 480,000. \nIt permits the sliding scale down the family preference, and it \neliminates what is the chain migration concern that had been raised by \nmany in committee.\n  I believe it is a modest amendment to control overall numbers. Coming \nfrom the State with the largest numbers, with the absence of classes \nfor youngsters, with the cutbacks in welfare money, with the absence of \nadequate housing for people, we cannot keep taking 40 percent of the \nNation's total of legal immigrants, of refugees, of asylees, and \ntherefore I think this is a prudent, modest, fair compromise.\n  So, again, we would place a hard cap at the current law level, \n480,000. We would close a loophole where unused employment visas spill \nover into the family immigration numbers, and we would guarantee that \nclose family members of citizens get visas each year with flexible \nlimits allowing an increase in the allocation of visas with decreases \nin the immediate family categories.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is essentially the same amendment \nthat we just disposed of. Once you maintain the cap that Senator \nFeinstein does as well as Senator Simpson, you use up 472,000, which \nleaves 7,000 left over. Senator Simpson targeted those to the wives and \nchildren of permanent resident aliens. Senator Feinstein spreads those \nout--adult unmarried citizens, adult children of citizens.\n  Quite frankly, I think we ought to be dealing with this in the legal \nimmigration, but if you had to ask me I would rather put them in for \nthe children and married members of permanent resident aliens. We are \ntalking about 7,000 visas on this--7,000. That is the amount that will \nbe available under this. So I really fail to see how this is very much \nmore than sort of Simpson-like.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from California. It is a good-faith effort to try to respond to \nthe critics of the Simpson amendment, and I think it does a very good \njob of doing that.\n  As Senator Kennedy pointed out just now, however, it does retain the \ncap of 480,000, and this is what we are trying to say here today. You \nreally cannot have it both ways. You cannot say that we are not \nincreasing illegal immigration and then not do anything to achieve that \ngoal, because under the bill as written, immigration is going to \nskyrocket. That is what the INS figures and formally reported by the \nSan Diego Union paper said: 40 percent next year; 41 percent the year \nafter that.\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\n  If we are willing to accept those large numbers, then we should be up \nfront about that. But everyone who has supported the bill out of \ncommittee and opposed the Simpson amendment has inferred that we are \nreally not going to increase numbers at all. The fact is, we would \nincrease them.\n  Under both the Simpson and Feinstein amendment, we would have a cap. \nSo that problem, the problem of, in effect, runaway numbers, is solved \nby this cap of 480,000. But at the same time, Senator Feinstein is \nattempting to respond to the criticism that opponents of the Simpson \namendment made, which is that all of the preference could be used up by \nthe first category, theoretically, and you would never guarantee that \nsome of the second, third and fourth preferences could be satisfied.\n  So what Senator Feinstein has done is to say there will be certain \nslots left open for, for example, the grown children of citizens or \nsiblings and, therefore, to the extent the 480,000 cap was not reached \nby the first preference, that the other preferences would each have a \nnumber--and it is not 7,000, the numbers would range between 35,000, \n75,000, depending upon how many are available.\n  Just in conclusion, it seems to me this is a good-faith effort to \ndeal with legitimate concerns that were raised, but, yes, it is also \ntrue that there is an absolute cap of 480,000, because the purpose here \nis twofold: to allow several different categories, each to have a \nnumber of slots to be made legal under our system, but at the same time \ndraw an overall limit so that annually no more than 480,000 would be \npermitted to come in under this particular family category.\n  So I think the Feinstein amendment is a good compromise, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond, if I might, \nto the argument raised by the Senator from Massachusetts. Using an \nImmigration and Naturalization Service document entitled ``Immigration \nand Backlog Reductions Under Current Law,'' and adding the three \ncategories--spouses and children's space, spouses and children's \nchange, an increase due to legalization through IRCA, here are the \ntotals that we come up with: In fiscal year 1995, 206,000; in fiscal \nyear 1996, 270,000; in fiscal year 1997, 370,000; in fiscal year 1998, \n349,000. The highest year would be 1997, which leaves 110,000 even in \n1997 to filter down through the categories.\n\n  I ask that the chart entitled ``Immigration and Backlog Reductions \nUnder Current Law''--these are assumptions, so I recognize that \ndepending on the assumptions that one uses, you can get different \nfigures. These are the ones that, again, are a little different from \nwhat Senator Kennedy is working on because they project this very large \ntotal at the bottom of 1 million in 1995, of 984,000 in 1996, of \n600,000 in 1997. Those are the total numbers.\n  So I think if these come in to be the case, even in the most \ndifficult year, there is 110,000 that would filter down through the \nremaining categories.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could have a moment to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. These various charts have been provided by the INS to \nme, as well as the other chart on which we have the numbers. I will put \nthose that were provided by the INS in, and I refer the Senator, if she \nhas these same charts--we do not have to take the time of the Senate. \nWe will be glad to have a quorum or let others speak.\n  But it points out in 1997, there is 472,781. That is the immediate \nrelative estimate, 472,000. If you have 472,000 and you have a cap at \n480,000, it means you have 7,151 left over. The idea of representing to \nthis body that we are going to spill some of those over into these \ncategories is a stretch, I just say.\n  Those numbers, in fairness to the Senator, build over a period of \ntime. There are still 40,000 in 1998; 86,000 in 1999. So those numbers \nstill go up, but they still do not justify the kind of spilldown in the \ncoverage that the Senator has explained.\n  It says 7,151 here, which was provided by the INS and 7,151. I will \nbe glad to go into a quorum call to make sure we are not talking about \ndifferent charts, but these were the ones provided by the INS. Whatever \ntime--it is Senator Abraham's time and Senator Feingold's time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would appreciate being apprised of the \ncircumstances with respect to time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit or time designated. It \nwas an approximate time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I was not sure whether that had actually been formulated \nin a unanimous-consent agreement. If not, let me make a couple of quick \npoints.\n  I do not think we want to extend the debate unnecessarily here, \nbecause the issues on this amendment are virtually identical to the \nissues that were on the floor in the context of Senator Simpson's \namendment.\n  The fact is that this is almost the same amendment as Senator \nSimpson's amendment. As we heard, modest efforts are being made to \napply some of these visas to, as I understand it, some of the other \ncategories besides the children and spouses of permanent residents, but \nit is going to work out, as Senator Kennedy has said, to a very, very \nfew, just because those categories will consume such a high percentage \nof the visas that are going to be available under this very substantial \namendment.\n  Second, the priorities, as I see them, that were established in the \nprevious amendment are in this amendment as well. Once again, we see an \noverwhelming percentage of the immigration that will be legal under \nthis amendment going not to the children of citizens of the United \nStates, adult children or married children, but rather to the children \nof noncitizens, many of whom are, in fact, individuals who were once \nillegal aliens. It seems to me those priorities are not the appropriate \nones that we should establish.\n  But I have to say, Mr. President, already just in the discussion that \nhas happened in the first few minutes of this amendment, it is quite \nclear--we just received this amendment late this afternoon--the \nprojections that are being made are hypothetical projections. There is \nconfusion with respect to this amendment.\n  It is unclear to me, after studying it for the last hour or so, \nexactly what its effects will be. At least we had a little bit of time \nto look at the effects of the previous amendment. But from what I can \ntell, it would definitely cut overall family preference immigration by \nroughly 60 percent. It would cap and slash the immigration of parents \nof U.S. citizens. It would cut the immigration of adult children of \nU.S. citizens by over 60 percent. It would eliminate all immigration of \nsiblings, basically. These are dramatic changes in the legal \nimmigration laws of this country.\n  As I said with some frequency during the debate on the last \namendment, Mr. President, they should be dealt with separately from the \ndebate on illegal immigration. These are two very distinct issues with \na very powerful and important impact on citizens of this country and \ntheir families.\n  We should deal in this bill with illegal immigration. We should \nmaintain the split which was put together in the Judiciary Committee \nthat divided these two. We should follow the lead of the House keeping \nlegal immigration separate from illegal immigration.\n  Even if we were to consider legal immigration, I once again argue it \nshould not be done in this type of piecemeal fashion, such weighty, \ncomplicated amendments brought in this fashion. It is impossible to \neven determine the potential impact of this amendment.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I urge the Senate to once again \nfollow the lead of the last amendment, keep these issues separate, keep \nlegal immigration separate from illegal immigration, pursue ahead \ntoday, and let us get a good illegal immigration bill through the \nSenate. I think it will address many of these problems. Then let us \ntake the legal immigration bill that is at the desk, and then let us \ndeal with that in a deliberative fashion here on the floor of the \nSenate. I think that is the way we should go.\n  This amendment is hardly different from the last one. It has the same \npriorities, has the same dramatic changes. I strongly oppose it.\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, for those Members in the Chamber or those \nMembers watching back in their offices, this is really the same vote \nthat we just had. It is not substantially changed. The issues are \nessentially the same. I am not going to take the time of my colleagues \nto wade through this again. We had about 6 or 7 hours already today on \nvery, very similar issues. It is essentially the same vote.\n  This bill still, I say with all due respect, is antifamily, is \nantifamily reunification. It flies in the face of the best traditions \nof our country as far as immigration policy is concerned. It mixes, \nunfortunately, the legal immigration issue and the illegal immigration \nissue. This is the illegal immigration bill. We should continue the \ntradition, and we should continue what the Judiciary Committee did, and \nthat is to not mix the two.\n  This is the sheet that has been passed out. When you go through it, \nwhat you really find is that it is very, very similar to the previous \namendment, very, very similar to the previous issue. It is true that \nsome of these slots have been sprinkled down into some of the family \ngroups, but effectively--effectively--it is very, very little. \nThe essence then is that it is pretty much the same vote that we had a \nfew minutes ago. I urge my colleagues again to reject the amendment.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I agree with the comments of \nthe Senators from Massachusetts, Michigan, and Ohio. We just had an \noverwhelming vote, that I think in large part reflected the will of \nthis body, that the legal and illegal immigration issues have to be \nkept separate. I am sure there were a variety of concerns, as well, \nabout the specifics of the previous amendment. But the overwhelming \nsentiment, I think, is that these issues have to be kept separate.\n  As indicated in the comments during that debate, that last vote was \nthe vote on whether or not we should take up the legal immigration \nissues in this bill or not. The vote was very overwhelming.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts suggests that this amendment might be \nreferred to as Simpson-like. I differ. I argue that it is more like \nperhaps ``Simpson, the sequel,'' because in both amendments you have \nthis absolute cap. The consequence of that, I think, is very real for \nfamilies that want to be reunited. In fact, there is an element of the \nFeinstein amendment that is even harsher.\n  As I understand, the amendment provides for a 5-year moratorium on \nsiblings being able to come into the country and be reunited in this \nway. At least the Simpson amendment provided for a category, although, \npractically speaking, it was pretty clear we would never get to that.\n  I think anyone who thinks that this is somehow a major compromise or \nsplitting the difference between current law and the Simpson \namendment--I think that would be inaccurate. But the most important \npoint is that because of this amendment, if we go this route, there \nwill be families who are conducting themselves legally, who today could \nlegally obtain a visa and will not obtain a visa. Those families will \nnot be reunited. That is what will happen because of this amendment.\n  In the end, Mr. President, obviously, this is a legitimate debate. It \nis the kind of thing we should do out here, but we should do it at the \nright time. There is a legal immigration bill where this subject could \nbe brought up and dealt with at the appropriate time to review this \namendment.\n  So in light of the last vote, in light of the fact that this will \nhave a real harsh consequence on many families conducting themselves \nlegally, in light of the fact that this body clearly has indicated a \ndesire to keep these issues separate, I urge that the amendment be \nrejected. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted.

Mr. President, I think we are ready to vote on this side. \nWe thoroughly debated this issue. In fact, we debated it all day. This, \nin reality, is the same amendment we voted on before. It simply does \nthe same thing in a different way. This amendment, in our opinion, is \nwrongheaded and wronghearted. It needs to be defeated. I hope we can \nmaintain the 80 votes we had before. I hope everyone who voted against \nthe previous amendment will vote exactly the same way they did for \nexactly the same reason. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, I seek unanimous consent to change my \nvote on rollcall No. 82 from yesterday, April 24, 1996. At the time of \nthe vote, I did not realize it was a tabling motion. Had I realized \nthat, I would have voted ``no'', not to table it. This vote change, if \nI get unanimous consent, in no way would change the outcome of the \nvote.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the permanent Record be \nchanged to reflect that I support the Dorgan amendment No. 3667 and \nthat I oppose the motion to table the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as the U.S. Senate continues to debate the \nillegal immigration reform legislation, I would like to make a brief \nstatement on an issue of importance to the State of Hawaii and our \nNation. Tourism is\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\nthe No. 1 industry in the State of Hawaii. The State has expressed an \ninterest in extending the current Visa Waiver Pilot Program to other \nAsian countries, particularly the Republic of Korea. The current Visa \nWaiver Pilot Program covers only three countries in the Asia-Pacific \nregion: Japan, New Zealand, and Brunei. New Zealand, Canada, and Guam \nall have visa waiver agreements with Korea. Since implementing visa \nwaiver agreements with Korea, arrivals increased in the first year by \n285 percent to New Zealand, 96 percent to Canada, and 147 percent to \nGuam. In 1995, the State of Hawaii wecomed over 120,000 visitors from \nKorea, and the State is anxious to see future growth in visitors from \nthis important emerging market.\n  Travel and tourism also play a major role in reducing the United \nStates unfavorable balance of trade. There is an increasing demand by \ncitizens of the Republic of Korea to visit the United States. In fiscal \nyear 1994, 320,747 nonimmigrant visas were issued to Korean travelers. \nIn fiscal year 1995, 394,044 nonimmigrants visas were issued to Korean \ntravelers. Of this amount, 320,120 were tourist visas.\n  The Republic of Korea is not eligible to participate in the current \nVisa Waiver Pilot Program. On March 14, 1996, I, along with Senators \nMurkowski, Akaka, and Stevens, introduced S. 1616, legislation that \nwould establish a 3-year Visa Waiver Pilot Program for Korean nationals \nwho are traveling in tour groups to the United States. Under the \nprogram, selected travel agencies in Korea would be allowed to issue \ntemporary travel permits. The applicants would be required to meet the \nsame prerequisites imposed by the U.S. Embassy.\n  The pilot legislation also includes additional restrictions to help \ndeter the possibility of illegal immigration. These are:\n  The stay in the United States is no more than 15 days.\n  The visitor poses no threat to the welfare, health, and safety, or \nsecurity of the United States.\n  The visitor possesses a round-trip ticket.\n  The visitor who is deemed inadmissible or deportable by an \nimmirgation officer would be returned to Korea by the transportation \ncarrier.\n  Tour operators will be required to post a $200,000 performance bond \nwith the Secretary of State, and will be penalized if a visitor fails \nto return on schedule.\n  Tour operators will be required to provide written certification of \nthe on-time return of each visitor within the tour group.\n  The Secretary of State and the Attorney General can terminate the \npilot program should the overstay rate exceed 2 percent.\n  Accordingly, I urge Senators Simpson and Kennedy to schedule a \nhearing on this proposal. I also encourage my colleagues to cosponsor \nS. 1616.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, during today's debate on S. 1664, I \nwanted to take the opportunity to speak on a bill I have cosponsored, \nthe Korea visa waiver pilot project legislation, S. 1616. While this \nlegislation is not being offered as an amendment to S. 1664, the \nsubject of the bill is relevant to today's debate.\n  I would urge all Senators to consider cosponsoring this legislation, \nand I would hope that the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on the problems of visa \nissuance for Koreans, and the partial solution offered by S. 1616.\n  I have worked closely with Senators Inouye, Akaka, and Stevens on \nthis legislation. This bill addresses the problem of the slow issuance \nof United States tourist visas to Korean citizens, and their, too \noften, subsequent decision not to vacation in the United States, \nincluding Alaska even though there are direct flights available for \ntourists from Korea to Alaska. The United States Chamber of Commerce in \nKorea has made resolving this issue a top priority on their agenda.\n  The main problem is that Koreans typically wait 2 to 3 weeks to \nobtain visas from the United States Embassy in Seoul. As a result, \nthese spontaneous travelers decide to go to one of the other 48 nations \nthat allow them to travel to their country without a visa, including \nboth Canada and New Zealand.\n  This bill provides the legal basis for a carefully controlled pilot \nprogram for visa free travel by Koreans to the United States. The \nprogram seeks to capture the Korean tourism market lost due to the \ncumbersome visa system. For example, in 1994, 296,706 nonimmigrant \nUnited States visas were granted to Koreans of which 7,000 came to \nAlaska. It is predicted that there would be a 500- to 700-percent \nincrease in Korean tourism to Alaska with the visa waiver pilot \nproject. In New Zealand, for example, a 700-percent increase in tourism \nfrom Korea occurred after they dropped the visa requirement.\n  This pilot program allows visitors in a tour group from South Korea \nto travel to the United States without a visa. However, it does not \ncompromise the security standards of the United States. The program \nwould allow selected travel agencies in Korea to issue temporary travel \npermits based on applicants meeting the same preset standards used by \nthe United States Embassy in Seoul. The travel permits could only be \nused for supervised group tours.\n  Many restrictions are included in the legislation for the pilot \nproposal.\n  The Attorney General and Secretary of State can terminate the program \nif the overstay rates in the program are 2 percent.\n  The stay of the visitors is less than or equal to 15 days.\n  The visitors have to have a round-trip ticket, in addition, the \nvisitors have to arrive by a carrier that agrees to take them back if \nthey are deemed inadmissible.\n  We recommend to the Secretary of State to institute a bonding and \nlicensing requirement that each participating travel agency post a \nsubstantial performance bond and pay a financial penalty if a tourist \nfails to return on schedule.\n  The on-time return of each tourist in the group would be certified \nafter each tour.\n  Security checks are done to ensure that the visitor is not a safety \nthreat to the United States.\n  This legislation's restrictions ensure that the pilot program will be \na successful program. Again, I urge my colleagues to support and \ncosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I move to table the motion to recommit \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n             Vote on Motion to Table the Motion to Recommit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the motion to recommit.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 85 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\n\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  So the motion to lay on the table the motion to recommit was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate to my colleagues that it will probably be \nfairly late. We will have a series of votes here. I will try to reduce \nthe votes from three to one. That may be objected to. If not, there \nwill be three votes. That will be followed by the appropriations bill \nthat is here from the House.\n  I am not certain how much debate we will have. It is a $160 billion \npackage. I assume there will be considerable debate. We are probably \nlooking at 12 o'clock, somewhere in there.\n  Having said that, I now ask unanimous consent that it be in order for \nme to move to table en bloc, which would save time, amendments numbered \n3669, 3670, and 3671. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we inquire \nfrom the majority leader whether there is any willingness to set a time \nfor the minimum wage debate so that we could have an up or down vote \nand the leader could have an up or down vote so we could avoid all of \nthis parliamentary business.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate to my colleague from Massachusetts--and I \nhave discussed this briefly with him and with the Democratic leader. I \nhave asked Senator Lott to discuss it further with the Democratic \nleader.\n  We made a proposal--as I understand, it has been objected to--that we \nwould take it up not before June 4 but not later than June 28, and \nother provisions, but we understood that would not be agreed to. It is \nnot that we have not tried. We will continue to work with the \nDemocratic leader and the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I would like to pass the immigration bill. It seems to me that \nimmigration, particularly illegal immigration, is a very, very \nimportant issue in this country. It has broad bipartisan support. The \nminimum wage, whatever its merits may be, does not belong on this bill. \nWe waited 3 years into the Clinton administration for anybody to even \nmention minimum wage. At least, the President never mentioned minimum \nwage.\n  Since the action on the Senate floor, the President has mentioned, I \nguess this year, minimum wage 50-some times--not once the previous 3 \nyears. So, it is not too difficult to understand the motivation.\n  Having said that, we are prepared to try to work out some \naccommodation with my colleagues on the other side, and we hope that we \ncan save some time. These are going to be party line votes. There will \nbe three of them. We could have three votes or we could have one vote, \nwhatever my colleagues would like to have.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Further reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding the proposal that was made was not an up or down vote and \nclean vote on the issue of the minimum wage. That was not the proposal \nthat was made. That is what we are asking for. That is what we are \nasking for. I would also say that we have had some 2\\1/2\\ hours of \nquorum calls today. All we are asking for is a short time period for an \nup-or-down vote and for the majority leader's proposal on this, and a \nreasonable timeframe. If we are not given that kind of an opportunity--\nwe have gone, for three and a half or 4 days, through various \ngymnastics to try to avoid a vote on the minimum wage, and now we are \nasked to truncate what has been done in order to avoid the vote on the \nminimum wage. So I object.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3669\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I now move to table amendment No. 3669 and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will yield for a question. I do not want to frustrate the \nDemocratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate is not in order.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do not want to delay the vote. I know everybody wants \nto move on. This issue has two pieces to it. The first is the one the \nSenator from Massachusetts described, relating to our determination to \nget a vote on the minimum wage. The other is the opportunity we want to \nbe able to offer amendments. A tree was constructed, parliamentarily, \nto deny Democrats the opportunity to offer these amendments. That is \nreally what this whole arrangement has been all about--denying \nDemocrats the opportunity to offer amendments. We hope that we can \naccommodate a way with which to deal with Democratic amendments, and it \nis only through this process that we are going to be able to do that.\n  So I am sorry that Senators are inconvenienced, but there is no other \nway, short of an agreement on amendments, that we are going to be able \nto resolve this matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 3019, the omnibus appropriations bill, with the reading \nhaving been waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3019), a bill making appropriations for fiscal year 1996 to \n     make a further downpayment toward a balanced budget, and for \n     other purposes, having met, after full and free conference, \n     have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of April 24, 1996.)\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, maybe just for 1 minute the chairman and the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia might give us a summary of the \nbill. This will be the last vote of the day.\n  There will be a vote on Monday, late Monday on cloture.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we make it \n2 minutes for a brief outline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, assure the body \nthat the leadership of this committee will be here on the floor \nfollowing the vote to engage in any colloquy required or asked for or \nto answer any questions.\n  Basically, this is where we are. Seven months into the fiscal year we \nare completing 5 of the 13 appropriations bills, totalling $162 billion \nin nondefense discretionary funds.\n  This covers the Labor-HHS, Commerce, State, Justice, HUD and related \nagencies, Interior, and the District of Columbia. I want to say that we \nhave accomplished this by a very strong bipartisan effort on the part \nof both the House and the Senate and the White House.\n  Leon Panetta, representing the White House, and David Obey and \nChairman Livingston from the House, Senator Byrd and myself from the \nSenate were the five principals, with staff assisting us, and we \nresolved seven riders relating to environmental issues and to the other \nriders that were very controversial: population control, HIV, repeal of \nthe military, and the abortion package relating to certification.\n  We had the opportunity to engage in having the administration and \nexecutive branch help offset the add-backs\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\nthat were requested by the administration. We added $4.2 billion \ntotally offset the $8 billion that they had asked for as add-backs. We \ntook a .00009 percent reduction across the board on all travel accounts \nin the executive branch of Government, which was about $350 million \noffset--some of those matters that we had on some of the add-backs for \nthe administration.\n  This is a compromise bill, and it is one that has been crafted in the \nbest condition and under the best circumstance that we function under.\n  I ask further, Mr. President, for the same amount of time to be \nallocated to the ranking minority member of the committee. Senator Byrd \nand his staff were an absolutely key and integral part of being able to \nbring this bill to the floor. I want to thank him and his staff very \nmuch for that cooperation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished senior \nSenator from Oregon, the chairman of the committee. I thank him for his \nwork. I thank him for his cooperation and his friendship.\n  I intend to vote for the continuing resolution.\n  Mr. President, enactment of the thirteen Fiscal Year 1996 \nAppropriations Bills has been a long and arduous process. As Senators \nare aware, the departments and agencies funded under five FY 1996 \nAppropriations Bills are presently operating under a one day Continuing \nResolution (the thirteenth continuing resolution this year). That \ncontinuing resolution expires at midnight tonight. Further continuing \nresolutions will not be necessary for FY 1996 if the Senate adopts the \npending measure and if it is signed into law by the President by \nmidnight tonight.\n  Title I of this Conference Agreement contains the Fiscal Year 1996 \nappropriations for the following appropriations subcommittees: \nCommerce, Justice, State; D.C.; Interior; Labor-HHS; and VA-HUD. In \naddition, Title II includes emergency and supplemental appropriations \ntotaling $2.125 billion. Contained in that amount are funds for \nemergency disaster assistance payments to States and communities \nthroughout the nation which have suffered devastation from floods, \ntornadoes, and other natural disasters. These amounts are fully paid \nfor by rescissions and other offsets contained in Title III of the \nmeasure.\n  In total, H.R. 3019 provides net spending totaling $159.4 billion. \nThis is $794 million in greater spending than the Senate-passed bill. \nHowever, the Conference Agreement also contains $2.1 billion more in \nspending cuts than the Senate-passed bill. These additional spending \nreductions were necessary in order to fully offset the emergency \nappropriations contained in the measure, as well as the additional \nspending agreed to in conference.\n  The bill before the Senate restores $5.1 billion for education and \ntraining, national service, law enforcement, technology, and other key \npriorities of Congress and the Administration. This amounts to well \nover half of the President's requested $8.1 billion increase. Among the \nmajor provisions contained in the bill are the following:\n  For Labor/HHS/Education, the conference agreement provides for \nincreases of nearly $3 billion for key programs including: $195 million \nmore for Goals 2000 (for a total of $350 million); $953 million more \nfor Title I--Education for the Disadvantaged (total of $7.2 billion); \n$266 million more for Safe and Drug-Free Schools (total of $466 \nmillion); $71 million more for School-to-Work at the Education \nDepartment (total of $180 million), and $61 million more for School-to-\nWork at the Labor Department (total of $170 million); $625 million more \nfor Summer Jobs for Youth (total of $625 million); $233 million more \nfor Dislocated Worker Assistance (total of $1.1 billion); and $169 \nmillion more for Head Start (total of $3.6 billion).\n\n  For VA/HUD the bill provides $1.6 billion more for key programs in \nthis part of the bill, out of the President's request for $2.5 billion, \nincluding: $387 million more for national service (total of $402 \nmillion); $45 million more for Community Development Financial \nInstitutions (total of $45 million); and $817 million for the EPA \nbudget, including: $465 million more for Water Programs (total of $1.8 \nbillion); $40 million more for EPA enforcement (total of $231 million); \n$150 million more for Superfund (total of $1.3 billion).\n  For Commerce/Justice/State the bill provides increases for key \nprograms including: $1.4 billion for the ``COPS'' program, together \nwith conference report language which stipulates that Congress is \ncommitted to deploying 100,000 police officers across the nation by the \nyear 2000; $503 million for a new local law enforcement block grant; \n$403 million for a new state prison grant program; and $221 million \nmore for the Advanced Technology Program (total of $221 million).\n  Finally, as members are aware, there were a number of controversial \nlegislative riders which had to be addressed in this conference. To \ntheir great credit, the Chairmen of the Appropriations Committees, my \ndistinguished colleague from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] and the \ndistinguished gentleman from Louisiana, [Mr. Livingston], after \ndevoting many long hours to these issues, were able to conclude them in \na way that addressed the concerns of members of the House and Senate, \nbut also met the concerns of the President in a way that will enable \nthis measure to be signed into law. Without addressing each of these \ncontroversial riders, suffice it to say that a number were dropped, \nothers were left in the agreement but with waiver authority provided to \nthe President, and still others were modified sufficiently to achieve \nagreement on all sides.\n\n  I commend the Chairmen and Ranking Members of all of the \nSubcommittees involved in this conference, as well as the excellent \nwork of all of the staff. I particularly want to recognize the \noutstanding efforts of the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, Mr. Hatfield. As Chairman of the Conference, he carried out \nhis responsibilities with great patience and aplomb, which are \ncharacteristic of my good friend from Oregon. I appreciate your \nefforts, Senator Hatfield, and I congratulate you on the successful \ncompletion of this very difficult conference. I am hopeful that all \nSenators will vote to adopt H.R. 3019 and that later today it will \nreceive the President's signature. At that point, we will have \ncompleted the most difficult and trying appropriations cycle for any \nfiscal year that I can recall in my years of service in the U.S. \nSenate. I look forward to working with the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Committee on the upcoming FY 1997 Appropriations Bills and I pledge \nto him my total cooperation in hopes that we can avoid many of the \ndifficulties we have had to overcome in fiscal year 1996. Mr. \nPresident, I ask that a more complete statement be inserted in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                        commerce, justice, state\n\n       The conference agreement includes $1.4 billion for the \n     Community Oriented Policing Services program or the ``COPS'' \n     program as it is commonly known. This is $100 million above \n     fiscal year 1995, $1.4 billion above the level included in \n     H.R. 2076, the Commerce, Justice and State bill that the \n     President vetoed last December. The conference report \n     reiterates, for the first time since the Republicans won a \n     majority in the House and Senate, that the Congress remains \n     committed to deploying one hundred thousand additional police \n     officers on the beat across America by the year 2000.\n       The conference agreement also provides $503 million for a \n     new local law enforcement block grant. This program is \n     intended to meet other law enforcement needs that communities \n     may have, such as equipment.\n       On another crime issue, the conference report includes $403 \n     million for a new State prison grant program, sometimes \n     called ``Truth in Sentencing.'' This program, which will \n     provide grants to States to build or renovate or expand \n     prisons.\n       The conference agreement provides $221 million for the \n     Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program. This is \n     $221 million above the vetoed CJS bill, H.R. 2076, but is \n     still about $210 million below the level enacted for the ATP \n     program in fiscal year 1995. These funds will be principally \n     used to pay for continuation of ATP awards made in fiscal \n     year 1995 and prior years. The ATP program provides for cost-\n     shared R projects with industry to help bring leading edge \n     technologies from the drawing board to the market place. This \n     was a high priority for the President and the Secretary of \n     Commerce in these negotiations. I should note, that the late \n     Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown was a major advocate of this \n     program.\n       The conference agreement includes $1.254 billion for \n     Department of State international organizations and \n     conferences. For the most part this represents assessed \n     contributions to the United Nations and other international \n     organizations, for example the World Health Organization and \n     Organization\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\n     of American States, and for United Nations Peacekeeping. The \n     conference agreement represents an increase of $326 million \n     above the vetoed CJS bill, H.R. 2076.\n       The agreement waives Section 15a of the State Department \n     basic authorities Act, so the State Department can continue \n     to obligate appropriations even in the absence of a fiscal \n     year 1996 authorization.\n       Finally, the Conference Agreement includes $100 million for \n     the Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loan \n     program. This will replenish SBA's funds and enable the \n     agency to respond to future disasters. Further, the \n     Conference Agreement also includes $18 million for Economic \n     Development Administration (EDA) within the Commerce \n     Department. This funding, which requires a certification and \n     request by the President, provides for emergency repairs of \n     facilities that were damaged by flooding in the Northwest and \n     provides for mitigation of flooding at Devil's Lake, North \n     Dakota, as well as other disasters.\n\n\n                          district of columbia\n\n       With regard to the District of Columbia, the annual Federal \n     payment to the District of Columbia was provided to the \n     District of Columbia government in earlier continuing \n     resolutions. This bill provides for the appropriations for \n     programs, projects, and activities in the District of \n     Columbia budget. The bill also includes a number of \n     legislative provisions designed to improve the quality of \n     education in the District of Columbia public school system.\n       Among the provisions are several which I authored which are \n     intended to improve order and discipline in the D.C. public \n     school system. These include: a dress code which shall \n     include a prohibition of gang membership symbols and which \n     may include a requirement that students wear uniforms; a \n     requirement that any students suspended from classes should \n     perform community service during the period of suspension; \n     and the placement of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, \n     who manages a number of programs for at-risk youth, on the \n     Commission on Consensus Reform in the District of Columbia \n     Public Schools.\n\n\n                                defense\n\n       The conferees agreed to provide $820 million of costs of \n     on-going operations in Bosnia. The amounts have been \n     designated an emergency, as recommended by the House. \n     However, the full amount included is offset by recommended \n     rescissions from existing defense resources.\n       The amount included for Bosnia operations represents the \n     second phase of financing for the Defense Department portion \n     of the costs. Previously, the Committees on Appropriations \n     have approved a reprogramming to cover an additional $875 \n     million of the funding requirement. Congress is expected to \n     consider additional reprogrammings to cover the remaining \n     balance which is estimated to be around $640 million for the \n     remainder of this fiscal year.\n       The conferees agreed to a Senate proposal to repeal Section \n     1177 of title 10 which would have required the mandatory \n     discharge or retirement of members of the Armed Forces \n     infected with the HIV-1 virus.\n       As proposed by the Senate, the conferees agree to authorize \n     the Air Force to award a multiyear procurement contract for \n     the C-17 program. The conferees direct that savings from this \n     contract must exceed those of current proposal under \n     consideration by the Air Force.\n       In addition, the conference agreement includes several \n     technical corrections, and clarifies guidance offered in the \n     FY 1996 DoD Appropriations Act. To more closely track \n     authorization recommendations of the Congress, the \n     conferees have added $44.9 million for continued B-52 \n     operations, and $50 million for SEMATECH. All funding \n     recommended in the Defense Chapter is fully offset by \n     proposed rescissions of $994.9 million from classified \n     programs and savings from lower inflation.\n\n\n                      energy and water development\n\n       For programs and activities under the jurisdiction of the \n     Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, the Conference \n     Agreement includes $135 million, the same as the budget \n     request and the amount proposed by the House and Senate, for \n     the Corps of Engineers to damages to non-Federal levies and \n     other flood control works in states affected by recent \n     natural disasters, and to replenish funds transferred from \n     other accounts for emergency work, under Public Law 84-99.\n       In addition, the Agreement includes $30 million, the same \n     as the budget request, for repair of Corps of Engineers \n     projects caused by severe flooding in the Northeast and \n     Northwest.\n       For the Bureau of Reclamation, an amount of $9 million is \n     included for emergency repairs as Folsom Dam in California.\n       An amount of $15 million is provided for the Department of \n     Energy to accelerate activities in the Materials Protection, \n     Control and Accounting program, to improve facilities and \n     institute national standards to secure stockpiles of weapons \n     usable fissile materials in Russia, and the Newly Independent \n     States. No similar provision was included in the House bill, \n     the Senate bill, or the budget request.\n       In addition, the conference agreement also includes several \n     provisions dealing with the transfer of funds for the Western \n     Area Power Administration, an item under the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission's jurisdiction involving the Flint \n     Creek Project in Montana, additional language involving \n     appropriations for the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois \n     Waterway navigation study, and language regarding refinancing \n     of the Bonneville Power Administration debt.\n       Finally, the conference agreement includes language \n     contained in the Senate bill authorizing the Board of \n     Directors of the United States Enrichment Corporation to \n     transfer the interest of the United States in the Corporation \n     to the private sector.\n\n\n                           foreign operations\n\n       Title II of the Conference Report contains two provisions \n     under the heading Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and \n     Related Programs.\n       The first provides $50 million for emergency expenses \n     necessary to meet unanticipated needs for the acquisition and \n     eradication of terrorism in and around Israel. The conferees \n     agreed that the fragility of the Middle East peace process \n     warranted this extraordinary action. This emergency \n     appropriation is fully offset.\n       The second provides $70 million, also fully offset, for \n     grant Foreign Military Financing for Jordan in recognition of \n     its central role in the search for peace in the Middle East. \n     These funds are to be used to finance transfers by lease of \n     16 F-16 fighter aircraft to the Government of Jordan. In \n     recognition of the downsizing of the U.S. defense industry \n     and the loss of jobs this is causing, the conferees directed \n     that the Department of Defense give priority consideration to \n     American defense firms in awarding contracts for upgrades and \n     other major improvements to these aircraft prior to delivery.\n\n\n                                interior\n\n       Mr. President, the Interior portion of this omnibus bill \n     finally brings to closure action on the Interior bill. As \n     many Senators know, the Interior bill went to conference \n     three different times, only to be vetoed by the President. In \n     response to the concerns raised by the Administration, this \n     bill has made significant changes, particularly with respect \n     to the legislative language. These items were among the most \n     contentious items in the conference on H.R. 3019 and were \n     among the last items to be resolved.\n       With regard to the Tongass National Forest, the language \n     follows closely the provisions proposed by the Senate \n     regarding the land management plan and alternative P, as well \n     as the contested timber sales under a recent lawsuit \n     (AWARTA). However, these provisions may be waived by the \n     President pursuant to the terms of this legislation. The \n     language clarifies that the AWARTA provisions in section \n     325(b) shall have no effect during a suspension. To assist \n     with the economic impacts of a declining timber sales program \n     on the Tongass National Forest, a disaster assistance fund of \n     $110 million is established.\n       Language from earlier conferences about the management of \n     the Mojave National Preserve and the endangered species \n     moratorium has been modified to address concerns expressed by \n     the Administration. However, in the event the President \n     believes such improvements do not allow for adequate \n     protection of the resource, a waiver is provided wherein \n     these provisions can be suspended.\n       Language about the Columbia Basin ecosystem project has \n     been deleted and instead, language is included which \n     clarifies that this project does not apply to non-Federal \n     lands and will not provide the basis for any regulation of \n     private property.\n       Because of concerns expressed by the Administration, the \n     timber provisions that provided authority for substitution of \n     alternative timber sales or buyout of timber sales are \n     deleted.\n       Language, and funding of $3 million, is extended to the \n     Smithsonian Institution to conduct another round of employee \n     buy-outs between enactment of this legislation and October \n     1, 1996.\n       In total, the Interior bill ends up being funded at a level \n     $1.2 billion below the fiscal year 1995 enacted level. There \n     are very real spending cuts in this legislation--many \n     agencies have already begun reducing programs and downsizing \n     their workforces. Some reductions in force have occurred, but \n     further drastic actions should be avoided as a result of \n     completion of this legislation.\n       With respect to funding, the Interior portion of this bill \n     seeks to protect the operating base budgets for the land \n     management agencies. Additional funding of $25 million each \n     for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health \n     Service is included above earlier conference levels. Funding \n     for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program is increased \n     $12 million above the earlier conference agreement. A total \n     of $4 million is provided to the Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     handle the emergency listings allowed by the act, or to \n     address program requirements in the event a waiver is issued.\n       In addition, this bill provides funding of $245.3 million \n     for natural disaster recovery efforts, stemming from flooding \n     earlier this year in the East and Pacific Northwest, as well \n     as other disasters in other regions of the country.\n\n\n                      labor, health, and education\n\n       I am pleased that an agreement has finally been reached on \n     the funding levels for the Labor, HHS programs, and that the \n     most controversial legislative riders have been dropped or \n     substantially modified.\n       The conference agreement closely follows the Senate bill \n     providing overall funding at $64.6 billion. This is $206 \n     million over the\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\n     Senate bill and $2.6 billion above the House bill. Moreover, \n     the agreement is fully $3.8 billion over the original House-\n     passed Labor, HHS bill, H.R. 2127. Nonetheless, critical \n     health, education and job training programs sustained cuts of \n     $2.6 billion or 4% below the fiscal year 1994 funding level. \n     Certain programs, such as the Low Income Home Energy \n     Assistance program which was slashed by 30%, were cut much \n     deeper than the overall spending reduction.\n       I am also pleased that it was bi-partisan cooperation in \n     the Senate which resulted in the overwhelming vote, 84-16, \n     for passage of the Specter-Harkin education restoration \n     amendment. This amendment restored $2.7 billion to high \n     priority education programs including Title I grants to \n     school districts with large numbers of poor children, and the \n     Goals 2000 program which funds state-wide public school \n     improvement initiatives. The conference agreement includes \n     education restorations which slightly exceed the funding \n     level in the Senate bi-partisan amendment.\n       There are a number of programs important to me and the \n     state of West Virginia which were terminated by the original \n     House Labor, HHS bill but which were restored in the \n     Senate bill and the conference committee. These include \n     black lung clinics, the Byrd Scholarship program, and full \n     funding for staffing the new, state-of-the-art NIOSH \n     facility in Morgantown.\n       Included in the bill is the termination of over 110 \n     programs viewed by the conferees as having met their \n     objectives, being duplicative of other programs, or having \n     low priority. Protected are high priority programs, such as, \n     medical research, student aid, compensatory education for the \n     disadvantaged, and summer youth jobs. The bill's highlights \n     include the following:\n       $625 Million for the 1996 Summer Youth Employment Program \n     of the Department of Labor. The House bill had terminated \n     this program.\n       $1.1 billion for the Dislocated Worker Retraining program, \n     bringing the total $233 million above the House bill.\n       $350 Million for the School to Work program, jointly \n     administered by the Departments of Labor and Education, an \n     increase of $105 million from the 1995 appropriated level.\n       $11.9 billion for medical research supported by the \n     National Institutes of Health. This is an increase of $654 \n     million over 1995, or 5.8 percent.\n       $738 million for the Ryan White AIDS programs. This is an \n     increase of $105 million over 1995. Within the total is $52 \n     million specifically set aside for the AIDS drugs \n     reimbursement program. These additional funds will enable \n     states to better meet the growing cost and demand for new \n     AIDS drugs.\n       $93 million to continue the Healthy Start program. This is \n     $43 million above the original level passed by the House.\n       $3.57 billion for the Head Start program. This is $36 \n     million above 1995.\n       $350 million for the GOALS 2000 Educate America Act \n     program. The House bill had terminated funding for this \n     program.\n       $7.2 billion for the Title I, Compensatory Education for \n     the Disadvantaged program. This is the same as the 1995 level \n     and nearly $1 billion more than the House bill.\n       $466 million for the Drug Free Schools program. This is \n     $266 million above the House bill.\n       $78 million for education technology programs which assist \n     schools in expanding the availability of technology enhanced \n     curricula and instruction to improve educational services. \n     This is $23 million above 1995.\n       $973 million for Vocational Education Basis Grants. This is \n     the same as the 1995 level and $83 million over the House \n     bill.\n       $93 million to recapitalize the Perkins Loan student aid \n     program. The House had proposed no funding for this purpose.\n       $32 million for the State Student Incentive Grant program. \n     The House bill had proposed terminating funding for this \n     program.\n       The bill also raises the maximum Pell Grant to $2,470. This \n     is an increase of $130 in the maximum grant and is the \n     highest maximum grant ever provided.\n       As Senators know, the House included many legislative \n     riders in its version of the FY 1996 Labor-HHS appropriations \n     bill. Disposition of some of these provisions occurred as \n     follows:\n       1. OSHA--Ergonomics Rider: House Recedes to the Senate \n     language that was included in last year's rescission bill \n     prohibiting OSHA from promulgating an ergonomic standard or \n     guideline. The language is modified to include the reference \n     in the House language ``directly or through section 23(g) of \n     the Occupational Safety and Health Act.''\n       2. NLRB--Single Site Bargaining Units: Senate Recedes to \n     language proposed by the House to prohibit the Board from \n     using funds in FY'96 to promulgate a rule regarding single \n     location bargaining units in representation cases.\n       3. Direct Lending: House recedes to the Senate with no cap \n     on loan volume, but a cap on administrative costs. This saves \n     $114 million by reducing the amounts available for \n     administrative costs from $550 million to $436.\n       4. Female Genital Mutilation: The agreement modifies the \n     Senate amendment to include the language requiring the \n     Secretary of HHS to collect data, conduct surveillance, and \n     develop outreach, prevention and education programs regarding \n     female genital mutilation, both for the general public and \n     the medical community. However, the agreement does not \n     establish new federal criminal penalties.\n       5. Abortion: The agreement adopts the Senate position on \n     the abortion riders in the bill, including the ``Hyde'' \n     language prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions, \n     except in the cases of rape or incest, or for the life of the \n     mother. Also included is the ``Coats/Snowe'' amendment \n     related to the accreditation of OBGYN training programs.\n\n\n            treasury, postal service and general government\n\n       The conference agreement deletes the appropriations cap of \n     $1,406,000 for Customs Service Small Airports to permit the \n     Customs Service to fund requests for user fee airports \n     through full reimbursement from requesting airports.\n       The conferees also added a new general provision requiring \n     the Internal Revenue Service to provide a level of taxpayer \n     service in fiscal year 1996 not below that provided in fiscal \n     year 1995.\n       In addition, the conference agreement adds a new general \n     provision to provide $1 million to the Office of National \n     Drug Control Policy to fund conferences on model state drug \n     laws through funding made available in fiscal year 1996 for \n     the Counter-Drug Technology Assessment Center. The bill also \n     includes a supplemental appropriation of $3,400,000 for the \n     Office of National Drug Control Policy. This supplemental \n     funding will permit the new Director of ONDCP, General \n     McCaffrey, to hire and retain an additional 80 FTEs bringing \n     the total number of FTE for this Office to 125 in fiscal year \n     1996. This supplemental funding has been fully offset through \n     rescissions in the General Services Administration, \n     installment acquisition payments account ($-3.5 million).\n       The conference agreement also includes a section proposed \n     by the Senate to increase the number of appointees to the \n     Commission on Restructuring the IRS by 4, bringing the number \n     of members of the Commission up to a new level of 17. This \n     provision permits the Majority Leader of the Senate and the \n     Speaker of the House to each name 4 members to the Commission \n     instead of 2 each as provided in current law.\n\n\n                      va-hud-independent agencies\n\n       The final conference agreement maintains, and even \n     strengthens, the bipartisan agreement passed overwhelmingly \n     by the Senate restoring funding cuts in environmental \n     programs. The final package includes an additional $817 \n     million over the amounts in the vetoed VA-HUD bill for \n     Environmental Protection Agency programs.\n       The VA-HUD chapter also includes increased funding for \n     science and technology programs, including an additional \n     $83,000,000 for the National Aeronautic and Space \n     Administration (NASA) and $40,000,000 for the National \n     Science Foundation.\n       The final conference agreement deletes two controversial \n     riders proposed in the original bill, including: (1) language \n     which would have taken away EPA's ability to overrule Corps \n     of Engineers decisions on wetlands, and (2) language which \n     would have transferred oversight of Fair Housing from HUD to \n     the Department of Justice.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me just clarify, following the vote we \nwill finish the action on the immigration matter. We will then come \nback, and it will be all the time anybody needs for colloquy, debate, \nor any other question they may want to ask either Senator Byrd or \nSenator Hatfield on the large appropriations bill.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I just \nsent two cloture motions to the desk which would limit debate on the \nnew Simpson amendment which encompasses all the Senate has adopted on \nthe immigration bill to date.\n  The first cloture vote will occur on Monday, April 29, and I will \nconsult with the Democratic leader before setting the cloture vote. I \nhave been thinking about 5 o'clock, or something near that, so that all \nMembers can be prepared for the cloture vote on Monday.\n  The second cloture vote will occur on Tuesday. And, again, I will \nspeak with the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  I also indicate that I regret that I had to file cloture motions to \nfill up the amendment tree. But we would like to finish the immigration \nbill.\n  We still have ongoing discussions of when we can agree, if we can \nagree, on a procedure to handle a minimum wage. If we can work that \nout, a lot of this would end, and we could finally end the immigration \nbill very quickly.\n  So I do not really have much alternative unless I submit to the \nrequest of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  It seems to me that we can work out some agreeable time for all \nSenators and some agreeable procedure. We will try to do that between \nnow and Monday. Maybe we can vitiate many of these things.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  The leader is absolutely right. This is all necessary because we are \nnot in a position to agree tonight apparently on when that time certain \nmay be for the minimum wage. I am optimistic, given our conversations \nin the last few hours, that we might be able to find a way in which to \nschedule the vote on the minimum wage in the not too distant future.\n  I am very hopeful that that can be done, that we can preclude in the \nfuture this kind of unnecessary filling of the tree and the \nparliamentary procedures involved with it. It is unfortunate, but under \nthe circumstances there may not be an alternative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4160-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4161-S4178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        1996 BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee and our ranking member, the very \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, for their work in bringing us \nto the point we are tonight. This has been a very long, difficult \nstruggle. Seven months, two Government shutdowns and 13 continuing \nresolutions later, we resolved many of these extraordinarily difficult \nand contentious issues in a way that I feel has done a real service to \nthe Senate.\n  I commend our colleagues. I commend all of those involved for having \nfinally concluded this effort. I certainly appreciate the effort on \nboth sides. I know others wish to speak, and I now yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, who, as I understand it, is going to \nmanage some time here under the agreement we have with the \ndistinguished majority leader so that we can make the comments we would \nhave made before the passage of the omnibus bill at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I believe that was the majority leader's indication of \nthe procedure we would follow. Let me say at this point in time, I \nsuggest that those who have statements to make that do not relate to a \ncolloquy which requires my presence would then follow after the \ncolloquy that does require my presence with the Senator from Texas \n[Mrs. Hutchison]. So that would be the procedure. And then if there are \nno questions for me afterward, I am going to retire and let the \nspeeches flow on.\n  Mr. President, returning now to the omnibus appropriations bill that \njust passed the Senate by an 88 to 11 vote, has passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a 399 to 25 vote, remarkable votes on a matter that \nhas as much controversy and issues that excited people's passions as \nhas this particular bill, I would like to acknowledge the support and \nthe backing of the Senate and House leadership. We kept the leadership \ninformed periodically throughout the negotiations with the White House, \nand we had the constant and consistent support by the leadership for \nthe strategy that we had laid out and for the steps we were able to \nachieve.\n  I also want to pay particular attention to the subcommittee chairmen \nwho served on the Appropriations Committee and the ranking members of \nthose subcommittees, because they were involved in the negotiations as \nthey related to their particular issues under their jurisdiction in the \nsubcommittees. So we had a very broad base of participation in spite of \nthe fact that five individuals had been put together in order to \nachieve the agreement--Senator Byrd and myself, and Chairman Livingston \nand Mr. Obey of the House, and Mr. Panetta representing the White \nHouse.\n  I also want to express our deep appreciation to the White House \nnegotiators for their responding to short-time notices. When we were \nready to meet again--and all these meetings took place in the \nAppropriations Committee room of the Senate side of the building--they \nresponded within minutes of the times when we said we would like to \ntalk to you again on this issue, or we are ready to return to the table \non a package of issues.\n  I want to also acknowledge Senator Domenici, as chairman of the \nBudget Committee. As you know, we function in a linked, and oftentimes \nin a lockstep with the Budget Committee, vis-a-vis the budget \nresolution and maintaining the caps and limits of spending established \nby that budget resolution. In this particular case we were making add-\nbacks and offsets, but it impacted upon the scoring system of the CBO. \nWe had constant, immediate response to needs by the Budget Committee \nand its staff, under the leadership of Senator Domenici, to give us an \nupdate or an immediate response to a question of scoring. We also had, \nfor every add-back, offsets; so that it was deficit neutral in every \nstep we took. Those offsets had to be called upon again by imaginative, \ncreative ideas--uranium enrichment programs and other such things, \nagain, which had a scoring implication that the Budget Committee \nresponded to regarding our need and helping us along.\n  In any case, there is something that comes up in the tail end that \nyou do not anticipate and do not suspect. One such incident is \nillustrative of the close working relationship with the Budget \nCommittee. In a case where $15 million was asked for nuclear safety as \nit related to nuclear nonproliferation, it was considered as one of \nthose oversights for some reason, but nevertheless it had to be acted \nupon at the request of the sponsoring Member. Here we had to reopen, in \na sense, the Energy Subcommittee that had been closed in relation to \nthis conference on the omnibus package. Again, Senator Domenici, as \nchairman of that subcommittee, came with the assistance required in \norder to not only reopen that committee but also to, in effect, find an \noffset. So, I want to pay special attention to the support from the \nBudget Committee, particularly Senator Domenici.\n\n  Mr. President, I am sure at the time the Senate acted upon these \nissues one by one, when we came out of our committee with a reported \nbill, people were very much aware of the heated debates that took place \nhere on the floor before we were able to take that bill, having passed \nthe Senate, with leadership support of both Senator Dole and Senator \nDaschle, with the overwhelming support of Republicans and Democrats--we \nwent into that conference with that kind of vote support which was very \nimportant. But we tend to forget, after we have gone through these \ndebates and do not relive them as those of us do who have to relive \nthem within a smaller context of a conference. Let me tell you, those \ndebates were just as intense, they were just as heated, they were just \nas divisive as they are on the floor, if not more so, because here you \nare sitting across a table, looking eyeball to eyeball to the adversary \nin the debate.\n  Let me just say, we got into abortion. That was the Coats amendment. \nWe got into population planning. We got into HIV, which was lifting the \nban that had been done in the managers' report here on this floor. But \nwe got into it in that situation within this very small context of \nbasically five principals. We got into seven debates on environmental \nissues. I think they are equal in the intensity that people express \ntheir viewpoints and ideas as were the social issues. And we had to \nwork through every one of those.\n  Let me say, the White House position initially was that all seven of \nthose environmental issues that had been put there by the Senate and \nthe House had to be excised; it would be a veto on the entire package \nif any one of those amendments, riders, stayed on this package. We kept \nfive of them. We kept five of the seven, modifying four of the five, \nbut we kept five of those environmental riders.\n\n  So, you see from that, the White House had moved. The White House had \nasked for $8 billion in add-backs. We agreed with offsets on $4.8 \nbillion, about a split. We denied the White House half of what they \nwanted. The White House got half of what they wanted.\n  I think, when you come to a conference, it is a matter of giving and \ngetting, so when the conference is over, everybody can say we won. That \nis a successful conference. I think we spend too much of our time \ntrying to determine who loses and who wins, and if we do not spend that \ntime, the media do.\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\nThe media likes winners and losers. It is kind of strange. It is \ndifficult for them to comprehend and handle a situation where everybody \nwins. They may not have won everything, and they did not lose \neverything. To me that is the art of compromise. That is the art of \nlegislation. That is recognizing the pluralism of our society.\n  We do not all think alike. God forbid we should ever. But, \nnevertheless, what I am saying is these votes in both the House of \nRepresentatives and in the Senate of the United States demonstrated my \nthesis--everybody won, or at least they can claim victory in this or \nthat or the other thing.\n  We have to recognize one other thing. The Appropriations Committee, 7 \nmonths into this 1996 fiscal year, are behind already for the 1997 \nfiscal year. What we did in this conference was going to affect how \nexpedited we can make the 1997 procedure. Sure, we might have won more \nfrom the House on the Senate side, but we would have done so at the \nexpense of being able to find the kind of compromises to expedite the \n1997 process. So we always, I think, have to realize that what we are \ndoing at the moment has an impact on what we are going to have to do \nnext. Again, we live in the moment and in a culture of instantaneous \ngratification: instant this, instant news, bite-size everything, and \nvery few people in our culture are looking beyond today and this very \nhour.\n  I want to say, in my view, the exception to that is the Republican \ndetermination to balance the budget by the year 2002, because we are \nlooking ahead to what implications today's actions are going to have on \nour children and our grandchildren, to the year 2002. But very few \nthings are happening in our culture total, not just the political, that \ngives any indication that people are looking beyond the moment.\n  We were looking as well to resolve this issue, knowing we were going \nto be immediately thrust into the next fiscal year activity, of 1997. \nWe have to always remain conscious of the fact that the President has \nlegislative power.\n  He cannot force us to legislate anything, but we cannot legislate \nindependent of the President either. That is the marvelous mystery of \nour mixing of powers within a separation of powers organization.\n  So when you look at the issues, the riders on the bill--and I am \ngoing to use any and every occasion that I have an opportunity to \nremind ourselves that, blast it all, it is the authorizers who should \nbe doing these riders in the first place and they are dumping on to us, \ncomplicating the appropriations process unnecessarily.\n  Why? Well, we are the only committee that has to act. A lot of people \nlike to talk, and they do. The appropriators not only talk, they have \nto act. We have to pass our bills. No other committee in this Congress, \nexcept the appropriators, are required by law to pass their bills to \nkeep the Government going. Not even the Budget Committee has to act. In \nfact, the Budget Committee did not give the appropriators a budget \nresolution until August a few years ago which, really, by that time, \nwas a rather futile gesture because we had to move ahead before the \nBudget Committee even acted in order to meet the October 1 fiscal year \ndeadline.\n  So I want to say again, a lot of people talk about budget reductions, \nbut it is the appropriators who have done it. We have cut the budget \nover $22 billion. No other committee has done it. They have talked \nabout it. We have done the cutting, $22 billion. And sometimes we have \nhad to do that without the benefit of anesthetic. This is a bloody \nsurgery we are into.\n  I am always amused by the Members who come around to the \nappropriating committee and say, ``Be sure and put that in. Be sure and \nhang on to that one,'' spend that money and then get up here and talk \nabout the appropriators or people refusing to cut spending. We are all \nguilty of it. It gets a little weary at times, I must say, but, \nnevertheless, that is the way the system functions. It is still the \nbest system in the world, no matter how many times we find fault with \nit.\n  So I can say this to the body today that it is not the bill I would \nhave written if I had been the only one, but it certainly is a bill of \nconsensus. We had to deal with Democrats, Republicans, House Members, \nSenate Members and the White House, and to have engaged in that was, \nindeed, both an experience and one that took team effort. I am indebted \nto my colleagues in the Senate for this vote of 88 to 11 and to the \nsuperior leadership of Congressman Livingston. Let me tell you, we have \nsometimes divisions on this side, and we think it is hard to bridge \nthose differences and so forth, but let me tell you, that House side--\nit is an amazing, amazing accomplishment that the leadership and \nChairman Livingston were able to get a 399-to-25 vote and, again, \neverybody won.\n\n  Mr. President, I said I would yield to my friend from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, and engage in a colloquy, and if there are no other \nquestions, I will engage in that colloquy at this time in order to \naccommodate the Senator. If there are no questions, then I will depart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee. There is a high price for leadership, and he certainly has \nprovided the leadership in this body in a very difficult circumstance. \nI appreciate the courtesies that he has given to me because it has been \na very tough vote. I feel very strongly on principle, and I will talk \nabout that later, but I appreciate the integrity of the process and of \nthe Senator from the State of Oregon.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate passed H.R. 3019, the omnibus \nappropriations bill for 1996. Included in that bill as part of the \nappropriations for the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of \nthe Interior was a provision that has twice passed the Senate. It puts \na moratorium on the listing of endangered species and the designation \nof critical habitat in order to permit the reauthorization of the \nEndangered Species Act to go forward without the controversy of new \nlistings and seeks to prevent further unnecessary harm to workers and \nproperty owners in the meantime.\n  As reported by the conference committee, the moratorium was revised \nto include language permitting the moratorium to be suspended if the \nPresident determines that it is in the public interest in the \nprotection of naturally or locally affected interests. I certainly \nagree that it is in the national and local interest to have sound \nenvironmental management. But I also believe that it is in the national \nand local interest to protect agricultural, ranching and timber jobs. \nWe must have the food, clothing, and shelter that our farmers, ranchers \nand lumberjacks provide. It is also in the national and local interest \nto protect human access to water for health, safety and economic \nreasons. We cannot have the people's access to water threatened, as it \nhas been in my State, by environmental laws that were enacted before \ntheir effect on the water supply was fully understood.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Oregon, is it his intention and \nunderstanding that in using this provision, the President shall take \ninto account jobs and people in addition to species?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hutchison. That is \ncorrect. In his exercise of the Executive power, the President is bound \nto consider the health and safety of the people and the economy in \nmaking Executive orders.\n  This is, of course, true with the suspension provision, too. I \nappreciate the assistance of the Senator from Texas in bringing this \nissue into focus at this particular time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Oregon, Mr. President. I \nthank him very much. I think that clarification should be a guide for \nthe President if he decides to override what the Senate has passed.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Texas will \nyield momentarily for a unanimous-consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Highlights in Title I of H.R. 3019, Omnibus Appropriations for Fiscal \n                               Year 1996\n\n\n  Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related \n                                Agencies\n\n       A total of $14.7 billion for the Department of Justice, \n     roughly a 20 percent increase over FY 1995 levels.\n       $1.4 billion for the Community-Oriented Policing Services \n     to meet the goal of putting\n\n[[Page S4163]]\n\n     cops on the beat. This program received no direct funding in \n     the conference report to accompany H.R. 2076, the FY 96 \n     Commerce, Justice, State & the Judiciary Appropriations bill.\n       $503 million for a Local Law Enforcement Block Grant, which \n     will give those on the front lines in the fight against crime \n     greater authority to make decisions about which crime-\n     fighting strategies can work best in their communities.\n       Under the Department of Commerce, $221 million for the \n     Advanced Technology Program (ATP), which receive no funding \n     in the conference report to H.R. 2076, the FY 1996 Commerce, \n     Justice, State and the Judiciary Appropriations bill, and $80 \n     million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program \n     (MEP). Both ATP and MEP are part of NIST's (National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology) Industrial Technology \n     Services.\n       $185 million for the Federal Communication Commission, an \n     increase of $10 million over the conference report to H.R. \n     2076.\n       Under the Department of State, sufficient funding for the \n     United States to maintain its commitment to the United \n     Nations at the 25 percent assessment rate, including $395 \n     million to support U.N. Peacekeeping.\n       $278 million for the Legal Services Corporation.\n\n\n                          District of Columbia\n\n       $4.9 billion spending limit on total city expenditures.\n       In response the District's request, language regarding \n     reductions-in-force (RIF) procedures is provided to make it \n     easier for the city to reduce staff and control spending.\n       Public education reforms: authority for establishing \n     independent charter schools; an oversight Commission on \n     Consensus Reform in the public schools to ensure \n     implementation of a required reform plan; technical \n     assistance from GSA to repair school facilities.\n\n\n              department of interior and related agencies\n\n       $1.321 billion is provided for the National Park Service \n     activities, an increase over the FY 1995 level.\n       The partial moratorium on Endangered Species Act listings \n     is retained in the bill, as is language protecting historical \n     management practices in the Mojave National Preserve. The \n     President would be allowed to suspend these provisions if he \n     determines such suspension is appropriate based upon the \n     public interest in sound environmental management and \n     resource protection.\n       Language providing a one-year moratorium on establishment \n     of a new Tongass Land Management Plan and allows certain \n     timber sales on the Tongass National Forest to be awarded if \n     the Forest Service determines additional analysis is not \n     necessary. The President would be allowed to suspend these \n     provisions if he determines such suspension is appropriate \n     based upon the public interest in sound environmental \n     management and resource protection. Should the provision be \n     suspended, $110 million would be available for economic \n     disaster assistance in Southeast Alaska timber communities.\n       Language affecting Western Oregon and Western Washington, \n     that would give greater flexibility to the Forest Service and \n     the Bureau of Land Management to offer alternative timber \n     sale volume to timber sale purchasers, has been dropped.\n       Language providing the Administration the authority to \n     purchase all or portions of previously sold timber sales in \n     Western Oregon and Western Washington has been dropped.\n\n\n   departments of labor, health & human services, and education, and \n                            related agencies\n\n       $625 million for the 1996 Summer Youth Employment Program \n     of the Department of Labor; The House bill had terminated \n     this program.\n       $1.1 billion for the Dislocated Worker Retraining program, \n     bringing the total $233 million above the House bill.\n       $350 million for the School to Work program, jointly \n     administered by the Department of Labor and Education, an \n     increase of $105 million from the 1995 appropriated level.\n       $11.9 billion for medical research supported by the \n     National Institutes of Health. This is an increase of $654 \n     million over 1995, or 5.8 percent.\n       $738 million for the Ryan White AIDS programs. This is an \n     increase of $105 million over 1995. Within the total is $52 \n     million specifically set aside for the AIDS drugs \n     reimbursement program. These additional funds will enable \n     states to better meet the growing cost and demand for new \n     AIDS drugs.\n       $93 million to continue the Healthy Start program. This is \n     $43 million above the original level passed by the House.\n       $3.57 billion for the Head Start program. This is $36 \n     million above 1995.\n       $350 million for the GOALS 2000 Educate American Act \n     program. The House bill had terminated funding for this \n     program.\n       $7.2 billion for the Title I, Compensatory Education for \n     the Disadvantaged, program. This is the same as the 1995 \n     level and nearly $1 billion more than the House bill.\n       $466 million for the Drug Free Schools program. This is \n     $266 million above the House bill.\n       $78 million for education technology programs which assist \n     schools in expanding the availability of technology enhanced \n     curricula and instruction to improve educational services. \n     This is $23 million above 1995.\n       $973 million for Vocational Education Basis Grants. This is \n     the same as the 1995 level and $83 million over the House \n     bill.\n       $93 million to recapitalize the Perkins Loan student aid \n     program.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, once again, I thank the Senator from \nOregon for completing a very tough job, and I commend him for the job \nthat he has done.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about my vote, because I voted against \nthis bill on a principle that I think is very important, and I would \nlike to step back and talk about the background.\n  Over the past 20 years, we have greatly improved the environment in \nthe United States. As a Nation, we have spent over a trillion dollars \nto clean our air, water, and land. We have cleaner air and water than \nwe have had for the past 40 years in our country. Now we are at a \ncrossroads in environmental policy. We can preserve all of the \nenvironmental gains that we have made and still move forward to assure \nour children a safer, cleaner, and healthier environment.\n  But we will not be able to move forward if we continue to rely on the \nold, top-down command and control solutions from Washington, DC. \nInstead of orders from Washington, DC, we need to allow communities and \nbusinesses to find the best way to meet our national environmental \nstandards themselves.\n  The administration and its leaders on Capitol Hill have used every \nopportunity to demagog and politicize environmental policy in order to \nprotect the status quo and appease extremist environmental ideologs. \nThey seek to take every opportunity to accuse Republicans of harming \nthe environment, as if we had a separate supply of water and air to \nbreathe.\n  I was accused by one of these groups of being supported by \nantienvironmental groups. So I asked the question, ``What groups are \nyou referring to as antienvironment?'' And they said, ``Realtors, home \nbuilders, electrical co-ops, farm bureaus.''\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be associated with those groups that \ngive to our economy and create the jobs in our country. They are not \nantienvironmental. And neither are any of us in this body. The rhetoric \nis misleading and it is even false in some cases.\n  They claimed that the Senate bill that we passed originally lowered \nclean air standards. It did not. They claimed that the Senate bill \nwould have increased industrial pollution. It did not. It provided \nincreases in clean water and drinking water programs.\n  They claimed the Senate bill would have ignored toxic waste sites. It \ndid not. In fact, it is time for this administration to stop rhetoric \nlike that and stop dragging its heels on Superfund cleanups, to put \naside the red tape and get things done that actually clean our water \nand air.\n  So what happened tonight? In order to prevent the President from \nshutting down the Government again, to protect the Washington \nbureaucrats' power, today's bill cedes to the President too much \nauthority that is our authority to write laws and then to make sure \nthat the regulators are doing what we intended for them to do. I think \nthat is a mistake.\n  Last year this Congress recognized that reform of the Endangered \nSpecies Act is long overdue. It called a timeout on new listings and \nnew designations of critical habitat. Congress recognizes that we must \nprotect the environment at the least possible cost to American workers \nand families.\n  The conference report that was before us today permits President \nClinton to suspend the moratorium on new listings at will. The \nEndangered Species Act has been good. It has focused us on the need to \npreserve plants and animals. There have been some notable successes. \nBut the heavyhanded means that are being employed now to preserve \nhundreds of subspecies of bait fish and rats are increasingly \ncounterproductive.\n  The moratorium on listings have kept American workers from losing \ntheir jobs. It has stopped narrow-minded interest groups from hijacking \nthe Endangered Species Act and hurting our economy. Timber growers that \nhave worked for years to grow trees to save for their retirement or for \ntheir children's education have had to cut trees on the basis of a \nrumor that their land might be listed as an endangered species habitat. \nWhy? In order to avoid having Washington bureaucrats tell these people \nthat they cannot cut down a tree after they have cultivated it for \ndecades.\n\n  In central Texas, my home State, the Fish and Wildlife Service \nlimited cutting of cedars to protect habitat for the golden-cheeked \nwarbler. The warbler uses cedar bark to make its nest. Cedars are a \nweed. They are a weed. Our homeowners and land owners clear the land. \nIf they are not cleared, in fact it hurts health. It also absorbs water \nthat should be going into the Edwards Aquifer which is a water supply \nto the city of San Antonio and ranches and farms all over the area.\n  If we cannot rely on the support and cooperation of the people who \nlive with the animals that we want to save, I do not think the animals \nare going to be saved. And that is not in anyone's interest nor is it \nin the interest of saving the animals.\n  That is why I have made such a high priority of reforming the \nEndangered Species Act. We need to forge a new consensus about saving \nendangered species. We need to make private property owners \nstakeholders, not adversaries in the process.\n  That is why I proposed and the President signed into law the \nmoratorium on new listings. The President says we must go back to the \nold law that is obsolete that everyone admits does not work. Even the \npeople who are trying to keep it admit it does not work. It puts the \npower back in the hands of Washington bureaucrats.\n  The President should not be able to change what has passed this body \ntwice in the last year with the stroke of a pen and take away the \nsavings, the property, and even the jobs of hard-working Americans. We \ncan set national environmental standards.\n  We can put Federal resources behind environmental cleanup and \nenforcement. But it must be done in a sensible way. It must take human \nneeds into account. Before we list species again we must put common \nsense into the law, put control back in the hands of the people. Only \nthen will we be able to assure a healthier, safer environment for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, there is some good in the bill that passed tonight. \nThere are some lower spending levels. That was a step in the right \ndirection in many ways. But the President pushed too far. Economic \ndamage could occur. Jobs could be lost. If the Fish and Wildlife \nService acts without considering good science, local concerns, and \nwater supplies for people, there could be untold damage to the people \nof our country.\n  I feel that I must oppose the compromise that passed tonight on this \nprinciple and say to the President, Mr. President, you must assume full \nresponsibility for your administration's actions. If people and \ncommunities are not considered in this process, when farmers cannot \nfarm, and water sources for cities are shut down, and when working \npeople lose their jobs, Mr. President, you have pushed too far, and \nthis politicization of the environment must stop. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as the only Democratic member of this \nbody who sits on both the Appropriations Subcommittee dealing with EPA \nand on the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have had a special \ninterest in the funding of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  And I want to thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for their work on \nthese issues.\n  Mr. President, when the EPA budget first passed the the Senate, EPA's \nfunding level was 17 percent below the fiscal year 1995 level. The \nHouse was 33 percent below the previous year level. Those figures were \nunacceptable to me, to the President and the American people.\n  The people of America have made clear that they want us do all we can \nto protect their drinking water from contaminates, their air from \nharmful smog and their land from the improper disposal of toxic wastes. \nSince the President vetoed that funding bill for EPA, there has been \nsignificant progress.\n  When this pending continuing resolution was considered in the Senate, \nI offered an amendment that would have raised EPA funding $726 million. \nThat would have raised EPA to the full 1995 level by adding money for \nstate assistance for drinking water and sewage treatment, for global \nclimate change research, for environmental enforcement and for Boston \nHarbor clean up.\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\n  Once that amendment was offered, there were long, and ultimately \npainful negotiations among the parties. Needless to say, negotiations \nwere not easy; if they had been today would be October 25,1995 not \nApril 25, 1996.\n  I want to especially acknowledge the efforts of the Junior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, John Kerry, who fought relentlessly to fund EPA \nand, in particular, to address the special needs of Boston Harbor. \nWithout his persistent efforts during our negotiations, the additonal \ndollars for Boston Harbor would not be in this bill.\n  As a member of the Conference, I want to take this opportunity to \nthank Senator Kerry for his hard work and persistent efforts in getting \nthe funding for this important water pollution control program.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this bill contains extremely important \nfunding for the State of Idaho, along with other items I must clearly \nsupport. For that reason, I will be voting in favor of this bill.\n  However, I think it is important to make a record of some of the \nshortcomings of this bill.\n  First, I am extremely disappointed that this bill ignores the \nconcerns of many communities and citizens in the Columbia Basin who \nworked honestly and deliberately over the years to develop local forest \nmanagement plans. Those plans will now be summarily overridden by two \ngigantic environmental impact statements which will dramatically alter \nall the existing local plans on 144 million acres. It remains my \nopinion that these EIS's represent an inappropriate application of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act. They are too big; they are too \nremote for comment by the citizens who will be affected; and they are \ntoo complex for any reasonable understanding by any affected party. I \nam told that this project will have cost the Forest Service and Bureau \nof Land Management up to $30 million. I submit that the advancement of \nscience through this project has been worth but a fraction. Despite my \nefforts and those of Congressman Nethercutt to interject some common \nsense and fiscal responsibility, the language we worked hard to support \nhas been dropped. As a result, I am very apprehensive that our local \ngovernments, our citizens who depend upon the public lands for \nlivelihood and recreation, and many others who use the forest will be \nlocked out of the forest for reasons none of us will ever understand.\n  Another item missing from this agreement that concerns me is my \namendment, passed by the Senate, relating to the Legal Services \nCorporation. Let me acknowledge the efforts of the Senate conferees--\nand particularly, Senator Gregg--to protect this amendment. As my \ncolleagues will recall, this amendment was aimed at what some of us \nbelieve is a pattern of straying from the important mandate of \nproviding legal services to the poor, instead pursuing a political \nagenda. In the case I highlighted, the Legal Services Corporation \ngrantee drove my constituents to the edge of bankruptcy in a 6-year \nbattle over an adoption that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court \nand twice to the Idaho State Supreme Court. Eventually, my constituents \nprevailed and the adoption was finalized. If anyone benefited from this \ngross waste of taxpayer funds, I have yet to discover it. It's my \nintention to continue pursuing my amendment to redress this unfairness \nin another forum.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3019, the \nOmnibus Fiscal Year 1996 Appropriations Bill which includes five \nseparate appropriations bills for the balance of fiscal year 1996. This \nbill provides full year funding for the Veterans, Housing Urban \nDevelopment and Independent Agencies appropriations bill, the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill, the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill, the Interior and Related Agencies appropriations \nbill, and the Commerce, Justice and State appropriations bill. It also \nincludes emergency funding to deal with the floods in the Pacific \nNorthwest and other disasters.\n  Mr. President, I serve as ranking member on the Commerce, Justice and \nState Subcommittee. I have served in that capacity or as Chairman of \nthat Subcommittee since 1977. And, I want to speak today most of all in \nsupport of the conference agreement as it pertains to the departments, \nagencies, programs and people covered by that important appropriations \nbill.\n  We need to keep in mind that we have had 13 stop-gap ``continuing \nresolutions'' since October 1, 1995 when the fiscal year began. In the \ncase of the CJS bill, the Senate completed action on the bill on \nSeptember 29, 1995, and passed the conference report to H.R. 2076 on \nDecember 7, 1995. I voted against that conference report as did 48 of \nmy colleagues. The President then vetoed H.R. 2076 on December 19, \n1995. While the President's official veto message mentioned many \nproblems with the CJS bill, in his actual statement he mentioned only \nthe elimination of the Cops on the Beat program and the Advanced \nTechnology Program as his reasons for finding the bill to be \nunacceptable.\n  So, we have now gone through this somewhat difficult process and \nconferenced what is essentially a new Commerce, Justice and State bill. \nDuring the past weeks, we have had negotiations between the White House \nand the Congressional leadership. And, during the past week, we have \nhad intensive negotiations going on between the White House represented \nby President's Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, his able assistant Martha \nFoley, and Jack Lew of OMB and the Congressional leadership represented \nby our distinguished Chairman, Senator Hatfield, Senator Byrd, House \nChairman Mr. Livingston, and Mr. Obey. They have had to work long hours \non a number of difficult, controversial issues. I think that they have \ndone an excellent job. I think that our Congressional team deserves \nspecial praise. They conducted these negotiations in a bipartisan \nmanner, something that has been seriously lacking in the 104th \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, the Commerce, Justice and State portion of this \nagreement represents a good, realistic compromise that responds to our \nspending priorities at the same time that it cutbacks overall spending. \nThis conference report provides $27.8 billion for the CJS bill. This is \n$3.2 billion BELOW the level requested in the FY 1996 President's \nBudget request.\n  This agreement restores funding for several high priority programs \nand makes several other changes that lead me to conclude that it is a \nvast improvement over the CJS bill that the President vetoed. I will \njust mention a few.\n  First, and most important to me, this agreement provides $221 million \nfor the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program (ATP). I \nauthored this program in the 1988 Trade Act and I can tell you that it \nis strongly supported by the President and was a high priority for our \nlate Secretary of Commerce. Ron Brown. ATP provides cooperative \nagreements that are cost-shared with industry. These ATP awards are \nintended to help industry take leading edge technologies from the \ndrawing board to the marketplace. It is intended to develop entirely \nnew industries, create high-paying jobs, and to help us compete with \nthe Japanese, French, and Germans who maintain quite similar programs.\n  This conference agreement is $221 million above the vetoed CJS bill, \nH.R. 2076, but is still about $210 million below the level enacted for \nthe ATP program in fiscal year 1995. Report language notes that the \nhighest priority should be to continue ATP awards made in fiscal year \n1995 and prior years--but, the new Commerce Secretary, Mickey Kantor, \nis allowed under this agreement to continue to make new ATP awards.\n  And, I should note, that the agreement includes an additional $2 \nmillion for the Office of our Under Secretary of Commerce for \nTechnology, Mary Lowe Good. She is the best. And report language \nexpresses our commitment to continue the U.S./Israel Science and \nTechnology Agreement which is overseen by her office.\n  Second, this conference agreement includes $1.4 billion for the \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services program or ``COPS'' as it is \ncommonly known. This is $100 million above the fiscal year 1995 level, \n$1.4 billion above the level included in H.R. 2076, the Commerce, \nJustice and State bill that the President vetoed last December. I \nshould note that it is almost the identical amount that was restored on \nthe Senate floor in September when the Senate\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\nconsidered H.R. 2076. The conference report reiterates, for the first \ntime since the Republicans won a majority in the House and Senate, that \nthe Congress remains committed to deploying one hundred thousand \nadditional police officers on the beat across America by the year 2000. \nThe conference agreement also provides $503 million for a new local law \nenforcement block grant. This program is intended to meet other law \nenforcement needs that communities may have, such as equipment. It is \nmy hope that this latter program will not simply become a new Law \nEnforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) program.\n  On another crime issue, the conference report includes $403 million \nfor a new State prison grant program, sometimes called ``Truth in \nSentencing.'' This program, which will provide grants to States to \nbuild or renovate or expand prisons. Senator Gregg, our Chairman, and \nhis staff director, David Taylor, worked very, very hard on this issue. \nI think they have come up with a program that is much better than the \nexisting program which is authorized in the 1994 Crime Bill. This new \nprison program will now really address the needs of small states, and \nwill help all states add prison cells to incarcerate violent offenders.\n  Third, this conference agreement includes $1.254 billion for \nDepartment of State international organizations and conferences. For \nthe most part this represents assessed contributions to the United \nNations and other international organizations, for example the World \nHealth Organization and Organization of American States, and for United \nNations Peacekeeping. The conference agreement represents an increase \nof $326 million above the vetoed CJS bill, H.R. 2076. While this is not \na personal priority of mine, I know that the Administration's view was \nthat these funds would have to be restored for the President to sign \nthis bill.\n\n  Fourth, the agreement waives Section 15a of the State Department \nbasic authorities Act, so the State Department can continue to obligate \nappropriations even in the absence of a fiscal year 1996 authorization. \nOnly in this CJS bill do we have this crazy situation where an agency \nis told that it legally cannot obligate appropriations if an annual \nauthorization has not been enacted. The Department of Defense doesn't \nlive under this ridiculous rule. Nor does the Justice Department or \nHealth and Human Services, or anyone else. I'm all for the importance \nof the authorization process--I am ranking minority and former Chairman \nof an authorization committee. But, I would never think of trying to \nstop NASA, or the Transportation Department, or the National Science \nFoundation or other agencies from obligating appropriations that the \nCongress and the President considered, approved, and enacted.\n  I also should note that the bill language regarding Vietnam allows \nthe State Department, USIA, and Foreign Commercial Service to maintain \na presence in that nation. We have opened diplomatic relations with \nVietnam and have an Embassy in that nation. It's time to move forward \nin our relations with Hanoi. I'm glad that Senators Hatfield, Kerry, \nKerrey, McCain, and Lautenberg were able to prevail on this issue.\n  Fifth, this bill includes some very important appropriations for \ndisaster assistance: $100 million is provided for the SBA for disaster \nloans. This ensures that parts of the United States that are hit by \ndisasters in the future, such as tornadoes and hurricanes, can receive \nassistance. And, $18 million is provided to EDA to help the Northwest \nand North Dakota deal with flooding and to address other disasters if \nnecessary.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. What is most important to \nnote is that this bill will become law unlike the previous \nappropriations bills that were vetoed. This is happening because \nmembers from my side of the aisle were included in the appropriations \nprocess. The role of the Presidency was recognized and the \nadministration's views were considered in making spending decisions. \nThis is not the way the Appropriations Committee and the Commerce, \nJustice and State Subcommittee started business in the 104th Congress. \nI truly hope it is the way we now will continue to do business as we \nembark on fiscal year 1997.\n  In conclusion, I think there are many people who deserve credit for \ngetting this bill to this point. But, no one deserves more credit than \nour distinguished Chairman, Senator Hatfield. He and I have been \nGovernors and know what it means to run a government. We have been \nlegislators together in this Senate for some thirty years. Senator \nHatfield understands the responsibilities of being a Senator and what \nit means to be Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, a \nCommittee with such an important tradition and mission. Senator \nHatfield took control a few months ago and literally brought the \nappropriations process back from total chaos. During this fiscal year, \nhe has repeatedly tried to bring some sanity, and bipartisanship to the \nappropriations decisions. I think the President and the many Federal \nemployees in the Executive Branch owe him a real debt of gratitude. \nBut, most of all, I think he has done this Senate, this Congress, and \nthis Nation a very real service and I, for one, want to express my \nappreciation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this conference agreement includes the \nfinal conference agreement on the District of Columbia appropriations \nfor fiscal year 1996. Like each of the other appropriations bills \ncontained in this omnibus agreement, the District's bill has endured a \nlong and arduous course to enactment today.\n  The District of Columbia portion is not all that we would want, but \nit is the best we can do. A key feature of this bill is the education \nreform that it contains. It would have been better and more effective \nif we could have included the $15 million in additional assistance that \nour original conference agreement included to begin these reforms. But \nthat was not possible. However, legislative language is included on \nmany of the reforms and I will work with the Superintendent, the Board \nof Education, other city officials and the control board to make sure \nthat these reforms are implemented. The children of this city can not, \nand now will not, wait another day.\n  The District is in a fiscal crisis. Research by the General \nAccounting Office and the Congressional Research Service of cities who \nhave faced similar crises tells us that if we are to restore the \neconomic vitality, an essential ingredient to restoring fiscal health, \nwe must reform the schools. We must provide quality public schools to \nretain and attract a tax base. That pursuit within Congress begins with \nthis bill.\n  One of the important reforms in the bill is the creation of a \nConsensus Commission on Education Reform. This group of citizens will \ncast a watchful eye over the reform process in the District and, if \nthere are impediments or a failure to act on the required reform plan, \nit will recommend and request the control board to take the required \nsteps to make reform a reality. I am determined that we will no longer \nhave wonderful plans or insightful reports that go unimplemented. This \ntime the intentions of the reformers will be realized.\n\n  The agreement does not include additional funds to carry out these \nreforms in 1996, but it does authorize funds for fiscal year 1997 and \nbeyond. I can assure city officials and my colleagues that I intend to \ndo everything that I can to see that these funds are appropriated next \nyear and in the future so that the changes envisioned are achieved.\n   Mr. President, in closing I want to thank the Senator from Oregon \nfor his tenacious and tireless work on this bill and his invaluable \nhelp in the regular D.C. conference. His help and guidance made an \nagreement possible. Many others contributed to the D.C. bill and the \nOmnibus bill's success, especially the Senator from West Virginia who \nhelped craft the agreement we are considering today.\n  I also need to thank our subcommittee's distinguished ranking member, \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, for his cooperation and \nsupport during the consideration of this bill. Finally, Mr. President, \nour counterparts in the House, Representative Jim Walsh and \nRepresentative Julian Dixon, who worked with us in a partnership to \nfind common ground and bring this bill to this point today.\n   Mr. President, I urge Senators to support this agreement, we need to \nget on with the task of reforming public education in the District and \nrestoring\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\nfiscal sense to it's budget process. This bill sets that course. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to gratefully express my \nrelief that finally, 7 months into the current fiscal year, we are \ndebating the bill that will put this year's budget to bed. And I am \npleased to be able to support this bill based on changes that have been \nmade over the past few days.\n  This agreement did not come easy, and it comes nearly too late for \nmany people. It's unfortunate that it took two Government shut-downs, \ninnumerable furloughs, and needlessly bitter partisan disputes, before \nwe reached the path of resolution: serious bipartisan negotiations.\n  I do not think many families would make their budgets this way, 6 \nmonths late. I know I would not. But I am glad we've reached an \nagreement nonetheless.\n  I said to all my colleagues and the people of Washington State early \nlast year there is a right way, and a wrong way, to balance the Federal \nbudget. The wrong way would be to use quick and dirty gimmicks, paper \ntigers like the constitutional amendment or the line item veto.\n  I said the right way is to go through the budget line-by-line, \nprogram-by-program, and make the tough choices necessary to balance the \nbooks. Well, that is what happened on this bill. It reflects tough \ndecisions, and strong, clearly-set priorities of both political \nparties.\n  The final agreement saves the taxpayers another $23 billion under \nlast year's budget, and I think that's a good thing. But it also \nredirects funds to support important education programs, health \nprograms, and environmental programs. In other words, we achieved a \nrare balance between spending cuts and spending increases that is good \nfor the people.\n  I want to talk briefly about each of these three areas, environmental \npriorities, education priorities, and public health priorities.\n  Mr. President, I am so pleased with the progress the administration \nmade in stripping this bill of almost all environmental riders. I \nbelieve this cleaner bill represents a victory for all of us who care \nabout the health of our environment and protection of natural \nresources. Two provisions I spoke against on the floor 3 days ago have \nbeen dropped: those affecting the Columbia Basin Ecosystem Project and \nthose addressing the timber salvage provisions.\n  Now, the Columbia Basin Ecosystem Project can go forward, providing \nresource managers with comprehensive, scientific information about how \nbest to protect the land, restore riparian habitat, and sustainably use \nour natural resources. This offers us one of our first opportunities to \nget ahead of the curve, and proactively address resource management \nbefore it we face a debilitating crisis. I appreciate my Senate \ncolleagues agreeing to allow this project to move forward.\n  Likewise, I appreciate Senator Hatfield dropping the salvage \nprovisions. I know there was legitimate disagreement between the \nchairman and the President about whether these provisions would help or \nhinder the administration's ability to alter current timber contracts \nto protect old growth forests. This has been such a contentious, \ndivisive issue that finding the right course of action in this \natmosphere has been nearly impossible. I wish this Senate had chosen \nsimply to repeal the entire timber salvage rider and replace it with \nthe long-term salvage program I had advocated in my amendment.\n  Overall, the Interior portion of this bill is balanced and fair. The \nPresident's Forest Plan is well-funded, the Elwha Dam has initial \nacquisition funds, Native American programs have been sufficiently \nfunded, some important land acquisitions have been made, and many vital \nprograms remain intact. I am very sorry the Lummi People are still \nbeing coerced about water rights on their reservation and wish we could \nhave made more progress on this provision.\n  Now on to education. Mr. President, my greatest concerns in this \nbudget were the deep and painful cuts to programs that support \nAmerica's young people. When we began this debate, we were faced with a \nproposal that would have slashed nearly $4 billion away from the \neducation of our next generation. Had these cuts been enacted, we would \nhave faced the largest setback to education in our Nation's history.\n  Thankfully, for children in Washington State and the millions of \nyoung people who can not be heard through the vote, rational and \nthoughtful leadership prevailed. The add backs to education and \ntraining represent a commitment to programs that provide opportunity \nand hope.\n  We have restored $333 million for dislocated worker retraining that \nputs my State's timber workers back into the work force. We have added \nback $137 million Head Start dollars that insure our kids begin school \nready to learn. We have restored $635 million for summer youth jobs for \nour young people that provide many of our most disadvantaged kids with \nthe opportunity to give back to their communities. We have also saved \nthe Safe and Drug Free Schools Program with $200 million that works \nproactively to take the fear out of our classrooms. Finally, the \nSchool-to-Work Program, which has been proven effective in the State of \nWashington received an additional $182 million. These programs, along \nwith $814 million new Title I dollars that provide our schools with the \nessentials of learning, will immeasurably benefit our kids and our \nNation's future.\n\n  I also want to talk about how AIDS research, prevention, and \ntreatment issues have been handled by this Congress. Today's agreement \nhas been a long-time coming. Finally, we have the opportunity to vote \nand pass a spending measure that will give help and peace of mind to \nmany who need it most. Of course, we can always do more and there is \nalways room for improvement. But, after months of debate and \ndisagreement, we have come up with a plan that I can vote for. I \nrecognize the need to cut spending and allocate Federal resources with \nstrict scrutiny.\n  But, these decisions cannot be made at the expense of our most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  Programs like the Ryan White CARE Act receive a much needed increase. \nThis bill raises funding for programs which care for those living with \nHIV/AIDS by $106 million over last year. These are critical dollars \nfor: emergency care for particularly hard-hit cities like Seattle; \ncomprehensive care for all our States to cope with the epidemic; early \nintervention services to save money down the road; and funds for \nPediatric AIDS demonstration projects.\n  The AIDS Education Training Center program, which I fought so hard to \nprotect last fall, and which I fought hard for throughout this process, \nwill be maintained. This critical program provides information to \nhealth care professionals about HIV and keeps them up-to-date on the \nlatest in treatment for those living with HIV and AIDS. We must make \nsure that information and public awareness are kept at an all-time \nhigh, and I congratulate my colleagues for having the good sense to \nrecognize the importance of the AETC program.\n  I also want to briefly express my relief that the blatantly \ndiscriminatory policy of discharging HIV-infected service members is \nrepealed in this bill. This proposal was closed-minded, unfounded, and \noffensive to our men and women in uniform who have chosen to serve our \ncountry. The Dornan-provision sent the wrong message; it said that \nCongress bases decisions on ignorance, fear and hate. I want no part of \nsending that message, and today we have the chance to right a terrible \nwrong.\n  Finally, Mr. President, while I am pleased with many of the changes \nthat were made to this bill, I am deeply disappointed that Senator \nHatfield's language on International Family Planning was not \nmaintained. Like many issues in this Congress, the Senate has taken a \ndifferent approach than our counterparts in the House with respect to \nInternational Family Planning assistance. Throughout the debate on this \nissue, the Senate has continually supported funding for this program, \nand I have spoken many times in favor of our efforts to continue \nproviding these services.\n  As it stands now, none of the appropriated funds can be spent until \nJuly 1. After that, money can only be spent on a month-to-month basis \nat a rate of 6.7 percent a month until the new fiscal year begins on \nOctober 1. The result is funding for U.S. population assistance will be \nreduced by about 85 percent\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\nfrom last year's level. This is a disastrous situation that will \nseverely hamper this program.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, \nI will work this year to try to restore these funds in fiscal year \n1997. The millions of couples who rely on these valuable services are \ncounting on this assistance.\n  Mr. President, I am glad we have finished the fiscal year 1996 \nbudget. It's the people's business, and it's our responsibility to \nconduct. While the process over the past several months has been \ndominated by partisanship and dispute, the past few weeks have \ndemonstrated that if reasonable leaders get together, they can usually \nresolve their differences and reach agreements that serve the public \ninterest.\n  I sincerely hope this example sets a new tone that will carry into \nthe fiscal year 1997 budget process. We have a short year, only a few \nmonths left to complete work on 13 new budget bills, before the \npolitical season completely overtakes Congress. I think it is in \neveryone's interest that we remain at the table and complete our next \nset of tasks with good humor and discipline.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when H.R. 3019 passed the Senate on March \n19, substantial progress had been made to protect critical funding for \neducation and training programs. The amendment I offered with Senator \nHarkin during Senate consideration provided $2.7 billion more for \neducation, job training and Head Start programs for the 1996/1997 \nacademic year. These additional funds were fully offset, thus \npreserving the balanced budget objectives for discretionary \nappropriations in fiscal year 1996.\n  The conference agreement before the Senate today maintains the \nincreased funds for education provided by the Specter/Harkin amendment. \nIt also protects funding for other important objectives, such as, \nworker safety, medical research, health services, and domestic violence \nprevention.\n  Overall, H.R, 3019 appropriates $64.6 billion for discretionary \nprograms of the Labor, HHS and Education Subcommittee. This is $204 \nmillion above the Senate passed bill, $2.6 billion above the House \nbill, and $2.6 billion, or 4 percent, below the 1995 post-rescission \nlevel. Included in the bill is the termination of over 110 programs \nviewed by the conferees as either having met their objectives, being \nduplicative of other programs, or having low priority. The bill's \nhighlights include the following: $625 million for the 1996 Summer \nYouth Employment Program of the Department of Labor; the House bill had \nterminated this program; $1.1 billion for the Dislocated Worker \nRetraining Program, bringing the total $233 million above the House \nbill; $1.3 billion for worker protection programs, bringing the average \nfunding level for each enforcement agency to 98 percent of the 1995 \nlevel; $350 million for the School to Work Program, jointly \nadministered by the Departments of Labor and Education, an increase of \n$105 million from the 1995 appropriated level. $11.9 billion for \nmedical research supported by the National Institutes of Health. This \nis an increase of $654 million over the 1995 level, or 5.8 percent; \n$738 million for the Ryan White AIDS Programs. this is an increase of \n$105 million over 1995. Within the total is $52 million specifically \nset aside for the AIDS drugs reimbursement program. These additional \nfunds will enable states to better meet the growing cost and demand for \nnew AIDS drugs; $93 million to continue the Healthy Start Program. This \nis $43 million above the original level passed by the House. $3.57 \nbillion for the Head Start Program. This is $36 million above the 1995 \nlevel; 350 million for the GOALS 2000 Educate America Act Program. The \nHouse bill had terminated funding for this program; $7.2 billion for \nthe Title I, Compensatory Education for the Disadvantaged Program. This \nis the same as the 1995 level and nearly $1 billion more than the House \nbill; $466 million for the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program. This is \n$266 million above the House bill; and $78 million for education \ntechnology programs which assist schools in expanding the availability \nof technology enhanced curricula and instruction to improve educational \nservices. This is $23 million above 1995.\n  H.R. 3019 also preserves funding for student aid programs. The \nagreement raises the maximum Pell Grant to $2,470. This is an increase \nof $130 in the maximum grant and is the highest maximum grant ever \nprovided. Funds also are provided to maintain the capital contributions \nto the Perkins Loan Program and Federal support for the State Student \nIncentive Grants Program.\n  Finally, the agreement includes $900 million for the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) in fiscal year 1996. The original \nHouse bill, H.R. 2127, had included no funding for the LIHEAP Program. \nH.R. 3019, also makes available $420 million in ``emergency'' \ncontingency funds for the fiscal year 1997 program. Regular funding for \nnext winter's LIHEAP Program will be considered during the fiscal year \n1997 appropriations process.\n  It is always easy to add money, but much more difficult to find the \noffsets for additional spending in order to not add to the Federal \ndeficit. The conference agreement before the Senate today succeeds in \nboth restoring funding to critical education, health and training \nprograms and in maintaining our commitment to balance the federal \nbudget. It is an excellent appropriations bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to give it their support.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, with the passage of this bill, and \nwith the signature of the President, the Federal Government will, at \nlong last, resume normal operations. The Federal Government will \nfunction as planned--for the first time in 7 months.\n  Much has happened in those past 7 months. Thirteen times, the \nGovernment of the United States faced uncertain funding. Twice, the \nGovernment ground to a halt. Federal services were interrupted, Federal \npaychecks were stopped, and Federal employees were treated as helpless \npawns in the midst of congressional grandstanding. Financial markets, \ninternational image, and public confidence were put at risk. There \nseems to be no resolution to this situation.\n  Seven months of uncertainty, said some of my colleagues, yes--but a \nnecessary sacrifice to achieve 7 years of deficit reduction and a \nbalanced budget by 2002.\n  That reasoning, Mr. President, was just plain wrong.\n  The type of Federal spending that pays for Government salaries and \nGovernment programs, known as domestic discretionary spending, is not \nresponsible for our Federal deficits. Discretionary spending has not \nincreased as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product since 1969--the \nlast time we had a balanced budget. Discretionary spending is a mere \none-sixth of the $1.5 trillion total of Federal spending--and that is \nsteadily declining.\n  The real problems with the deficit are with what are known as \nentitlement spending--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, federal \nretirement programs, and interest on the national debt. These programs \nare consuming a rapidly growing portion of overall federal revenues, \nand, by 2012, will consume 100 percent of the revenue the Federal \nGovernment takes in.\n  I know how important it is to reduce the deficit. That's why I \ncosponsored the Balanced Budget Amendment. We cannot leave a legacy of \ndebt to our children. We have an obligation to restore budget \ndiscipline, so that our children--and future generations--will be able \nto achieve the American Dream.\n\n  In order to do that, tough choices must be made. All federal programs \nmust be on the table. Nothing can be exempt from review. Everything \nmust be examined to see where we can do better, and what we no longer \nneed to do.\n  That does not mean, however, that reducing the debt can be achieved \nsimply by cutting one Federal program in favor of another. Yet that's \nexactly what this omnibus appropriations bill attempts to do.\n  This $163 billion bill funds programs normally funded through \nindividual appropriations bills, such as education, job training, Head \nStart, crime and the environment. Over $5 billion in programs once \ntargeted for termination or deep cuts are restored, such as Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions, Head Start, Safe and Drug Free \nSchools, and School-to-Work programs.\n  The bill provides $1.4 billion to put 100,000 additional police \nofficers on the streets. The bill restores the Summer Jobs for Youth \nProgram, restores $195\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\nmillion for the Goals 2000 program, for a total $350 million; restores \n$387 million more for National Service, for a total of $402 million, \nand restores Title I funding for disadvantaged students. The bill also \nboosts Ryan White funds by $82 million, EPA water programs by $465 \nmillion, and Superfund by $150 million.\n  The agreement deletes, or allows the President to waive such \ncontroversial legislative riders as the anti-environmental provisions \nassociated with the Tongass National Forest, Mojave National Preserve, \nand Endangered Species Act.\n  Also included in the bill is a repeal of the discriminatory provision \nthat would have forced HIV-positive members of the military to leave \nthe service.\n  This bill is a great improvement over the spending levels initially \nproposed by this Congress. The restoration, or near restoration, of \nmany of these education and job training programs means that the \npriorities of the American people have prevailed.\n  The bill still cuts important discretionary spending by $23 billion.\n  Some may hail that as deficit reduction, Mr. President, and yes, a \nnumber of these program reductions and terminations are justified.\n  But cutting those items will not make a dent in Federal deficits. The \nappropriations process cannot be expected to compensate for our failure \nto address our deficit problem.\n  We can cut this $23 billion, cut welfare and foreign aid, stop pork \nbarrel spending, and eliminate funding for Congress altogether, but we \nstill will not solve our more fundamental budget problems.\n  The only way to really balance the budget is to act based on the \nbudgetary realities, rather than the myths. If we fail to do so, in \nless than 20 years, the skyrocketing growth in entitlement programs \nmeans there will not be one single dollar for agriculture, for \neducation, for national defense, or transportation, cancer research, or \nflood control, or any of the myriad of other Federal activities.\n  It is as simple as that, Mr. President, and it's a critical fact that \nthis bill, with all its cuts, simply misses.\n  We are halfway into this fiscal year. There is a time to debate, and \na time to act. While I believe we can do far better than this bill, \ngoing forward with additional temporary funding extensions is something \nI find even more unpalatable, and that is why I reluctantly will \nsupport final passage of this conference report.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise to voice my serious concerns that \nthis omnibus appropriations bill fails to include an important \nprovision: a limitation on the expansion of the Federal Direct Loan \nProgram to 40 percent of loan volume for the academic year that begins \non July 1, 1996.\n  As my colleagues know, back in the fall when we passed the Balanced \nBudget and Reconciliation Act, Congress agreed to return this \nquestionable, big-government program to a true demonstration size--10 \npercent of total student loan volume. Many of us viewed the 10 percent \ncap as a reasonable compromise, especially in light of the House vote \nto repeal the program altogether. And, many of us would still prefer to \nrepeal this misguided takeover of the student loan program.\n  Nonetheless, I and many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nwere willing to support a middle ground on this issue: a limit on the \nexpansion of direct lending to 40 percent of loan volume. I believe \nthat this was a more-than-reasonable compromise because it would permit \nall currently participating schools to remain in the program. Let me \nsay that again: not one school that is already participating in direct \nloans would be forced out.\n  However, the administration would not accept this reasonable \ncompromise. The President allegedly threatened to veto the entire \nomnibus appropriations bill if a cap on direct lending was included. \nThis is incredible! That the President would be willing to hold the \nentire appropriations process hostage to ensure the continued expansion \nof a program which is nothing more than a delivery system for loans, is \ntruly an extreme position.\n  Remember, this President told the country just a few short months \nago, during his State of the Union address, that the era of big \nGovernment is over. This same President stressed the need for stronger \npublic-private partnerships in meeting the needs of the American \npeople. Yet he threatened to stop the budget process once again if this \nomnibus appropriations bill included a cap on a massive, new government \nbureaucracy which seeks to end a public/private partnership which has \nbeen successfully serving students for 30 years!\n  We should not allow the President to pretend to be moderate on the \ncampaign trail while he engineers a potentially disastrous federal \ntakeover of the student loan industry. The President's refusal to \nnegotiate a reasonable cap on the untested direct loan program exposes \nthe true colors of this administration: rather than new Democrats they \nare clearly old-fashioned, bureaucracy-building, Washington-knows-best \nliberals.\n  Unlike the more complex debates over Medicare, Medicaid and welfare \ndelivery systems, it is quite obvious that direct lending is an \nintuitively backward idea that will:\n  Make the Department of Education the single largest consumer finance \nlender in the country, while driving private lenders out of the student \nloan business.\n  Result in a $150 billion increase in federal debt by 2002, and a $350 \nbillion increase over the next 20 years.\n  Eliminate a program where the private lenders share default risk, and \nreplace it with a system where private sector contractors shift the \nentire risk to the taxpayer.\n  Replace private sector competition with government contractors.\n  Substitute an untested student aid delivery system that has yet to \ndemonstrate the ability to collect the loans it makes for the \nguaranteed loan program, which has dramatically improved the \nperformance of the student loan portfolio in recent years.\n  We should keep in mind that the Department of Education's management \ntrack record bodes ill for the future of the direct loan program.\n  The management track record of the Department of Education over the \npast few years--and the last several months in particular--raises grave \nquestions concerning whether the Department has the management ability \nto take over student lending without jeopardizing the uninterrupted \nflow of funds in the Nation's largest program of student financial \nassistance.\n  Major missteps in the past year have included:\n  I. Inability to process on a timely basis the Federal Application for \nStudent Financial Aid (FAFSA), the basis calculation of financial need \nrequired of all applicants for student assistance.\n  Although the Department continues to blame weather and Federal \nfurloughs for the unprecedented delays, the fact is that the Department \nstarted 6 months behind schedule, and hired new contractors using new, \nuntested technology. In trying to cover up their very serious mistakes, \nthe Department has had to hire additional processors and authorized 24-\nhour, 7-day-a-week operation, at unknown additional taxpayer cost.\n  Students and institutions have been severely affected by this mix-up \nat the Department: institutional financial aid officers and State \nscholarship programs are unable to offer student aid packages to \nprospective students; a million students do not know where or whether \nthey will be able to attend college this fall; and 23 percent of our \nNation's colleges are planning to push back their May 1 deadline for \nstudents to decide which college to attend.\n  II. The Department has mismanaged the congressionally mandated anti-\ndefault initiative, which is designed to terminate high-default schools \nfrom Federal student loan programs.\n  Although the law requires the Department to decide institutional \nappeals within 45 days, the Department failed to meet this requirement. \nIn an effort to get rid of its 1992 backlog, the Department threw in \nthe towel and accepted whatever default rate a school claimed for \nitself, without investigation. As a result, schools with default rates \nof as high as 24 percent now boast single digit official rates for \nfiscal year 1992. Incredibly, there is still a backlog of 400 appeals \nof rates calculated for 1990 and 1991!\n  As a result, students at high-default institutions have remained \neligible for student loans--loans which have a high\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\nprobability of defaulting, burdening taxpayers with millions of dollars \nin unnecessary costs. The Department's default rate for 1993 for high \nrisk schools was so flawed that it had to be withdrawn and reissued in \nFebruary 1996.\n  III. The Inspector General severely criticized the cost effectiveness \nof the Department's efforts to encourage defaulters to consolidate \ntheir defaulted loans into direct lending's income contingent \nrepayment.\n  The Inspector General estimated this flawed initiative could cost \ntaxpayers $38 million.\n  IV. Failure of the Department's contractor to post information \nreceived from guaranty agencies on a timely basis has resulted in \nthousands of defaulted borrowers having their income tax refunds \nwrongly withheld.\n  In addition, these individuals have been subjected to Federal \ncollections efforts despite the fact that they had entered into \nsatisfactory repayment arrangements with their guarantor.\n  V. The National Student Loan Data System, mandated by Congress in \n1986 and only implemented by the Department in 1995, is so flawed that \nit has erroneously calculated school default rates and cannot be relied \nupon for its basic function of determining student's eligibility for \ngrants or loans.\n  What does this woeful litany of mismanagement mean?\n  It means that the Department of Education has used poor judgment in \ndeveloping its computer systems and overseeing its contractors.\n  It means that its current management is incapable of performing \nessential technological functions which it had been performing \nsuccessfully for a number of years.\n  It means that the taxpayer will be unnecessarily burdened with \nadditional costs incurred because of the Department's inability to \nmanage.\n  It means that millions of students and their parents are, at the very \nleast, extremely inconvenienced by the Department's inability to \ngenerate information essential to awarding of student financial aid on \na timely basis. And in far too many cases, a student's entire future--\nwhether or not he/she attends college--may be jeopardized by the \nDepartment's mismanagement.\n  And it means that it would be foolhardy to trust the Nation's largest \nstudent financial assistance program--student loans--to the same \nDepartmental officials that have in the past few months mismanaged \nevery major contract and system for which they have been responsible.\n  This debate is about what is the best way of delivering student \nloans--whether through a Federal bureaucracy, or through a private-\npublic partnership. While I believe very strongly that the latter will \nprevail in the long run, the compromise that the President would not \nallow simply called for leaving things where they are, and not \nexpanding this program further.\n  We should not be allowing the administration to go forward with its \ngrandiose plans for taking over the student loan program with its own \nuntested, costly direct government lending program. The \nadministration's direct loan program is more Federal bureaucrats, more \nGovernment spending, and a more costly program. The administration \nwants this massive, new bureaucracy to replace the current bank-based \nstudent loan program.\n  By not including a cap on this experimental program in this omnibus \nappropriations bill we are trusting the Department of Education to \ndistribute, account for, and collect billions of dollars in student \nloans. This is the same Department that is currently causing students \nacross the country to have to worry needlessly about their financial \naid awards because the Department was unable to manage the processing \nof the forms.\n  We should be stopping this insanity today. A reasonable cap of 40 \npercent on direct lending would have forced the Department to slow down \nand pay attention to all the student aid programs, not just direct \nlending--hopefully avoiding a repeat of the trauma which is facing \nstudents now during the application cycle. Unfortunately, this \nreasonable approach was lost along the way.\n  President Clinton's pronouncements in his State of the Union Address \nnotwithstanding, the era of big government continues.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, there is no excuse for the Congress to have \ndelayed the fiscal 1996 budget this long. But thankfully, the high \nstakes game of political chicken is finally over. After closing the \nGovernment on two occasions, passing 13 separate stop-gap funding \nbills, and waiting a full 7 months beyond the start of the budget year, \nCongress will finally pass the 1996 spending bill.\n  This $160 billion measure funds the programs from five separate \nappropriations bills throughout the rest of this fiscal year. I will \nvote for the bill because it demonstrates that, when we work as a \nbipartisan majority, we can do what America has been asking us to do \nfor a long time: cut the budget while protecting priorities like \neducation, health care, and the environment. With this plan, overall \nFederal spending will be cut by $23 billion. However, $5 billion for \nhealth, education, environment, and job training programs has been \nrestored under this measure.\n  Because some were intent on trying to score political points this \nyear rather than finishing our budget in a timely fashion, important \nprograms for education, public health and job training and safety had \nbeen left in precarious funding situations since October 1, the \nbeginning of the fiscal year. State labor departments were hampered in \ntheir ability to help those affected by plant closings. Head Start \nadministrators wondered if they would have to close doors in the middle \nof their program year, negating recent gains from this early \nintervention program. And it looked like Americorps would be killed \nbefore the benefits from this promising community service program were \never realized.\n  But no cuts would have had a more detrimental and long-term effect \nthan the proposed cuts in education. I say this as a strong advocate of \nbalancing the budget. To get to that goal, I know we have to consider \ncuts in programs we support. And I am willing to do so in every area--\nexcept education. The drastic cuts in education initially proposed \nwould have set our Nation back in the attempt to build a work force \nneeded to lead our economy into the 21st Century.\n  During negotiations with the House, the Senate and the administration \ninsisted on basing overall education funding on the levels contained in \nthe Senate bill--that is, funding at least at last year's level. As a \nMember of the Appropriations Committee, I have fought for the Senate \neducation levels. With the diligent leadership of Senators Hatfield, \nByrd, Specter, and Harkin, the Senate position on education prevailed.\n  The title I education program, our largest contribution to schools \nacross the country to help teach disadvantaged kids, has been funded at \n$7.2 billion. This is a full restoration to last year's level. Safe and \ndrug free schools, a program granting schools the resources they need \nto curb drugs and violence and create a productive learning \nenvironment, is funded at last year's amount of $466 million. GOALS \n2000 will be funded at $350 million, $22 million less than 1995, but \nenough to allow States and school districts to continue in their \nefforts to pursue effective education benchmarks. I am very pleased to \nsay that the School to Work Program, which helps kids obtain technical \nskills critically needed in today's work force, received a $105 million \nincrease.\n  Although these levels may not seem like a huge victory, just take a \nlook at what could have been, and what would have been, had the Senate \nand the President caved to extremist policies. The House proposed \ncutting title I education by almost $1 billion; Goals 2000 was \ncompletely eliminated as was the State student incentive grant program; \n$266 million was slashed from the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program; \nvocational education was cut $83 million; and, school to work cut $55 \nmillion.\n  These levels would have had dire consequences for Wisconsin's \neducation system. Wisconsin was originally slated to lose $28 million \nin education resources--including over $1 million in cuts to Goals \n2000, almost $2 million in cuts to safe and drug free schools, over $4 \nmillion in vocational education cuts, and an unsustainable $20 million \ncut in title I, the money that goes to our most disadvantaged young \nstudents. This bill today prevents these short-sighted education cuts.\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\n  Other programs important to the future of Wisconsin received needed \ninvestments under this bill. The Ryan White AIDS programs received a \n$105 million increase from last year. This total includes $52 million \ndirected to the AIDS drug reimbursement program so that States may \nbetter meet demands for breakthrough drugs. Healthy start, which funds \na promising demonstration program in Milwaukee aimed at preventing \ninfant mortality, was restored to $93 million, or $43 million above the \nHouse cut. Funding was added back to the mental health block grant, \nwhich provides resources to help adults and children with severe mental \nillness and emotional disturbance. Dislocated worker assistance and the \nSummer Youth Employment Program were also restored under the bill.\n  Mr. President, this bill is much more than a day late, but at least \nit's not billions of dollars short on education. Although I am \ndisappointed with some provisions of the bill, I am pleased that our \nefforts to restore the investment in education prevailed.\n  I am also pleased that the most egregious antienvironmental riders \nhave been either eliminated or modified in this bill. Further, I am \npleased that a significant portion of the funding for environmental \nprograms has been restored. While overall fiscal constraints will \nundoubtedly become more severe in the coming years as we take the steps \nnecessary to move toward a balanced budget, I think we should take a \ncloser look at our priorities for discretionary spending. In my view, \nspending on the environment, as an investment in our future, should be \na priority.\n\n  There are some aspects of this bill with which I am much less happy. \nI am very disappointed that this budget fails to fund an adequate \namount of crime prevention--programs that can reach young people before \nthey are lost to a life of crime. Last fall, a bipartisan Senate agreed \nto shift $80 million into crime prevention programs like Weed & Seed, \nthe Boys and Girls Clubs, and DARE--only about one-quarter of what was \nauthorized by the 1994 Crime Act for prevention in 1996. As we started \non a new version of the budget this spring, a separate bipartisan vote \nof the full Appropriations Committee again set aside $80 million for a \nbroad range of local crime prevention--less than 5 percent out of the \n$1.9 billion local law enforcement block grant.\n  Despite these votes, and continuing bipartisan support on the Senate \nside, our $80 million in crime prevention funding was quietly stripped \nout of this legislation, leaving only a small increase for Weed & Seed \nand the Boys and Girls Clubs, and entirely neglecting those areas that \ndo not have one of these programs. After all these months, we are shut \nout--and so are all of the young people who are looking for a little \nhelp in their efforts to get off the streets and stay out of prison.\n  The 1994 Crime Act authorized a reasonable 80 percent to 20 percent \nsplit between law enforcement and prevention. But this budget wipes out \nalmost all prevention funding. As any professional in the juvenile \njustice system will tell you, that is a big mistake.\n  I am also disappointed with the conferees' action on agricultural \ncredit. The fiscal year 1996 agriculture appropriations bill was \ncompleted by Congress and signed by the President in a timely manner \nlast year, and therefore we have not needed to include regular \nagriculture funding in any of the continuing resolutions. However, \nthere is an agricultural credit provision in this bill, which seeks to \nrectify a credit provision of the recently passed farm bill that I \nbelieve is very unfair.\n  The farm bill provision in question essentially prohibits farmers \nfrom receiving USDA loans or loan guarantees if they ever had their \ndebts restructured. During the 1980s, the Federal Government actively \nencouraged farmers to restructure and write down their debts. Now the \nnew farm bill tells farmers that they are barred from getting more \nloans if they took that advice, even if they are creditworthy today. In \nmy mind, that's close to a breach of contract.\n  A number of us in this body have cosponsored a bill S. 1690, \nintroduced by Senators Conrad and Grassley, that would provide some \nshort-term relief for farmers that have been caught by this mid-stream \nchange of policy by delaying implementation of these unfortunate credit \neligibility provisions for 90 days.\n  Further, as a member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, \nI have also been working with others to try to craft language to be \nincluded in this continuing resolution to resolve this matter. While \nthere is a provision included in the bill to try to provide some \nrelief, I believe that it is far too narrow because it doesn't address \nthe plight of farmers with farm ownership loans that have been \napproved, but not yet obligated. Even under the credit provision \nincluded in this bill, those farmers will be denied those loans that \nthey had previously been promised. To address this problem, 11 Senators \nrecently signed a letter asking for the necessary revisions to the \nprovision. I am discouraged that these efforts were rejected.\n  All in all, I think this bill is a victory for fiscal sanity and a \nvictory for education, health care, and the environment. Unfortunately, \nthe battle went on too long and extracted too high a price--the \nuncertainty for Federal fund recipients, the Government shutdowns, the \npartisan budget negotiations, and the divisive parliamentary \nmaneuvering around the 13 continuing resolutions. We should strive for \na similar end next year. But lets hope that our means of getting there \nis more sensible, more bipartisan, and more productive.\n\n\n              national commission on restructuring the irs\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I want to compliment the work of the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, for securing the \nadoption of an amendment in the conference to modify the composition of \nthe National Commission on Restructuring the IRS, which was authorized \nin Public Law 104-52. This amendment increases to 17 the number of \nmembers of the Commission. With this change, Mr. President, I believe \nwe can stop the logjam which we have found ourselves in and get the \nmajority and minority leaders of both bodies and the President to make \ntheir appointments to this Commission in an expeditious manner. I \nwould, however, like to take this opportunity to clarify two points \nwith respect to the Commission with the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman, Mr. Shelby. First, by increasing the number of Commission \nmembers to 17 under section 637(b)(2) of Public Law 104-52, we intended \nthat the number of members to constitute a quorum under section \n637(b)(4), would increase from seven to nine. Is that the Senator's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, that is my understanding. Because we did not want to \nreopen the Treasury chapter in the conference, this technical change \nwas not made, but it is certainly my intention as the subcommittee \nchairman that the Commission should honor our intent that nine members \nof the Commission will constitute a quorum.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the distinguished Senator for that clarification. \nFinally, I want to ask if it is the Senator's understanding we intended \nthat the Commission not issue its report until after December 31, 1996?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, that is my understanding.\n  Mr. KERREY. Again, I thank the distinguished Senator for all of his \nwork on this important matter. In addition, I want to thank the \ndistinguished majority and minority leaders and the President for their \ninvolvement in this issue and urge them to make their appointments to \nthis Commission as quickly as possible.\n\n\n establishment of a pediatric intensive care center in an empowerment \n                  zone encompassing camden, new jersey\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nchairman's attention, and to the attention of my esteemed colleague, \nSenator Harkin, that Cooper Hospital/University Medical Center and its \nChildren's Regional Hospital are the only acute care hospitals in the \nempowerment zone that encompass Camden, NJ. These hospitals provide \ncritical services to the Camden community. Now they are proposing to \nestablish a new pediatric rehabilitation center which will address a \nvital unmet need in the community. There are many worthy organizations \nseeking these empowerment funds; however, this project is expected to \nprovide community based quality care for children from communities in \nthe Camden area. I strongly suggest that this project be considered for \nempowerment zone funding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for bringing this matter to our \nattention. I\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nconcur with his recommendation and underscore the value of such a \nfacility. This project should certainly be considered for empowerment \nzone funding.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with my distinguished colleagues and am \nencouraged by the significant contributions such a project can make. \nConsideration should be given to the establishment of the pediatric \nintensive care center with empowerment zone funds.\n\n\n              Universal Newborn hearing screening colloquy\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Specter, in a colloquy. As you know, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services recently issued a plan to \nimprove the health of this country's citizens by the year 2000. \nIncluded in that plan, commonly referred to as the healthy people 2000 \nreport, was a goal to reduce the average age at which children with \nsignificant hearing impairment are identified to no more than 12 \nmonths.\n  In March 1993, NIH convened a consensus panel on early identification \nof hearing impairments in infants and young children. That panel \nrecommended that all children be screened for hearing impairment before \nthey discharged from the birthing hospital. Unfortunately, at that \ntime, few hospitals or audiologists and experience with the newborn \nhearing screening techniques which were recommended. Therefore, in \nOctober 1993, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau funded a consortium \nof sites who were experienced with NIH-recommended technique to \nencourage and assist with the implementation of the NIH recommendation. \nThat consortium, with a relatively small amount of Federal money, has \nbeen extremely successful in assisting with the implementation of \nnewborn hearing screening programs. Through their efforts, there are \nnow over 70 hospitals in 14 different States doing universal newborn \nhearing screening following the NIH-recommended protocol.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think the work of the consortium which you have \ndescribed is the kind of work which is needed to continue universal \nnewborn hearing screening consistent with the healthy people 2000 \nreport and the NIH recommendations. I would support the continued \nfunding of these activities by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau.\n\n\n                          vista literacy corps\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the intent of the \nconferees in regard to funding for the VISTA Program. It is my \nunderstanding that the conference agreement provides an additional $2.1 \nmillion for VISTA and that this represents half of the $5 million added \nby amendment in the Senate for the VISTA Literacy Corps. Is this \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SIMON. Am I also correct in assuming that the conferees intend \nthat these funds may be allocated specifically to the efforts to combat \nilliteracy that have been carried out by the VISTA Literacy Corps?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator is correct in his understanding of our \nintent.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the Senator and appreciate the support of the \nCommittee for the effective work of the VISTA Literacy Corps.\n\n\n                          disaster assistance\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, on the floor and \nwonder if he would be willing to engage in a short colloquy with \nSenator Conrad and myself on the disaster assistance section of the \nomnibus appropriations bill, H.R. 3019.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I will be happy to respond to any questions you may \nhave.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are particularly concerned that the conference \nagreement does not explicitly mention that Devils Lake, ND, is eligible \nto receive disaster and hazard mitigation assistance from the Economic \nDevelopment Administration, as was the case in the Senate-passed \nversion of the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is it the Chairman's view that the ongoing and severe \nflooding problems at Devils Lake should be given serious consideration \nfor EDA assistance under the terms of this agreement?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. That was the position of the Senate, and these severe \nproblems remain eligible for some assistance under this agreement.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We thank you for your help on this extremely urgent \nmatter for North Dakota, and sincerely appreciate your views as \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I also thank the chairman, and sincerely appreciate all \nhis assistance.\n\n\n                     small airport user-fee program\n\n  Mr. COHEN. I am concerned that section 107 of this bill, which lifts \nthe cap on the amount of funds that may be expended on a customs \nservice program for small airports, could lead to abuse of this program \nand unfair competition.\n  Under current law, all large airports, such as Bangor International \nAirport, which are designated ports of entry, must charge passengers \n$6.50 per ticket to pay for the cost of customs inspection and \nprocessing. In 1984, Congress established a program for small airports \nthat could not qualify for port-of-entry status to enable them to \nprovide customs services to international passengers. Passengers \narriving at airports that qualify for this program do not pay the $6.50 \nfee. Instead, a user-fee airport pays a user fee directly to the \nCustoms Service, which goes into an account that pays the salaries of \nthe customs inspector and the cost of customs inspections and other \nservices at the user fee airport. By law, the Secretary of the Treasury \nmay only qualify an airport to participate in this user-fee program \nupon finding that the volume or value of business cleared through such \nairport is insufficient to justify the availability of customs services \nat such airport.\n  Guidelines published by the Customs Service provide that airports \nwith over 15,000 international passengers annually, or which meet other \ncriteria, can qualify for port-of-entry status. By implication, \nairports receiving more than 15,000 passengers annually should not \nqualify for the user-fee program because they have sufficient volume to \njustify full-time customs' services. Unfortunately, there is no \nmechanism under current law for automatic graduation of user-fee \nairports into port-of-entry status. This loophole enables airports \ndesignated by the Secretary as a user-fee airport to service \nsubstantial numbers of international passengers, but circumvent the \n$6.50 per passenger fee that must be paid by passengers arriving at \nport-of-entry airports. Unless the law is changed, airports with user-\nfee status, that nonetheless enter the business of large-scale \ninternational transit, have a built-in competitive advantage over port-\nof-entry airports that must charge each passenger $6.50.\n  I would like to ask the Chairman of the Finance Committee for his \ncomments on this situation.\n  Mr. ROTH. I agree that there appears to be a significant loophole in \nthe current law that should be closed regarding user fee airports. We \nneed to ensure that the advantages of the user-fee program benefit the \nsmall airports it is designed to help and not give an unfair and \nunintended advantage to big airports that remain in the program.\n\n  Therefore, I think we need to find a way to discourage user fee \nairports that have a substantial increase in the number of \ninternational passengers from remaining in the user-fee program and to \nencourage their designation as a port of entry, which is appropriate \nfor larger airports. Otherwise, a user fee airport could receive an \nunfair competitive advantage over port-of-entry airports merely by \navoiding the $6.50 passenger processing fee on airline tickets, as the \nSenator from Maine has pointed out.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for his comments. As the chairman may be aware, this is a \ncritical issue for the State of Maine, as abuse of the user-fee program \nby airports that no longer qualify for that program have the potential \nof causing severe economic harm to Bangor International Airport, one of \nMaine's most important employers. If this abuse of the program is \npermitted to continue, flights that currently refuel and clear Customs \nin Bangor could decide to move their refueling operations to Canada, \nwhere the Government heavily subsidizes fuel costs at competing transit \nairports. Those flights could then continue on to Sanford Airport in \nFlorida, a user-fee airport that has been able to gain an unfair \ncompetitive advantage because it can offer to international charter \nflights the ability to\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\navoid the $6.50-per-passenger fee that must be paid by port-of-entry \nairports such as Bangor. Indeed, there can be little doubt that this \ndiversion of air traffic will occur, as, according to press reports, \nSanford Airport is scheduled to receive 325,000 passengers during the \nremainder of the year, a level far above the 15,000-passenger threshold \nfor user-fee airports. I am very concerned that the expansion of the \nuser-fee program, made possible by the lifting of the funding cap in \nthis appropriations bill, will create an immediate threat to Bangor \nInternational Airport's business and have the unintended effect of \ndiverting to a Canadian airport important international air traffic \nthat currently uses American transit airport facilities.\n  Can the chairman of the Finance Committee provide assurances that \nthis problem will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible and that \nhe will support a legislative remedy to close the loophole that \ncurrently provides user-fee airports engaged in substantial \ninternational business to circumvent the $6.50 per passenger fee?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am sensitive to the imminent problems facing Bangor \nInternational Airport as a result of the loophole in the user-fee \nairport program. I assure you that I will provide whatever help I can \nto ensure that the customs laws provide a level playing field for all \nairports that receive significant numbers of international passengers.\n\n\n                      tongass land management plan\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the language agreed to by the conferees \nand the President directs the Secretary to: first, maintain the land \nbase of the 1992 Tongass Land Management Plan--1.7 million acres--for \ntimber for 1 year; and second, release the enjoined AWRTA sales. The \nPresident may waive either or both of these requirements. If he so \nchooses, he triggers a $110 million appropriation over 4 years--fiscal \nyears 1996-99--for timber worker employment, community development, and \nto replace lost timber sale receipts.\n  I want to extend to my colleague, Senator Stevens, well deserved \ncredit for protecting the people of southeast Alaska and penalizing the \nadministration for not meeting its obligations under the Tongass Timber \nReform Act of 1990 to sustain the timber dependent communities of \nsoutheast Alaska. And I want to thank all of my colleagues, \nparticularly Senator Hatfield and Senator Gorton, for standing by us in \nthe fact of Clinton administration recalcitrance, ignorance about the \nconditions in Alaska, and extreme prejudice about sustainable forest \nmanagement.\n  Like the Sierra Club earlier this week, the Clinton administration \nappears opposed to any forest management on the national forests. I \nsuppose this should not be terribly surprising, given the high number \nof former Sierra Club lobbyists in the Clinton administration. At least \nthe current lobbyists at the Sierra Club had the honesty to publicly \nannounce their total opposition to all timber harvesting.\n  I am going to be equally candid. My bottom-line goal over the next \nyear is going to be to make it as difficult and painful as possible for \nthe administration to complete its draft Tongass Land Management Plan \npreferred alternative and suspend the 1.7 million acre land base \nrequirement that we have just enacted. It would unacceptably reduce the \nproductive forest land base and throw workers out of jobs and families \nin the streets. The draft TLMP contains alternatives that maintain the \n1.7 million acre land base and allowable sales quantity. One of these \nalternatives can and should be selected.\n  Let me make a few additional points so that there is no confusion \nabout what we are doing today and so that all of my colleagues have a \ncomplete context for the current and coming debate. And the debate will \ndefinitely continue.\n  The purpose of today's amendment is to penalize the Clinton \nadministration for failing to meet its multiple use obligations under \nthe Tongass Timber Reform Act of 1990, and to make it as difficult as \npossible for the administration to shirk these obligations in the \nfuture.\n\n  The administration has been--and, under our amendment, will continue \nto be--required to seek to meet market demand for Tongass forest \nproducts and thereby protect southeast Alaska communities under the \nprovisions of the 1990 act.\n  All along, what we have wanted to do was to protect the forest land \nbase so a sustainable industry and associated communities can exist in \nsoutheast Alaska. We can't make the administration--particularly this \nadministration--manage the forest. Our hope is that we can at least \nprotect the landbase, and to the greatest extent possible we have done \nthis.\n  In my oversight of the Forest Service's development of a new Tongass \nLand Management Plan I have been flatly appalled by: first, the lack of \nsound scientific information involved in the effort; second, the poor \ncredibility of the socio-economic impact analysis conducted; third, the \noffering of more multiple-use promises that can't be kept; and fourth, \nthe rush to complete this effort which is, in part, politically driven. \nIndeed, the White House press office's statement today that the \nPresident would use the suspension, without even consulting with the \nForest Service is evidence of crass politicization of the resource \nagency. Last week, we had an 8-hour hearing on this draft plan. Here \nare the transcripts; I would be happy to share them with anyone who \nwants to read them to see how little the Forest Service knows about the \nresources and the people of the Tongass.\n  The TLMP uses voodoo economics to evaluate the effects of weird \nscience employed to justify Greenpeace politics in southeast Alaska.\n  We will proceed with our oversight of the TLMP process to continue to \npress the Forest Service to do a professionally credible job in \ndeveloping a final plan.\n  This is important because nothing requires the Forest Service or the \nPresident to ignore the requirements of common sense and multiple use \nand reduce the forest land base. There are TLMP alternatives which \nwould maintain the land base.\n  The challenge today's amendment lays before Bill Clinton is to manage \na Federal forest resource wisely to protect the environment, provide \njobs, and sustain communities without falling back as a substitute to \nthe old, large Federal grants programs of the past. We sincerely hope \nthe President doesn't rely on a failed policy of large Federal grants \nto shore up a failed policy of forest preservation that has reduced the \nhealth of our forests nationwide.\n  The challenge to Phil Janik, our regional forester, is to get a lot \nbetter data before he selects an approach which costs the taxpayers \n$110 million. But at least the people of southeast Alaska will not be \npenalized if he fails to meet this responsibility.\n  Janik is a $110 million man. His decisions, if not wisely made, will \ntake $110 million from the U.S. Treasury, assuming the administration \ndoes not eliminate his authority to make a decision.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we have just passed in the last hour and a \nhalf the Omnibus Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1996. I think we \nhave dealt a big blow to the era of big government. My view is the \nAmericans--whether Republicans, Democrats or Independents--wanted us to \nmake changes, and we have delivered a true victory for all of America's \ntaxpayers.\n  We have saved $23 billion over last year's level of discretionary \nspending. That is $23 billion less Washington spending, and $30 billion \nless than the President requested. That is a lot more savings than many \npeople predicted. I think we probably could have done more had we had a \nlittle more time. It is the biggest decrease in Washington spending in \nmore than half a century, according to some who have been around.\n  It has been a long and difficult process and has taken a lot of \nbipartisanship in many cases, working with the White House in other \ncases, but it covers five separate appropriations bills, nine Cabinet \nagencies, and appropriates over $160 billion.\n  There has been a lot of back and forth with the White House. A lot of \nnegotiations. A lot of give and take. Both sides had to give a little. \nCertainly nobody got everything they wanted in the final version of \nthis bill.\n  But what the American people got was a spending bill that is $23 \nbillion less than last year and $30 billion less than President \nClinton's request. We did our duty for the taxpayers of America.\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\n  If we maintain our path of savings, we will stay on path to a \nbalanced budget in 2002.\n  We will continue to follow through on our promise for smaller \nGovernment, less Washington spending, and letting America's working \nfamilies keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  There is also good news in other parts of this bill. For instance, \nthe ``stop-fril'' language will help stop frivolous inmate litigation. \nThis much-needed legislation makes it harder for inmates to sue States \nand localities on prison conditions--like the prisoner who sued because \nhe wanted ``Reebok'' brand tennis shoes instead of the ``Converse'' \nbrand shoes provided by the prison.\n  Some 33 States have estimated that frivolous lawsuits cost them more \nthan $55 million annually. We are doing something about that in this \nbill.\n  I also want to say a word about the funding restriction on Vietnam in \nthis legislation. I am disappointed the certification standard was \nchanged from ``fully cooperating'' to ``cooperating in full faith'' in \nthis conference report. This is an issue of great importance to many \nMembers of Congress, including myself. I know some voted against the \nentire bill because of this provision. It is also very important to me. \nThe administration was successful in including this change, but \nCongress will continue to monitor cooperation on POW/MIA issues very \nclosely--regardless of the certification standard.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nHatfield, for his leadership, and also the distinguished ranking \nminority member, Senator Byrd, for his leadership, in putting together \nthis historic legislation, as well as all the other Senators on the \nAppropriations Committee who worked so hard and so successfully on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n\n                         Endangered Species Act\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, first, I would like to acknowledge the \nSenate Appropriations Committee chairman, Senator Hatfield, for his \nefforts on bringing us to the point where we now have the \nappropriations bills resolved. Tough, tough assignment. Senator \nHatfield did it with a great deal of insight and skill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make a few points concerning the \nlanguage that is contained in the appropriations bill. I would like to \nreference the moratorium on the listing of the endangered species. I \nappreciated what the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, stated in \nher comments. I also want to inform Members of the Senate as to the \nprogress toward reform of the Endangered Species Act. The \nappropriations bill before us continues the moratorium language that \nhas been in previous bills before this Congress. I remind all of us \nthat the authorization of the Endangered Species Act expired in 1993. \nYet, the act continues. And it is not working.\n  It also contains a provision that allows the President to waive the \nmoratorium in its entirety. I am concerned that the latter provision \nwill bring a halt to real progress for Endangered Species Act reform.\n  When the Senate adopted the omnibus appropriations bill, which \ncontinued the moratorium, I was already in negotiations on Endangered \nSpecies Act reform with Senators Chafee and Reid. Soon following that, \nSenator Baucus joined us in a very intensive effort in finding a way to \nreform the Endangered Species Act in a true bipartisan fashion. We have \nmade significant progress in these talks.\n  Starting in each case with Senate bill 1364, the Endangered Species \nConservation Act, which I have introduced, and its companion bills, S. \n1365 and S. 1366, we have come to agreement on reform of conservation \nplans; we are near agreement on recovery; and will soon discuss listing \nand consultation. There are a number of other issues, no less \nimportant, that we are already discussing that are on the table as \nwell.\n  As of this week, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service informs me that \nthey have proposed 239 United States and foreign species for which they \nhave not completed final action. I am told the National Marine \nFisheries Service has no proposed rules outstanding at this time.\n  I want to provide you with a summary of the list of proposed species \nthat could be immediately listed upon lifting of the moratorium, which \nthe President may do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this data provided by the Department of \nthe Interior be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              State Lists of Species Proposed for Listing\n\n       The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed 239 species \n     for which they have not completed a final action (U.S. and \n     Foreign as of October, 1995).\n       The National Marine Fisheries Service has no proposed rules \n     outstanding at this time.\n       Most of the 239 FWS species are from California (>120) and \n     Hawaii (79). Twenty-five other states have from 1 to 9 \n     species proposed more than one year ago.\\1\\ They are:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ These lists were made from a Department of Interior list \n     and map. Discrepancies between the list and the map in the \n     number of proposed species in each State are shown.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n

Mr. President, most of the 239 species are from \nCalifornia and Hawaii; 25 other States have from 1 to 9 species \nproposed each. If I may, I would like to just reference this chart and \nshow you a sampling of what we are talking about.\n  In the State of California, you see ready to be listed 123 species. \nIn Hawaii, there are 79. In State of Arizona, 8. Texas, 7 species. \nAlabama, 8. Georgia has 6. Florida has 7. Tennessee has 7 species. \nKentucky has 6 species.\n  I am concerned that the President will decide to waive the \nmoratorium. I am concerned for the people whose lives will be affected \nby an additional 239 species being placed on the list. These people, \nand those species, would fall victim to a law that does not work.\n  If this language passes, I urge the President to not waive the \nmoratorium language. I hope that he will agree with me that it is \nbetter to consider these species for listing under a new reformed bill \nthat we have worked together to create. In 23 years, since the \nEndangered Species Act first became law, we have made significant \nprogress in science that has been identified, and techniques that have \nbeen utilized, and in management practices.\n  I remind the President that if there are species that are in imminent \ndanger of extinction, he can still use the emergency authority to list \nthem. Rather than exercise the waiver, I believe the administration \nwould be wiser to accelerate negotiations with Congress on a \ncomprehensive reform of the Endangered Species Act.\n  Now, should the President choose to waive the moratorium on these 239 \nspecies, there are other considerations. I think under the current law \nwe can expect these newly listed species to be the subject of many \nlawsuits. The $4 million that we have provided to accomplish emergency \nlisting activities, to manage petitions, and deal with existing \nlawsuits would soon be totally exhausted. Waiving the moratorium would \nleave us worse off than before.\n  I met with my negotiating partners this week. We made a commitment to \ncontinue our talks. We have made a commitment that we are going to do \neverything possible to reach a reformed Endangered Species Act that \nwill have bipartisan support. I sincerely hope the possible lifting of \nthe moratorium on listings will not change that commitment. Now I urge \nall of the Members of the Senate to join Senators Chafee, Baucus, Reid, \nand myself, in reforming the Endangered Species Act this year. This is \na task we must accomplish so that endangered and threatened species can \nbe protected for future generations and, also, so that future \ngenerations will have the quality of life that goes with a strong \neconomy. We can and, I believe with all sincerity, we will save species \nwithout putting people and their communities at risk.\n\n\n                            Disaster Relief\n\n  Mr. President, contained in the omnibus bill is disaster relief for a \nnumber of States that have experienced recent disaster. In the State of \nIdaho, in February, 10 of the northern counties were deemed national \ndisasters because of the onslaught of flooding. As of yesterday, Mr. \nPresident, 6 of those 10 counties have, once again, by the Governor of \nIdaho, been declared disasters because the rains, once again, are \nhitting. In a 24-hour period, one river rose 4 feet. So, once again, we \nare right back in it. Therefore, these funds are so critical and the \ntiming of this is absolutely important.\n  While we can rebuild and we can put back into place the \ninfrastructure for these communities, and while people can see their \nhomes restored, I have to point out that one of the other provisions \nthat was lost in this omnibus bill is the fact that we no longer have \nthe timber salvage language in there. They dropped the Senate additions \nmade during the March conference.\n  I can show you in the State of Idaho miles upon miles the acres of \nblackened forest from forest fires. We simply wanted to get in there \nand be able to remove up to 10 percent of the dead trees because there \nis still economic value in those trees. We also wanted to remove them \nbecause they simply become new fodder for future forest fires.\n  That is what that language provided. It also provided jobs to the \npeople that live in those areas that have been so devastated by the \nfloods. Yes, we will rebuild the infrastructure. But I do not know what \nkind of a future is upon us now.\n  That is one of the implications of the passage of this omnibus bill. \nIt concerns me deeply. And, therefore, again I urge all Members of the \nSenate, let us work together to find a solution to this so that we, the \nstewards of this land, can demonstrate our love and appreciation for \nthis environment but also so that a good, strong environment also can \nproduce a good, strong economy. They are not mutually exclusive.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4161-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4178-S4180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about \nDepartment of Defense [DOD] infrastructure costs.\n  DOD is expected to spend $152 billion in fiscal year 1996 on \ninfrastructure. Infrastructure dollars are spent to maintain the bases, \nfacilities, and activities that house and sustain the Armed Forces. \nThey support costs.\n  The General Accounting Office [GAO] has just completed a report on \nDOD infrastructure costs. The report was prepared by one of GAO's best \nanalysts, Mr. Bill Crocker.\n  The GAO's findings are truly amazing. Despite four rounds of base \nclosures since 1988 and dramatic cuts in the force structure, there are \nno savings. DOD infrastructure costs are going up--not down.\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\n  We have had four rounds of base closures--1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. \nThis was the Base Realignment and Closure or BRAC process. And BRAC was \nquite painful for many communities.\n  Well, the driving force behind BRAC was ``to save money by reducing \noverhead.''\n  Mr. President, that was the promise. Streamline Defense \nInfrastructure and save money. That was the deal. The base structure \nexceeded the needs of a shrinking force structure. The whole idea was \nto close excess, obsolete bases and save money.\n  Well, once again savings promised by the Pentagon have evaporated \ninto thin air.\n  Now, I know that base closings require upfront costs. In some cases, \nthese are quite substantial. But the upfront costs are supposed to be \nfollowed by down stream savings. Secretary of Defense Perry made this \nvery point in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee as \nrecently as March 5, 1996.\n  This is what he said, and I quote: ``While BRAC initially costs \nmoney, there will be significant savings in the future.''\n  To back up his assertion, Mr. Perry points to the fiscal year 1999 \nbudget.\n  Again, this is what Mr. Perry said, and I quote: ``In the FY 1999 \nbudget, the Department projects $6 billion in savings from closing the \nbases, thus allowing a $10 billion `swing' in savings.''\n  He went on to say:\n\n       These and future savings from baseclosing will be devoted \n     to modernization.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, what happened to those savings?\n  The GAO can't find them.\n  The GAO audited the fiscal year 1996 to 2001 Future Years Defense \nProgram or FYDP.\n  The Department's own numbers--the numbers in the FYDP--indicate that \ninfrastructure costs will rise in the outyears.\n  Infrastructure costs rise as follows, beginning with fiscal year \n1998: 1998, $147 billion; 1999, $152 billion; 2000, $156 billion; 2001, \n$162 billion.\n  Where are the savings promised by Mr. Perry?\n  Why are not those savings reflected in the department's books?\n  I think the GAO report provides a partial answer to the question.\n  It is true.\n  Base closing did produce some decreases in base support costs.\n  BRAC did produce some real savings.\n  But I underscore ``did,'' which is past tense.\n  Bureaucrats at the Pentagon don't look on savings like the average \nAmerican citizen.\n  To bureaucrats, it is theirs to spend. It's not the peoples' money to \nbe returned to the Treasury.\n  Put a sponge on it, and make it disappear. That is how they see \nsavings.\n  As soon as the savings popped up on the radar screen, they grabbed \nthe money and spent it.\n  Those savings are not being plowed into readiness and modernization--\nas Mr. Perry promised.\n  Those savings are being diverted into new infrastructure projects.\n  Those savings are being used to create more excess overhead.\n  ``Force Management'' is an excellent case in point.\n  Force Management is one of the infrastructure cost categories.\n  More money for force management sounds reasonable enough, but it does \nnot stand up too well under scrutiny.\n  Force management covers such things as military and departmental \nheadquarters and public affairs.\n  To me, more money in force management means fatter headquarters.\n  Fattening up the headquarters doesn't come cheap, either.\n  Spending for expanded headquarters will rise as follows, beginning in \nfiscal year 1998: 1988, $13.6 billion; 1999, $15.2 billion; 2000, $16.1 \nbillion; 2001, $17.2 billion.\n  Now, Mr. President, why is DOD planning to beef up headquarters, when \nDOD continues to make dramatic deceases in the force structure?\n  A much smaller force structure should be much cheaper to manage.\n  Right?\n  And a smaller force should mean much smaller and fewer headquarters.\n  Right?\n  Not at the Pentagon.\n  As the force gets smaller and smaller, the headquarters are getting \nbigger and bigger. Why?\n  It's needed to accommodate a topheavy rank structure.\n  Base closures and realignments mean that some headquarters will have \nto be consolidated with others.\n  We know that.\n  But with continued shrinkage in the force structure, there still \nshould be plenty of excess headquarters space.\n  There is no need to fatten up headquarters operations.\n  That just does not make any sense at all right now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo tables.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      TABLE V-3--FORCE STRUCTURE a --PART V: FORMULATING THE DEFENSE BUDGET                     \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Cold war                                                     \n                                                 fiscal year   Base force  Fiscal year  Fiscal year   BUR-based \n                                                     1990        plan b        1996         1997        plan c  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArmy--active divisions.........................       18           12           10           10           10    \n    Reserve component brigades d...............       57           34           47           42           42    \nMarine expeditionary force e...................        3            3            3            3            3    \nNavy aircraft carriers (active/reserve)........       15/1         12/1         11/1         11/1         11/1  \nCarrier air wings (active/reserve).............       13/2         11/2         10/1         10/1         10/1  \nBattle force ships (active/reserve)............      546          430          359          357          346    \nFighter wing equivalents (active/reserve)......       24/12        15/11        13/8         13/7         13/7  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na Dual entries in the table show data for active/reserve forces, except for carriers, which depicts deployable/ \n  training carriers.                                                                                            \nb Bush Administration's planned fiscal year 1995 force levels, as reflected in the January 1993 Annual Defense  \n  Report.                                                                                                       \nc Shown are planned force levels, which may differ slightly from those recommended by the BUR, but which are    \n  consistent with its proposals.                                                                                \nd An approximate equivalent.

GAYLE CORY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senate family this week lost one of its own, Gayle \nCory, the former postmaster of the Senate, who died of cancer on \nWednesday evening.\n  Gayle's Senate career spanned 35 years. Beginning as a receptionist \nwith Senator Ed Muskie in 1959, Gayle became the executive assistant to \nour former majority leader, George Mitchell, before her appointment to \nthe Senate post office.\n  As an officer of the Senate, Gayle reformed and strengthened the \noperations of the Senate post office, improving service to Members and \nassuring the strong financial controls so essential as a matter of \npublic trust. The Senate lost a dedicated employee of enormous personal \nintegrity when Gayle resigned in January of 1995.\n  It was not her work, however, that defined Gayle. It was her personal \nwarmth and her generous spirit. Gayle gave of herself and her time to \nall who asked--colleagues at work, constituents from Maine, citizens \nfrom around the entire country. All who turned to Gayle Cory knew they \nwere heard and that she would do her best.\n  She was realistic about people's behavior but optimistic about their \npotential. Perhaps that is why she dedicated all of her life to public \nservice. Gayle believed that if people were given the opportunity to \nbehave well, most of them would, so she made it her business to create \nsuch opportunities for everyone who came into contact with her. Perhaps \nthat is why Gayle was so well loved by so many. She brought out the \nbest in everyone.\n  On behalf of the Senate family, I extend my condolences to Don Cory, \nGayle's husband, to her daughters and stepchildren, to her brother, \nBuzz Fitzgerald, and her sister, Carol. Our prayers and our thoughts \nare with them.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, many of us in the Senate are today mourning \nthe loss of a very dear friend, long-time aide to Senators Edmund S. \nMuskie and George J. Mitchell, and former Postmaster of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Gayle Cory died Wednesday night, succumbing to the cancer that caused \nher retirement in January 1995 after a too brief career as Senate \nPostmaster. Her death comes nearly 1 month after the death of her dear \nfriend, former Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie. Gayle was a member \nof Senator Muskie's staff from the very beginning of his Senate career \nin 1959, and she was at his side throughout his years in the Senate. \nShe was one of a very few Senate aides who moved with him to the \nDepartment of State when Senator Muskie was appointed Secretary of \nState in 1980. But their friendship, and Gayle's friendship with Jane \nMuskie and the Muskie children, continued long after Senator Muskie \nleft public life.\n  She returned to the Senate to join the staff of former Senator George \nJ. Mitchell. She served as his top personal assistant until he became \nSenate Majority Leader, when he appointed her Postmaster of the U.S. \nSenate. As Senate Postmaster, Gayle oversaw many improvements in the \npost office security operations. She also instituted many reforms which \neffectively preserved the integrity of the Senate Post Office during \nthe same period of time that the House postal services were engulfed by \nscandal.\n  Gayle Cory was very special to all of us fortunate enough to know her \nand work with her. She did not have acquaintances * * * to meet Gayle \nwas to be her friend, and all of us, regardless of our political \naffiliation, knew we could count on her help and her wise counsel. Few \nof us in this body today understand the workings of the Senate as \nthoroughly as Gayle did, and she used her knowledge and experience to \nwork for the people of Maine. She loved Maine deeply, and the people of \nMaine were always her first priority. She was the first contact for \nmany Mainers coming to Washington, and even those meeting her for the \nfirst time were made to feel welcome, to know they had found a friend. \nIn fact recently, my office was visited by a family from Gayle's \nhometown of Bath, whose sole reason for stopping by was to inquire \nabout Gayle.\n  Gayle worked hard and successfully over the years but she never \nsought personal recognition for her efforts. She was loved and deeply \nrespected by members of my staff, many of whom kept in touch with her \nafter her retirement. We are deeply saddened by her passing. We have \nlost a wonderful friend, but she will live on in our memories and in \nour hearts.\n  I want to extend my deepest sympathies to Gayle's husband, Don, to \ntheir two daughters, Carole and Melissa, and to her brother and sister, \nDuane Fitzgerald and Carole Rouillard of Bath, ME.\n  I extend my sympathies, too, to Gayle's extended family here in the \nSenate--the staffs of former Senators Edmund S. Muskie and George \nMitchell, and the staff of the Senate Post Office. They, too, have lost \na member of their family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4180-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4180-S4184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE SALVAGE LAW AND NATURAL RESOURCES DECISION MAKING\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as part of the negotiations with the \nWhite House on appropriations for the remainder of Fiscal Year 1996, we \nhave agreed to eliminate language designed to make the so-called \nSalvage Rider more workable for the Administration. To my colleagues \nwith whom I worked to fashion this language, let me say that I did not \ndrop it willingly. I dropped it in the face of a direct and specific \nveto threat by the President. I continue to believe it is sound policy \nand makes many desirable changes to the original salvage law.\n  This language would have given the Administration the authority, for \nany reason, to halt for 90 days the green tree sales released under \nSection 2001(k) of the law on which harvesting had not begun by March \n28, 1996. During that 90 day period, the President would have been able \nto negotiate with contract holders to provide replacement timber or a \ncash buy out as a substitute for harvesting the original timber sale. \nCurrent law restricts the President's ability to enter into such \nagreements.\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\n  The proposed language would also have lifted the completion deadline \nimposed by current law so that the owners of these sales would not have \nbeen rushed to harvest their timber before the deadline. By lifting \nthat deadline, I sought to provide a longer time frame for parties to \nnegotiate with the Administration on mutually agreeable ways to avoid \noperating sales that may have adverse environmental consequences.\n  Mr. President, I have always believed that the high road for public \nofficials is in solving legitimate policy problems, not in retaining \nissues for some perceived partisan gain. In negotiating improvements to \nthe current timber salvage law, it is my view that the Administration \ndropped the former approach for the latter. The President determined, \nfor reasons that puzzle me greatly, that he was unable to embrace the \nadditional flexibility that we had offered to him under the salvage \nlaw. I can only assume that the White House has determined that \nretaining the issue as a political cudgel is more valuable during an \nelection year than actually solving the problem.\n  Recall that when the President signed this measure into law, he \nissued a statement praising Congress for making a number of changes \nthat would greatly improve the provision. Soon thereafter, with the \nwrath of the environmental community unleashed upon it, the White House \nchanged its tune. The new, and unflattering, message was that the \nPresident had been duped into signing the Salvage law.\n  As someone intimately involved in much of the process, I can say with \nabsolute confidence that the White House was aware of every letter in \nthis provision. It was negotiated in excruciating detail over a period \nof 6 months.\n  Even though I am convinced the White House was fully aware of what \nwas included in the current salvage law, I appreciate the controversial \nnature of the subject matter and the need to address genuine problems \nwith the law. For this reason, I have attempted in good faith to \naddress the President's legitimate concerns. In fact, I share a number \nof the same concerns. Since December, when the White House first \napproached me for assistance in amending this law, my staff and I have \nmet repeatedly with the President's staff. I have responded to the \nWhite House's concerns by proposing effective solutions that are, \nfrankly, difficult for supporters of the Salvage Law to accept.\n  It now appears to me that the thinking at the White House has again \nchanged since we began our meetings last December. Only the President \nand his advisors know the political calculus behind his decision to \nreject this language. Most of the changes to the current salvage law \nwere suggested by the White House. It would have given the President \nthe unilateral authority to immediately halt the very timber sales he \nhas publicly objected to.\n  By threatening to veto the entire budget agreement over the inclusion \nof this single provision, the President appears to be willing to \ncontinue the budget stalemate and furlough thousands of Federal workers \nin order to play politics with the forests of the Northwest.\n  I hope the President's advisors will keep this language handy. Later \nthis summer, these sales will be rapidly harvested prior to the \ndeadline and within weeks of the November election. I am confident the \nPresident will wish he had the substantial authority the Congress had \noffered to give him and which he had originally requested. He could \nhave stopped the very sales he and the environmental community have \nobjected to so strongly in the press. Let no one be confused about why \nthe President lacks the authority to resolve concerns with these \nsales--the President rejected it.\n\n  It is my belief that the White House rejected this reasonable \nlanguage because of its fear of being at odds with the environmental \ncommunity. The position of the environmental community is total repeal \nand they oppose anything less.\n  I told the President when he was about to announce his forest plan \nfor the Pacific Northwest that his advisors were putting him in a box \nin which he would have no choice but to take the extreme position. \nToday, the President has found himself inside that same box.\n  The historic timber debates in the Northwest have never been about \nowls or old growth. I have argued for many years that the true agenda \nof many in the environmental community is to eliminate timber harvests \non Federal lands--zero cut. Now this view is in the mainstream of the \nenvironmental movement, a movement the President is determined to \nsatisfy.\n  The Sierra Club voted 2-to-1 this week to back a ban on logging of \nany kind on all Federal land. The adoption of this single-minded \npreservation perspective by one of our Nation's largest environmental \norganizations has finally disrobed the underlying agenda of the \nenvironmental community--lock-up of our Nation's forests. We can now \ndebate the merits of entirely eliminating timber harvest on our \nmillions of acres of Federal lands.\n  Today, in Oregon, the zero-cut proposition has been put squarely \nbefore the public in the form of the Enola Hill timber sale.\n  This sale is about 40 miles outside Portland on the way to Mount \nHood. The Forest Service initially prepared this sale in 1987. Since \nthen, it has undergone a long and distinguished legal history. It has \nbeen unsuccessfully challenged in four separate lawsuits. It is now in \nthe midst of its fifth legal action and was the focus of hundreds of \nprotesters last week.\n  With this kind of controversy and divisive legal history, one might \nimagine that the Enola Hill sale involves critical salmon habitat, \nvarious listed endangered species, miles of new forest road \nconstruction or huge clearcutting of 1,000-year-old trees. My \ncolleagues may be surprised to learn that the Enola Hill sale involves \nnone of these controversial things.\n  There are no Endangered Species Act concerns with this sale. There \nare no spotted owls, no marbled murrelets, no endangered salmon runs to \nbe concerned about in the area.\n  The sale is comprised of second growth timber, not old growth.\n  The sale is not a clearcut, but rather a 250 acre selective cut which \nwill remove about one third of the trees. The entry will hardly be \nvisible when the sale is completed.\n  The sale involves no new roads to be built. How can this be? Because \nall logs will be removed by helicopter, a fairly expensive, but much \nmore common practice in timber management in the Northwest today.\n  The sale has the further attribute of addressing a very real forest \nhealth problem. Laminated root rot is killing these trees that are to \nbe harvested. This sale is designed to slow the spread of this disease \nto other forest stands.\n  So why all the controversy? The primary challenge to this sale is \ncultural. A number of individual Native American tribal members have \nargued that the Enola Hill area is sacred. However, no Tribe has \nobjected to the sale going forward, including the largest Tribe in my \nState and the one in closest proximity to the sale area, the Warm \nSprings Tribe.\n  The Courts and the Forest Service have weighed the questions of \ncultural significance of the site and the evidence has been \ninconclusive at best. The Forest Service continues to state its \nwillingness to consider adjusting the sale to accommodate any \nidentified culturally significant areas, but those individual tribal \nmembers who object to the sale refuse to identify any particular areas \nas being any more culturally significant than other areas in the Mount \nHood National Forest. I have chosen to highlight this sale only because \nthe environmental community has chosen to highlight it. It is the \nflagship sale for the Northwest environmentalists as they protest \n``lawless logging.''\n\n  I have a difficult time locating any environmental issue on the Enola \nHill sale that would not be present in any timber sale. We have now \nreached the bottom line debate: Is cutting down trees in our national \nforests to satisfy the public's increasing demand for wood products \ninherently unsound from an environmental perspective?\n  In this debate, the environmental community's true agenda comes \nthrough loud and clear: zero cut, lock up. This position is socially \nand environmentally irresponsible and I reject it in the strongest \npossible terms.\n  As I have said before, I do not enjoy seeing trees being cut down. I \nam a former tree farmer. I plant trees. Like many others, however, I \nenjoy having a\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\nroof over my head. I enjoy having furniture to sit on, and I imagine my \ncolleagues enjoy these beautiful wooden desks and the wood paneling \nhere in the Senate Chamber. The demand for wood products to fulfill our \nNation's housing and other wood fibre demands is growing, Mr. \nPresident, not shrinking. Fortunately, our primary resources for \nmeeting these demands, wood products, are renewable and are grown from \nfree solar energy.\n  Moreover, arguably the greatest tree growing region in the world is \nthe Pacific Northwest. It troubles me greatly that timber harvesting in \nthis very region has been drastically reduced and is now well below \nscientifically sustainable levels.\n  With demand continuing to rise, America is now forced to look \nelsewhere to satisfy its needs. I have called this practice \nEnvironmental Imperialism--lock up our own forests but go to the Third \nWorld and other countries to satisfy American demand. Unfortunately, \nmost, if not all, of these countries do not have comprehensive forest \npractices statutes in place like we do here. Their harvesting is most \noften based on satisfying economic needs without consideration for \necological concerns.\n  I have seen the detrimental effects of this U.S.-centered policy with \nmy own eyes. I traveled to Russia last summer, and I learned of an \ninteresting comparison--the timber lands of Siberia are 15 times less \nproductive than the timber lands in western Oregon. In other words, it \ntakes 1.5 million acres of Siberian timber land to grow the same amount \nof timber we can grow on 100,000 acres in the Northwest. I have also \nrecently visited the rain forests of South America and seen the impacts \nthat the exporting of our domestic problems has caused in that area.\n  These experiences have helped me put the global nature of our timber \npolicies in perspective. When we reduce timber production from the \ngreat timber growing lands of the Pacific Northwest, there is an \nundeniable global impact.\n  I believe that the administration wants to be sensitive to the global \neffects of our environmental policies in this country. I want to \ncommend Secretary of State Christopher for his commitment to looking at \nenvironmental issues on a global basis. However, along with this view \nmust come the recognition that not only do the practices of other \nnations impact us here in the United States, but that our domestic \npractices and policies also have a great impact on other nations.\n  Mr. President, I have always believed that we have a responsibility \nto conserve our natural resources. I have authored nearly 1.5 million \nacres of wilderness legislation in Oregon and added 44 river segments \nto the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. At the same time, I \nbelieve that we have a moral obligation to satisfy the demand of \nAmericans with the wise use of American resources, not by going abroad \nto rape the resources of other countries.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, with its latest action to oppose giving \nitself flexibility on the Salvage Rider, the White House has chosen \npolitical convenience over the best interests of the environment both \nin the Pacific Northwest and throughout the world. The provisions \nstricken from the Omnibus Appropriations package would have given the \nPresident significant authority to resolve problems with sales released \nunder the current Salvage Law. I hope that in the future our \nnegotiations will hinge on the resolution of legitimate policy issues, \nrather than clinging to a political issue for perceived partisan \nadvantage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the rejected language, \nand a letter related to the issues I have raised here be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Salvage Flexibility Language--Dropped\n\n       Sec. 325. Section 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19 is amended \n     by striking ``in fiscal years 1995 and 1996'' in paragraph \n     (1), and by striking paragraph (3) and inserting in lieu \n     thereof:\n       ``(3) Timing and Conditions of Alternative Volume.--For any \n     sale subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the \n     Secretary concerned shall, and for any other sale subject to \n     this subsection, the Secretary concerned may, within 7 days \n     of enactment of this paragraph notify the affected purchaser \n     of his desire to provide alternative volume, and within 90 \n     days of the date of enactment of this paragraph, reach \n     agreement with the purchaser to identify and provide, by a \n     date agreed by the purchaser, a volume, value and kind of \n     timber satisfactory to the purchaser to substitute for all or \n     a portion of the timber subject to the sale, which shall be \n     subject to the original terms of the contract except as \n     otherwise agreed, and shall be subject to paragraph (1). Upon \n     notification by the Secretary, the affected purchaser shall \n     suspend harvesting and related operations for 90 days, except \n     for sale units where harvesting and related activities have \n     commenced before March 28, 1996. Except for sale units \n     subject to paragraph (2), the purchaser may operate the \n     original sale under the terms of paragraph (1) if no \n     agreement is reached within 90 days, or after the agreed date \n     for providing alternative timber until the Secretary \n     concerned designates and releases to the purchaser the \n     alternative timber volume in the agreement. The purchaser may \n     not harvest a volume of timber from the alternative sale and \n     from the portion of the original sale to be replaced which \n     has greater contract value than the contract value of the \n     alternative sale agreement. Any sale subject to this \n     subsection shall be awarded, released and completed pursuant \n     to paragraph (1) for a period equal to the length of the \n     original contract, and shall not count against current \n     allowable sale quantities or timber sales to be offered under \n     subsections (b) and (d). A purchaser may enforce the rights \n     established in this paragraph to obtain substitute timber \n     within the required or agreed upon time frame in federal \n     district court.\n       ``(4) Buy-Out Authorization.--The Secretary concerned is \n     authorized to permit a requesting purchaser of any sale \n     subject to this subsection to return to the Government all or \n     a specific volume of timber under the sale contract, and \n     shall pay to such purchaser upon tender of such volume a buy-\n     out payment for such volume from any funds available to the \n     Secretary concerned except from any permanent appropriation \n     of trust fund, subject to the approval of the House and \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations. Such volume and such \n     payment shall be mutually agreed by the Secretary and the \n     purchaser. Any agreement between the purchaser and the \n     Secretary shall be reached within 90 days from the date on \n     which the negotiation was initiated by the purchaser. The \n     total sum paid for all such buy-out payments shall not exceed \n     $20,000,000 by each Secretary and $40,000,000 in total. No \n     less than half of the funds used by the Secretary concerned \n     must come from funds otherwise available to fund Oregon and \n     Washington programs of the Forest Service and the Bureau of \n     Land Management. The Secretary is authorized to offset any \n     portion of a buy-out payment agreed under the provisions of \n     this paragraph with an amount necessary to retire fully a \n     purchaser's obligation on a government guaranteed loan.''\n       Section 325. Deletes language regarding the redefinition of \n     the marbled murrelet nesting area and inserts a new provision \n     that amends subsection 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19 to \n     provide alternative timber options or buy-out payments to \n     timber purchasers for both Forest Service and Bureau of Land \n     Management sales offered or sold originally in units of the \n     National Forest System or districts of the Bureau of Land \n     Management subject to section 318 of Public Law 101-121. The \n     new language neither expands nor reduces the sales to be \n     released under subsection 2001(k). The managers do not intend \n     to interdict or affect prior or pending judicial decisions \n     with this language.\n       The provision increases the Administration's flexibility by \n     allowing the Secretary concerned to notify a purchaser within \n     7 days, and agree with a purchaser within 90 days of the date \n     of enactment, to provide alternative volume for part or all \n     of any sale subject to subsection 2001(k) in a volume, value, \n     and kind satisfactory to the purchaser, by a date agreed by \n     the purchaser. The precise designation of alternative timber \n     need not occur within the initial 90-day period. Upon \n     notification by the Secretary, the purchaser shall suspend \n     harvesting and related operations for 90 days, except for \n     sale units where harvesting and related activities have \n     commenced before March 28, 1996. For any sale that cannot be \n     released due to threatened or endangered bird nesting within \n     the sale unit, the amendment requires the agreement for \n     alternative volume, in quantity, value, and kind satisfactory \n     to the purchaser, and by a date agreed by the purchaser, to \n     be reached within 90 days of the date of enactment of this \n     section.\n       The Administration has delayed implementing subsection \n     2001(k) well beyond the original 45-day time limit set by \n     Congress, and still has not released all the sales required \n     under the statute. Therefore, except for sale units affected \n     by paragraph (2) of subsection 2001(k), the purchaser may \n     operate the original sale under subsection 2001(k) if: 1) the \n     Secretary has not designated and released timber by the date \n     agreed or 2) if no agreement has been reached 90 days after \n     notification. Also, a purchaser may enforce the rights \n     established in this paragraph to obtain substitute timber \n     within the required or agreed time frame in Federal district \n     court. The managers continue to endorse the statement of the \n     managers language accompanying the conference report on the \n     1995 Rescissions Act (House Report 104-124; Public Law 104-\n     19) relating to section 2001(k).\n       A purchaser may not be compelled to accept alternative \n     volume over the purchaser's\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\n     objection, as he cannot be under present law. The purchaser \n     may not operate on both the portion of the original sale to \n     be replaced, and the alternative timber such that the \n     combined contract value harvested exceeds the contract value \n     of the alternative timber in the agreement. Sales with \n     alternative volume under the amendment are subject to the \n     original terms of the contract unless the parties agree \n     otherwise and are subject to paragraph (1) of subsection (k). \n     Any alternative volume under paragraph (3) shall not count \n     against current allowable sales quantities or timber sales to \n     be offered under subsections (b) and (d) of section 2001 of \n     Public Law 104-19. Alternative volume may, at the Secretary's \n     discretion, come from areas not otherwise contemplated for \n     harvesting.\n       To avoid forcing purchasers to operate sales hastily before \n     environmental considerations can be taken into account, the \n     limitation in paragraph (1) to fiscal years 1995 and 1996 is \n     deleted, and all sales awarded or released under subsection \n     2001(k) are now subject to the legal protections in paragraph \n     (1) for a period equal to the length of the original contract \n     (including any term adjustment or extensions permitted under \n     the original contract or agreed by the Secretary and the \n     purchaser). The period of legal protection for each sale \n     begins when the sale is awarded or released under subsection \n     2001(k), or when alternative volume is provided under this \n     statute.\n       The provision also gives the Secretary of the Interior and \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, upon request of a sale owner, \n     the authority to purchase all or a specific volume of timber \n     under the sale contract covered under this subsection. \n     Payment may be made directly to the purchaser, or to agents \n     or creditors to retire fully the purchaser's obligation on a \n     government guaranteed loan. The volume and payment must be \n     mutually agreed by the Secretary and the purchaser. The \n     payments would come from any funds available to the Secretary \n     concerned, except for any permanent appropriation or trust \n     funds, such as the timber salvage sale funds and the Knudsen-\n     Vandenburg fund. In order to relieve partially the burden on \n     programs in the rest of the nation, no less than half of the \n     funds used for the payments must come from accounts which \n     otherwise would be available to the Secretaries for Oregon \n     and Washington programs of the Forest Service and the Bureau \n     of Land Management. The Secretaries shall follow established \n     reprogramming procedures when seeking the approval of the \n     House and Senate appropriations committees to designate funds \n     for the buy-out payments. Each Secretary may use up to $20 \n     million for such payments. Any agreement between a purchaser \n     and the Secretary concerned shall be reached within 90 days \n     of the date on which a negotiation was initiated by the \n     purchaser.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         The Confederated Tribes of the Warm Spring Reservation of \n           Oregon, Natural Resource Department,\n                                   Warm Spring, OR, April 3, 1996.\n     Kathleen McGinty,\n     Chair, Council on Environmental Quality, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chair McGinty: The April 10, 1996 correspondence to \n     President Clinton from Richard Moe, president of the National \n     Trust for Historic Preservation, regarding Enola Hill and its \n     potential eligibility to the National Register of Historic \n     Places and related issues is extremely dismaying. During the \n     past 10 years the Mount Hood National Forest administrators \n     and technical staff have consulted at both the government to \n     government and technical levels regarding resource issues at \n     Enola Hill.\n       The destruction issue raised by the opponents of the Enola \n     Hill timber sale is debatable. It is our understanding \n     through direct coordination and consultation with the Mount \n     Hood National Forest staff and administrators that the sale \n     is being implemented to insure the forest health on Enola \n     Hill. The existing timber stand is approximately 80 to 100 \n     years old and represents a monoculture of Douglas fir which \n     is being affected by laminated root rot. This affliction is \n     endemic, yet can be controlled through stand manipulation. \n     The proposed treatments through harvest and introduction of \n     fire and pathogen control will mimic the natural stand \n     regimes present in the region prior to Euro-American \n     settlement. The timber sale will thus add to the quality of \n     the natural and cultural landscape.\n       The planning process for the Enola Hill timber sale has to \n     our satisfaction attempted to document the tangible and \n     intangible values associated with the area. It is also our \n     understanding that the C6.24 clause of the award contract is \n     to insure that upon discovery of any properties potentially \n     eligible to the National Register of Historic Places all work \n     will cease and mitigation measures developed in conjunction \n     with professional staff and in consultation and coordination \n     with the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs and public.\n       Ongoing claims and concerns regarding Native American \n     traditional use and cultural resources at the Enola Hill area \n     has created an air of controversy within the Native American \n     community, the Forest Service, non-native people and the \n     judicial system. Our tribal government adopted the ``Warm \n     Springs Tribal Council Position Paper Regarding Enola Hill'' \n     through Resolution 8607 on January 19, 1993 in the interest \n     of the Tribe and its members. This position paper firmly \n     expresses that the Warm Springs elders and religious leaders \n     are the only Indian people with the sovereign authority to \n     speak about the cultural significance of Enola Hill as well \n     as the entire area surrounding Mount Hood. The proposed \n     timber sale opposition to Enola Hill are voices of those \n     individuals not from our tribes who claim the right to speak \n     as Indian people about cultural significance, traditional \n     uses and sacred sites.\n       We are currently unaware of any tribal government request \n     to consider Enola Hill as a ``traditional cultural property'' \n     eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic \n     Places. A true traditional Indian interpretation of cultural \n     significance of any part of Mount Hood whether within the \n     ceded or traditional lands is based on a special relationship \n     of Warm Springs tribal members and their ancestors since time \n     immemorial with Wy'east or Mount Hood. Consent for use has \n     and is still based on ancestral courtesy and custom with \n     regard to exercising aboriginal and treaty rights within the \n     ceded or traditional use lands.\n       In addition it is the Tribal Council position that ``the \n     Federal Government, the State of Oregon, the Federal Court, \n     and the non-Indian public, look to our people for the answers \n     to their questions about what Mount Hood, including Enola \n     Hill, means to the traditional people of this area. We are \n     those people and we should be the only ones to answer those \n     questions.''\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Charles R.

The entire area \n     surrounding Mount Hood, including the headwaters of the \n     Sandy, Zig Zag, and Salmon Rivers where Enola Hill is \n     located, is very familiar to our people. The seven bands and \n     tribes of Wasco and Sahaptin-speaking Indians who signed the \n     Treaty with the Tribes of Middle Oregon of June 25, 1855, all \n     lived within close proximity to Mount Hood. The mountain \n     itself, the trees and berries and plants that grow on its \n     slopes, the deer and elk and other wildlife that call the \n     mountain home, and the rivers, springs and other waters that \n     originate on Mount Hood, and the fish and other creatures \n     that live in these waters, all occupy a special place in the \n     cultural, spiritual and historical life of our people.\n       There is no federally recognized Indian tribal government \n     in existence today with closer ties to Mount Hood than the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of \n     Oregon. In pre-treaty times, Mount Hood rose high into the \n     sky above our traditional homes along the Columbia River and \n     its Oregon tributaries. Today, the mountain is located mostly \n     within our treaty-reserved ceded area and just outside of the \n     Northwest boundary of our present reservation. In short, we \n     regard Mount Hood as our mountain.\n       Based on our special relationship with Mount Hood, which \n     has existed since time immemorial, we believe that no other \n     tribe, band or group of Indian people has a right greater \n     than or equal to the natural sovereign right of the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon \n     to speak about the importance of Mount Hood\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\n     from an Indian point of view. Our historic, cultural and \n     spiritual attachment to Mount Hood has caused us to be \n     involved in many public policy, administrative and legal \n     proceedings involving use and development of the mountain. \n     Currently, we are party to several legal proceedings \n     involving land management decisions of the Mount Hood \n     National Forest. We are concerned about these decisions \n     because of the potential impacts of these developments on our \n     treaty fishing rights, and other legally protected interests. \n     We are, for example, the only tribes involved in the Mount \n     Hood Meadows Ski Area expansion proceedings. We believe that \n     Mount Hood National Forest should consult only with our tribe \n     on issues relating to proposed developments on public lands \n     in the vicinity of Mount Hood.\n       With regard to the area called ``Enola Hill,'' our people \n     are familiar with this place. Many of our elders camped with \n     their families in this area, fished for salmon and picked \n     huckleberries in the general vicinity of Enola Hill. Whether \n     there is special cultural significance to Enola Hill as a \n     whole, and whether there are special religious and spiritual \n     places there, is not something we wish to speak about in a \n     position paper or put down in writing. In the past, our \n     tribal elders have provided such information to appropriate \n     officials once they have been assured of confidentiality and \n     convinced of the serious need for the information. However, \n     we are concerned that culturally sensitive information our \n     elders have disclosed concerning Enola Hill could be \n     exploited and used for improper purposes. Unwarranted public \n     access to such information through the courts or the media \n     only makes our job of protecting our people's sacred sites \n     more difficult. We hope that the cure does not become worse \n     than the affliction.\n       We believe very strongly that only Warm Springs tribal \n     elders and religious leaders should be questioned on this \n     issue. Certain individuals who are not from our tribe, and \n     indeed some of them are not even Indian, have spoken out \n     frequently and loudly about what they believe is the \n     desecration of sacred Indian religious places at Enola Hill. \n     Mount Hood, including Enola Hill, is not theirs--it is ours. \n     It is not for them to talk about the traditional Indian \n     cultural and religious significance of any part of Mount \n     Hood. It is the mountain of our people and we believe that we \n     should be the only ones asked to give the true traditional \n     Indian interpretation of the significance of any part of the \n     Mount Hood region. For this reason, we oppose the voices of \n     those individuals about the importance of Enola Hill. \n     Furthermore, we ask that the Federal Government, the State of \n     Oregon, the Federal Court, and the non-Indian public, look to \n     our people for the answers to their questions about what \n     Mount Hood, including Enola Hill, means to the traditional \n     Indian people of this area. We are those people, and we \n     should be the only ones to answer those questions.\n       Dated: January 20, 1993.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4180-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL ORGAN DONOR AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week is National Organ Donor \nAwareness Week. It is a privilege to be part of this important effort \nto increase public awareness about the need for donors. Organ donation \nliterally saves lives. It truly is the gift of life.\n  As Carl Lewis, the Olympic Gold medalist, told the Labor and Human \nResources Committee in his testimony this week, ``One thing about organ \nand tissue donation: it is the absolute definition of altruism--giving \nsolely for the sake of giving . . . It is an opportunity that is almost \nimpossible to find anywhere else you might look. It is the opportunity \nto actually save the life of another human being.''\n  Eleven years ago, a Massachusetts constituent, Charles Fiske, came to \nCongress and testified eloquently about the financial and emotional \nordeal of his family's search for a liver transplant for their 9-month-\nold daughter. Out of that testimony came a long-overdue national effort \nto increase the number of organ donors, enhance the quality of organ \ntransplantation, and allocate the available organs in a fair manner. In \n1984, President Ronald Reagan signed the National Organ Transplant Act \ninto law. Its primary goal was to assure patients and their families a \nfair opportunity to receive a transplant, regardless of where they \nlive, who they know, or how much they could afford to pay. We have not \nyet achieved these goals, but we are closer to them today.\n  Additional legislation is now pending. The Organ and Bone Marrow \nTransplant Program Reauthorization Act was recently approved \nunanimously by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, and is \nnow awaiting action by the full Senate. That measure will improve the \ncurrent organ procurement and allocation systems by earmarking funds \nfor public education, training health professionals and others in \nappropriate ways to request donations, improving information for \npatient, and increasing the role of transplant recipients and family \nmembers in these efforts.\n  Legislation will help, but the shortage of organs for transplantation \ncannot be solved by legislation alone. Our goals can be achieved only \nthrough broad participation by people across the country.\n  Every day, eight Americans die who could have lived if they had \nreceived a transplant in time. Last year, 3,500 patients died because \nno donor was available, including 173 from Massachusetts. As technology \nfor transplants continues to improve, the gap between demand and supply \nwill continue to widen. The number of persons needing transplants has \ndoubled since 1990. A new name is added to the list every 18 minutes.\n  Currently, 45,000 Americans are in need of an organ transplant, \nincluding 1,400 children. By the end of this year, the total is \nexpected to exceed 50,000. Despite the need, fewer than 20,000 \ntransplant operations will be performed in 1996--because of the \nshortage of donors.\n  In part, we are not obtaining enough donors because of the myths \nsurrounding organ donation. Many citizens don't know that it is illegal \nin this country to buy and sell organs. There is no age limit for \ndonors. Donations are consistent with the beliefs of all major \nreligions.\n  Except in rare cases such as kidney transplants among close \nrelations, virtually all donations actually take place after death, in \naccord with the wishes of the donors and their families. The removal of \nthe organs does not interfere with customary burial arrangements or an \nopen casket at the funeral, since the organ is obtained through a \nnormal surgical procedure where the donor s body is treated with \nrespect.\n  The decision to become a donor will not affect the level of the \ndonor's medical care, or interfere in any way with all possible efforts \nto save patients where the patients are near death. We need to do all \nwe can to dispel the myths that contradict these facts.\n  Most important, as members of Congress, we can lead by example, by \nsigning our own organ donor card. I have done so and I have discussed \norgan donation with my family, so that they know my wishes. Senator \nFrist and Senator Simon have urged all of us in the Senate to sign \norgan donor cards, and over 50 Senators have now done so.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to become organ donors. We must do \nmore, and we can do more, to save the lives of those who need \ntransplants. Each of us can save several lives by agreeing that we \nourselves will be donors. And we can save many more lives as other \nAmericans learn from our examples and become donors themselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4184-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4184-S4185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    JUNK GUN VIOLENCE PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, along with my colleague from New Jersey, \nSenator Bradley and my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, I \nhave introduced legislation to ban the production and sale of junk \nguns--or as they are sometimes called, Saturday night specials. My bill \nwould take the standards for safety and reliability that are currently \napplied to imported handguns, and apply them to domestically produced \nfirearms. It is a simple common sense proposal that deserves the \nsupport of all Senators.\n  I had a meeting with a very special physician today and I want to \nshare with my colleagues some of the things that I learned. Dr. Andrew \nMcGuire is Director of the Trauma Foundation, a nonprofit organization \nbased out of San Francisco General Hospital. The Trauma Foundation has \na simple goal: keep people out of the emergency room.\n  Several years ago, Dr. McGuire was asked to write a policy paper \naimed at developing strategies to curtail violence in the San Francisco \narea. He concluded that something had to be done to curtail the \nproliferation of handguns. Specifically, he advised banning these \ncheap, poorly constructed junk guns.\n  Since then, Dr. McGuire has been on a crusade to educate the country \nabout\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\nthe danger of junk guns. He has developed a national network of trauma \nsurgeons to spread the word about gun violence. On this issue, we \nshould listen to our doctors. They are the ones who see the destruction \ncaused by these weapons first hand.\n  Some of the statistics Dr. McGuire shared with me were truly \nfrightening. Since 1930--when statistics were first recorded--more than \n1.3 million American have died of gunshots. That is more Americans than \ndied in all of our wars since the Civil War.\n  Two weeks ago, the Children's Defense Fund released a study showing \nthat nationwide gunshots were the second leading cause of death among \nchildren. In California, gunshots are No. 1.\n  Let me say that again. Among California children ages 0 to 19, \ngunshots are the single leading cause of death. More die of gunshots \nthan automobile accidents or any disease. That is a crisis that I, as a \nSenator from California, cannot overlook.\n  We must do something to stop this epidemic of violence. Passing the \nJunk Gun Violence Protection Act, would be an excellent step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4184-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A PRESCIENT MOMENT 25 YEARS PAST\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, one of the great benefits that accrues to \nthose of us who have served in the U.S. Senate over a period of time--\nmeasured not in years but in decades--is that of perspective. Serving \nhere since my election in 1960 has provided me with a gift of hindsight \nthat only time and experience can produce.\n  It was 25 years ago this week that I participated in a historic \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. We scheduled that hearing \nto provide leaders of the anti-war movement with a legitimate forum to \nfocus their collective anger and voice their passionate resistance to a \nheart-rending war that was dividing this country.\n  I remember this hearing clearly. It was held during the historic \nencampment of Vietnam veterans in our Capital City and the committee \ninvited the veterans to testify. It was from the witness table in our \nhearing room, in what was then the New Senate Office Building, that the \nveterans sounded their call for an end to the war.\n  What stands out most in my mind, however, was the testimony, the \neloquence and the authority of a tall, lanky young man who testified on \nbehalf of his friends and peers. A decorated hero, he was speaking for \nthose who were paying the ultimate price for a disastrous foreign \npolicy.\n  The large hearing room was crowded and the tension was electric. As I \nsat behind the raised dais, with Senators William Fulbright, our \nchairman; Stuart Symington, George Aiken, Clifford Case, and Jacob \nJavits, I remember looking at the drama before us and saying that the \nyoung man who was testifying should be on my side of the dais.\n  He had just returned from the war and had been decorated for heroism, \nhaving been injured in combat (three Purple Hearts) and saved the lives \nof his Swift Boat crewmen (a Silver Star and two Bronze Stars). As an \nearly and outspoken opponent of the war myself, I knew him and had \nworked to win support for him and his fellow anti-war veterans.\n  After his testimony, when it became my turn to address him, I \nwelcomed him with these words: ``As the witness knows, I have a very \nhigh personal regard for him and hope before his life ends he will be a \ncolleague of ours in this body''. That young man was John Kerry.\n  Mr. President, since that historic time, one which truly marked a \nmilestone in the shift of public opinion, I have come to know John much \nbetter. I am happy to find that history has proven me right--both in my \nopposition to the war in Vietnam and in my glimpse of a young man's \nfuture.\n  When John Kerry, as the Junior Senator from Massachusetts, joined us \non the Foreign Relations Committee, I could not have been more \ndelighted with my prescience.\n  During my service Chairman of the Committee, I asked him to handle \nthe State Department authorization bill--one of the major annual bills \nthat come before the committee--because I knew he had the knowledge, \nthe mastery of the legislative process and the negotiating skills to do \nthe job.\n  I was right. Senator Kerry has skillfully managed that bill several \ntimes now. And in the past year he negotiated with the Chairman Jesse \nHelms, over an intensely difficult question, and acquitted himself \nsuperbly.\n  Perhaps his greatest contribution, however, has been his chairmanship \nof the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. Thanks to John \nKerry's doggedness and leadership, we are finally on the path to \nhealing the wounds and closing the last chapter on a painful time in \nAmerican history--that of the Vietnam war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4185-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4185-S4187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ADDRESS BY SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AT THE DOW JONES AND COMPANY DINNER\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into \nthe Record the remarks delivered by the distinguished Senator from \nArizona [Mr. McCain] to Dow Jones and Company on April 23, 1996.\n  In his remarks, Senator McCain addresses a very important issue: what \nare the obligations of a candidate for the presidency in how he \ncriticizes his opponent--a sitting President--when the President is \nabroad representing the United States? As he points out, the Clinton \nadministration is insisting on a double standard. During the 1992 \ncampaign, when then-Governor Bill Clinton was challenging President \nBush, candidate Clinton had no hesitation in taking President Bush to \ntask even on foreign policy and national security topics while \nPresident Bush was outside of the United States meeting with world \nleaders. On the other hand, now, in 1996, when Bill Clinton is the \nincumbent, he is criticizing his challenger, the Republican leader, for \nhis recent comments on the Clinton domestic record--specifically on the \nissue of Federal judges. As Senator McCain details the matter, there is \nsimply no precedent for the White House's distorted and self-serving \nassertions. I hope all of my colleagues will take a look at these \nremarks, as well as members of the media who are interested in setting \nthe record straight.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Address by Senator John McCain\n\n       Thank you. I welcome this opportunity to have as a captive \n     audience people whose attention I spend a fair amount of time \n     trying to get. Al Hunt told me that I could speak on any \n     subject I wished to, and never one to waste such \n     opportunities, I want to spend some time this evening \n     analyzing in detail the pathology of karnal bunt, the fungal \n     disease afflicting wheat crops in Arizona. . . . Or perhaps I \n     should save that analysis for a speech to the New York Times.\n       I will instead ask your indulgence while I talk a little \n     bit about the press and the presidential race. As I will \n     include a few constructive criticisms in my remarks, I want \n     to assure everyone here that I exempt you all from any of the \n     criticisms that follow. Each and everyone of you has my \n     lasting love and respect.\n       I would like to begin by quoting a presidential candidate.\n       ``What's the President going to Japan for? He's going to \n     see the landlord.''\n       Here's another quote:\n       ``[The President] has slowed progress toward a healthier \n     and more prosperous planet. . . . He has abdicated national \n     and international leadership on the environment at the very \n     moment the world was most amenable to following the lead of a \n     decisive United States.''\n       And one more:\n       ``[The President should not give trade preferences] to \n     China while they are locking their people up.''\n       Now, let me offer a quote of more recent vintage by that \n     same individual.\n       ``I like the old-fashioned position that used to prevail \n     that people didn't attack the president when he was on a \n     foreign mission for the good of the country. It has been \n     abandoned with regularity in the last three and a half years. \n     But I don't think that makes it any worse a rule.''\n       President Clinton is, of course, the author of all four \n     quotations. The first three--those he made as a candidate for \n     President--were delivered while former President Bush was on \n     foreign missions ``for the good of the country,'' in Japan \n     and Brazil.\n       The last quote was taken from the President's Moscow press \n     conference last Saturday when he responded to Senator Dole's \n     criticism of his judicial appointments. As you can see, he \n     used the occasion to denounce a practice he regularly \n     employed as a candidate.\n       What made this particular example of presidential hypocrisy \n     so galling, was that Senator Dole has scrupulously avoided \n     criticizing the President's foreign policy while the\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\n     President was overseas. I know that for a fact because I have \n     been involved in Dole campaign decisions about when and when \n     not to draw comparisons between the President's foreign \n     policies and prospective Dole Administration foreign \n     policies. It was Senator Dole himself who insisted that the \n     campaign make no criticisms of the President's foreign \n     policies while the President was abroad. In fact, Senator \n     Dole specifically declined the opportunity to criticize the \n     President's China policy on Face the Nation Sunday, showing \n     extraordinary restraint given that policy's abundant defects.\n       What President Clinton suggested in his Moscow press \n     conference was that he should be immune from criticism of his \n     domestic policies while abroad. The President's protestation \n     notwithstanding, that has never been a political custom in \n     the United States. Were it to be, I suspect the President \n     would open his reelection headquarters and establish \n     temporary residence in a foreign capital where he could \n     blissfully ignore the scrutiny that comes with campaigning \n     for the presidency.\n       Indeed, I limited the examples of candidate Clinton's \n     criticisms of President Bush only to those which referred to \n     President Bush's foreign policies; criticisms which did \n     violate--egregiously so--a venerable and worthy American \n     political custom. In fact, in researching those quotes we \n     discovered pages and pages of domestic policy criticism which \n     candidate Clinton leveled at President Bush's while the \n     President was traveling overseas. But as those did not \n     violate the custom in question, only the new custom which \n     President Clinton invented in Moscow, I left them out of my \n     remarks.\n       When it comes to campaigning, President Clinton always \n     shows surprising audacity. He quite cheerfully discards one \n     identity for its opposite, and often appropriates with \n     astonishing ease the arguments of his critics, always laying \n     claim to first authorship. As a Dole supporter, I have an \n     obligation to point out such incidents of presidential \n     hypocrisy. But so, I submit, does the press.\n       Almost every news account of Senator Dole's speech on the \n     President's judicial nominees observed that Senator Dole had \n     voted for most of those nominees. But nary a report of \n     President Clinton's virtuous appeal for a respite from \n     partisanship examined the legitimacy of the custom he \n     professed to uphold, or included a reference to the \n     President's own violations of that custom.\n       The President is a formidable candidate. He'll be hard to \n     beat even in a fair contest. He'll be impossible to beat if \n     Senator Dole must adhere to standards which the President is \n     free to ignore. After all, it should hardly come as a \n     surprise to any journalist that the President has, on \n     occasion, shown a tendency toward a little self-righteous \n     posturing when he has little cause to do so. Indeed, I have \n     often observed that the more accurate the arguments against \n     him, the more self-righteous the President becomes.\n       Of all the people to accuse of excessive partisanship in \n     foreign policy debates, Bob Dole is the least deserving of \n     such criticism. I would refer the President to the debate \n     over his decision to deploy 20,000 American troops to Bosnia. \n     Without Bob Dole's leadership the President would not have \n     received any expression of Congressional support for the \n     deployment. Bob did not even agree with the decision to \n     deploy. But he worked to support that deployment even while \n     his primary opponents were gaining considerable political \n     advantage by opposing his support for the President.\n       Senator Dole gave his support because he had as much \n     concern for the President's credibility abroad as the \n     President had. I would even contend that on many occasions \n     Bob Dole has shown greater concern for presidential \n     credibility than has the President. Which brings me to my \n     next point.\n       I have lately noticed that in comparisons of the foreign \n     policy views of President Clinton and Senator Dole, some in \n     the media--more often broadcast media than print--have \n     resorted to facile, formulaic analysis as a substitute for \n     insightful political commentary. Some reporters have \n     increasingly asserted that there isn't much difference \n     between the candidates' foreign policy views, only, perhaps, \n     in their styles as foreign policy leaders. They further \n     assert that these stylistic differences have narrowed as \n     President Clinton has lately recovered from his earlier \n     ineptitude on the world stage. Thus, they mistakenly \n     conclude, foreign policy should not play a significant role \n     in the presidential debate this year.\n       I am sure you will not be surprised to learn that I \n     strongly dispute both the premises and conclusion of that \n     argument. It overlooks not only major policy differences \n     between Senator Dole and the President--Ballistic Missile \n     Defense, Bosnia, Iran, Korea and NATO expansion come \n     immediately to mind--but it devalues the importance of \n     leadership style to the conduct of foreign policy. Both the \n     conceptual and operational flaws of the incumbent \n     Administration's statecraft and the alternatives which \n     Senator Dole's election offers should be and will be an \n     important focus of this campaign.\n       As we all know, a presidential election is primarily a \n     referendum on the incumbent's record. A challenger draws \n     distinctions between himself and the incumbent by first \n     examining the performance of the incumbent, and criticizing \n     the flaws in that performance as a means of identifying what \n     the challenger would do differently.\n       As a campaigner, even as an incumbent campaigner, the \n     President is remarkably adroit at staying on offense. As one \n     politician to another, I respect the President's political \n     abilities. He really does not need any assistance from the \n     press in this regard.\n       To combat the curt dismissal of ``stylistic differences'' \n     between the candidates we could supply a shorthand response: \n     ``style is substance.'' But we serve voters better by \n     elaborating what those differences say about each candidates' \n     leadership capacity. Those differences are important. They \n     should be an important focus of campaign debates.\n       In a comparison of foreign policy views, to minimize \n     distinctions between candidates as merely ``stylistic'' is to \n     reject important principles of American diplomacy. Let me \n     elaborate a few of the principles which I think have been \n     casualties of the President's ``style'' of foreign policy \n     leadership.\n       First, words have consequences: The President must make no \n     promise he is unprepared to keep and no threat he is \n     unwilling to enforce. The casual relationship between \n     presidential rhetoric and presidential action in the Clinton \n     Administration has damaged the President's credibility abroad \n     and harmed many of the most important relationships we have \n     in this world.\n       Second, diplomacy must be led from the Oval Office for it \n     is the President who gives strategic coherence to American \n     diplomacy. The President must prioritize our interests and \n     oblige policymakers to integrate policies to serve those \n     priorities. When the President is passive, government will \n     not be organized cohesively to conduct foreign policy; second \n     and third level officials are elevated to leading policy \n     roles; and single issue advocates will fragment U.S. \n     diplomacy.\n       Absent such cohesiveness, Clinton Administration officials \n     have poorly prioritized U.S. interests, often placing \n     peripheral interests before vital ones. They have pursued \n     case-by-case policies that often collided with one another \n     and conducted relations with some countries in ways that \n     disrupted our relations with others. Diminished presidential \n     leadership in foreign policy has also resulted in the \n     franchising of foreign policy to retired public officials \n     whose goals may or may not be compatible with the \n     Administration's.\n       Third, there is no substitute for American leadership in \n     defense of American interests. The Administration's \n     reluctance to give primacy in our post Cold War diplomacy to \n     American leadership or even, at times, to American interests \n     has violated proven rules of American leadership. Among those \n     are: protect our security interests as the precondition for \n     advancing our values; force has a role in, but is not a \n     substitute for diplomacy; build coalitions to protect mutual \n     security interests, don't neglect security interests to build \n     coalitions; and don't slight your friends to accommodate your \n     adversaries.\n       The direct consequences of the Administration's failure to \n     observe these rules, have been its misguided efforts to cloak \n     the national interest in ``assertive multilateralism''; its \n     poor record of building coalitions despite its virtuous \n     regard for multilateralism; and its paralyzing confusion \n     about when and how to use force.\n       Fouth, foreign policy should serve the ends of domestic \n     policy, and just as importantly, domestic policy should serve \n     the ends of foreign policy. The President has often \n     misconstrued that relationship, often using foreign policy as \n     an international variant of pork barrel politics to serve his \n     own political ends. This in part explains the \n     Administration's interventions in Haiti and Northern Ireland, \n     and its mania for managed trade solutions to our trade \n     imbalance with Japan. It explains, in part, their gross \n     mishandling of our relationship with China.\n       However, the most damaging effect of this flaw is that it \n     has damaged the President's ability to persuade the American \n     public that our vital interests require America to remain \n     engaged internationally. This failure has led to a \n     demonstrative increase in isolationist sentiments in both \n     political parties.\n       We need not look far in the past to measure the \n     consequences of the President's style of foreign policy \n     leadership. The purpose of the President's recent state visit \n     to Japan, and his brief visit to Korea were, in fact, damage \n     control expeditions intended to repair the harm which the \n     President's leadership style had done to our relationships \n     with our allies.\n       The President's heavy handed threats of economic sanctions \n     to coerce Japan's acceptance of numerical quotas for American \n     exports risked divesting our relationship of its vitally \n     important security components. Thus, when we required Japan's \n     help in mustering a credible threat of economic sanctions \n     against North Korea the Japanese demurred. And when the \n     despicable rape of an Okinowan girl by three American marines \n     increased opposition among the Japanese public to our \n     military bases there, Japanese leaders were noticeably slow \n     to defend our presence. Hence, the need for the President to \n     go to Japan to reaffirm the importance of our security \n     relationship.\n       The President's visit to Korea was intended to reaffirm \n     American resistance to North Korea's attempts to drive a \n     wedge between us and our South Korean allies. South Korea has \n     cause to worry about the effect North Korea's recent \n     provocations in the DMZ might have on alliance solidarity \n     considering the wedge we allowed North Korea to drive between \n     the U.S. and South Korea during our earlier negotiations with \n     Pyongyang over their nuclear program.\n       Our relationship with one country that wasn't on the \n     President's itinerary, but\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\n     should have been--China--has also suffered as a result of the \n     strategic incoherence of Administration statecraft. Both the \n     President's passivity in foreign policy and his poor record \n     of linking rhetoric with deeds have badly damaged our ability \n     to manage China's emergence as a superpower--the central \n     security problem of the next century.\n       Administration diplomacy for China has been fragmented as \n     officials from the Commerce Department, USTR, Defense and \n     various bureaus of the State Department pursued different, \n     and often conflicting agendas in China. (Chicken export \n     lobbyist lately gained brief control over our Russia policy, \n     but that's the subject of another speech.) Moreover, the \n     wounds the President inflicted on his own credibility as he \n     mishandled the MFN question and the visit of President Lee--\n     first assuring the Chinese that Lee wouldn't come, and then \n     reversing his decision without informing Beijing--have \n     seriously crippled the Administration's ability to have a \n     constructive dialogue with the Chinese on the host of issues \n     involved in our relationship.\n       Lastly, I want to make brief reference to another topical \n     foreign policy mistake which reveals the leadership flaws of \n     the incumbent administration: the recent disclosure that the \n     administration acquiesced in, and possibly facilitated \n     Iranian arms shipments to Bosnia, Currently the media and \n     Congress are focusing on whether that action was illegal. \n     Such focus may overlook the policy's more important security \n     implications.\n       President Clinton campaigned for office by denouncing the \n     arms embargo against Bosnia. As president, his expressed \n     intent to keep his campaign promise encountered stiff \n     resistance from Russia and our European allies. Rather than \n     exert maximum leadership to persuade others to join in \n     lifting the embargo or conceding that his earlier position \n     had been mistaken, the President chose to allow Iran to arm \n     the Bosnian Government. Consequently, the President helped \n     create an Iranian presence in Bosnia that threatens the \n     security of our troops stationed there, and which has \n     destroyed the Administration's efforts to enlist our allies \n     in efforts to isolate Iran internationally.\n       The legality of such a policy may be suspect. But what is \n     beyond dispute is the stupidity of a policy that risks our \n     larger security interests for the sake of avoiding a \n     difficult diplomatic problem.\n       Thus ends my lecture on the criticality of ``stylistic \n     differences'' in choosing a president. I fear I have abused \n     your hospitality by making what could be construed as a \n     partisan speech. But my purpose was not to take cheap shots \n     at the Administration for the benefit of the Dole campaign. I \n     think both Senator Dole and I have proven our regard for \n     bipartisanship in the conduct of American foreign policy. \n     That does not mean, however, that we should refrain from \n     criticizing the President's foreign policy when we find it to \n     be in error.\n       It would be a terrible disservice to the voters for either \n     campaign to devalue the importance of foreign policy \n     differences in this election--both conceptual and operational \n     differences. The quality of the next President's leadership \n     abroad will have at least as great an impact on the American \n     people as will the resolution of the current debate on \n     raising the minimum wage. And I end with a plea to all \n     journalists to accord appropriate attention to all the issues \n     in the voters' choice this November.\n       Now, I am happy to respond to your questions on this or any \n     other subject which interests you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4185-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE BAD (VERY) DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I think so often of that memorable evening \nin 1972 when the television networks reported that I had won the Senate \nrace in North Carolina.\n  At first, I was stunned because I had never been confident that I \nwould be the first Republican in history to be elected to the U.S. \nSenate by the people of North Carolina. When I got over that, I made a \ncommitment to myself that I would never fail to see a young person, or \na group of young people, who wanted to see me.\n  I have kept that commitment and it has proved enormously meaningful \nto me because I have been inspired by the estimated 60,000 young people \nwith whom I have visited during the 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  A large percentage of them are greatly concerned about the total \nFederal debt which recently exceeded $5 trillion. Of course, Congress \nis responsible for creating this monstrous debt which coming \ngenerations will have to pay.\n  Mr. President, the young people and I almost always discuss the fact \nthat under the U.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of \nFederal money that has not first been authorized and appropriated by \nboth the House and Senate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I decided that it was important that a daily record \nbe made of the precise size of the Federal debt which, at the close of \nbusiness yesterday, Wednesday, April 24, stood at \n$5,110,704,059,629.39. This amounts to $19,307.33 for every man, woman, \nand child in America on a per capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt since my report yesterday--which \nidentified the total Federal debt as of close of business on Tuesday, \nApril 23, 1996--shows an increase of more than 4 billion dollars--\n$4,331,633,680.00, to be exact. That 1-day increase is enough to match \nthe money needed by approximately 642,294 students to pay their college \ntuitions for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4187-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE PLO CHARTER\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, yesterday the Palestine National Council \nvoted by an overwhelming margin to revise its so-called Charter by \nremoving clauses referring to the destruction of Israel. The vote is \nfurther evidence of sea change in Palestinian attitudes and ideology, \nand provided a welcome respite from the otherwise troubling situation \nin the Middle East.\n  In September 1993, during the signing of the historic Israel-PLO \nDeclaration of Principles, PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat made a commitment \nto Israel to amend the Charter--the spirit and letter of which was \nclearly at odds with the peace agreement. Yesterday, Arafat, who is now \nChairman of the autonomous Palestinian Authority, secured near-\nuniversal Palestinian backing for his pledge.\n  In voting to carry out this commitment, the Palestinians remain \neligible under the terms of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, \nalso known as MEPFA, to receive United States assistance. The vote also \nappears to open the way for the resumption of substantive peace talks \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians leading to a final status \nagreement.\n  As one of the original authors of MEPFA, I was particularly pleased \nby yesterday's events. In February, I led a congressional delegation to \nthe Middle East, where the distinguished Senator from Virginia [Senator \nRobb], the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma [Senator Inhofe], and I \nmet with Chairman Arafat to urge that the Charter be amended. While I \nwas somewhat skeptical after that meeting that Chairman Arafat would \ndeliver on his promise, yesterday's vote helps to convince me that \nthere is a forceful and sincere desire on his part to implement the \npeace agreements with Israel.\n  To be sure, Mr. President, there remains much concern about the \nfuture of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The issue of terrorism remains \nthe most important factor in determining the success or failure of the \npeace process. We can, and should, continue to press the Palestinians \nto root out completely the terrorist element--which they will only be \nable to do with the support and good will of Israel. The vote \nyesterday, in my opinion, will do much to bolster Arafat's standing in \nIsrael's eyes. And that bodes well for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4187-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4187-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4187-S4188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:54 am., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1675.

A bill to require institutions of higher education to \nprovide voter registration information and opportunities to students \nregistering for class, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n\n\n               the student voter registration act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat I believe will effectively increase voter registration among \ncollege and university students and will positively change the voting \npatterns of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, currently there are over 15 million college students \nacross this country who are eligible to vote. This highly concentrated \ngroup of individuals, when allowed increased access to voter \nregistration, can be a very powerful and influential political voice. \nThe legislation I am introducing today provides colleges and \nuniversities the mechanisms and the opportunities to increase voter \nregistration among college students so that they can be an active and \nvisible political force within our country.\n  College and university students are one of the most highly mobile \nconstituent groups in this country and our voter registration systems \nhave not been entirely effective in empowering our Nation's college \nstudents to register and to vote. It is estimated that college students \nin America move on\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\nan average of twice a year. To continue to vote, college students must \nre-register to vote or change their address every year. No other \nconstituent group in America faces such a significant barrier. My \nlegislation will empower college and university students to overcome \nthis barrier.\n  Mr. President, this bill, which may be cited as the Student Voter \nRegistration Act of 1996, will amend the National Voter Registration \nAct of 1993. It will require all colleges and universities that receive \nFederal funds, have 2-year or 4-year programs of instructions and \nconfer associate, baccalaureate or graduate degrees, to provide voter \nregistration opportunities and forms, including absentee ballots, to \nstudents at the time of class registration. Although the National Voter \nRegistration Act of 1993 has made significant advances in the voter \nregistration arena, this legislation will reach out and assist an \nadditional constituency group.\n  According to a recent study prepared by the Harwood Group for the \nKettering Foundation, students feel alienated from the current \npolitical process and pessimistic about the prospects for change. This \nsame study challenged America's students ``to be more aware of the \npower and possibility that lie(s) in their own innate capacity for \ncommon action.'' The legislation allows students to overcome the \npolitical barriers currently placed before them by a system that has \nnot fully recognized their needs and their power.\n  If you look at youth participation compared to all eligible voters in \nPresidential elections from 1972 to 1992, you can see the red column \nshows that 64 percent of eligible voters voted in the 1992 election, \nand 43 percent of those in the age group 18 to 24, went to the polls in \n1992 to express their political views.\n  When you look at the same comparison of eligible voters to this age \ngroup 18 to 24 in midterm elections, from 1974 to 1994, the disparity \nis even greater. Among all eligible voters the percentage is 45 \npercent. Among this age group it is 20 percent. We need to take action \nto deal with that.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would amend the law to provide \nthat voter registration opportunities exist in much larger numbers for \nthis age group.\n  I think it is important legislation for us to enact and to do so, \nhopefully, before we get too much further into this election year.\n  As these charts behind me show, for the past 24 years, 18 to 24-year-\nolds have had a significantly lower voter participation rate as \ncompared to all eligible voters. For example, in the 1992 Presidential \nelection, of young people in the 18 to 24-year-old age category \neligible to vote, only 53 percent had registered to vote and only 43 \npercent of eligible young people actually voted. During the last \nmidterm election, 40 percent of young people age 18 to 24 were \nregistered to vote and only half of them voted. That is less than 20 \npercent Mr. President. These numbers are staggering when compared to \nthe numbers of all eligible voters who turned out to vote. In 1994's \nmidterm election, 45 percent of eligible voters went to the polls to \nexpress their political views. In the last Presidential election over \n60 percent of eligible voters went to the polls to vote. Mr. President, \nin 1992, youth participation reached its highest level--43 percent--\nsince 1972, the first year that 18 to 24-year-olds were eligible to \nvote. We need to continue this upward trend. The bill I am bringing to \nthe Senate floor is a solid mechanism for this.\n  Mr. President, this is not a partisan issue. I do not stand here in \nthe Senate today in an effort to increase registration for my party, \nbut instead I hope this legislation will increase registration and \npolitical involvement among students regardless of party affiliation.\n  Mr. President, anyone who believes that this is a partisan issue \nneeds to just look at this final chart that I have here. It is clear \nthat when you look at this age group, in this case 18- to 29-year-olds, \nthe numbers, in terms of party affiliation for Democrats versus \nRepublicans is almost identical.\n  Again, this is not a partisan issue. This is not a way to get more \nDemocrats registered at the expense of the Republicans, or vice versa. \nIt is a way to get more young Americans registered and to get them \nparticipating in our political system. What is important is that \nstudents have every opportunity to register--not what party they align \nthemselves with and not how they chose to vote. This bill gives college \nand university students the opportunity to register and provides \naccessibility to registration forms.\n  As the American people look ahead to the 1996 election, it is \nimportant that we began to establish the foundation for an effective \ndialogue regarding the electoral process. For many college students \nthis may be the first general election they participate in and it is \ncritical that they do participate. It is also critical, that we here in \nCongress accept the challenge of energizing America's college students \nand presenting them the opportunity to be an influential part of the \ndevelopment and the continuation of this great democracy.\n  I commend this legislation to my colleagues, and I will file it with \nthe clerk today and ask that it be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the act establishing the National Park \nFoundation; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         the national park foundation act amendment act of 1996\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today and along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Johnston, Bennett, and Kempthorne to introduce a \nbill which, when enacted, will generate as much as $100 million \nannually from the private sector in support of our national parks.\n  This legislation contains a number of amendments to the National Park \nFoundation Act, which I am pleased to say will revitalize and expand \nthe scope of operations of the Foundation.\n  An act of Congress created the National Park Foundation in 1967 as \nthe official nonprofit partner of the National Park Service. The \nFoundation provides a vehicle for donors who want to contribute to \nnational parks with the assurance that gifts will be carefully managed \nand used wholly and exclusively for the purpose specified by the donor.\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\n  The Foundation provides a simple and direct way for individuals, \ncorporations, and private foundations to help conserve and preserve the \nnatural, cultural, and historical value of the national parks for the \nenjoyment of future generations.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of organizations who claim to \nsupport our national parks, and to some extent they do. Unfortunately, \nthere is little evidence that the parks ever receive any monetary or \ntangible benefits from these organizations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have three pages of the \nNational Park Foundation's annual report printed in the Record which \nwill show some of the benefits the Foundation provides.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Financial Report\n\n       The National Park Foundation continued to generate solid \n     financial results in fiscal year 1995, which ended June 30, \n     1995.\n       Total revenue from all sources increased for the fifth \n     consecutive year, rising from $6.7 million in 1994 to $9.9 \n     million in 1995. The major revenue item, contributions to the \n     Foundation, increased from $5.9 million to $6.3 million. \n     These contributions from individuals, corporations, \n     foundations, and through marketing programs and the Combined \n     Federal Campaign, play an important role in supporting the \n     Foundation's mission this year and in the future.\n       Unrestricted revenue is used to support the Foundation's \n     discretionary grantmaking to the National Parks and to \n     support operations. Restricted revenue is used to benefit \n     specific parks or projects. The donor's designation is \n     honored through the years.\n       Total grants made by the Foundation to the National Parks \n     increased 13 percent, from $2.3 million in 1994 to $2.6 \n     million in 1995. Grants made from unrestricted funds totalled \n     $1 million and grants made from restricted funds totalled \n     $1.6 million. The Foundation has made grants totalling $10.4 \n     million during the past five years.\n       The Foundation's total expenditures for 1995 were $4.3 \n     million. Grants to the National Parks and program related \n     expenditures accounted for 83 percent of that spending.\n       The balance sheet remains in healthy condition. Assets are \n     $27.1 million at June 30, 1995, compared to $20.7 million a \n     year ago.\n       Total fund balances increased 29 percent, from $19.9 \n     million to $25.6 million. These fund balances, which will \n     benefit the National Parks in future years, have grown from \n     $9.6 million to the current $25.6 million during the past \n     five years.\n       The management of restricted funds and programs is a major \n     activity of the Foundation. Restricted fund balances \n     increased from $8.3 million in 1994 to $12.5 million in 1995.\n       The Permanent Fund balance, which acts as the Foundation's \n     endowment for resources so designated by the Board, increased \n     from $10.4 million to $11.9 million. The increase resulted \n     mainly from market appreciation in investments of $1.4 \n     million. The increase in the Permanent Fund balance provides \n     the Foundation with the resources to meet the current and \n     future needs of the National Parks.\n       The Foundation has successfully managed all funds received. \n     Total market value appreciation on invested funds was $2.4 \n     million in 1995.\n       The National Park Foundation is extremely grateful to the \n     many individual, philanthropic and corporate supporters who \n     have given generously of themselves to strengthen our \n     efforts.\n\n                                            NATIONAL PARK

=============================================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with the notable exception of the \nNational Park Foundation, I am aware of no national conservation \norganizations whose actual cost of conducting business is less than 10 \npercent of their entire operating program.\n  In other words, Mr. President, donations made to the National Park \nService through the Foundation are actually used to enhance the \noperation of programs conducted by the National Park Service. The \nFoundation is governed by a board of distinguished civic and business \nleaders committed to helping the national parks. By law, the Secretary \nof the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, serves as the chairman of the board, \nand the Director of the Park Service, Roger Kennedy, serves as the \nsecretary of the board.\n  The Foundation is a partnership between the public and private \nsectors. It provides direct support for park units through a \ncompetitive program that grants venture capital to seed creative \nefforts to conserve park resources.\n  With the help of private partners, the National Park Foundation has \nmade grants of over $10 million to support projects in our national \nparks in the last 5 years. I know of no other organization, Mr. \nPresident, which claims to support our National Park System that has a \nrecord that even comes close to this achievement.\n  The National Park Foundation does not engage in activities normally \nassociated with lobbying, and as a result it does not enjoy the \nnotoriety or the vast fundraising programs that benefit other \nenvironmentally motivated organizations or environmental causes. \nUnfortunately, not many people even know about the existence of the \nNational Park Foundation.\n  Mr. President, administrative requests and congressional \nappropriations are simply not keeping pace with increased visitations \nand other demands placed on the National Park System. With the current \ndemands on Congress to balance the budget and eliminate the Federal \ndeficit, it would be more and more difficult for Congress to authorize \nsufficient funding for our national parks. As a result, there is a \ngreat need for additional support to protect, conserve and enhance our \nnational parks.\n  Mr. President, the National Park Foundation is well positioned to \ntake on this important task.\n  This bill contains amendments which will authorize the National Park \nFoundation to: First, engage in business relationships with appropriate \nprivate partners to raise revenue for the National Park System similar \nto the authority Congress has already granted the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation and the National Forest Foundation. Second, it \nwould operate similarly to the U.S. Olympic Committee, where once a \nsponsor has been approved by the United States Olympic Committee, \nmoneys are being generated from the private sector partners for the \nbenefit of the Olympics.\n  This bill, when enacted, will allow the Foundation to optimize and \ncapture for our national parks the economic value of selective, \nappropriate sponsorships of national parks similar to, as I have said, \nthe authority Congress has granted to the United States Olympic \nCommittee.\n  As commercial advertisers have long demonstrated, the national parks \nhave great commercial value. Each year advertising, publishing, \ncommercial broadcasts, moviemaking, merchandising and other commercial \nactivity worth hundreds of millions of dollars is made on the \nintellectual property and other assets of the parks with virtually no \nreturn to the Park Service.\n  A change is needed to enable the Park Service, through the National\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\nPark Foundation, to capture some of that potential income through \nlicensing and other marketing agreements.\n  Mr. President, my bill provides safeguards which will negate any \nuntoward, inappropriate commercialization of our parks; however, it \nwill allow new revenue-generation opportunities outside the parks in \npartnership with private enterprise.\n  It is private enterprise that will ultimately provide additional \nfunding in the billions of dollars for resource management and \ninfrastructure repair required for park facilities throughout our \nNation.\n  If we do not count the damage to the C canal, the current backlog \nin maintenance and facility repair for our parks is in excess of $4 \nbillion. It is going to take literally hundreds of millions of dollars \nto reestablish resource management and visitor service programs which \nhave been deferred servicewide.\n  According to the National Park Service, employee housing faces a \nbacklog of $500 million. Mr. President, it is apparent that we cannot \neven afford to take care of the caretakers, much less properly address \nthe needs of the National Park System.\n  Enactment of this legislation will provide an economically cost-\nefficient and accountable program by which the Foundation can begin the \nlong quest to address the needs of our National Park System with the \nassistance of private sector resources.\n  Mr. President, the concept is exciting. The results will surely \ncontribute to the future financial stability of our Park System as well \nas the protection of those national treasures we described as our \nnational parks.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Together \nwe can make it possible for the National Park Foundation to play the \nrole originally intended by Congress back in 1967, making a significant \ncontribution to preserving America's national parks through private \npartnerships between Government, private business, and individuals.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1704. A bill to provide for the imposition of administrative fees \nfor medicare overpayment collection, and to require automated \nprepayment screening of medicare claims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             the medicare overpayment reduction act of 1996\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing an \ninitiative to address Medicare overpayments--a serious problem which is \ndepriving the trust fund of billions of dollars every year.\n  I'd like to thank Martha McSteen, president of the National Committee \nto Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and her talented staff, for \ntheir invaluable efforts and continued support of this important \ncrusade.\n  Today, I introduce the Medicare Overpayment Reduction Act. This bill \nimposes an administrative fee on providers who submit inaccurate \nMedicare claims and are overpaid by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration. The fee will be equal to 1 percent of the overpaid \namount, and is intended to discourage overpayments and to offset the \ncost of recovering them.\n  In addition, the bill will require the Health Care Financing \nAdministration to screen claims for accuracy, before payment is made, \nfor certain procedures and services where there is a high rate of mis-\nbilling.\n  Hospitals, and other providers under Medicare Part A, are prepaid \nannually by HCFA for anticipated Medicare expenditures. Currently many \nhospitals grossly overestimate their Medicare funding needs and use the \noverpayment to subsidize their non-Medicare operations. This is an \nabuse and it must stop. The legislation will impose the administrative \nfee if a hospital overestimates its Medicare needs by more than 30 \npercent, and does not repay the overage within 30 days.\n  Doctors, on the other hand under part B, submit claims for services. \nSometimes claims are submitted for services that were never provided, \nor that are incorrectly coded in order to receive greater payments. The \nfee will discourage this activity and help us recoup the cost of \nseeking reimbursement.\n  Moreover, prepayment screening will help eliminate overpayments from \noccurring in the first place. Prescreening technology is readily \navailable and used extensively in the private sector, and we should use \nprescreening to improve Medicare payment accuracy.\n  It should come as no surprise to my colleagues, or to any interested \ncitizen, that the Medicare system is in serious condition. It is \nestimated that Medicare funds will be exhausted by the year 2002. The \nWashington Post today reported that the trust fund is in worse shape \nthan previously thought.\n  We have an obligation to take every step we can to protect the trust \nfunds and ensure their health and viability for this and future \ngenerations.\n  While overpayments are not the only problem with Medicare, they are a \nsignificant problem. GAO reports that last year over $4.1 billion was \noverpaid from the trust funds. Had this bill been in effect last year, \nI would submit that a healthy portion of these mis-billings and \noverpayments might not have occurred and even if they had, we would \nhave been able to recoup over $15 million from imposing the \nadministration fee.\n  While this bill is not a panacea, it is a step in the right direction \nin the effort to discourage overbilling, and to recoup recovery costs \nin every instance.\n  Overpayments are costly, unnecessary and wasteful. They contribute to \nthe Medicare solvency problem and they must be stopped. This bill will \nhelp.\n  Again, I want to thank Martha McSteen, her staff and the membership \nfor their continued support of the effort to help protect and preserve \nthe future of the Medicare program, and for their leadership on this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                            By Mr. THURMOND:\n\n  S. 1705. A bill to eliminate the duties on Tetraamino Biphenyl; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      DUTY ELIMINATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \npermanently suspend the duty on the chemical tetra amino biphenyl \n[TAB]. This chemical is imported to the United States from Germany. TAB \nis an essential raw material used in the production of a high \nperformance fiber called ``PBI.''\n\n  PBI is a unique heat and chemical resistant fiber that, in some uses, \ncan be a suitable replacement for asbestos. PBI has a wide range of \nthermal protective applications including flight suits and garments for \nfirefighters, boiler tenders, and refinery workers.\n  Mr. President, in previous Congresses, I introduced similar \nlegislation to apply duty-free treatment to TAB. These bills were \nultimately incorporated into the Omnibus Tariff and Trade Act of 1984, \nthe Omnibus Trade Act of 1988, and the Customs and Trade Act of 1990. \nThe current duty suspension for this chemical expired December 31, \n1992.\n  During the Uruguay Round negotiations, the Administration made a \ncommitment to negotiate the elimination of duties on products covered \nby duty suspension legislation. However, TAB was inadvertently deleted \nfrom Tariff Schedule XX during talks on the GATT Agreement. This \nchemical has been on the duty suspension list for several years. It is \na noncontroversial item and should have been included in the final \nTariff Schedule XX approved at Marrakesh.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that TAB was on the original \nDepartment of Commerce ``Consolidated Duty Suspension List'' of \nproducts to be incorporated into the U.S. offer and on subsequent \noffers until the final document was prepared in March. The February \n25th offer, which was the last list made available to the public, \nincluded TAB as ``free'' under the proposed HTS 2921.59.14. When the \nimporting company asked why it was deleted, they were told that it was \nincorporated into either the pharmaceutical or intermediate chemicals \nfor dyes lists.\n  Recently, importers were surprised to discover that TAB was not \ncovered under any duty suspension and would be assessed a 12.8 percent \nduty. According to the company, it is not covered under any tariff \nheading, no industry opposition has been found, and no instructions \nwere issued which would have deleted TAB from the list. I hope the \nSenate will consider this measure expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1705\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIMINATION OF DUTIES ON 3,3'-DIAMINOBENZIDINE \n                   (TETRAAMINO BIPHENYL).\n\n       (a) Elimination of Duties.--The President--\n       (1) shall proclaim duty-free entry for 3,3'-\n     diaminobenzidine (Tetraamino Biphenyl), to be effective with \n     respect to the entry of goods on or after January 1, 1995, \n     and\n       (2) shall take such actions as are necessary to reflect \n     such tariff treatment in Schedule XX, as defined in section \n     2(5) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3501(5).\n       (b) Liquidation or Reliquidation and Refund of Duty Paid on \n     Entries.--\n       (1) Liquidation or reliquidation.--Notwithstanding section \n     514 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1514) or any other \n     provision of law, and subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary \n     of the Treasury shall liquidate or reliquidate any entry of \n     goods described in subsection (a) that was made on or after \n     January 1, 1995, and before the proclamation is issued under \n     subsection (a), and refund any duty or excess duty that was \n     paid on such entry.\n       (2) Requests.--Liquidation or reliquidation may be made \n     under paragraph (1) with respect to any entry only if a \n     request therefor is filed with the Customs Service, within \n     180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, that \n     contains sufficient information to enable the Customs \n     Service--\n       (A) to locate the entry; or\n       (B) to reconstruct the entry if it cannot be located.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION.\n\n       As used in this Act, the term ``entry'' includes a \n     withdrawal from warehouse for consumption.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1709. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nadjust the maximum hour exemption for agricultural employees, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n        the water delivery organization flexibility act of 1996\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today, which this \nbody previously approved as an amendment to the first bill amending the \nFair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] that the Senate passed in 1989. This \nbill would solve a problem with the interpretation of a provision of \nthe FLSA, clarifying that the maximum hour exemption for agricultural \nemployees applies to water delivery organizations that supply 75 \npercent or more of their water for agricultural purposes.\n  Representative Mike Crapo, of the Second District of Idaho, is today \nintroducing an identical bill in the other body. Our bill would restore \nan exemption that was always intended by Congress.\n  Companies that deliver water for agricultural purposes are exempt \nfrom the maximum-hour requirements of the FLSA. The Department of Labor \nhas interpreted this to mean that no amount of this water, however \nminimal, can be used for other purposes. Therefore, if even a small \nportion of the water delivered winds up being used for road watering, \nlawn and garden irrigation, livestock consumption, or construction, for \nexample, delivery organizations are assessed severe penalties.\n  The exemption for overtime pay requirements was placed in the FLSA to \nprotect the economies of rural areas. Irrigation has never been, and \ncan not be, a 40-hour-per-week undertaking. During the summer, water \nmust be managed and delivered continually. Later in the year, following \nthe harvest, the work load is light, consisting mainly of maintenance \nduties.\n  Our bill is better for employers, workers, and farmers. Winter \ncompensation and time off traditionally have been the method of \ncompensating for longer summer hours. Without this exemption, \nirrigators are forced to lay off their employees in the winter. \nTherefore, our bill would benefit employees, who would continue to earn \na year-round income. It also would keep costs level, which would \nbenefit suppliers and consumers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PRISONER TRANSFER TREATIES.\n\n       (a) Negotiations With Other Countries.--(1) Congress \n     advises the President to begin to negotiate and renegotiate, \n     not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, bilateral prisoner transfer treaties, providing for the \n     incarceration, in the country of the alien's nationality, of \n     any alien who--\n       (A) is a national of a country that is party to such a \n     treaty; and\n       (B) has been convicted of a criminal offense under Federal \n     or State law and who--\n       (i) is not in lawful immigration status in the United \n     States, or\n       (ii) on the basis of conviction for a criminal offense \n     under Federal or State law, or on any other basis, is subject \n     to deportation under the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n\n     for the duration of the prison term to which the alien was \n     sentenced for the offense referred to in subparagraph (B). \n     Any such agreement may provide for the release of such alien \n     pursuant to parole procedures of that country.\n       (2) In entering into negotiations under paragraph (1), the \n     President may consider providing for appropriate \n     compensation, subject to the availability of appropriations, \n     in cases where the United States is able to independently \n     verify the adequacy of the sites where aliens will be \n     imprisoned and the length of time the alien is actually \n     incarcerated in the foreign country under such a treaty.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the focus of negotiations for such agreements should \n     be--\n       (A) to expedite the transfer of aliens unlawfully in the \n     United States who are (or are about to be) incarcerated in \n     United States prisons,\n       (B) to ensure that a transferred prisoner serves the \n     balance of the sentence imposed by the United States courts,\n       (C) to eliminate any requirement of prisoner consent to \n     such a transfer, and\n       (D) to allow the Federal Government or the States to keep \n     their original prison sentences in force so that transferred \n     prisoners who return to the United States prior to the \n     completion of their original United States sentences can be \n     returned to custody for the balance of their prisons \n     sentences;\n       (2) the Secretary of State should give priority to \n     concluding an agreement with any country for which the \n     President determines that the number of aliens described in \n     subsection (a) who are nationals of that country in the \n     United States represents a significant percentage of all such \n     aliens in the United States; and\n       (3) no new treaty providing for the transfer of aliens from \n     Federal, State, or local incarceration facilities to a \n     foreign incarceration facility should permit the alien to \n     refuse the transfer.\n       (c) Prisoner Consent.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, except as required by treaty, the transfer of an \n     alien from a Federal, State, or local incarceration facility \n     under an agreement of the type referred to in subsection (a) \n     shall not require consent of the alien.\n       (d) Annual Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committees on \n     the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the \n     Senate stating whether each prisoner transfer treaty to which \n     the United States is a party has been effective in the \n     preceding 12 months in bringing about the return of \n     deportable incarcerated aliens to the country of which they \n     are nationals and in ensuring that they serve the balance of \n     their sentences.\n       (e) Training Foreign Law Enforcement Personnel.--(1) \n     Subject to paragraph (2), the President shall direct the \n     Border Patrol Academy and the Customs Service Academy to \n     enroll for training an appropriate number of foreign law \n     enforcement personnel, and shall make appointments of \n     foreign law enforcement personnel to such academies, as \n     necessary to further the following United States law \n     enforcement goals:\n       (A) prevention of drug smuggling and other cross-border \n     criminal activity;\n       (B) preventing illegal immigration;

Mr. President, pursuant to Public Law 104-4, \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has requested, and \nobtained, the opinion of the Congressional Budget Office regarding \nwhether S. 1271, the Nuclear Policy Act of 1996 contains \nintergovernmental mandates as defined in that act. I ask that the \nopinion of the Congressional Budget Office be printed in the \nCongressional Record in its entirety.\n  The opinion follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed S. 1271, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996 as \n     ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources on March 13, 1996, in order to determine \n     whether the bill contains intergovernmental mandates. CBO \n     provided federal and private sector mandates cost estimates \n     for this bill on March 28, 1996. CBO is unsure whether the \n     bill contains intergovernmental mandates, as defined in \n     Public Law 104-4, but we estimate that if there are mandates, \n     they would impose costs on state, local and tribal \n     governments totaling significantly less than the $50 million \n     threshold established in the law.\n       S. 1271 would amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act by \n     directing the Department of Energy (DOE) to:\n       Begin storing spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear \n     waste at an interim storage facility in Nevada, no later than \n     November 30, 1999;\n       Establish an intermodal transfer facility at Caliente, \n     Nevada, by November 30, 1999, to transfer material from rail \n     facilities to heavy-haul trucks for transport to the interim \n     storage facility;\n       Enter into a benefits agreement with Lincoln County, Nevada \n     (the site of the transfer facility), and make payments to the \n     county under that agreement as specified in the bill; and\n       Continue site characterization activities at the proposed \n     permanent repository site at Yucca Mountain, also in Nevada.\n       In addition, the bill would authorize the appropriation of \n     such sums as are necessary to establish a pilot program to \n     decommission and decontaminate an experimental reactor owned \n     by the University of Arkansas.\n       While S. 1271 would, by itself, establish no new \n     enforceable duties on state, local, or tribal governments, it \n     is possible that the construction and operation of an interim \n     storage facility as required by the bill would increase the \n     cost to the state of complying with existing federal \n     requirements. CBO has not yet determined whether these costs \n     would be considered the direct costs of a mandate for the \n     purposes of Public Law 104-4.\n       Interim Storage Facility.--The state of Nevada and its \n     constituent local governments would incur additional costs as \n     a result of the interim storage facility required by this \n     bill. CBO expects that state spending would increase by as \n     much as $20 million per year until shipments to the facility \n     begin in 1999 and $5 million per year between that time and \n     the time that the permanent facility at Yucca Mountain begins \n     operations. This additional spending would support a number \n     of activities, including emergency response planning and \n     training, escort of waste shipments, and environmental \n     monitoring. In addition, spending by Nevada counties for \n     similar activities would probably increase, but by much \n     smaller amounts. Not all of this spending would be for the \n     purpose of complying with federal requirements.\n       These costs are similar to those that the state would \n     eventually incur under current law as a result of the \n     permanent repository planned for Yucca Mountain. DOE \n     currently does not expect to begin receiving material at a \n     permanent repository until at least 2010, while under S. 1271 \n     it would begin to receive material at an interim facility in \n     1999. As a result, the state would have to respond to the \n     shipment and storage of waste at least ten years sooner. \n     Further, state costs would increase because it would have to \n     plan for two facilities.\n       The state could incur substantial additional costs relating \n     to road construction and maintenance as a result of the \n     shipment of waste by heavy-haul truck from the transfer \n     facility in Caliente to the interim storage facility. Based \n     on information provided by DOE, however, CBO expects that the \n     federal government would pay most of these costs.\n       Federal Payments to State and Local Government.--S. 1271 \n     would authorize payments to Lincoln County, Nevada, of $2.5 \n     million in each year before waste is shipped to the interim \n     facility and $5 million annually after shipments begin. In \n     addition, the bill identifies several parcels of land that \n     would be conveyed to Lincoln County by the federal \n     government.\n       The state government and other governments in Nevada would \n     lose payments from the federal government if S. 1271 is \n     enacted, however. The bill would eliminate section 116 of the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which authorizes payments to the \n     state of Nevada and to local governments within the state. \n     Section 116 currently authorizes DOE to make grants to the \n     state and to affected local governments to enable them to \n     participate in evaluating and developing a site for a \n     permanent repository and to offset any negative impacts of \n     such a site on those governments. Further, that section \n     authorizes DOE to make payments to the state and to local \n     governments equal to amounts they would have received in \n     taxes if all activities at the repository site were subject \n     to state and local taxes.\n       In recent years, Congress has appropriated amounts ranging \n     from $12 million to $15 million per year under this section \n     for Nevada and for local governments in the state. No funds \n     have been specifically appropriated for these grants in \n     fiscal year 1996, but DOE is authorized to provide funds from \n     other appropriations.\n       S. 1271 would continue the provision in current law that \n     directs DOE to provide technical assistance and funds to \n     state and local governments and Indian tribes through whose \n     jurisdictions radioactive material would be transported. This \n     assistance would primarily cover training of public safety \n     officials. In addition, DOE would be required to conduct a \n     program of public education in those states. The amount of \n     costs reimbursable under these provisions is very uncertain \n     and would depend largely on the routes selected by DOE for \n     transport of material to the storage sites. Based on \n     information provided by state officials, we believe that \n     states would be unlikely to spend their own funds on these \n     activities unless reimbursed by the federal government.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n     June E. O'Neill, Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4250-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4250-S4251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago President Clinton \nsigned the line item veto into law. I would just like to\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\nexplain briefly why I voted for this bill during the Senate's debate in \nMarch.\n  I have long believed that giving the President line-item veto \nauthority will be helpful in imposing budget discipline. I think it \nwill be helpful in preventing unsupportable spending projects from \nbeing added to spending bills without public notice, debate, or \nhearings. I have voted for the line-item veto three times in the past \nthree Congresses. So I am delighted that the Senate finally had a \nchance to vote on the conference report.\n\n\n                  Line-Item Veto Sees the Light of Day\n\n  I was especially pleased, Mr. President, because I had been in some \nsuspense as to whether the line-item veto bill would emerge at all from \nthe Senate's conference with the House. It was on March 23, 1995 that \nthe Senate passed our line-item veto bill. The House took so long that \nI had to offer an amendment to urge the Speaker to agree to the \nSenate's invitation to a conference. When the House passed its bill, \nthe budget debates slowed down the conference. There were weeks when I \nquestioned whether we would be able to send the line-item veto to the \nPresident at all.\n  Once the line-item veto did emerge from conference, a full year after \nthe Senate passed its version, I could not help wondering whether the \ntiming was an attempt by the majority to avoid giving President Clinton \nthe line-item veto this year. The veto law will take effect only in \nJanuary 1997, long after this Congress should complete its budget work. \nSince I voted to give Presidents Reagan and Bush the line-item veto, I \nregret that President Clinton will gain the line-item veto power only \nafter this year's heavy legislative lifting is done.\n  Having gotten my disappointment about the bill's timing off my chest, \nMr. President, let me go on to discuss my views on the conference \nreport.\n\n\n                    Line-Item Veto a Sensible Reform\n\n  Let there be no mistake about the line-item veto. It is a historic \nbudget reform. It would enable the President to veto spending projects. \nThat power is important because Congress has a bad habit of spending \nmoney on projects that we have not reviewed in committee hearings or \npermitted in authorization bills.\n  The line-item veto law would also enable vetos of new entitlement \nspending and targeted tax benefits. This is crucial because \nentitlements are the fastest-growing portion of the Federal budget. \nLastly, the bill also contains a provision requiring that savings \nachieved by the line-item veto be devoted solely to deficit reduction. \nPresidents will use the line-item veto only to save money.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased that we have achieved this bipartisan \nbudget reform. Fully 43 Governors have the line-item veto, which \nsuggests to me that it is a power that the President can safely wield.\n  The bill will help the President control spending abuses, especially \nunauthorized projects in appropriations bills. The line-item veto \nseemed to me to be a sensible reform. That is why I voted for it, and \nwhy I am pleased it is now the law of the land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4250-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED FEDERAL EMPLOYEES WEEK\n\n Mr. THOMPSON.

Arthur, thereby \n     creating the United States Civil Service System; and\n       Whereas, the United States Civil Service Retirement System \n     was created in 1920 and signed into law by then President \n     Woodrow Wilson; and\n       Whereas, virtually every state, county, and municipal civil \n     service system has developed from the Civil Service Act; and\n       Whereas, untold thousands of United States Civil Service \n     employees have worked diligently, patriotically, silently, \n     and with little notice to uphold the highest traditions and \n     ideas of our country; and\n       Whereas, thousands of Federal employees are retired in \n     Tennessee and continue to devote inestimable time and effort \n     toward the betterment of our communities and state;\n       Now therefore, I, Don Sundquist, Governor of the State of \n     Tennessee, do hereby proclaim the week of April 14-20, 1996, \n     as National Association of Federal Employees Week in \n     Tennessee and do urge all our citizens to join in this worthy \n     observance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4251-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4251-S4252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF DR. ROBERT A. ALOST\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Louisianian, my good friend, Dr. Robert A. Alost, who has \nannounced his retirement as president of Northwestern State University \nafter a long and distinguished career of service to NSU, the city of \nNatchitoches, and the State of Louisiana.\n  During his 10-year presidency at NSU, Northwestern has been \ntransformed from a regional university to an institution of statewide \nprominence. Dr. Alost's tireless efforts to widen and enrich the \neducational experience of his school have strengthened every aspect of \nthe institution. Student enrollment has increased by over 71 percent \nand the average ACT score is up, the school's academic curriculum has \nexpanded by leaps and bounds, and its financial status has never been \nstronger.\n  While this progress merits commendation, Dr. Alost is even more \ndeserving of recognition because he considers his accomplishments as \nsimply part of his service to his alma mater, to a school he loves, and \nto a faculty and student body he considers his family. There are three \nwords which come to mind when describing Robert Alost: service, \nleadership, and innovation. I know that countless other Louisianians \nwould agree with this assessment, for his personal and professional \nhistory truly exemplify each of these qualities.\n  Dr. Alost's dedication to Northwestern State University is rooted in \nhis own experience as a student at NSU, where he received his \nundergraduate degree is 1957 and a masters degree in 1958. After \nreceiving a doctoral degree from Louisiana State University in 1963, \nDr. Alost had a wide range of aspirations, and of all the opportunities \navailable to him, he decided to dedicate his career to the advancement \nof Northwestern State University. He has risen from a young faculty \nmember to its president, and has left a lasting legacy which will be \nappreciated for generations.\n  Under Dr. Alost's watch, the expansion of NSU's research and academic \nprograms have placed it at the forefront of several innovative programs \nin higher education. Northwestern became America's first university \nselected to participate in the JointVenture [JOVE] Program with the \nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The results of this project, \ninvolving the analysis of data collected in space exploration, will \nhave unlimited applications. Young people from across the United States \nwill benefit from this cutting-edge program, and NSU's new space \nscience curriculum and summer camp program will help support America's \nfuture scientists. Dr. Alost oversaw the development of the Louisiana \nScholars College, which was designated by the State Board of Regents as \nthe State's selective-admission college of the liberal arts and has \nelevated NSU's reputation to statewide prominence.\n  Dr. Alost has overseen many other noteworthy additions to NSU. \nNorthwestern began a program in intercollegiate debate which won the \n1994 Cross Examination Debate Association National Championship and has \nbeen the top program in the country over the past 5 years. Dr. Alost \nsupervised the establishment of a doctoral program in educational \ntechnology to instruct educators on the most effective methods of using \ntechnology in the classroom. Northwestern is working with\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\nthe nationally recognized Duke University Talent Identification \nProgram, which identifies verbally and mathematically gifted young \npeople, and it offers regional residential courses to these special \nstudents. Dr. Alost has also overseen the establishment of Northwestern \nAbroad, which provides travel-study opportunities to students who wish \nto expand their knowledge of other cultures.\n  I had the pleasure of working with Dr. Alost when we brought the \nNational Center for Preservation Technology and Training to NSU, a \nnational institution dedicated to historic preservation. This one-of-a-\nkind center was established by the National Park Service to train \ncultural resource professionals and serve as a clearinghouse for the \ntransfer of historic preservation technology across the country. It is \nthe innovate examples I have just cited which have designated \nNorthwestern State University as a premier institution for higher \nlearning.\n  Dr. Alost's service has also touched those outside of the \nNorthwestern community. Over the years, numerous civic, professional, \nand religious organizations have flourished under his leadership. He \nhas served as president and on the board of directors of the \nNatchitoches Tourist Commission. As an administrator and educator, he \nserved as president of the Louisiana Council for Deans of Education, \nthe Louisiana Association for Colleges and Teacher Education, and the \nLouisiana Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation.\n  While Dr. Alost is a great source of pride for Northwestern State \nUniversity, he has also been honored with many local, State, and \nnational awards. In 1985, he was recognized by the Louisiana \nAssociation of School Executives as the State's Educator of the Year. \nIn 1986, he received the Leadership Award from the Louisiana \nAssociation of Gifted and Talented Students. The citizens of \nNatchitoches proclaimed him Man of the Year in 1987. His achievements \nwere heralded on a national level in 1989 when he was presented with \nthe Phi Kappa Phi Distinguished Member Award.\n  Dr. Robert Alost's lifetime of achievement is truly an inspiration, \nand he serves as an incredible role model for those who believe that \nthe possibilities are limitless. It has been an honor and a privilege \nto know him. I congratulate Dr. Alost on his distinguished career and \nwish him well as he enjoys the well-earned rewards of \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4251-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INDIANAPOLIS MOTOR SPEEDWAY AND THE INDIANAPOLIS 500\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today as the month of May \napproaches to pay tribute to an important part of Hoosier heritage, the \nIndianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500.\n  The Indianapolis Motor Speedway was built in 1909 to provide a \ntesting ground for Indiana's burgeoning automobile industry. Indiana \nwas home at the time to such names as Duessenburg, Cord, Marmon, Stutz, \nNational, Cole, Auburn, and Apperson.\n  The first Indianapolis 500 was run in 1911 and races have been run \never since. In 1917, the track backstretch was given over to the \nmilitary for use as an aviation maintenance training center. It became \none of the first lighted runways in the world. Races were canceled \nduring the years 1917, 1918 and 1942-45 out of respect for the war \neffort. Since those early days, the race has grown to become a rite of \nspring for millions of Americans, attracting the world's largest 1-day \nsporting event crowd, as well as an immense broadcast audience.\n  Indianapolis is the home of the IndyCar racing industry, and the \nmonth of May is an especially dynamic time in our State. As race season \nbegins, it is appropriate that we honor this uniquely American event \nand all those who have made it possible. In particular, we take pride \nin honoring the memory and vision of Tony Hulman, Jr.; the steadfast \nservice of his wife, Mary Fendrich Hulman; and their daughter, Mari \nHulman George; as well as the strong leadership of Indianapolis Motor \nSpeedway president Anton H. George, who personifies the very future of \nIndyCar racing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4252-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4252-S4253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ADM. JAMES S. RUSSELL\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \nrise today to record the passing of a truly great American, Admiral \nJames S. Russell. Adm. Russell built a remarkable legacy as a \ndistinguished and decorated military officer and a respected civic \nleader in Washington State.\n  James Sargent Russell was born on March 22, 1903, in Tacoma, WA, \nwhere he spent his childhood. Eager to serve his country in World War \nI, he attempted to join the U.S. Navy after graduating from high \nschool. Because he was too young, the Navy would not accept his \nenlistment. Instead, he followed his love of the sea, beginning his \nmaritime career as a seaman in the Merchant Marine.\n  In 1922, he entered the U.S. Naval Academy, from which he graduated \nin 1926. This marked the beginning of a long and illustrious tour of \nduty with the U.S. Navy. After serving aboard the battleship West \nVirginia, he entered the young field of naval aviation, and was \ndesignated a Naval Aviator in 1929.\n  During World War II, then-Lieutenant Commander Russell led Patrol \nSquadron 42 in the Aleutian Island Campaign. For his heroism and \nexceptional service, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the \nAir Medal, and the Legion of Merit. After serving in the Office of the \nChief of Naval Operations in Washington, DC, he returned to combat duty \nin the Pacific and was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a second Legion \nof Merit.\n  Following World War II, he assumed the post of commander of the \nU.S.S. Coral Sea and then was chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, \nrising to the rank of vice admiral. From 1958 to 1962, he served as \nVice Chief of Naval Operations with the four-star rank of Admiral. \nBecause of his exceptionally meritorious efforts in that capacity, he \nwas awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.\n  In 1962, Admiral Russell was named commander in chief of the Allied \nForces in Southern Europe, a position he held until his retirement from \nactive duty in 1965. His leadership during a time of heightened \ntensions earned him a Gold Star in lieu of the second Distinguished \nService Medal.\n  The advancement of the field of naval aviation owes a great deal to \nthe work of Admiral Russell. He entered the field when biplanes ruled \nthe skies and aided the development of supersonic fighters. For his \nwork on the development of the F-8 Crusader Navy fighter, the first \nship-based fighter to fly faster than 1,000 miles per hour, Admiral \nRussell was awarded the prestigious Collier Trophy in 1956.\n  Recognition of his work extends beyond the borders of the United \nStates, and is evidenced by his receipt of three foreign decorations. \nThese include: the Order of Naval Merit (Grand Officer) by Brazil, the \nLegion of Honor (Commander) by France, and the Peruvian Cross of Naval \nMerit (Great Cross).\n  After retiring from active duty, Admiral Russell returned to the \nTacoma area and became a prominent member of that community. He \nremained active in the aerospace industry as a consultant and board \nmember. However, his second career, which spanned almost as many years \nas his first, was as a civic leader who bridged the civilian and \nmilitary communities. Indeed, at an age when many of his contemporaries \nwere enjoying a quiet retirement, Admiral Russell took an active role \nin community affairs.\n  Admiral Russell leaves his wife, Geraldine; his son and daughter-in-\nlaw, Don and Katherine Russell; his daughter-in-law, Anitha Russell; \nfive grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. I wish to express my \nsincere sympathy and condolences to these and other members of his \nfamily.\n  All who are acquainted with Admiral Russell know that his work has \nbenefited and will continue to benefit countless individuals in \nWashington State, across this Nation, and around the globe. Admiral \nRussell served his country and community selflessly for three-quarters \nof a century. He led by example and earned the respect of all who knew \nhim. I and so many people --his friends, colleagues, family, and \ncommunity members--are sincerely grateful for his many contributions to \nmilitary and civilian life. He leaves behind a great legacy and will \nnot be soon forgotten.\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY WILDCATS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as my colleagues well know, I do \nnot frequently venture down to the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue. \nThe current occupant of the White House and I do not always see eye to \neye. But, times change and I am anxiously awaiting the opportunity to \nset aside political differences in order to join the President in \nwelcoming to Washington the 1996 NCAA Division I National Champions, \nthe University of Kentucky Wildcats.\n  Mr. President, University of Kentucky basketball enjoys a proud \nhistory, one unequaled by any other school. In fact, in this season of \nunparalleled achievements, Kentucky not only earned bragging rights for \nthe year, but they also became the winningest program in college \nbasketball history. With their victory in the Mideast Regional Final, \nthe Wildcats overtook the University of North Carolina and returned to \ntheir perch atop basketball's elite.\n  This fact is further demonstrated by the yearend Sagarin basketball \nRatings. These figures compiled by basketball expert Jeff Sagarin \nfactor in numerous variables, including schedule strength, to determine \nthe top teams in Division I NCAA. This year, Kentucky posted a yearend \nrating of 103.26, which put the Wildcats not only in first place for \nthe year, but also made it the top rated team in the 22-year history of \nthese figures.\n  As for history, let's review a few quick facts about this Wildcat \nteam. On their way to a 34-to-2 record, the Cats defeated every team on \ntheir schedule at least once by a minimum of 7 points. They scored 86 \npoints in one-half against the LSU Tigers. Mr. President, for those of \nmy colleagues who may not follow college basketball closely, allow me \nto put this achievement in terms more readily understandable. Scoring \n86 points in one half is equivalent to Bob Dole winning the Presidency \nbefore the polls in the Midwest even close, which, by the way, I \nanticipate he will do. Finally, the Wildcats did something that nobody \nbelieved was possible in this age of parity in college athletics: they \nplayed the entire Southeastern Conference regular season without losing \na single game. A perfect 16 and 0.\n  Rupp, Issel, Groza, Givens, Macy, Mashburn, Hall, and now Pitino. The \nFabulous Five, Rupp's Runts, the Fiddlin' Five, Pitino's Bombinos, the \nUnforgettables, and now the Untouchables. UK basketball enjoys a \ntradition unequaled by any other program. Mr. President, I believe this \ntradition will continue to grow for decades to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in extending congratulations to this \nteam of outstanding young men, a group distinguished not only by their \nathletic achievements but their character as well. As an unabashed \ncollege basketball fanatic, I want to personally thank Coach Pitino, \nAthletic Director C.M. Newton, and President Charles Wethington for \nrestoring dignity, excitement, and honor to this proud program. Their \nleadership provides an example all of us in public life would do well \nto emulate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4252-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ROLE OF RELIGION IN AMERICAN SOCIETY\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the State of Maryland is very \nfortunate to have many churches and religious institutions which serve \nfamilies and individuals with special needs. I am pleased that the \nworld headquarters for the Seventh-day Adventist Church is located in \nMaryland. On March 10, more than 500 community service directors and \nvolunteers of the Allegheny East Conference of Seventh-day Adventists \nconvened in Hyattsville, MD, under the leadership of Pastor Robert \nBooker. The keynote address was delivered by Dr. Clarence E. Hodges, \nvice-president of the North American Division of the General Conference \nof Seventh-day Adventists. He spoke eloquently on the role of religion \nin American society. I want to share with my colleagues some of his \nthoughts. Dr. Hodges began his remarks by speaking of the freedom of \nreligion which the United States enjoys.\n\n       When freedom of religion is combined with other economic \n     and social freedoms, society flourishes and the quality of \n     life is enhanced for all citizens. The United States has the \n     model which must be protected. Religious institutions stay \n     out of government and governmental institutions stay out of \n     religion while both employ their special approaches to \n     advance the interests of society and the individual.\n\n  In his remarks, Dr. Hodges highlighted the vital role religion plays \nin our country, not only in meeting spiritual needs, but also in \nmeeting the day to day needs in our communities. As he points out: \nWhere would we be without their immense contributions?\n\n       What would it cost for government to replace all church \n     operated charitable organizations, educational institutions, \n     hospitals, nursing homes, welfare centers, soup kitchens, and \n     other services provided to individuals?\n\n  And as he pointed out in his concluding comments, the contributions \nthat people of faith and religious-based organizations are making to \ncommunities are needed now more than ever, in these times of declining \nspending at all levels of government.\n\n       The family, the basic unit of society, is coming apart. \n     Divorces are at record high levels. First time marriages are \n     being delayed. Babies are born to babies. Children are being \n     raised in single parent families. Only nine percent of the \n     children who live with both parents are poor while forty-six \n     percent of the children who live with only one parent are \n     poor. Since 1970, out of wedlock births have tripled. Child \n     abuse and neglect contribute to the death of twelve children \n     each day. Three hundred fifty thousand children between eight \n     and eighteen years of age are put out of their homes each \n     year. Homeless and runaway children are exploited by \n     perverted adults for money and sick pleasures. The foster \n     care system which is designed to provide protection and hope \n     for neglected children actually feeds thousands into the \n     corrections system as felons each year. Mothers are battered \n     in front of and with their children and many see no other \n     option but to suffer through this kind of domestic violence \n     year after year. But your services are making a difference. \n     We will never know the full value or impact of your services. \n     Our governmental agencies at all levels and all tax payers \n     appreciate what you are doing in response to human needs, \n     family problems, and natural disasters. Since you serve \n     anyone in need, without strings attached, and since your \n     clients include all races, cultures and religious groups, I \n     am pleased to congratulate you for doing the work of your \n     Lord in an outstanding manner. You are ready for welfare \n     reform, changes in Medicaid, nutrition programs, and the \n     various block grant proposals. Thanks be to our founding \n     fathers for their vision of religious freedom.\n       We live in a world where there is no suffering-free zone. \n     We can relocate to beautiful communities but there is no \n     comfort zone. We can run but we cannot hide. We can have \n     creature comforts and luxuries far beyond our needs but we \n     will have no comfort zone until we have reached out to all in \n     need.\n       What is the value of a good neighbor? What is the value of \n     the Good Samaritan? What is the value of religion? What is \n     the value of religious freedom? The value of mankind, that's \n     the answer. May we and America forever place a high value on \n     all our freedoms and on all mankind.\n  I believe all of my colleagues will find food for thought in Dr. \nHodges' comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4253-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4253-S4256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nALLEGED SWISS COLLABORATION WITH THE NAZIS AND THE SMUGGLING OF GERMAN \n                      LOOTED PROPERTY TO ARGENTINA\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that \ncontinues to trouble me, namely that of the role played by Swiss banks \nand their continued retention of assets belonging to European Jews and \nothers before and during World War II.\n  In a document from the State Department, entitled, ``Nazi and Fascist \nCapital in Latin America,'' dated March 23, 1945, found at the National \nArchives, details Nazi capital infiltration of Latin and South America. \nYet, within the report, there are sections which explain the role of \nthe Swiss bankers in helping to secret Nazi assets out of Europe. At \nthis time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this report be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The relevant part of the report states that,\n\n       ``Accusations have also been voiced that Nazi German \n     capital is escaping in Swiss diplomatic pouches, probably \n     without the knowledge of the Swiss federal government, \n     because of the government's practice of entrusting diplomatic \n     missions to its bankers and businessmen traveling to the \n     Western Hemisphere.''\n\n  If this is true, it suggests that Swiss bankers might have directly \nhelp get Nazi assets out of Europe to Latin and South America. This \nrevelation could lead to serious questions about the sincerity of the \nSwiss bankers with regard\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\nto Jewish assets in their possession, as well as those of the Nazis. \nWhere did all of the money go? That is what the Banking Committee will \ntry to find out.\n  The report follows:\n\n               Nazi and Fascist Capital in Latin America\n\n       Ever since the Nazis and the followers of Mussolini began \n     to lose confidence in their ultimate victory, they started to \n     establish safe refuges for their capital in neutral \n     countries. The object of these transfers is only, in a minor \n     degree, for the purpose of establishing coches for their \n     loot, for the purpose of enjoying a comfortable old age, with \n     personal and economic security, such as that of Kaiser \n     Wilhelm II in the Netherland town of Doorn. The main purpose \n     is the reestablishment of German industrial and financial \n     power or influence in countries from which they could again \n     attempt to dominate the world, first economically and later \n     politically.\n       These transfers are being accomplished by various methods. \n     Most of them are being made by the intermediacy of neutral \n     countries. A great deal of capital, British and United States \n     currency, jewels, and technical secrets and stock \n     certificates have been transported from Germany to neutral \n     Switzerland, Spain, Tangier, and Portugal, and from there to \n     the final destination, largely to neutral Argentina where the \n     capital is expected to enjoy safety from any Allied \n     interference. Spanish Falangists, aristocrats, and \n     businessmen have been helping in these transfers, with their \n     voyages from Spain to Argentina. These activities gained \n     momentum in 1944.\n       In Spanish ships and German submarines, as much as possible \n     of Germany's capital, American and other currency of the \n     Allied nations, confiscated by the Nazis, inventions, \n     technical personnel, officers, and machinery has been sent to \n     Latin America, including some industrial plants complete with \n     administrators. A typical example was the arrival in \n     Argentina, at the beginning of 1945, of the heads of the \n     CHADE (Compania Hispano-Americana de Electricidad), Juan \n     Ventosa y. Calvet and F.A. de Cambo. The heads of the \n     Deutsche Bank and the Allgemeine Elektrizitats Gesellschaft \n     figure prominently on the board of directors of CHADE which \n     controls electric light and power for the city and province \n     of Buenos Aires. Before his trip to Argentina, Ventosa y. \n     Calvet was seen several times in Berne and Montreux, \n     Switzerland, in the company of Hitler's financial advisor, \n     Dr. Hjalmar Schacht. That is one example of how the Argentine \n     Government has managed to speed up the development of war \n     industries. In that way, Fritz Mandl, former Austrian \n     munitions manufacturer, organized his armament factories in \n     Argentina. Collaborators with German investments in Argentina \n     are: Gen. Basilio Pertine, Dr. Arnold Stoops, Guillermo \n     Schulenberg, Max Kleiner, Federico Curtins, Dr. Alejandro \n     Czisch, Fernando Ellerhorst, Dr. C.E. Niebuhr. All of them \n     are members of the board of directors of the most \n     important German, or German-controlled, companies in \n     Argentina: Siemens Bauunion, Siemens Schuckert, Osram, \n     Wayss & Freytag, Bayer, Allgemeine Elektrizitats \n     Gesellschaft, known as A.E.G., and many others.\n       The main German investments include banks, such as the \n     Banco Aleman Transatintico and the Banco Germanico de la \n     America del Sud; insurance companies, such as La Germano \n     Argentina, Compania de Segures Aachen y Munich; construction \n     companies, such as Siemens Bauunion; electric machinery \n     companies, such as the half-dozen subsidiaries of Siemens-\n     Schuckert, and Siemens & Halske; chemical companies, most of \n     the subsidiaries of I.G. Farbenindustrie, such as Quimica \n     Bayer S.A., Quimica Schering, Quimica Merck Argentina, \n     Anilinas Alemanas; machinery distributors, such as Compania \n     de Motores Otto Deutz Legitima S.A., Sociedad Tubos Mannesman \n     Ltda., Aceros, Roechling-Buderus, S.A., Aceros Schoeller-\n     Bleckman, S. de R.L. and many others.\n       Accusations have also been voiced that Nazi German capital \n     is escaping in Swiss diplomatic pouches, probably without the \n     knowledge of the Swiss federal government, because of the \n     government's practice of entrusting diplomatic missions to \n     its bankers and businessmen traveling to the Western \n     Hemisphere.\n       The vast fortunes of Nazi party leaders and industrialists, \n     sent out of the Reich for safe-keeping to neutral countries, \n     but mainly to Buenos Aires, are ready to resume business \n     through Germany's industrial and chemical cartels in new \n     headquarters as soon as Germany surrenders. The alleged or \n     Swiss aid to Germany in these matters is believed to have \n     contributed to Russia's refusal to attend last year's \n     international Aviation Conference in Chicago because of the \n     presence there of Swiss and Spanish delegates.\n       The personal fortunes of Nazi officials, including Hermann \n     Goering, Joseph Goebbels, Robert Ley and others, are said to \n     be reaching Geneva via German diplomatic pouches, and from \n     there--it is alleged--they are sent to Buenos Aires.\n       The Nazis once used Spanish diplomatic pouches in Venezuela \n     and other countries to send strategic materials like \n     industrial diamonds and platinum home from South America. \n     Before Argentina broke its official ties with Germany, the \n     Nazis sent vital materials to Berlin in their diplomatic \n     pouches and received large shipments of such diverse items as \n     propaganda, short-wave radio transmitters, and the blueprints \n     for war weapons now produced in several Argentine arms \n     plants, notably that of the former Austrian munitions king, \n     Fritz Mandl.\n       Another method of obtaining allied or ``free'' currency in \n     neutral countries, a method which furthermore obviates the \n     necessity--often involving a certain risk--of smuggling \n     currency, valuables, or stock certificates into neutral \n     countries, was extortion from Germans living in neutral \n     countries. The system of extortion, which the Nazis had \n     employed on a world-wide scale during that year, was based \n     upon the sale of exist permits from Germany and occupied \n     territories. Persons seeking such permits were compelled \n     to persuade their relatives or friends in the Western \n     Hemisphere to place at the disposal of the Nazis large \n     sums of ``free'' currency of the neutral powers. At the \n     same time, residents of the American Republics were \n     informed that their relatives or friends in Germany, or in \n     territories occupied by it, would be sent to concentration \n     camps or subjected to other tortures if the specified sums \n     of money were not paid within a fixed period of time. \n     Through this procedure, many persons in Europe, who had \n     ties of friendship or relationship with residents of the \n     New World, were held as hostages pending the payment of \n     ransom in the free currencies.\n       The fortunes in securities, bullion and cash transferred to \n     the Argentine capital are only part of the sums being \n     invested abroad for the Nazi hierarchy by banks of neutral \n     countries. International financial speculators have invaded \n     the United States, Argentina, and Panama to assist the \n     Germans in one of the greatest mass exodi of capital ever \n     known. United States Government agents have successfully \n     blocked the activities of a number of these speculators but \n     have as yet been unable to do anything about the misuse of \n     diplomatic immunity of neutral countries. Such neutral \n     diplomatic pouches are passed without inspection on Spanish, \n     Portuguese, and Swiss merchant ships at the British control \n     stations in Gibraltar and Trinidad.\n       It is reported that Reichsmarshal Goering lately used this \n     method to transfer personal funds. According to these \n     reports, Goering previously sent more than $20,000,000 of his \n     personal fortune to Argentina via the Dresdener Bank of \n     Berlin and the Schweizer Bankverein of Geneva. His \n     representative in Argentina is Dietrich Borchardt, a German \n     of Argentina citizenship, who not long ago visited the United \n     States and engaged in financial transactions.\n       Goering is also reported to have transferred some funds to \n     Argentina by a Nazi submarine which in the Spring of 1943 \n     surfaced near Mar del Plata on the Argentina coast and \n     transferred some forty boxes to a tugboat of an Axis-owned \n     line in Buenos Aires. Part of that money is said to have been \n     invested in the ``Electro Metalurgica Sema'' arms plant in \n     Buenos Aires which Goering recently sold to the Argentine \n     government for $5,000,000.\n       One of the latest reports is the discovery that Nazi \n     Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels has $1,850,000 in United \n     States money in a safety deposit box in a German-controlled \n     bank in Buenos Aires, under the name of a friend of German \n     origin there.\n       Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop has a large sum \n     deposited in the name of his cousin, a German named Martin, \n     who recently received $500,000 from a Swiss bank from the \n     account of the Nazi diplomat.\n       Admiral Karl Doenitz, chief of the German Navy, has an \n     undisclosed sum in the care of a relative, Edmundo \n     Wagenknecht, owner of one of the largest German import and \n     export firms in Argentina.\n       Robert Ley, Chief of the Nazi Labor Front, recently bought \n     a large farm near Bahia Blanca, Argentina, under the name of \n     Franz Borsemann, a trusted Nazi friend.\n       It is estimated that in 1939 German investments in Latin \n     America amounted to at least 150 million dollars or 16 \n     percent of the total foreign investment of Germany. This \n     figure does not include the capital belonging to persons of \n     German lineage or capital employed by those who had acquired \n     an American citizenship while maintaining Nazi contacts and \n     sympathies. It consists of those investments whose ownership \n     is known to be German, hence it is a minimum figure. Much of \n     this, although small in proportion to British and United \n     States holdings, was effectively and intensively organized \n     and integrated into the Nazi political system.\n       When the Germans overran almost all of continental Europe, \n     they seized many millions of French francs, Dutch guilders, \n     Belgian belgas, Norwegian and Danish kronen, Czech korunas, \n     Polish zlotys, and a great deal of American and British \n     currency found in the banks of these countries. They \n     transported or transferred them to neutral banks, and from \n     there much of it went to South America, mainly to Argentina. \n     This money was partly used for the purpose of expanding Nazi \n     controlled industries in these neutral countries.\n       According to some Argentine estimates, the Germans have \n     $750,000,000 cashed or invested in South America, including \n     their pre-war investments.\n       During the war, these investments have been considerably \n     increased through the infiltration of German capital.\n       ``Anilinas Alemanes'' (German Anilines), which is part of \n     the huge German dye trust, is an example. According to \n     figures registered by this company with the Argentine\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\n     government, its capital there in 1940 was 5,000,000 pesos. In \n     1943 it was 9,600,000 pesos, the balance having been invested \n     from abroad during the war. Although the company officially \n     was cut off from all supplies from Germany during that \n     period, its 1939 profits of 69,453 pesos had soared to \n     1,731,847 pesos in 1943.\n       German government officials ``bought'' millions of dollars \n     in Argentine securities from their owners in occupied Europe, \n     giving the victims worthless German paper money or securities \n     in exchange. The Argentine securities thus obtained have been \n     sent to Buenos Aires for safe-keeping. Future attempts of the \n     victims to recover these Argentine securities will be a \n     difficult, if not impossible task.\n\n\n                        Previous Commercial Ties\n\n       Industries and commercial houses operated by Germans in \n     Latin America conducted their activities as though \n     nationalized by the Third Reich, in the interest of the Party \n     and often with little regard for financial profit and \n     ordinary business enterprise. Commercial enterprises such \n     as retail and wholesale distribution, importing and \n     exporting, commodity brokerage, and drug compounding and \n     distribution were the types preferred for German \n     investment. More than half of the German capital in Latin \n     America was invested in this field of endeavor.\n       The largest and most extensive investments were made by \n     Germans in Brazil. Here the basis for a thriving trade in \n     German and Brazilian commodities existed as a result of a \n     large colonies of Germans in Brazil which had been \n     established under the leadership of the Hanseatic \n     Colonization Company beginning in 1887. Most of these early \n     colonists were farmers and laborers and as their economic \n     status became stronger and more prosperous, German \n     industrialists, traders, technicians, and small capitalists \n     were attracted to the country. Thousands of farms owned by \n     Germans and citizens of German descent and in 1939 an \n     estimated 40 million dollars in German capital was invested \n     in commercial houses. German traders maintained the closest \n     of ties with Germany, dealing principally in German goods and \n     in products specially prepared, packed and shipped from \n     Brazil to German markets. These strong commercial ties were \n     fully utilized by the Nazi party organization not only to \n     extend the party network but to provide powerful financial \n     support.\n       Similar commercial penetration occurred throughout Latin \n     America reaching a position of dominance in Chile, Colombia, \n     and Bolivia. In 1939, German investments in commercial firms \n     in Chile were estimated at 16 million dollars, in Colombia 9 \n     million, and in Bolivia 5 million. German business agents \n     covered the area reaching remote districts with products of \n     German industry and seeking commodities in exchange. Easy \n     credit terms were extended, personal favors granted, and \n     buyers tied to sellers by means of continuing obligations. \n     Such firms as Bayer, Becker, Elsner, Kyllman, Swertzer, and \n     Zeller operated prosperously and with extensive credit \n     furnished by banks with German connections. With typical \n     thoroughness the Germans extended their control until \n     dominance was achieved in many fields. In Uruguay a Nazi \n     gauleiter named Delldorf used the firm of Lahusen and Company \n     as a center of party espionage. This firm with other German-\n     owned and controlled units dominated the wool export trade of \n     the country. The financial strength and commercial prestige \n     of these firms enabled them to exert effective powers over \n     press and radios; a power which was fully used.\n       In addition to these strictly German investments there were \n     substantial capital holdings in the hands of local citizens \n     of German descent with Nazi sympathies and connections. In \n     Colombia alone there were an estimated 225 firms of this type \n     with capital aggregating about 5 million dollars.\n\n\n                        Agricultural Investments\n\n       Second in size to German investment in commercial \n     enterprises were German land holdings in Latin America. In \n     Argentina, German colonies were established, principally in \n     Patagonia. More than half of the population in this area was \n     foreign, the Germans numbering 15,000. Several of the richest \n     and most extensive land holdings in Patagonia were dominated \n     directly or indirectly by powerful German interests. The \n     Germans lived here as Germans speaking their own language, \n     retaining German customs, schools, and religion, celebrating \n     German holidays, and spreading a continuous flow of Nazi \n     propaganda. The area was virtually a Nazi State, followed the \n     party line, and kept alive the issue of creating a separate \n     State.\n       In Peru, Gildermeister and Company with home offices in \n     Lima and Berlin operated under the name of Negociacion \n     Agricola Chicama, Limitada (formerly Casagrande Luckner \n     Plantagen, A.G.). In 1939 this firm owned the largest sugar \n     plantation in the world (more than 1.5 million acres) and \n     controlled the production of more than half of all sugar \n     produced by Peru. The capital investments of this firm were \n     estimated at about 20 million dollars; it possessed its own \n     private seaport, Puerto Chicama, but the total quantity and \n     composition of exports and imports which flowed through the \n     port is a matter of conjecture. Gildermeister maintained \n     close ties with the Nazis, one of the Gildermeister brothers \n     serving as the Peruvian ambassador in Berlin until 1942. The \n     concern employed German as well as native personnel, and \n     dominated completely the economy of the Chicama Valley.\n       In Central America, notably Guatemala and Costa Rica, \n     German land holdings were substantial. In Guatemala, German \n     capital controlled about 60 percent of the coffee acreage and \n     the amount invested was estimated at 20 million dollars. \n     Similarly, in Costa Rica about 5 million dollars of German \n     capital was invested in coffee and sugar plantations.\n\n\n                           Banking Interests\n\n       Ranking third in size, the German investments in banking in \n     Latin America were of considerably greater importance as \n     instruments of Nazi control then might appear from their \n     capital. German personnel was strategically placed in local \n     banks; correspondent contacts were developed and maintained \n     on an extensive scale; loans to institutions of strategic \n     importance and to governments were made and the dominant \n     motive was often clearly political rather than economic.\n       In every report or news dispatch from South America, two \n     banks have been named as the key transmission-belts for \n     financing German enterprises in Latin America: the German \n     Overseas Bank (Deutsche Ueberseeische Bank) and the German-\n     South American Bank (Deutsche-Suedamerikanische Bank). \n     The former--its Spanish name is Banco Aleman \n     Transatlantica--is under the control of the Deutsche Bank, \n     the largest private bank in Germany, with eighteen \n     branches in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. \n     Its board of directors contains, besides the heads of the \n     Deutsche Bank, the director of the Krupp combine, Dr. \n     Busemann; the general director of the potash trust, Dr. \n     Diehn; and representatives of the Steel Trust and of \n     Siemens-Schuckert, one of the two largest electricity \n     trusts in Germany. The German Overseas Bank has interests \n     in the Central Banks of Argentina, Chile, and Peru.\n       The majority of shares in the German-South American Bank \n     (Banco Germanico de la America del Sud) belong to the \n     Dresdener Bank, Germany's second largest private bank. Here, \n     too, the Krupp combine is represented in the person of \n     Krupp's brother-in-law, Baron von Wilmosky. Hermann Buecher, \n     chairman of the board of AEG, Allgemeine Elektrizitats \n     Gesellschaft, the largest German electricity trust, is also a \n     director of the bank. Consul Heinrich Diederichsen, head of a \n     large Hamburg import and export house, is a director of the \n     bank; while his son, utilizing the money of the German-South \n     American Bank, plans a very important role in the fascist \n     Integralists movement in Brazil.\n       German banks were of notable importance in Argentina, \n     Brazil, Colombia, and Chile, operating with numerous branches \n     and controlled from Berlin. The former Banco Italiano (now El \n     Banco Credito del Peru) was a 10 million dollar Axis \n     institution which dominated the banking business of Peru. It \n     has such power that few important steps, affecting government \n     finance or of major economic importance, were taken without \n     consulting the officers of this institution. Through \n     selective financing, it controlled the public utilities and a \n     substantial number of private business interests in Peru.\n\n\n                     Investments in Transportation\n\n       The major German investment in Latin American \n     transportation was made in airlines. The systems developed in \n     strategic areas. The principal lines, Condor, Lufthansa, \n     Sedta, Varig, Scadta, and Lloyd Aero Boliviano, operated \n     largely with German personnel (some of whom were officers in \n     the Nazi Army) and systematically mapped the strategic areas \n     of Latin America. This subject is treated in a separate \n     section of this report.\n       German shipping companies forced to suspend business \n     activities as a result of the British blockade did not close \n     their offices but in many cases expanded and opened new \n     offices to carry on propaganda functions.\n       The Compania Union Industrial de Barranquilla was the only \n     shipbuilding firm in Colombia for the river trade. Its \n     control was German, most of its personnel was German and \n     nearby property and business was owned or dominated by \n     Germans.\n\n\n                            Public utilities\n\n       Though direct financial investments by Germans in public \n     utilities in Latin America were small, Germans held key \n     positions in many utility concerns, notably Argentina; and in \n     Uruguay, the German firm, Siemens, contracted to build a \n     great hydroelectric power and distribution system at Rio \n     Negro using German technicians and German equipment and \n     installations. The entire technical personnel of the electric \n     plant in Quito was German. The chief engineer on this project \n     was Walter Giese, a Nazi gauleiter who established in Ambato \n     a powerful Nazi radio transmitting station.\n\n\n                  transfer of italian fascist capital\n\n       The Italian Government in Rome, cooperating with the Allied \n     Commission, seized and sequestered Fascist estates valued at \n     $80,000,000 in liberated Italy. But high-ranking Fascists are \n     said to have smuggled between $400,000,000 and $500,000,000 \n     into neutral countries, most of which is the result of \n     wholesale looting.\n       Edda Mussolini, the Duce's daughter and widow of Count \n     Ciano, executed Fascist Foreign Minister, escaped to \n     Switzerland and is credited with having stored away more \n     pillage than any other Italian Fascist.\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\n       Other nations where Fascists have succeeded in hiding funds \n     include Portugal, Argentina, and Brazil, according to an \n     Allied Commission official.\n       Italian ``epuration'' (purge) officials are not \n     investigating a report that Mussolini himself hid some loot \n     in the United States.\n       Mussolini's family, including children and grandchildren, \n     his mistress, Clara Petacci and all of her family, comprise \n     sixteen names of 267 whose estates in liberated Italy have \n     thus far been sequestered. Not all of the 267 are Fascist \n     leaders. Some are simply profiteers and war contract \n     swindlers.\n\n\n                    Swiss Bankers and German Capital\n\n       Three members of the Swiss delegation of the International \n     Business Conference, held at Rye, N.Y., in November 1944, \n     made several attempts to induce the U.S. Treasury Department \n     to rescind its ruling that the true ownership of all funds \n     deposited by Swiss banks in this country be revealed within \n     one year after hostilities cease in Europe. The Swiss banking \n     system in which numbers designate accounts instead of names, \n     makes it enormously difficult to trace secret or hidden \n     funds.\n       According to sources having connections in Geneva and \n     Buenos Aires, the reason for Swiss bankers; anxiety to evade \n     disclosure of their clients, names is the fact that Swiss \n     banks have for several years been aiding in the transfer of \n     immense fortunes of Nazi leaders and their European \n     collaborators to the United States, Spain, Argentina, and \n     Brazil.\n       The Swiss Committee, headed by Edmond Barbey of Lombard, \n     Odier et Cie., includes Andre Fatio of Ferrier, Lullin, and \n     F.H. Bates, all representing the Union de Bancs Suisses (The \n     Swiss Banking Association). They are basing their plea on the \n     Swiss banking tradition of absolute secrecy concerning their \n     clients' accounts--or even of the fact that the account \n     exists.\n       At present Swiss funds deposited in the United States \n     anonymously are blocked by the Treasury Department which \n     promises to release them upon definite proof that they do not \n     belong to enemy aliens or war criminals.\n       The chairman of the Swiss delegation to the International \n     Business Conference was Hans Sulzer of Gebrueder Sulzer in \n     Geneva (and a branch in Frankfort-on-Main, Germany), who was \n     on the British blacklist. (Charged with supplying Diesel \n     engines for Nazi submarines, Sulzer hotly replied, ``They \n     were not for submarines!).\n       In allowing men like Sulzer and their bankers the cloak of \n     diplomatic immunity, the Swiss government has, probably \n     unwittingly, enabled German leaders like Goering, Goebbels, \n     and von Ribbentrop to spirit huge funds abroad. For centuries \n     Swiss banks have been confidants of men who want to keep \n     their financial transactions secret. A banker is forbidden by \n     the Swiss constitution from disclosing his clients' \n     maneuvers. He would rather go to jail than do so.\n       The Swiss Banking Association is therefore doubly anxious \n     to induce the United States to refrain from insisting on \n     postwar disclosure of the names of its depositors here. \n     Besides being forced to confess their relations with war \n     criminals, they will have lost the advantage of secrecy which \n     has enabled them to vie in world influence with the greatest \n     banks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4253-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4256-S4257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RESURGENCE OF THE AMERICAN STEEL INDUSTRY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to draw the Senate's \nattention to a most important development that seems to have gone \nvirtually unnoticed by a great many in the general public. As the co-\nchairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, I am pleased to report that the \nstory of the resurgence of the American steel industry is a genuine \nAmerican success story. In the April 16, 1996, edition of the New York \nTimes, there was an extensive article which outlined many of the ways \nin which American steel companies have been able to rebound from huge \nlosses and, in some cases, bankruptcy. Today the American steel \nindustry is simply the most cost effective, and highest quality steel \nindustry in the world.\n  During the 1980's, as many of my colleagues will remember, the steel \nindustry was confronted with many serious problems, not the least of \nwhich was the fact that foreign steel producers, with the approval of \ntheir governments, targeted our steel industry for extinction by means \nof dumping and other unfair trade practices. In response to the threat \nof our using our antidumping and countervailing duty laws, foreign \ngovernments negotiated voluntary restraint agreements [VRA's] with the \nUnited States that kept a lid on imports of unfairly traded steel.\n  These VRA's were desperately needed medicine which gave our steel \ncompanies the extra boost they needed to rise from the ashes. In \naddition, Congress worked on a bipartisan basis to maintain the \neffectiveness of U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws. \nEffective use and administration of our trade laws were--and remain--\nabsolutely vital to the health of our steel industry.\n  That is why I fought so hard, when we were negotiating the Uruguay \nround of the GATT, and when Congress was writing the legislation to \nimplement the round, to make sure that the sanctity and effectiveness \nof our fair trade laws were maintained. Today, some are trying to \nundermine our trade laws through covert means, to find ways of getting \naround our trade laws. Mr. President, we can't afford to let that \neffort succeed. America's steel industry, the backbone of our economy, \ncan't afford to let that effort succeed.\n  However, our trade laws alone didn't bring about American steel's \nresurgence. Since 1980, U.S. steel producers have invested over $35 \nbillion in modernization--a figure higher than the industry's total \ncash flow! But the revitalization of America's steel industry has been \ncostly and painful. Between 1980 and 1992, the workforce was cut by 57 \npercent and 450 facilities were closed.\n  Most of the 235,000 people whose jobs were lost in those down years \nwon't benefit from the resurgence of America's steel industry, but the \npolishing-up of the rust belt will benefit thousands of other workers \nand their families.\n  Today, the United States has a world class steel industry. American \nsteel is the lowest cost producer for the U.S. market; U.S. labor \nproductivity--man hours/ton--in the steel sector leads the world; the \nquality of American steel is second to none; and the United States is \nemerging as a center of innovative steelmaking technology.\n  As we all know, successful competition in today's global marketplace \nrequires a vigorous manufacturing base. Steel is fundamental to that \nbase and continues to be essential to manufacturing, infrastructure and \ndefense--mainstays of our economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the New York Times article entitled, ``Big \nSteelmakers Shape Up,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 16, 1996]\n\n  Big Steelmakers Shape Up--U.S. Mills Win Back Business at Home and \n                                 Abroad\n\n                           (By John Holusha)\n\n       Sparrows Point, MD.--Richard Moore was laid off from the \n     Bethlehem Steel Corporation's sprawling mill here in 1981, \n     one of tens of thousands of workers shed by the American \n     steel industry as it fought to cut bloated costs and fend off \n     surging imports.\n       Now, after a nearly 15-year stint selling auto parts, Mr. \n     Moore is back on the job, one of 400 production workers hired \n     here last year, the first new arrivals since 1979. More are \n     expected to be hired soon.\n       ``The work here is dirtier, hotter, more dangerous and \n     strenuous'' than the sales job, Mr. Moore said during a brief \n     break. But, at $24 an hour in base pay and benefits, it is \n     also ``much better than what I was doing,'' he added.\n       The return of Mr. Moore and his colleagues--and others like \n     them at steel plants around the country--marks the return as \n     well of an industry that was nearly given up for dead in the \n     United States a decade or so ago.\n       Slimmer now and better run, American steelmakers are taking \n     back more and more pieces of their domestic business from \n     competitors in Japan and other countries. And at levels not \n     seen for half a century, they are going abroad with a \n     vengeance, more than holding their own on foreign turf in \n     terms of quality and price, even with the added expense of \n     shipping.\n       Last year, they shipped 7.1 million tons of steel slabs, \n     sheets and structural beams to foreign countries, nearly \n     doubling the 3.8 million tons exported in 1994. It was the \n     best export performance since 1940, according to the American \n     Iron and Steel Institute, the principal industry trade group. \n     And orders are booming this year.\n       As explanation of why he expects to stay on this time \n     around, Mr. Moore pointed to the fact that the tinplating \n     line he works on had sold its full 1996 production capacity \n     by mid-March. Last year, Bethlehem exported 500,000 tons of \n     steel from the plant here, along the Chesapeake Bay about 12 \n     miles southeast of Baltimore. That is up from just 50,000 \n     tons the year before. All in all, the performance last year \n     and the strong orders so far this year ``confirm that the \n     U.S. steel industry has become competitive on a world \n     basis,'' said Peter F. Marcus, a metals analyst at Paine \n     Webber.\n       To be sure, the United States still imports more steel than \n     it exports, at least partly because so many outmoded mills \n     have been closed that the domestic industry cannot fully \n     supply the market. Imports totaled 24.4 million tons last \n     year. And the bulk of the hiring here and at other plants is \n     to replace retiring workers, not to add to the payroll.\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\n       Still, in one basic category, hot rolled sheet steel, the \n     United States has been a net exporter since last June. And \n     overall employment in the industry--now thought to be around \n     170,000--has begun to increase as the first few of nearly a \n     dozen new mills scheduled to open by the end of the decade \n     have started production. Taken together, the numbers show \n     just how far American steelmakers have come in changing their \n     old ways, analysts and industry executives say.\n       Those ways were marked by a full plate of inefficiencies: \n     overstaffing, outmoded production processes and poor quality \n     control. Foreign steelmakers, led by the Japanese and the \n     Europeans, saw their chance and moved in. But there were \n     domestic threats to the steel giants as well, from so-called \n     mini-mills, upstart operators that turned out low-cost steel \n     from scrap rather than from raw materials. And some foreign \n     companies bought plants in the United States and began to \n     revamp them.\n       Eventually, the big American steelmakers got serious about \n     survival. They slashed payrolls, shuttered the most \n     antiquated of their hulking mills and spent billions on new \n     technology and equipment.\n       With costs down and quality up, the industry has been \n     positioned of late to take advantage of currency swings that \n     have made American products cheaper abroad. Besides making \n     American steel itself more attractive to foreign markets, the \n     relative weakness of the dollar has helped many domestically \n     made products, from cars to appliances, that contain steel. \n     And that, in turn, has given the American steelmakers a \n     chance to retake at least some of their home ground.\n       Noting that the Chrysler Corporation is exporting steel to \n     Europe to make Jeeps there and that cars containing American \n     steel are being exported in larger numbers than they used to \n     be, Michelle Applebaum, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, \n     said: ``The Rust Bowl in the United States has become \n     competitive again. The steel market is the primary \n     beneficiary of the new competitive heartland in the United \n     States and is stronger than it has been in decades.''\n       The evidence of the shift is striking in sheet steel, the \n     biggest category and a major component of cars, building \n     materials and appliances. At the beginning of 1995, Ms. \n     Applebaum said, imports accounted for a net market share \n     (subtracting exports) of 17 percent. But by the end of the \n     year that figure was down to 5 percent. ``That means that a \n     full 12 percent share was given back to the U.S. market,'' \n     she said, equaling twice the output of one large steelmaker, \n     Inland Steel Industries.\n       One measure of efficiency is the amount of labor it takes \n     to produce a given quantity of steel. According to Mr. \n     Marcus, the average integrated mill in the United States \n     requires 4.42 hours of labor to produce a metric ton, or \n     2,200 pounds, of steel. That compares with 4.49 hours in \n     Japan, 4.69 in Germany and 4.71 in Britain. Twenty years ago, \n     when far more labor was required, Japan was the leader, at \n     11.36 hours, followed by the United States, at 12.49.\n       Steel executives say exports provide a long-term \n     opportunity, though shipments are likely to vary from year to \n     year, depending on domestic demand. Because it costs about \n     $50 a ton to ship steel overseas, the profit margin is less \n     than in a domestic sale. But because blast furnaces must be \n     run continuously, disgorging ton after ton of molten pig \n     iron, manufacturers like having an alternative market if \n     demand fails at home.\n       ``Right now, the domestic market is more attractive, so our \n     exports will probably be less this year than in 1995,'' said \n     Paul Wilhelm, president of the U.S. Steel Group of the USX \n     Corporation. U.S. Steel exported 1.5 million of the 11.4 \n     million tons of steel it made last year. But the company is a \n     permanent player in the export business, with long-term \n     overseas accounts, Mr. Wilhelm said.\n       John J. Connelly, the president of U.S. Steel International \n     Inc., added, ``we see this as an ongoing 4 to 5 percent of \n     our business through thick and thin.''\n       And while the cheap dollar helps keep that market open, \n     industry experts say, there are other factors.\n       ``Currency has an effect, but in the end if you are low-\n     cost, high-quality and meet customer expectations, you will \n     get business,'' said Curtis H. Barnette, Bethlehem Steel's \n     chairman.\n       This newfound efficiency and quality will have increasing \n     importance in coming years as the new mills begin opening in \n     this country. If products from the new mills can push out \n     imports rather than cannibalize older mills, as has been the \n     case in the past, jobs at places like Sparrows Point look \n     like a better long-term bet.\n       All the start-ups are patterned on mini-mills, which have \n     small, highly efficient work forces. The Nucor Corporation, \n     the mini-mill leader, can make steel at some of its mills \n     with less than half an hour of labor a ton.\n       But the mini-mills may no longer enjoy the big advantage \n     over traditional mills that they had in the past, some \n     experts say. In part, that is because the traditional mills \n     have become so much more efficient.\n       Another reason has to do with the production process of \n     most mini-mills: They have to live with the impurities in the \n     recycled materials they use, and the price of high-quality \n     scrap has been rising. Integrated mills, because they work \n     from raw materials, can better tune the chemistry of their \n     products.\n       Because the price of scrap is likely to keep rising as new \n     mini-mills add to demand, many companies are investing in \n     ways to separate iron from ore that do not involve blast \n     furnaces, which are costly to build and operate. Nucor, for \n     example, is converting ore into iron carbide, a form of the \n     metal that can be added to scrap.\n       As the mini-mills lose some of their edge, the slimmed-down \n     integrated mills should be able to hold their own better on \n     the domestic front, analysts predict.\n       At Sparrows Point, the changes have been profound. In the \n     1950's and 60's, it was more like an independent empire than \n     a factory. The mill employed about 30,000 people and there \n     was a company town, complete with company-owned housing, \n     stores and schools. There was even a police force and a semi-\n     professional football team.\n       In the late 60's, the company decided to end this \n     paternalistic system and to gradually close down the town. \n     New mill buildings swallowed the remains of the town, and the \n     workers who stayed on the payroll moved to Baltimore and the \n     surrounding area.\n       ``There was a high school where the blast furnace is now,'' \n     said Duane Dunham, the president of Bethlehem's Sparrows \n     Point division.\n       Over the last decade, Bethlehem poured in $1.6 billion for \n     improvements. Everything in the mill is automated and run by \n     computer, allowing only a few people to control the movement \n     of vast amounts of material by watching wall-sized displays. \n     Today the plant employs just 3,250 people and can make 3.5 \n     million tons of steel a year, about one-third of its capacity \n     in the old days.\n       The attitude of the employees and their union, the United \n     Steelworkers of America, has changed as well. At the tin \n     plate plant to which Mr. Moore is assigned, for instance, the \n     rigid union work rules of the past have become flexible.\n       ``We are all cross-trained, so we can fill in for people \n     who are not here,'' said Brenda Matthews, one of the new \n     workers, adding that little distinction was made between men \n     and women. ``Women do the same jobs as men,'' she said, with \n     one exception: Only the men load the heavy bars of tin needed \n     in the electroplating process.\n       Even some of the veterans are whistling a new tune. James \n     Henson has been at Sparrows Point for 25 years, mostly as an \n     operator of a tractor that moves coils of sheet steel prior \n     to shipment.\n       ``In the old days, we had people chasing coils all over the \n     place,'' he said, waving at a warehouse that is easily as \n     long as three football fields. ``Now it is all on computer \n     and we are shipping to our customers on a just-in-time basis. \n     Every tractor operator has a computer and every coil is \n     logged in. It's better this way.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4256-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL PARK WEEK\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President I rise today to recognize National \nPark Week from April 22-28.\n  Mr. President, Montana is known for its wonderful landscapes, \nabundant game, and a Big Sky. Montana is also known as a tourist's \nhaven because of the State's access to two of the Nation's most \nbeautiful treasures, Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National \nPark.\n  Our complex National Park System includes the likes of the crown \njewel itself, Yellowstone National Park, but also includes the more \nurban historical treasures in Washington, DC.\n  The caliber and diversity of our National Park System is uncontested \nthroughout the world. However, so is the cost of maintaining such a \nvast ecological system. We in Congress have worked to preserve our \nnational parks and ensure the public's access to these native gems.\n  In an effort to meet the costs of preservation without limiting \npublic access, the 104th Congress has passed legislation that increases \nentrance fees. The fees are our guarantee that national parks can \nmaintain quality services and preservation practices that make each \nvisitor's experience a memorable one.\n  Our National Park System provides a popular retreat for families. I \nbelieve the parks should be accessible to all people of all ages \nregardless of physical abilities. The parks do not belong singularly to \nthe hearty wilderness explorer, they belong to all Americans.\n  So whether your view is of Glacier's majestic snow covered peaks \novershadowing the Going-To-The-Sun road, or Yellowstone's Lamar Valley \nboasting its elk, waterfowl, buffalo, and the occasional grizzly, the \npreservation of the national park system will be secured.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4257-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4257-S4259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMEMORATION OF THE WARSAW GHETTO UPRISING\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to commend to the Senate \nthree remarkable public addresses delivered\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nlast week on the Days of Remembrance, designated by the Congress to the \nmemory of the Holocaust victims. Two of these speeches were given at \nNew York City's Annual Commemoration of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and \nthe third graced the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council's National Civic \nCommemoration in the Rotunda of the Capitol Building.\n  These addresses by my friend Benjamin Meed, president of the Warsaw \nGhetto Resistance Organization and Avroham Burg, the dynamic director \ngeneral of the Jewish Agency for Israel, are important statements that \ndeserve the attention of all who cherish human freedom and democratic \nvalues.\n  I ask to have these remarks by Mr. Meed and Director General Burg \nprinted in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n   An Address by Benjamin Meed, President, Warsaw Ghetto Resistance \n  Organization 53rd Annual Commemoration of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising\n\n       We are together again--the entire Jewish people, men, \n     women, and children, to commemorate the murder of the Jewish \n     people by the Germans and their collaborators. They made no \n     distinctions among Jewish people at the gates of hell. \n     Together we were all pushed to the gas chambers. For one \n     reason only--we were born as Jews.\n       This commemoration, which I have the honor to chair for the \n     35th year, is deeply emotional for me as it is for many of \n     you. For many years, the survivors alone remembered. We kept \n     reliving our nightmares in the hope that the world would pay \n     attention to our past, and now, the world has heard our \n     story.\n       People have started to understand that what happened was \n     real. When we testified collectively, the world began to take \n     our tragic experience seriously--and to heed our warning.\n       Or perhaps it is because all humanity is frightened that \n     the tragic, unique lesson that we Jews experienced, can \n     happen again--this time on a cosmic scale--to all people. And \n     it is all because survivors kept faith with the final command \n     imparted to us by the Kedoshim! Zachor--Gedenk--Remember!\n       We accepted that obligation and took it with us to our \n     adopted homes throughout the world. In Israel or Argentina--\n     in Sweden or France--throughout the United States and \n     Canada--survivors remember. How can we forget? How can we \n     allow others to forget? How betrayed and isolated we were by \n     the high and the mighty--and the ordinary people. The so \n     called ordinary people were not so ordinary. Many highly \n     educated were nevertheless motivated to murder us.\n       Immediately after the Holocaust they said they did not \n     know. How could they not have known? On the cattle cars to \n     Auschwitz and Treblinka--throughout Poland, Czechoslovakia \n     and Hungary on the way to death--we criss-crossed all of \n     Europe--day after day after day--screaming for help in \n     Yiddish and Polish, Greek and German, Dutch and Flemish, \n     Russian and French. But the world would not listen as we were \n     herded together from the four corners of Nazi Europe to be \n     murdered--only because we were Jews.\n       We Jews now speak other languages. And on Yom Hashoah we \n     gather from every part of the world--to remember together! \n     And Jews are united--not by death--but by memory and by a \n     love of Israel. To us survivors, the State of Israel is not \n     only a political entity. It is a homeland--a realized dream--\n     a bright beacon of light in a world desperate for hope.\n       And yet we are still afraid--but it is a different fear. \n     Those who were fortunate enough not to have experienced the \n     Holocaust do not and cannot understand how we survivors feel \n     when we see how our tragic past is remembered by others. We \n     are deeply hurt when we see the way the Holocaust is \n     portrayed as only dead bodies--piles and piles of corpses and \n     mass graves. We survivors shudder, for in a way we fear that \n     Hitler succeeded because the world is not aware of the \n     vibrant Jewish life that was before the Holocaust--or of the \n     cultural heritage of 1,000 years of Jewish history in Europe. \n     It does not hear the songs of the shtetl, the theme of \n     Warsaw, the Yeshivot of Vilna, the Hasidim of Belz, or the \n     poets of Lodz and Krakow.\n       All it recognizes is death. Yet we remember the life that \n     was destroyed--the world that is no longer. The world of \n     Yiddishkeit and Menchlichkeit.\n       We are still asking the questions--how did it happen? Who \n     failed? What failed? But these questions should not distract \n     our attention from the real murderers--the Germans and their \n     collaborators--or from the profound failure of world leaders \n     and church leaders. Their silence has yet to be judged by \n     history.\n       And we think not only of the past but also of the future. \n     To you--our children assembled here, we would like to entrust \n     our memories--as part of our last will and testament. You are \n     the last generation to be blessed with the memories of the \n     survivors--the living witnesses to the kingdom of night. This \n     is your heritage, which we are transmitting to you. You must \n     know your roots. You must remember that your very birth was \n     testimony of the triumph of hope over despair--of dreams over \n     pain. You are our response to those who tried to destroy us.\n       We also want to protect the truth from innocent and well-\n     meaning people who speak only of the good--of the rays of \n     hope and goodness--the righteous Gentiles whose memories we \n     cherish with gratitude. But where was the reality? For every \n     righteous person, there were thousands who collaborated or \n     who shared the enemy's desire to murder the Jews or who, at \n     best, stood idly by and did nothing.\n       Let us remember the Holocaust as it was. It was painful. It \n     was bitter. It was ugly. It was inhuman. But it was real. Let \n     us not permit it to be diluted or vulgarized. Let us not \n     diminish its meaning by treating every event in human \n     history--every instance of human suffering or discrimination \n     as a Holocaust.\n       We survivors know that time is growing short, we are \n     getting older and we need each other more than ever before, \n     and we need you--our children and our fellow Jews to continue \n     our legacy.\n\n  Remarks of Avroham Burg, Director General of the Jewish Agency for \n                                 Israel\n\n       Shalom Moishe, my dead elder brother.\n       A year has passed, and once again we are gathered to honor \n     your memory. Each year, we promise you that we will never \n     forget. We will not forget you and all our brothers and \n     sisters who will forever remain the young boys and girls you \n     were on the day of your deaths.\n       You really haven't changed. You are still so much like the \n     old, faded picture hanging on the wall at home. It was hand \n     painted with life-like colors.\n       In our memories, you are still smiling as if the world \n     wasn't such a hard place to live in. It's as if you really \n     haven't noticed that another year has gone by. The sun is \n     hotter, and the cold is even colder. My legs are weaker, and \n     my eyes are filled with more tears. And strangely, as more \n     time passes, and we grow further apart we grow closer \n     together. Because each year, fewer survivors remain. They \n     leave this world, and we remain here with the heavy burden of \n     memory. And, as we eulogize you, we also eulogize lost \n     childhood and history that--like you--we can never ever bring \n     back.\n       Six million brothers died. Sisters, children, parents and \n     their loved ones. How many of you are there really? Another \n     entire State of Israel. Another community the size of the \n     American Jewish community. Another fifteen communities of \n     Latin American Jews? So many boys, girls and grandchildren \n     that will never be born.\n       Our mourning will never cease. Never, because you--the \n     fallen--never will have children. There were those who never \n     had children because they were too young, and those who had \n     children whose spirits never ran free, and those who had \n     children who never had the chance to fulfill their dreams.\n       As time passes, we miss you more than ever. We miss the \n     children that you never had. So many unborn children. For \n     those of you, the childless generation, we are here for you, \n     standing by your side, here and now.\n       And the cycle of our mourning will never be completed. Our \n     continuous grieving is the grieving of a people that is \n     missing so many of its members.\n       And we--the living--each year, we bring children into the \n     world. So many of them bear your name, Moishe, to honor the \n     dead, and we hope that they will experience all the things we \n     wanted for you but you never had.\n       Our children are continuing in your footsteps, from the \n     point at which your life was cut off.\n       They will never know you, and we silently pray:\n       That they will carry your name but please God, that they \n     will know a different fate. That they will live, and know \n     goodness and peace. Each year we promise our children the \n     things that our mothers promised us:\n       Son, when you are all grown up, there won't be violence in \n     the world. When you grow up, there will be peace in our \n     world. And we also promise our children something that we may \n     not accomplish.\n       Will our grandchildren enjoy the redemption on behalf of \n     our dead loved ones?\n       I really don't know what to say to you. You who come here \n     every year. You who come here to unite with the memory of \n     those no longer with us. We have come here because of the \n     togetherness, and the awesome atmosphere of condolence. We \n     want to be with you today, in this gathering of mourners. It \n     is here, and in every place that we take our revenge.\n       On that painful and horrifying day, at the moment before \n     the flames engulfed you, we cried out--revenge!\n       Oh God of Vengeance--Hashen--appear!\n       And, as time passed, something deep inside of us cried out \n     to us, and we pray to God, but differently:\n       Oh God, full of mercy--Father of Compassion!\n       Because Jewish revenge is not taken by shedding blood.\n       We do not want to resemble our killers when we take our \n     revenge. Our revenge is different.\n       We remember, and never forget. We remember the murderers, \n     and know that we can never forget that in every man there is \n     an evil inclination. We remember the march of the dead, and \n     we march for the living.\n       We remember the glorious legacy of communities that were \n     ruthlessly executed.\n       And we swear that our grandchildren and great-grandchildren \n     will never, ever forget you, Moishe.\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\n       The world, it seems, wants us to accept that your souls and \n     the worldly goods you worked for were taken away from us \n     forever. Your souls are protected by God, and your spirit \n     rests in the next world. But we will have your goods \n     returned. Because justice was not fully served on the day of \n     surrender in 1945.\n       We have not forgotten the despondency of the final moments. \n     And we have demands from and messages to the once Nazi-\n     occupied European countries, and the neutral nations:\n       You will not benefit from the deposits or the possessions \n     of those who were murdered. We are all too aware of the \n     ``dormant'' accounts.\n       There are no dormant accounts. And there are no dormant \n     memories.\n       Because each individual is a messenger, and there is no man \n     who does not have a mission.\n       And, it is not our mission because of the individual or for \n     the individual. Rather, this is the mission of the individual \n     on behalf of his people.\n       One individual comes to the world to teach, and another to \n     learn. One person comes into the world to cry, and the other \n     to console. One person is born to live, and yet you were born \n     and then died so soon. Was this your mission? You died so \n     that we could live. And we were born to remember.\n       Today, we are your messengers, Messengers who must remember \n     to live by your commandments. To have the ultimate Jewish \n     revenge--the revenge of peace, as in the Jewish prayers that \n     we say three times per day:\n       Bring upon us peace and goodness and a blessed life, grace \n     and kindness, upon us and the entire House of Israel, amen. \n     Bless us our Father, each of us as one in the glorious light \n     of your powers, because the light of your powers gave us the \n     Torah and the love of kindness, and the love of charity and \n     blessings and mercy and life and peace.\n       And it would please you to bless us, and to bless your \n     entire House of Israel at every moment and at every hour and \n     the strength of your peace be upon us. Blessed art thou, our \n     Lord who blesses his people of Israel in peace.\n       Amen. May their memories be a blessing.\n\nWelcoming Remarks by Benjamin Meed, Chairman, Days of Remembrance, U.S. \n                       Holocaust Memorial Council\n\n       Members of the Diplomatic Corps, distinguished Members of \n     Congress, Honorable members of the Holocaust Memorial \n     Council, Fellow Survivors, Dear Friends.\n       When Congress created the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Council in 1980, there were only a few Yom Hashoah \n     observances held in communities of Holocaust survivors living \n     in this country. You, the Members of Congress, entrusted us, \n     the members of the Council, with the responsibility of \n     teaching American citizens about the Holocaust. We have \n     complied with your mandate by building the Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum, which most of you have visited, and by leading the \n     nation in annual civic commemorations, known as the Days of \n     Remembrance. I am privileged to tell you that now, during \n     this week of Holocaust Remembrance, more than a million \n     people from all the states of our great Union will come \n     together in Memory. We are joined by Governors, Mayors and \n     community leaders as well as professors, teachers and \n     schoolchildren.\n       Earlier today, the entire nation of the State of Israel \n     stopped and stood silent in Remembrance. We are together in \n     dedication to Memory and aspiration for Peace.\n       Over the past fifteen years that we have gathered to \n     commemorate in this Rotunda, we have observed an \n     anniversary--the fiftieth year of a milestone event: the \n     Night of Broken Glass, the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the \n     encounter between American soldiers and Holocaust survivors.\n       This year we confront the anniversary of the aftermath of \n     the Holocaust: what happened as we survivors attempted to \n     rebuild our lives. This was not an easy thing to do. It was \n     years before we could ask a policeman for directions. Why? \n     Because he was wearing a uniform. For a long time, it took \n     great courage just to answer a knock on the front door.\n       It is true that we looked to the future in hope, but the \n     shadows of the past remained. And so we dedicated our lives \n     to Remembrance--remembrance of all those for whom the future \n     had been destroyed by the Shoah.\n       Rebuilding became a central concern for the world--\n     rebuilding a Europe devastated by war; rebuilding the \n     shattered image of humanity in a world of Auschwitz, Belzec \n     and Treblinka. America understood the necessity of \n     encouraging the European nations to work together for \n     economic recovery. Thus the Marshall Plan was implemented, \n     and the groundwork for the Europe of today was laid.\n       The Allied leaders also realized that to build a sound \n     future, there had to be an accounting for crimes so great as \n     to be unparalleled in recorded history.\n       Nuremberg, the city where Nazi party pageants had been \n     held, the place where the Nuremberg Laws were promulgated and \n     the German legal system became an accomplice to mass murder, \n     was chosen as the site for the first, joint International \n     Military Tribunal.\n       In its charter, three forms of crimes were specified. Two \n     of them were ancient, but one was unprecedented. Crimes \n     against the peace and war crimes were familiar terms to all \n     of us, but Crimes Against Humanity was a new category. It \n     described mass murder and extermination, enslavement and \n     deportation based on racial, religious, or political \n     affiliation.\n       Through the proceedings of the Nuremberg Trials, we came to \n     know the perpetrators. Documents that the killers had so \n     carefully created were gathered and studied. In the defense \n     testimony of accused doctors, judges and industrial leaders \n     as well as military generals, Einsatzgruppen commanders, and \n     concentration camp commandants, the world learned ``how the \n     crimes were committed.'' We also learned that tens of \n     thousands of ordinary Germans from all walks of life had \n     willingly participated in the annihilation process. \n     Ironically, those on trial pled not guilty to the charges, \n     they did not claim innocence. Rather, they attempted to \n     shift the burden of responsibility to those of higher \n     rank.\n       Was justice achieved? Certainly not! For what meaning can \n     justice have in a world of Majdanek, Chelmno and Sobibor? \n     What punishment is appropriate for the crimes?\n       Still, the attempt to speak of justice was important. It \n     was a way of setting limits, of saying there are crimes so \n     evil and so enormous that civilization itself is on trial. \n     For such crimes, there must be punishment.\n       For many years at hundreds of commemorations around the \n     world, we have pleaded Zachor--Remember. Remember the \n     children of Teresienstadt. Remember the fighters of Warsaw. \n     Remember the poets of Vilna. Remember all of our lost loved \n     ones.\n       Today, let us also not forget the killers. Let us not \n     forget their evil and their infamy. Let us not forget them \n     because they express what happens to the power of government \n     and the majesty of legal systems that become detached from \n     moral values and humane goals. The same powers that heal and \n     help can also humiliate and decimate. There is a difference; \n     there must be a difference: and you and I must make sure that \n     we make a difference.\n       With these words, here in this great Hall of democracy, let \n     us recommit ourselves to the principles of justice and \n     liberty for all--and to Remembrance--now and forever.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4257-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4259-S4260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO WORK DAY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today on Take Our Daughters \nto Work Day, to encourage young women and girls across America to set \ntheir sights high, and to reach for their dreams.\n  When I was a young girl, most women worked in the home. Girls were \nnot frequently asked, ``What do you want to be when you grow up?'' Our \noptions appeared limited, and we had far fewer women role models \ntelling us, ``If you work hard, you can be whatever you put your mind \nto.'' Some women broke the gender barrier, and served as role models \nfor a whole generation of young women and girls. One such woman was \nMargaret Chase Smith, whose service in this body inspired many girls \nand young women in Maine and across the Nation to seek a career in \npolitics.\n  Since my childhood, the composition of the work force has changed \ndramatically, and job opportunities have significantly increased for \nyoung women and girls. Today, women comprise 46 percent of the paid \nlabor force, and by the year 2000, two out of three new entrants into \nthe labor force will be women.\n  Despite these gains, studies show that during adolescence girls often \nreceive less attention in school and suffer from lower expectations \nthan do boys. They also set their future sights lower than their male \ncounterparts. This is reflected in a 1994 New York Times/CBS poll, \nwhich found that over one-third of girls surveyed believed that there \nare more advantages to being a man than a women. For many girls, low \nself-esteem can lead them to lose confidence in their abilities, which \nmay prevent them from achieving their fullest potential later in life. \nFor others, this low self-esteem can lead to teen pregnancy, drug use \nand other problems which threaten women's professional and economic \nopportunity, not to mention their health and social welfare.\n  In this day and age, we cannot accept reduced opportunities for girls \nand women from either an equity standpoint or an economic one. Today, \nwomen are equally responsible for the financial well-being of their \nfamilies. Many American families find two incomes a necessity if they \nwish to thrive, and others require two incomes simply to stay above \npoverty. So it is not just their own futures that are at stake, but the \nfuture of their children and their children's children.\n  We need to do far more to challenge our daughters' notions of women's \nwork. While most school-age girls plan to work, they do not plan for \ncareers that could sustain themselves and\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\ntheir families. Women and girls continue to be enrolled in education \nand training programs that prepare them for low-wage jobs in \ntraditionally female occupations. Women remain significantly \nunderrepresented in careers requiring math and science skills--women \ncomprise only 11 percent of today's technical workforce, and only 17 \npercent of all doctors are women. Nearly 75 percent of tomorrow's jobs \nwill require the use of computers, but girls comprise less than one-\nthird of students enrolled in computer courses. And a study by the \nGlass Ceiling Commission found that women occupy only 5 percent of \nsenior-level management of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 \nservice companies. As leaders and as parents, we must do our best to \nensure that American girls are prepared to step into those high wage \njobs and management positions that command higher salaries in the \nworkforce.\n  I am extremely pleased to participate on the steering committee for \nTake Our Daughters to Work Day, organized by the Maine's Women's \nDevelopment Institute, in my home State. Girls in Maine and across the \nNation need to see first-hand that they have a range of life options. \nThey need that extra support to boost their confidence and believe in \nthemselves and their potential. They need to be encouraged to reach out \nand use their creative spirit. It is our responsibility to set high \nstandards and provide them with the experiences and role models that \nwill inspire them to be the leaders of the future.\n  Today, millions of parents across the Nation are taking their \ndaughters to work. These parents perform a great service by exposing \ntheir daughters to new and exciting experiences. They are not only \nexpanding their horizons and helping them to explore career \nopportunities, but teaching them important lessons about goal setting \nas well. Take Our Daughters to Work Day is of great importance to girls \nacross the Nation, and to the women of tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4259-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THREE OF DELAWARE'S FINEST CITIZENS--THE ALLEN BROTHERS: \n                     CHARLES, JR., WARREN, AND JACK\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to three \nbrothers who are pioneers in Delmarva's flourishing poultry business. \nOver the past 50 years, Charles C. Allen, Jr.; Warren L. Allen; and \nJohn R. ``Jack'' Allen, have built what was once a small, mom and pop \nfamily business, into one of our Nation's top poultry companies, Allen \nFamily Foods Inc. Their contributions to the industry and to our State \nof Delaware are as rich and diverse as the history of the poultry \nbusiness itself, and I congratulate them on their half-century of \ndedication and achievement.\n  Their parents, C. Clarence and Nellie Allen, first got into the \npoultry business in 1919, incubating about 250 chicks. Things got off \nto a bit of a shaky start for the Allens. On one occasion Nellie \nbanished Clarence to the garage after one of his chicken incubation \nexperiments nearly burned their house down. But the Allens persisted \nand 4 years later in 1923, the family expanded the operation by \npurchasing a 38-acre farm on the outskirts of Seaford, DE. This 100-\nyear-old farmhouse became one of the first commercial chicken houses on \nthe Delmarva peninsula and remains the company's headquarters.\n  Charles Jr., Warren, and Jack continued the family tradition and \nexpanded this once-modest enterprise vigorously through the years. \nToday, Allen's Family Foods is a privately held, multimillion dollar, \nintegrated poultry company. Allen's processed chicken is sold in stores \nfrom Virginia to Massachusetts. Charles C. handles the farming side of \nthe business; Warren is vice president in charge of finance; and Jack \nis secretary-treasurer. The elder Allens have in turn brought their \nthree sons: Charles C. Allen III; John R. Allen, Jr.; and Warren L. \n``Wren'' Allen Jr., into the business, ensuring that Allen's Family \nFoods will be operating in Delaware well into the next century.\n  In addition to this commercial success, the Allen family has made \ntremendous contributions to their community. Warren Allen served three \n2-year terms as the Delaware State Representative for the 38th \ndistrict, in addition to service as the chairman of the advisory \ncouncil of the Delaware Home and Hospital for the Chronically Ill in \nSmyrna, and on the board of trustees of the Delaware State Hospital. \nCharles Allen was campaign manager for the hospital's expansion \nfundraising drive. Their generosity also led to the creation of the \nAllen Little League baseball field at Williams Pond. For their \nlifetimes of service, the Delmarva Poultry Industry recently honored \nCharles, Jr., Warren, and Jack as the 1995 distinguished citizens; the \nfirst time in history that this award has been shared by three members \nof one family. I can think of no more deserving individuals and I again \nextend my congratulations to the Allen family.\n  The story of Allen's Family Foods encompasses all that is just and \ngood in America: Ingenuity, perseverance, dedication, and compassion \nfor our fellow citizens. Simply put, Delaware is a better place because \nof the Allen Family. Again, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to my \nfriends Charles, Jr., Warren, and Jack, and wish them many more years \nof health, happiness, and prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4260-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HUMANITARIAN AID TO LEBANON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment in the aid package for Lebanon which was recently \nannounced by the Clinton administration. The aid package consisted of a \nmere $1 million to fulfill the International Committee for the Red \nCross request, an additional $25,000 from USAID through the U.S. \nEmbassy in Beirut, and 50,000 pounds of U.S. military medical supplies \nand equipment.\n  Due to the most recent violence in Lebanon, some 400,000 refugees \nhave been displaced. There is an extreme amount of pressure upon the \ncountry's infrastructure, particularly in Beirut where there is very \nlittle electricity. In southern Lebanon it has been reported that the \nwater supply has been cut off to dozens of villages. The Lebanese \npeople have suffered greatly over the last two decades, but they are \nparticularly in need of urgent assistance. The United States has always \nviewed Lebanon as a good friend and ally, and thus the United States \nshould make a greater commitment of resources.\n  Considering the President's past emergency aid packages of $59 \nmillion for Rwandan and Burundi refugees and $11 million for Cuban and \nHaitian refugees, the Clinton administration efforts with respect to \nLebanon is clearly and grossly insufficient. For approximately the same \namount of refugees in Russia, this administration donated 1.2 million \npounds of medical supplies and equipment. This inequity with respect to \nLebanon is clearly unfair.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Clinton administration to immediately \nredouble its aid efforts to Lebanon. In addition, as I have done for \nthe past week, I urge the administration to utilize all of its \ndiplomatic resources to negotiate a cease fire in this region and to \nbring and end to the hostility immediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4260-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4260-S4261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING STUDENTS FROM TRUMBULL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \na group of students from Trumbull High School. This weekend, April 27-\n29, 1996, more than 1,300 students from 50 States and the District of \nColumbia will be in Washington, DC to compete in the national finals of \nthe We the People--The Citizen and the Constitution Program. I am proud \nto announce that a class from Trumbull High School will represent \nConnecticut. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the \nnational finals by winning first place at the statewide competition in \nConnecticut.\n  The distinguished members of the team representing Connecticut are: \nDavid Abbate, Stephen Britton, Meredith Bucci, William Dunn, Brian \nEmery, Michael Felberbaum, Kristina Gospic, Pamela Harinstein, Bruce \nMalloy, Philip Moore, Jessica Paris, Michael Ragozzino, Douglas Rowe, \nMatthew Rowland, Jason Saunders, John Urbanati, Richard Van Haste and \nAlison Veno.\n  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Rita Altieri, who \ndeserves a share of the credit for the success of the team. The \ndistrict coordinator\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\nJane Hammer and the State coordinator Joani Byer also contributed a \nsignificant amount of time and effort to help the team to the national \nfinals.\n  The We the People--The Citizen and the Constitution Program is the \nmost extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The 3-day national competition simulates a \ncongressional hearing in which students' oral presentations are judged \non the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their \nability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues. \nAdministered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People--\nProgram, now in its ninth academic year, has reached more than 70,400 \nteachers and 22,600,000 students nationwide at the upper elementary, \nmiddle, and high school levels. Members of Congress and their staff \nenhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with \nstudents and teachers.\n  The We the People--Program provides an excellent opportunity for \nstudents to gain an informed perspective on the significance of the \nU.S. Constitution and its place in our history and our lives. I wish \nthese students the best of luck in the national finals and look forward \nto their continued success in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4260-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WATER RESOURCE RESEARCH ACT\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate \nwill pass H.R. 1743, a bill to reauthorize the Water Resource Research \nAct, as amended by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. This is a small, but vitally important piece of legislation that \ngained unanimous support in the House of Representatives, as well as \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee here in the Senate. I want \nto thank Senator Kempthorne and Senator Reid, along with Chairman \nChafee and Senator Baucus for working with me to ensure the swift \npassage of this legislation. Their hard work, and that of their staffs, \nis greatly appreciated.\n  H.R. 1743 extends the authorization for the water resources research \ninstitutes program through the year 2000. The water resources research \ninstitutes program is a vital Federal/State water research, education \nand information transfer partnership. This program supports a network \nof institutes at the land grant colleges in each of the 50 States, 3 \ntrust territories and the District of Columbia. These institutes are \nthe primary link between the academic community, the water-related \npersonnel of the Federal and State government, and the private sector. \nThe institutes provide a mechanism to promote State, regional and \nnational coordination of water resources research and training, as well \nas information transfer. This is a very productive program. In fiscal \nyear 1995, the Federal appropriation for the water institutes--under $5 \nmillion--leveraged approximately $65 million from State, private and \nother sources to support the institutes research and training \nactivities.\n  Federal regulations and programs designed to solve water problems \nhave their primary impact at the State and local level. State and local \ngovernments are in a far better position to tailor solutions to local \nwater problems than the Federal Government. Programs such as the water \nresources research institutes are an efficient and effective way for \nthe Federal Government to assist States to conduct research and solve \nproblems in the water resources field. In administering the State water \nresources research institute program, the Interior Department and the \nGeological Survey distribute funds equally among all the institutes. \nThe State institutes then award research funds through a competitive, \npeer review process. Institutes have advisory panels comprised of \nlocal, State, and Federal water officials, representatives from water \nuser groups and other interested parties, which develop yearly research \npriorities for their States and review the allocation of funds among \nvarious competing projects. This is the true strength of this program. \nIndividual State institutes are able to focus grants on research that \naddresses the most pressing water problems in that State. There have \nbeen efforts made to strengthen the competition for funding between the \nindividual water institutes. I have serious concerns about that. We \nmust fund this program at a level that allows us to maintain the \nnetwork of institutes in every State. In addition, we must preserve the \nrole of the advisory panels in each State, continuing to allow each \nState to determine the research agenda for themselves. I would hope the \nDepartment of Interior would not impose new restrictions on State water \nresources research programs in the future.\n  In addition to the core program, I am pleased the bill before us \ncontains an authorization for a second program focused on regional \nissues. I amended the House bill to include this important program, \nwhich will allow the institutes to conduct research of regional, \ninterstate issues. Increasingly the water issues we're asking States to \ndeal with are of a regional, interjurisdictional nature. The bill as \namended in committee reauthorizes the section 104(g) program to support \nthis needed interdisciplinary research and analysis necessary for \nassessing regional and interstate water resource problems.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill takes a realistic look at future \nfunding. This bill funds the institute programs at a level more in line \nwith historical appropriations, reducing the current authorization by \nmore than 40 percent below the current authorized level.\n  This is a good bill, a good program, and I'm pleased the Senate is \nmoving ahead with passage today. I'm hopeful the House will agree to \nour changes quickly and we can get this bill signed into law without \ndelay. Thanks again to the leadership of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee for working with me on this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4261-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4261-S4262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMEMORATING THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHERNOBYL TRAGEDY\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to solemnly commemorate \nthe tenth anniversary of the worst nuclear accident since the dawn of \nthe nuclear age.\n  On April 26, 1986, a flawed structural design and operator error \ncaused a sudden power surge within reactor number four at the V.I. \nLenin atomic power plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine.\n  The resulting chemical explosion vaporized nuclear fuel, melted the \nreactor's substandard shell and released into the atmosphere a \ngigantic, 180-ton cloud of deadly radioactive iodine, cesium and other \nlethal isotopes--containing 200 times the amount of radioactive \nmaterial emitted during the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n  Within a 4-month period, 31 power plant employees and cleanup workers \ndied of acute radiation poisoning. Tens of thousands of other Ukrainian \nand Belarusian men, women and children suffered radiation sickness. \nInvisible fallout--detected as far away as California--contaminated \nforever more than 10 million acres of nearby forests and farmland, \npermanently poisoning the local food chain.\n  When the magnitude and the severity of the catastrophe became clear, \nclose to 200,000 people were hastily and permanently evacuated from the \nrich, fertile land which was their home for generations. The Chernobyl \narea--once lush with old-growth forests rich in mushrooms, berries and \nother medicinal herbs--is now a 30 kilometer dead zone.\n  Human habitation is strictly forbidden.\n  A decaying, 24-story concrete tomb known as the sarcophagus now \nencases the destroyed reactor, serving as a grim reminder of this dark \npage in human history.\n  A decade later, those affected continue to struggle with the \nlingering health effects. The incidence of adolescent thyroid cancer \nthroughout northern Ukraine and nearby Belarus is an astounding 200 \npercent higher than average, due in part to the consumption of poisoned \nmilk.\n  Already 800 children have contracted the disease, and experts say \nthat as many as 5,000 will develop it.\n  The incidence of radiation-related birth defects in the region has \ndoubled. A team of British and Russian scientists recently concluded \nthat genetic DNA mutations caused by radiation poisoning are being \npassed along to a generation of children who did not even exist at the \ntime of the accident.\n  Whether these malformations will affect the future health of these \nchildren is a mystery.\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\n  Many surviving Chernobyl victims also suffer from a myriad of \npsychological disorders, more difficult to identify and treat but every \nbit as harmful as the physiological effects of radiation.\n  Sadly, a recent study comparing mortality rates before and after the \ndisaster places the total number of fatalities at roughly 32,000.\n  Despite these disturbing findings, we really know very little.\n  Information on radiation exposure is incomplete and unreliable, and \nmany of those affected have moved or relocated hampering study efforts. \nOthers may suffer from yet-to-be diagnosed diseases caused by prolonged \nexposure to unsafe levels of background radiation.\n  It is unlikely that we will ever know the true scope of this tragedy.\n  Though two of Chernobyl's four nuclear units remain operational, I am \npleased that President Clinton and Ukrainian President Lenoid Kuchma \nagreed to an accord earlier this year to close the facility completely \nby the year 2000.\n  I am also pleased that the United States is committed to improving \ninternational nuclear reactor safety.\n  I am hopeful that more can be done for the afflicted region, and was \nheartened by the serious dialog at last week's G-7 nuclear safety \nsummit in Moscow.\n  These are all important steps toward putting this devastating tragedy \nbehind the Ukrainian people.\n  I also want to pay tribute to the compassion of the Ukrainian-\nAmericans who have remained steadfast in their support for Chernobyl's \nvictims.\n  Mr. President, the legacy of the Chernobyl disaster extends beyond \nnationalistic and ethnic boundaries and reaches all humanity.\n  Indeed, fallout from the accident affected 5 million people and set \noff monitors throughout the Northern Hemisphere.\n  Radiation knows no borders.\n  Here in the United States, I am comforted by the knowledge that \nbecause of our superior design and safety standards a Chernobyl-type \nevent is, for all practicable purposes, an impossibility.\n  The Chernobyl facility never would have been permitted to open under \nour regulations.\n  Nonetheless, we can never be too vigilant in our efforts to ensure \nthat nuclear power plants are operated in the safest possible manner.\n  As my colleagues in this body know, I have long believed that there \nexists an inherent conflict of interest in our nuclear regulatory \nsystem that requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to sit in \njudgment of itself.\n  NRC's two functions--providing day-to-day oversight and investigating \nserious events--are incompatible in my view.\n  For this reason, I have asked the General Accounting Office to look \ninto the extent to which this conflict is responsible for events and \naccidents at nuclear plants.\n  I also propose that we remove the investigatory functions from the \nNRC, and give these functions to an impartial, truly independent \nnuclear safety board.\n  This watchdog would have broad authority to look into all \ncircumstances surrounding any accident and to lay blame where it \nrightfully belongs--whether it is the utility, the reactor \nmanufacturer, or the NRC.\n  By removing the structural conflict which currently exists within the \nNRC, it is my hope that we can regain the public's confidence and \nprovide the utmost degree of safety to all Americans.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we strive to restore \nneeded objectivity to the oversight process.\n  Mr. President, the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster is more \nthan just a reminder of the potential cost of nuclear energy.\n  It is a call to us, our Nation's elective representatives, to work \ntogether to ensure the safe operation of nuclear power, both \ndomestically and internationally, for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Let us not watch this day pass without thoroughly and carefully \nexamining our current nuclear regulatory system. All of humanity is \ndepending on us. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4261-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AUTHORIZATION FOR THE USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 252 \nsubmitted earlier today by Senators Pressler and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 252) congratulating the Sioux Falls \n     Skyforce, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on winning the 1996 \n     Continental Basketball Association Championship.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, due to a last second shot at the buzzer, \nSouth Dakota is home to the newest champions of professional \nbasketball. Last night, the Sioux Falls Skyforce were crowned Champions \nof the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). The Skyforce \ndramatically defeated the Fort Wayne (Indiana) Fury, 118-117, after \novercoming a 16-point deficit. That is my kind of deficit reduction.\n  In honor of this event, I am introducing a Senate resolution \ncongratulating the Skyforce, and their fans, for this victory. I am \npleased that Senator Daschle has also agreed to cosponsor the measure.\n  At this time, I want to personally extend my congratulations to the \nowners of the Skyforce, Greg Heineman, Robert J. Correa, and Roger \nLarson, General Manager Tommy Smith, and the Skyforce staff, for \nguiding the Skyforce to its first CBA Championship in the team's 7-year \nhistory. I also congratulate Head Coach Morris ``Mo'' McHone, Assistant \nCoach Paul Woolpert, and the talented Skyforce players, especially \nPlayoff MVP Henry James. Their hard work, sweat, and determination \nreally paid off when it counted. The Skyforce won the championship \nconvincingly, beating Fort Wayne four games to one.\n  Most of all, I congratulate the people of Sioux Falls and the \nsurrounding area. They have enthusiastically embraced the Skyforce and \nprovided loyal support over the years. The success of the Skyforce, and \nthe CBA as a league, prove that professional basketball can survive and \nprosper in smaller cities across the Nation. I have been to many \nSkyforce games. Their games are always very fun and exciting. It is \nfamily-orientated entertainment at its best.\n  Sioux Falls is rapidly becoming a sports mecca in the Midwest. The \ncity's current professional baseball team, the Sioux Falls Canaries, \nhave been playing in the northern league since 1993. But the city has \nbeen home to a number of professional baseball teams since the \nbeginning of the century. Professional teams from other sports would do \nwell to take note of the city's enthusiasm for sports and consider \nmoving to Sioux Falls.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me state that I was thrilled to learn of \nthe Skyforce victory for personal reasons. Before the final series \nbegan for the CBA Championship, I made a small wager with the Senator \nfrom Indiana, Senator Coats. I gambled 12 pounds of South Dakota's \nfinest steak, while my colleague risked 12 gallons of Edy's Grand Ice \nCream, made in Fort Wayne. This afternoon, my good friend from Indiana \ngraciously paid off. I will gladly take a scoop or two, but I will be \nsharing the fruits of this victory with several children's charities in \nSioux Falls.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that a roster of the Skyforce players \nand staff, along with a news article about the Skyforce victory, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n                      1995-96 Sioux Falls Skyforce\n\n\n                                PLAYERS\n\n       Stevin Smith, Reggie Fox, Trevor Wilson, Henry James, Corey \n     Beck, Carlton McKinney, Emmett Hall, Tony Massop, Rich King, \n     Devin Gray, Mike Williams.\n\n\n                                COACHES\n\n       Morris ``Mo'' McHone, Paul Woolpert.\n\n\n                                 OWNERS\n\n       Greg Heineman, Robert J.

And Sioux Falls has something to scream about.\n       Gray wanted to end the CBA Finals on Wednesday night so he \n     could catch tonight's first-round game in Indianapolis \n     between the Pacers and Atlanta Hawks. He got front-row \n     tickets from his friend Dale Davis, who plays for Indiana.\n       The rookie forward made it happen by swishing a leaning 7-\n     footer at the buzzer, giving the Skyforce a 118-117 Game 5 \n     win over the Fort Wayne Fury before 4,377 at the Allen County \n     War Memorial Coliseum.\n       Gray's drive from the right side sealed the fifth \n     consecutive road victory for Sioux Falls, which took the \n     best-of-seven series 4-1.\n       And after seven years of searching for greatness, this \n     ambitious franchise has finally--and emphatically--reached \n     the top.\n       ``If I had to draw the play up, I'd do it the same way,'' a \n     beaming Gray said as his teammates eagerly embraced the Jay \n     Ramsdell Trophy with help from owners, wives, girlfriends and \n     fans.\n       ``I was looking to get the rock and go to the hole, and I \n     figured I'd either make it or get fouled. They didn't call \n     the foul, so I'm glad it went in. I was laying on the court \n     when it did.''\n       Playoff MVP Henry James led Sioux Falls (42-26) with 26 \n     points, while Trevor Wilson added 24 and Reggie Fox had 20 \n     behind four 3-pointers.\n       James was hugged by his mother, Betty, after winning his \n     second CBA title before 75 family members and friends in his \n     hometown.\n       And he professed faith in the timely touch of Gray.\n       ``I was used as a decoy, and I knew his shot was going \n     in,'' said James, donning a freshly furnished Skyforce \n     championship cap and T-shirt.\n       ``He was able to lower his shoulder moving along the \n     baseline, and you can't let him do that. He's too strong. \n     We've all seen him make that shot a million times.''\n       But Fort Wayne--which got 29 points from Jaren Jackson and \n     Carl Thomas--refused to end its surprisingly successful \n     season without an admirable and fitting fight.\n       The Fury (32-38) led by as many as 15 points in the third \n     quarter and nearly forced Game 6 in Sioux Falls with a heroic \n     shot of its own.\n       Thomas, who struggled mightly in the first four games, \n     gently coaxed in a driving one-hander with 2.9 seconds left \n     to give his team a 117-116 lead that delighted the devoted \n     crowd.\n       But during the ensuing timeout, Skyforce coach Mo McHone \n     figured that Fort Wayne would be mainly concerned about the \n     Skyforce/See 5C perimeter potency of James and Fox.\n       Having seen Gray perform with toughness and maturity \n     throughout the playoffs, he called upon his seventh-round \n     draft pick out of Clemson, who finished with 17 points.\n       Gray had missed two crucial free throws with 35 seconds \n     left, but he had also preceded Thomas' basket with a strong \n     drive that put Sioux Falls briefly ahead by one.\n       ``Devin's been on five for us, and Trevor set him up with a \n     great (inbounds) pass,'' said McHone, who is the first coach \n     to claim consecutive CBA titles since Bill Musselman won four \n     in a row (1985-88).\n       ``We've been winning games like this, and this was such a \n     great way to end it. We just fought hard all night, because \n     we had to. They pretty much outplayed us.''\n       But never was McHone worried, not with a team that has \n     frequently floored him during a magical playoff run.\n       By winning three straight to clinch the title on Fort \n     Wayne's floor, the Skyforce once again displayed a maturity \n     that stemmed from having a meaningful mission.\n       ``We were lucky and good--and we came together when it \n     counted,'' said Wilson, who added 11 rebounds and six \n     assists.\n       ``Earlier in the season, we were trying to win, but guys \n     were also worrying about NBA callups and overseas offers. \n     There was a little more selfishness at that point.\n       ``When the playoffs started, everyone realized there was \n     one common goal, and we did what we had to do.''\n       Both Wilson and Fox said they wanted to return to Sioux \n     Falls, but not for a basketball game. Only for a celebration.\n       And when the CBA's finest team crooned ``We Are The \n     Champions'' as cameras captured the moment, it seemed \n     celebrating was the only logical thing to do.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nto the resolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Con. Res. 56, \nintroduced by Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 56) recognizing the \n     10th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, and \n     supporting the closing of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Lautenberg in \noffering this legislation to remember the 10th anniversary of the \nterrible nuclear accident at Chernobyl. While 10 years have passed \nsince that tragic day, the health and economic consequence of Chernobyl \ncontinue to be borne by the Ukrainian people.\n  I recall quite well how the Chernobyl accident on April 26, 1986 \nsignaled the inhumanity of the totalitarian system of government. At \nfirst, the Soviet Government feebly attempted to deny the incident--\nwith the effect of causing further harm to those who lived in its \nvicinity. Ultimately, the full scale of the disaster became known, but \nonly after millions in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and Poland had been \nexposed to radioactive fallout.\n  That a government could be so brutal to its people is no surprise to \nthose of us who worked for many years to confront and defeat the \ntotalitarian system. That the Soviet Government could be so brutal to \nthe people of Ukraine was no surprise to a people who endured the \nforced starvation, massacres, and genocidal policies of Joseph Stalin \nin the 1930's. The radioactive wasteland around Chernobyl will, \nunfortunately, serve as a lasting and hideous monument to refute those \nwho would defend such a system, or whose historical memory has faded \nsufficiently to allow them to forget its evil.\n  Within the catastrophe at Chernobyl were sown the seeds of the \ndownfall of the Soviet system. A fiercely independent people such as \nthe Ukrainians cannot be subjected forever to such abuse. I am proud of \nthe role that I was able to fulfill in the Congress, in full support of \nPresidents Reagan and Bush, as the United States prevailed, the Soviet \nUnion collapsed, and Ukraine again became an independent state in the \nmomentous year of 1991. I was proud to sponsor legislation which called \nfor direct United States aid to the republics, rather than through \nMoscow in 1990. The goal of defeating communism and achieving \nindependence for Ukraine was not easily achieved, it was one that \nrequired the combined efforts of many nations and many people, \nincluding the Ukraine-American community, who simply refused to accept \nthat communism would prevail over the spirit of Ukrainians.\n  Democracy is prevailing in Ukraine today, but the Ukrainian people \nand Government continue to shoulder the burden of the Chernobyl \ndisaster. Just as the United States joined with the Ukrainian people to \ndefeat communism, we work in partnership to overcome the tragic \nconsequences of Chernobyl. I was pleased to support the Republican \ninitiative in Congress to provide Ukraine with $225 million in \nassistance this year, including specific assistance to nuclear safety, \nthe development of alternatives to nuclear power and to address the \nongoing health problems due to the Chernobyl disaster. I am certain \nthat working together we can bring peace, prosperity, and a better \nquality of life to the people of Ukraine. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport our resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4264-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4264-S4265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senate \nConcurent Resolution 56, which recognizes the 10th anniversary of the \nChernobyl nuclear disaster, the worst of its kind in history, and \nsupports efforts to close the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant.\n  In the early morning hours of April 26, l986, reactor number 4 at the \nChernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine exploded, releasing \nmassive amounts of radioactive substances into the atmosphere. This \nexplosion released 200 times more radioactivity than was released by \nthe atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, profoundly affecting the \nhealth of millions of people in the surrounding contaminated areas.\n  A decade after, Chernobyl's legacy continues and shows no signs of \nabating. At a hearing earlier this week of the Helsinki Commission, \nwhich I co-chair, four experts, including the Ambassadors to the United \nStates from both Ukraine and Belarus, the countries most adversely \naffected by the explosion, testified eloquently about the \nenvironmental, health, social, political, and economic consequences of \nthe Chernobyl disaster. Their testimonies only reinforced the fact that \nChernobyl's deadly fallout continues.\n  Thyroid cancers, especially among children in the contaminated areas \nin Belarus and Ukraine have risen dramatically. The rate of leukemia, \nand of birth defects, appears to be increasing.

This \nexplosion released 200 times more radioactivity than was released by \nthe atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, profoundly affecting the \nhealth of millions of people in the surrounding contaminated areas.\n  A decade after, Chernobyl's legacy continues and shows no signs of \nabating. At a hearing earlier this week of the Helsinki Commission, \nwhich I co-chair, four experts, including the Ambassadors to the United \nStates from both Ukraine and Belarus, the countries most adversely \naffected by the explosion, testified eloquently about the \nenvironmental, health, social, political, and economic consequences of \nthe Chernobyl disaster. Their testimonies only reinforced the fact that \nChernobyl's deadly fallout continues.\n  Thyroid cancers, especially among children in the contaminated areas \nin Belarus and Ukraine have risen dramatically. The rate of leukemia, \nand of birth defects, appears to be increasing. And an article in \ntoday's New York Times reports that scientists claim that they have \nfound inherited genetic damage in people exposed to the fallout. While \nthe depressing consequences to human health and the environment are \nincreasingly coming to light, we need to understand more about the \nongoing ramifications of the disaster.\n  Mr. President, Senate Concurrent Resolution 56 addresses the legacy \nof Chernobyl, recognizing the serious health and socioeconomic \nconsequences for millions of people in Ukraine, Belarus, and western \nRussia.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2024 just \nreceived from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2024) to phase out the use of the mercury in \n     batteries and provide for the efficient and cost-effective \n     collection and recycling or proper disposal of used nickel \n     cadmium batteries, small sealed lead-acid batteries, and \n     certain other batteries, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on September 19, 1995, the Senate \nunanimously passed the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery \nManagement Act, S. 619. This legislation, which I introduced on March \n24, 1995, was cosponsored by Senators Lautenberg, Faircloth, McConnell, \nLieberman, Simon, Mack, Bond, Graham, Warner, Reid, Inhofe, and Snowe. \nThe purpose of this legislation was to remove Federal barriers \ndetrimental to much-needed State and local recycling programs for \nbatteries commonly found in cordless products such as portable \ntelephones, laptop computers, tools, and toys. In addition to \nfacilitating the recycling of rechargeable batteries made out of \nnickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd), my legislation also codified the phaseout of \nthe use of mercury in batteries.\n  The House of Representatives, on April 23, passed by voice vote under \nsuspension, the House version of the battery bill, H.R. 2024. The House \nlegislation, with the exception of some enforcement-related technical \nchanges to the bill that were advocated by the Environmental Protection \nAgency, is virtually identical to the language contained in S. 619 that \nthe Senate passed 7 months ago.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues I should like to remind them of what \nthis legislation is intended to do. Most notably the legislation--\n  First, facilitates the efficient and cost effective collection and \nrecycling or proper disposal of used nickel cadmium (Ni-Cd) and certain \nother batteries by: (a) establishing a coherent national system of \nlabeling for batteries and products; (b) streamlining the regulatory \nrequirements for battery collection programs for regulated batteries; \nand (c) encouraging voluntary industry programs by eliminating barriers \nto funding the collection and recycling or proper disposal of used \nrechargeable batteries; and second, phase out the use of mercury in \nbatteries.\n  I am pleased to report that not only is H.R. 2024 supported by the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the Electronic Industries Association, the Portable \nRechargeable Battery Association, the National Electrical Manufacturers \nAssociation, the National Retail Federation, and the North American \nRetail Dealers Association, but it is also supported by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  The prompt passage of this bipartisan legislation will achieve a \nnumber of important goals. First, by establishing uniform national \nstandards to promote the recycling and reuse of rechargeable batteries, \nthis legislation provides a costeffective means to promote the reuse of \nour Nation's resources. Second, this legislation will further \nstrengthen efforts to remove these potentially toxic heavy metals from \nour Nation's landfills and incinerators. Not only will this lower the \nthreat of groundwater contamination and toxic air emissions, but it \nwill also significantly reduce the threat that these materials pose to \nthe environment. Third, this legislation represents an environmentally \nfriendly policy choice that was developed as the result of a strong \ncooperative effort between the States, environmental groups, and the \naffected industries.\n  Mr. President, passage of this legislation will not only provide a \nsignificant and positive step in removing potentially toxic heavy \nmetals from our Nation's solid waste stream, but it will also provide a \ncost-effective and sensible method of protecting the environment. If we \nadopt H.R. 2024 today, this legislation can be quickly sent to \nPresident Clinton for his signature, and we can get to work to get \nthese materials out of our solid waste stream and ensure protection of \nthe environment. I urge its immediate adoption.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support and urge the \nadoption of H.R. 2024, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery \nManagement Act. The bill is nearly identical to S. 619, legislation \nintroduced by Senator Smith, reported by the Environment\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\nCommittee and approved by the full Senate by voice vote on September \n21, 1995.\n  H.R. 2024 is an industry initiative developed to respond to the \nenvironmental threats posed by used, spent batteries. The approach is \ntwofold. First, the bill promotes the recycling of rechargeable \nbatteries through uniform labeling requirements and streamlined \nregulations for battery collection programs. Second, the bill limits \nmercury content in and phases out the use of mercury in certain \nbatteries.\n  The bill is straightforward and contains two titles. Title I would \nfacilitate the efficient recycling of nickel-cadmium rechargeable \nbatteries, small lead-acid rechargeable batteries, and rechargeable \nbatteries used in consumer products through: One, uniform battery \nlabeling requirements; two, streamlined regulatory requirements for \nbattery collection programs; and three, the elimination of barriers to \nfunding voluntary industry collection programs.\n  Title II is intended to phase out the use of mercury in batteries, \nthus reducing the threat this material poses to our air and \ngroundwater.\n  H.R. 2024 and its Senate companion S. 619 are prime examples of \nindustry's concern for the environment. The legislation is an excellent \nexample of a point that I have made many times: protection of the \nenvironment and a strong economy go hand in hand. By providing a \ncoherent national system for labeling batteries and products, requiring \nthe easy removability of batteries from consumer products, and \nstreamlining Federal regulations, the Mercury-Containing and \nRechargeable Battery Management Act will provide States, localities, \nconsumers, and industry the opportunity to join together to achieve \ngreater environmental protection without imposing burdens on the States \nor local taxpayers. In fact, the bill will generate substantial savings \nfor Federal, State, and local entities and commercial operations that \nship batteries due to the lower cost associated with the bill's \nstreamlined requirements.\n  H.R. 2024 is legislation supported by the Portable Rechargeable \nBattery Association and the National Electrical Manufacturers \nAssociation. In addition, the administration has expressed its support \nfor the bill. I am convinced that H.R. 2024 will result in greater \nprotection of our environment and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Chafee and \nSenator Smith in supporting H.R. 2024, the Mercury-Containing and \nRechargeable Battery Management Act.\n  The bill is based on the bipartisan bill that I sponsored with \nSenators Faircloth, Lieberman, Reid, and Graham during the last \nCongress.\n  This legislation is an important step in our efforts to control the \namount of toxic wastes entering the waste stream. Specifically, it \ndeals with mercury, cadmium, and lead, which are contained in some \nbattery casing. These materials pose no risk while a battery is in use. \nBut they can be a significant concern when discarded in our solid waste \nstream.\n  Cadmium, which is used in the electrodes of rechargeable nickel-\ncadmium batteries, can cause kidney and liver damage.\n  Mercury exposure can cause significant damage to the nervous system \nand kidneys. It has also been linked to decreased motor functions and \nmuscle reflexes, memory loss, headaches, and brain function disorders. \nAnd when mercury enters the aquatic environment, it can form methyl \nmercury, which is extremely toxic to both humans and wildlife.\n  Although dry cell batteries account for less than one-tenth of 1 \npercent of the 180 billion tons of garbage we generate each year, dry \ncell batteries have been significant sources of mercury, cadmium, and \nlead in our waste stream.\n  According to a New York State report, mercury batteries accounted for \n85 percent of the mercury, and rechargeable batteries accounted for 68 \npercent of the cadmium, in New York's solid waste.\n  In landfills, dry cell batteries can break down to release their \ntoxic contents and contaminate our waters. In incinerators, the \ncombustion of dry cell batteries containing toxic metals leads to \nelevated toxic air emissions, and has increased the concentrations of \ntoxic metals in the resulting fly and bottom ash.\n  This bill, by limiting the amount of toxics used in primary batteries \nand creating a recycling program for rechargeable nickel cadmium, will \nremove a significant source of toxics from our landfills.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be deemed read \nfor the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 2024) was deemed read for the third time, and \npassed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/25/senate-section/article/S4265-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AUTHORITY TO SIGN DULY ENROLLED BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
