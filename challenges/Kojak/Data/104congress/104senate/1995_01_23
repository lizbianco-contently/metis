Mr. President, I rise today to issue a warning to those \nin Congress who are suggesting we eliminate or deeply slash the Federal \nfarm programs.\n  These programs have given American consumers the lowest price and \nhighest quality food in the world. These programs have helped make \nAmerica's farmers preeminent among the world's food producers. They \nhave helped agriculture produce a $17 billion surplus in trade, one of \nthe largest of any American industry. These programs are the foundation \nof a $950 billion industry employing over 23 million Americans that \ndelivers food and fiber to American families.\n  To those who would kill our farm programs, I say this amounts to \nunilateral disarmament in the battle for world agricultural markets. It \nis an unwise dismantling of our successful national food policy. Our \nagriculture programs are the foundation on which much of our ability to \nmeet international competition is based. They are also the foundation \nfor our national food policy, which has helped us become the most \nrichly abundant nation in the world. No one would have suggested we do \naway with our missile defenses during the cold war. Yet some now \nsuggest we do away with the farm programs that work for millions of \nAmericans in the food industry and for all American consumers.\n  Let me just explain very clearly why U.S. farm policy is right for \nAmerica. First, our agriculture policy is vital for preserving our \ninternational competitiveness. Second, agriculture is a fundamentally \nunique type of business. Third, Federal farm programs are crucial for \nAmerican consumers.\n  Despite these compelling arguments, some people assume farm programs \nare an appropriate place to slash and even eliminate America's \ncommitment to our most basic industry. Why do they assume this? Mr. \nPresident, I believe it is complacency. We have been so well \n[[Page S1294]] fed and blessed with food security for so long that we \nhave forgotten why we created the system.\n  I am here to remind America that the farm programs are part of an \nextraordinarily successful strategy to bring ample, affordable food to \nconsumers and help us compete in a tough international fight for \nmarkets. Yet there remains a gap between our Federal agricultural \npolicy and an appreciation for the food on our tables.\n  Complacency has allowed critics to create myths about agriculture. \nMyth 1 is that farm programs are not necessary in the world economy. \nMyth 2 is that agriculture is like every other type of business. Myth 3 \nis that consumers will benefit from the elimination of farm programs.\n  I am here today to dispel those myths. I say to those who are \npointing their finger at agriculture, they should think twice. They are \nsuggesting a reversal of the policy that has made our Nation the world \nleader in agriculture. They are seeking to dismantle the policy that \nhas provided American consumers with the highest quality, lowest priced \nfood in the world. They are jeopardizing an American industry that is \nthe envy of every other country in the world. They must explain why we \nshould fix a system that is not broken.\n  Mr. President, myth 1 about agriculture is that we do not need farm \nprograms to compete in the world market. What many critics do not \nunderstand is that today there is an intense worldwide battle for \nagriculture market dominance. Our primary competitor is Europe. They \nhave a plan. They have a strategy to win the world agricultural trade \nbattle. They provide high levels of support to their producers to \nencourage surplus production. They dump those surpluses on the world \nmarket, undercutting our producers and grabbing international market \nshare. They are on the march. They are on the move. Make no mistake.\n  Meanwhile, we sleep. We are blissfully unaware that our markets are \nbeing stolen from us day by day. One day we may awaken to learn that \nEurope has done to us in agriculture what Japan has done to us in \nautomobiles and electronics. The Europeans understand that there is a \nwar being waged for markets, and they believe ultimately there will be \na cease-fire. They believe there will be a cease-fire in place, and \nthey want to occupy the high ground. The high ground is dominating \nworld market share. And, oh, how well their strategy is working. In a \nfew short years, Europe has transformed itself from the largest net \nimporter of wheat to the No. 2 exporter.\n  This chart shows precisely what has happened from 1960 to 1992. The \nred line shows European exports of wheat. The blue line shows imports. \nAs one can see, Europe that was once the largest importer has now moved \nto the No. 2 exporter in the world. They have a plan. They have a \nstrategy.\n  Let me just tell you what we are up against. The Europeans support \ntheir producers at rates 2 to 20 times the level of support we give our \nfarmers. For example, the Europeans spend $119 per metric ton to \nsupport their wheat producers; 2\\1/2\\ times the U.S. level. This chart \nshows the difference. This is just government levels of support. \nEurope, $119 per ton, the United States, $46 per ton; over 2\\1/2\\ times \nour level of support. It does not stop with wheat.\n  The same is true for beef producers. Again, they support their \nproducers at 2\\1/2\\ times the level we support our producers. Again, \nnot surprisingly, Europe is No. 2 in beef exports.\n  This chart shows European support versus U.S. support for beef. This \nis in dollars per metric ton. Europe is $2,274 per metric ton. The \nUnited States is $878 per metric ton. Europe is supporting their \nproducers at 2\\1/2\\ times the level that we are supporting our \nproducers.\n  If that is not bad enough, Mr. President, let us look at oilseed. \nThey give their oilseed producers 23 times the level of support we give \nour oilseed producers. While world oilseed demand and acreage have \nincreased over 40 percent in the past 15 years, U.S. oilseed plantings \nhave increased a minute 0.3 percent. European plantings have \nskyrocketed 330 percent.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows European support in oilseeds versus \nU.S. support--a dramatic difference. It is $329 a metric ton in Europe, \n$15 a ton in the United States. And we wonder why Europe is capturing \nmarket after market.\n  Mr. President, I hasten to point out that these examples demonstrate \nhow much the European governments are supporting their producers. It \ndoes not count European consumer subsidies to their producers, which \nwould make the levels of producer subsidy much higher.\n  Mr. President, this is not a level playing field. This means that \nAmerican farmers must not only compete against French and German \nfarmers. American farmers must compete against the French Government \nand the German Government. This means that Europeans take income from \nAmerican farmers. This means that Europeans take jobs from Americans \nworking in processing, transportation, and the input industry.\n  We can see how well this European strategy is working in trade \nnegotiations, as well. While Europe supports their farmers at high \nlevels, we consistently slash agriculture spending in this country. My \ncolleagues should remember the early stages of the Uruguay round of \nGATT. The European GATT negotiators sat back, watched us cut our own \nprograms and then toughened their negotiating position. We could have \nwon more for our farmers and our agribusiness industry if we had not \nunilaterally cut our farm programs.\n  Instead of a level playing field, Europe held out for equal \npercentage reductions from these unequal levels of support. That \nassures they will remain on top.\n  Mr. President, again, I emphasize to those who are listening, the \nEuropeans have a plan and a strategy to dominate world agricultural \nmarkets. Their plan, their strategy is to continue high levels of \nsupport--much higher levels than ours--on the assumption that at some \npoint in this world trade battle, there will be a cease-fire. They \nbelieve there will be a cease-fire in place. They want to occupy the \nhigh ground. So in area after area, we see the European strategy \nplaying out. Oh, how well it is working. We let them take advantage of \nus. We cannot allow that to happen again.\n  The Europeans support their producers at high rates for simple yet \ncompelling reasons. They've been hungry. They know what it is like to \ngo through war and not have a stable food supply. They have made \nconscious decisions to avoid that ever happening again. They also know \nthat every field of wheat and every field of sunflowers creates jobs \nand processing, transportation and input industries. I admire them for \ntheir foresight and commitment.\n  Against these odds, agriculture in America is still one of the few \nsectors of the economy that contributes positively to our balance of \ntrade. While the rest of the economy is heading for a $180 billion \ntrade deficit, agriculture is producing a $17 billion trade surplus. \nThe farm programs are the foundation on which our farmers are able to \ncompete against these overwhelming odds. Remember, if American farmers \ndo not grow it here, American workers do not transport, process and \nmarket it here.\n  I repeat, we are in a worldwide battle for market dominance. The \nEuropeans hope the United States will give up and give in. They hope we \nwill roll over. They hope we will flinch.\n  Mr. President, I am here to deliver a message. We must not back down. \nWe must not unilaterally disarm. We must not retreat. We must fight if \nwe are to preserve jobs and economic activity in this country.\n  The current battle in this global market is crucial for millions of \nAmerican jobs. That is precisely what is at stake--American jobs. The \nquestion is this: Will we stay in this fight? We cannot win the battle \nwith our hands tied behind our backs. If we give in, we lose. This is \nnot a question of subsidies. It is a question of whether we are going \nto stand behind our farmers in this global market battle. It is a \nquestion of whether we are going to stand for American jobs.\n  Today, we are at a crossroads. We are beginning debate on the 1995 \nfarm bill, a bill that will set American agriculture and food policy \ninto the 21st century. At the same time, debate on another round of \nGATT will begin in \n[[Page S1295]] the next few years. The choice is ours. We engage, or we \nretreat.\n  Mr. President, myth two about agriculture is that it is like every \nother type of business. That is simply not the case. Unlike any other \nsector, farmers produce a basic human need: food. To sustain that \nabundant food supply, we maintain a reserve of basic commodities to \nfulfill our food and feed needs in times of shortfall. The reserve is a \nnational food security system, an insurance policy for consumers \nagainst shortfalls in crop production. Inherently, reserves depress \nprices and reduce farmers' incomes.\n  For many decades, the people of this Nation have believed that \nmaintaining a stable reserve of critical commodities is in our national \ninterests. For decades, we have believed that we should maintain \nproducers' incomes at levels sufficient to sustain a stable supply. \nThat is why we have farm programs.\n  Not only do farmers produce a basic human need and maintain large \ninventories, but farmers must also deal with a highly volatile factor--\nthe weather.\n  In other parts of the world, droughts have killed hundreds of \nthousands of people. Thankfully, our Nation has always been spared \nfamine. We have had a rational food policy. Americans need not think \nlong to recall the last time weather had a disastrous impact on U.S. \nagricultural production--the last time we made a claim on our national \nfood insurance policy. The 1993 flood reduced corn production by one-\nthird. Luckily for the American consumer, we had stocks of grain on \nhand, a land reserve to increase plantings, and favorable weather in \n1994 to replenish our supply.\n  How much would consumers have spent on higher food costs without a \nfarm program? The answer is billions of dollars. On top of the billions \nof dollars consumers saved in 1993, food stocks in hand during the \n1988-1989 drought saved consumers some $40 billion in higher food \ncosts. That is how a national food policy should work, and that is how \nour national policy does work.\n  Moreover, the research that agriculture supports has given consumers \na second insurance policy. Insects and disease have always presented \nformidable and destructive problems to agriculture. For example, 1993 \nwheat production in some counties in North Dakota was cut 50 percent by \ndisease. Farmers burned literally millions of acres of wheat destroyed \nby that disease. Researchers are now hard at work to prevent the spread \nand find a cure.\n  We can remember what happened in other times, in other countries that \ndid not have such a vigorous effort, such an insurance policy.\n  The potato famine of the mid-19th century in Ireland provides a \ndramatic example of the importance of disease research. One single \nfungus destroyed Ireland's potato crop, forcing many into starvation. \nFortunately for U.S. consumers today, food production research in the \nU.S. targets disease early, limits the spread, and prevents that type \nof human devastation.\n  Mr. President, myth three about farm programs is that their \nelimination will benefit consumers. The purveyors of myth three ignore \nclear evidence to the contrary.\n  First, American citizens enjoy a safe, high-quality, abundant, and \nstable food supply. Second, we spend less of our disposable income on \nfood than any other consumers in the world.\n  I have brought this chart to show what we pay in this country versus \nwhat other consumers in other countries pay. I think it is very \nrevealing. This shows the percentage of income that goes for food. In \nItaly, 26 percent of their country's income goes for food--26 percent. \nIn Australia, 23 percent; in Japan, 19 percent; Germany, 19 percent; \nFrance, 16 percent; the United Kingdom, 12 percent; Canada, 11 percent; \nand in the United States, 8 percent of our income goes for food, the \nlowest cost food in the world. And there are those who suggest we \neliminate the underlying programs that make this possible. Mr. \nPresident, that makes no sense.\n  We have been in a time when we spend less of our income for food than \ndo the consumers of any nation, but at the same time we have achieved \nthat result, we see food prices continuing to fall. According to the \nUSDA, consumer spending has dropped from 10 percent of income in 1970 \nto 8 percent today. So not only have we achieved the lowest cost food \nin the world, but we have also kept food costs going down. In 1970, 10 \npercent of the average American's income went for food. In 1991, it was \ndown to 8 percent.\n  And of that declining percentage, only 22 cents of each dollar goes \nto the American farmer. Further, the cost of marketing food has been \nthe principal factor affecting consumer costs.\n  Let us just look for a moment at the price of bread. This chart shows \nwhat has happened with U.S. wheat prices versus what happened to bread \nprices. Wheat prices have been relatively stable. Bread prices have \ncontinued to rise. In other words, there is virtually no relation \nbetween the consumer cost and the price the farmer receives. Clearly, \nthe increase is not going into the farmer's pocket. To further \nillustrate, from 1983 to 1993, 85 percent of the rise in consumer food \ncosts went to the marketing bill, not to farmers.\n  Returning to our examples of the 1993 flood and the 1988-89 droughts, \nwhile production dropped sharply, consumer prices remained stable. \nAgain, this is how the farm programs are supposed to work and it is how \nthey do work--protecting consumers against the dramatic fluctuations in \nsupply that can occur because of weather-related and disease-related \ndisasters.\n  What would happen if farm programs were eliminated? Very likely, \nreserves of grains would be reduced, prices would fluctuate, and \nconsumers' cost of food would increase. Does that sound like something \nthat is good for the American consumer? Absolutely not.\n  Mr. President, we are now engaged in a debate about how to reduce the \nbudget deficit. I support a balanced budget. I have not only voted for \ndeficit reduction measures, I have offered my own plans, as a member of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, every year I have been in the U.S. Senate.\n  But let us look at what you get if you eliminate agriculture \nspending. You do not get much. Agriculture represents less than 1 \npercent of the entire Federal budget.\n  This chart shows Federal outlays from 1996 to 2002, the period about \nwhich we are talking about balancing the Federal budget. Here is \ninterest on the debt, nearly $2 trillion over that period; defense, \nover $2 trillion; Social Security is nearly $3 trillion; domestic \ndiscretionary spending, just over $2 trillion; Medicare, almost $2 \ntrillion. Where is agriculture? Where is agriculture, Mr. President? It \nis this little, tiny slice right here. You almost cannot see it.\n  That is because, of the $13 trillion that we are projected to spend \nover the next 7 years, $87 billion is for agriculture--$87 billion out \nof $13 trillion, far less than 1 percent of Federal spending.\n  Mr. President, I repeatedly encounter press reports of someone \nsuggesting we cut agriculture and that cutting agriculture will somehow \nsolve our deficit problems. It simply will not.\n  Not only is it a small pot of money, it is a dwindling pot. \nAgriculture spending has suffered dramatic cuts in recent years. In \nconstant dollars, farm spending dropped a full two-thirds since 1986. \nStill, some continue to point their finger at agriculture as the cause \nof our deficits. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows in constant dollars agriculture \nprogram spending: In 1986, expressed in 1994 dollars, $35 billion; in \n1994, down to less than $12 billion, a dramatic reduction. In fact, if \nother parts of the budget had suffered the same reductions that \nagriculture has experienced, there would be no deficit problem. We \nwould be in surplus.\n  Mr. President, many critics of farm programs suggest that because \nsome forms of agriculture production in the United States survive \nwithout Government programs, all commodities should be able to operate \nin that manner. Most often mentioned are livestock and fruits and \nvegetables.\n  Let us just take livestock off the table right away. Anyone who \nsuggests the livestock industry operates without the benefit of feed \nprices stabilized by our farm program is sorely misinformed.\n  Fruits and vegetables are another case. Fruits and vegetables are \nperishable. While a reserve would be highly impractical, the prices of \nmany such commodities are stabilized through \n[[Page S1296]] marketing orders administered by USDA. So, in fact, we \ndo have price stabilization programs for the vast majority of \nagricultural commodities. That is why consumers enjoy stable supplies, \nhigh quality, and modest food prices.\n  Mr. President, I believe I have demonstrated how important farm \nprograms are to consumers. Now let us take a hard look at how the \nelimination of farm programs would affect producers.\n  Who are these producers? They are good citizens. They are hardworking \npeople. They get up early. They work late. They support their \ncommunities. They pay taxes. And, Mr. President, far from the media-\ngenerated image of wealthy folks, the average net farm income in North \nDakota is $20,000 a year. I know that is hard to believe when one sees \nportrayed over the media these images of wealthy farmers who are \nfarming the mailbox.\n  Mr. President, that is not the way it is. I come from North Dakota. I \ngo across the State of North Dakota, through cities and towns, visiting \nfarmsteads. I get a chance to see what the condition is in rural \nAmerica.\n  The hard reality is that the average farmer in my State is earning \n$20,000 a year. They have strong families. Farming is a family \nbusiness. They raise good children; children that grow up with a strong \nwork ethic, a good education, and good values.\n  But those children rarely come back to farm because they do not see a \nfuture in it. They do not see a good opportunity. They do not see a \nsecure and profitable profession. They see a struggle. They see a \nstruggle to raise a good crop, a struggle to withstand low prices, a \nstruggle to persevere through hail, drought, or flood.\n  They watch their parents struggle and they ask why.\n  Mr. President, I think we find farm families staying on the land not \nbecause it makes sense financially, because the rate of return for \nagriculture is as low as any industry one can find. I believe they stay \nwith it because it is a way of life.\n  What will the cuts that some people are suggesting do to this way of \nlife? In North Dakota, the effect would be dramatic. According to USDA \nstatistics, in 1993, farm program payments represented 82 percent of \nnet farm income--82 percent of net farm income represented by Federal \nfarm program payments. Nationally, startling statistics from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture provide a clear picture of what is happening \non the farm. Let me quote:\n\n       * * * recently, entry has fallen fastest for farms operated \n     by those under 35.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       * * * the most noticeable change in the 1992 census (of \n     Agriculture) was among 35-to-44 year-old farmers. Farm exits \n     for this age group increased * * *\n\n  What does this tell us? It tells us that farming is not an \neconomically attractive business. It is high risk, not high income.\n  Again, according to USDA:\n\n       Approximately 90 percent of all farm operator households \n     received some income from off-farm sources.\n\n  If farming were such a profitable business, far fewer households \nwould have to search for alternative sources of income to meet their \nneeds.\n  Finally, the difference between the Consumer Price Index and the \nprices received for farm commodities clearly portrays the pressure that \nfarmers face.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows the farmers' financial squeeze. The \nConsumer Price Index rises much faster than farm prices. This chart \nshows from 1982 to 1993 the relationship between the Consumer Price \nIndex, the prices that farmers pay for things, and farm prices, the \nprices that farmers get. This chart tells us a very clear story:\n  From 1982 to 1993, the red line shows farm prices. It has been \nrelatively stable. The blue line shows what has happened to the \nConsumer Price Index. It has risen each and every year on a steady \ncourse. So the gap between what farmers pay and the prices they receive \nhas steadily grown.\n  Farmers are being squeezed by low farm prices and rising costs. \nFurther, agricultural program cuts will damage rural America in \nprofound and irreversible ways. At a time when we need sustained \neconomic growth in both rural and urban areas, the needs of rural \nAmerica cannot be ignored. It would be flawed economic policy.\n  In conclusion, let me restate why we need to maintain our agriculture \npolicy. First, agriculture programs are the foundation for our \ninternational competitiveness. Without them, we unilaterally disarm in \nthe world trade battle. That would harm American farmers, eliminate \nAmerican jobs and threaten America's economic security.\n  Second, agriculture programs are insurance policies for consumers. \nWithout farm programs, consumers lose security over a basic human need: \nFood.\n  Finally, agriculture is a fundamentally different form of business. \nTo work properly, it must maintain a reserve, but that reserve \ndepresses prices for farmers and benefits consumers. Because of \nagriculture's differences, farm programs are essential.\n  We as a nation have maintained an agriculture policy for decades to \nprotect producers and consumers. This is not blind generosity. This is \nnot aimless policymaking. This is not luck. Those who seek to destroy \nthe farm program must demonstrate why their way is right for America. \nThe burden of proof is on them. I think the facts prove they are dead \nwrong.\n  Our agriculture policy works. We have proof that it works. We must \nnot destroy a program that is proven to deliver an abundance of low-\ncost, high-quality food. We must not destroy a program that has made \nAmerica the world leader in agriculture. We must not destroy a program \nthat has worked. We must not unilaterally disarm.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE.

The first was love of family--and what a remarkable family it is. \nOver the past half-century, the Kennedy name has become synonymous with \npublic service.\n  Indeed, during Rose Kennedy's life, she would see three of hers sons \nserve in the U.S. Senate--one of whom, of course, became President of \nthe United States.\n  One daughter currently serves as Ambassador to Ireland; another is \nregarded as one of the great humanitarians of our time.\n  Two grandsons currently serve in the U.S. Congress; and just last \nweek a granddaughter was sworn-in as Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, \nand a grandson became a member of the Maryland House of Delegates.\n  The other principle at the center of Rose Kennedy's life was love of \nGod. And it was that love that enabled her to survive through the \ndeaths of four of her children.\n  Many words will be written and spoken in the coming days about Rose \nKennedy, but none will be more eloquent than those of our colleague, \nSenator Edward Kennedy, who said, ``She was the most beautiful rose of \nall.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1296-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ROSE KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

Mr. President, as one of millions upon millions of \nAmericans mourning today the passing of a great woman, I want to extend \nto our colleague Senator Edward Kennedy from Massachusetts, and to his \nextended family, my wife Erma's and my condolences on the death \nyesterday of his mother, Mrs. Joseph P. Kennedy--Rose Fitzgerald \nKennedy, as we knew her best.\n  Some Americans have expressed a regret that our representative \ndemocracy precludes the granting of titles of noble recognition as is \ncommon among our British cousins.\n  To be certain, if titles were granted in America to those most \nworthy, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy would long, long ago have been known \naffectionately as ``Lady Kennedy.''\n  Indeed, given her innate intelligence, political acumen, and enviable \nsense of self, had Rose Kennedy been born perhaps 50 years later than \nshe was, she might well have been the first United States Senator in \nher family.\n  Instead, being born 104 years ago, from her childhood and youth, Rose \nKennedy imbibed the air of the politics of Boston, of Massachusetts, \nand of America, and learned to play magnificently the role of wife to \nher husband and mother to her sons and daughters as she brought her \nincomparable strengths and graces to bear on their successes.\n  Rose Kennedy's life spanned more than half the history of the \nRepublic of the United States. For much of that history, Rose Kennedy \nwas a frontline participant in the great events of our era, and in more \nthan a peripheral fashion.\n  Where else in American history can be recorded that one woman was the \nwife of an Ambassador to the Court of St. James, the mother of an \nAmerican President, the mother of three United States Senators, mother \nof the Attorney General of the United States.\n  And, perhaps, above all else, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy will live on in \nthe hearts and memories of untold millions of Americans who witnessed \nher fortitude and faith in the face of pitiless tragedy in the loss of \nthree of her sons in the service of our country--her son Joe, Jr., in \nWorld War II, and her sons John and Robert to the mindless hatred of \nthe previously nameless assassins on whom infamy will forever rest \nthrough the sins against our country and history itself that they \ncommitted in murdering these two outstanding men.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the members of the Kennedy family will \nexperience some degree of comfort in the condolences that we offer them \ntoday, and, more importantly, that the Kennedy family will find \nincreased strength in consolation in recalling the strength and \ncharacter that Rose Kennedy embodied and in realizing the affection and \nreverence in which she was held by the American people and by people \naround the world.\n\n     Let Fate do her worst, there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past, which she cannot destroy;\n     Which come, in the night-time of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n     Long, long be my heart with such memories filled!\n     Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled,--\n     You may break, you may shatter the vase, if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to compliment the Senator \nfrom West Virginia for a beautiful tribute to a remarkable woman.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I, too, would like to associate myself with \nthe remarks of the Senator from West Virginia. It is hard to believe \nthat Rose Kennedy in her 104 years comes close to encompassing almost \nhalf the time period that this country has been in existence--a little \nshort of that, but not very much.\n  It has been my pleasure to know her from some years ago. I have not \nsee her in recent years, but we were visitors with the Kennedy family \non a number of occasions years ago when she was there. We got to know \nher as a very gracious lady.\n  I think Senator Byrd has very properly given the accolades that he \nhas, that she has so well deserved. And I associate myself with his \nremarks at this time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to extend my wife's and my deepest \nsympathy to our colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. \nKennedy], on the death of his mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. I extend \ncondolences also to two of her grandsons, my Rhode Island colleague \nRepresentatives Patrick Kennedy and Representative Joseph Kennedy of \nMassachusetts.\n  No other woman in American history can match the distinction of Rose \nKennedy in nurturing progeny for distinguished service to the Nation. \nThree sons who became U.S. Senators, one of them a President, and now \nin the next generation two grandsons in the House of Representatives, a \ngranddaughter who is a Lieutenant Governor, and another grandson in a \nState legislature.\n  History will look back in wonder and admiration at such a family and \nespecially at the woman who instilled it with so much vitality and high \nsense of purpose.\n  Rose Kennedy was privileged to savor the highest of life's triumphs \nbut she also had to bear the burdens of tragedy of almost unbearable \nweight. Where lesser mortals would have been crushed by such adversity, \nRose Kennedy remarkably kept on course, guided, as it were by some \nstrong inner compass.\n  We know now that the compass was steadied by her own great faith and \nreligious commitment, and that these were the sure cornerstones on \nwhich she built her extraordinary family.\n  Rose Kennedy left a legacy like no other to the Nation, and the \nNation will always be grateful.\n  [[Page S1298]] Mr. President, there is only one other woman in \nhistory that comes anywhere near Rose Kennedy, in my memory or in my \nview. That is the mother of Napoleon, Madam Le Mere. She ruled the \nknown world at the time, most of Europe and the countries there. And \nshe, herself, gave her imprimatur to all kings and queens and rulers \naround Europe.\n  I send all my sympathy to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I would like to rise to say a few words \nabout the Mexican debt situation and about our relationship with \nMexico. I have been very troubled that our leadership has agreed to \nsupport this loan guarantee package with Mexico without further \nanalysis.\n  There are two things that give me great trouble, and as a member of \nthe Finance Committee I will be asking some very hard questions. First \nof all, why can we not get this package collateralized? Why can it not \nbe attached either to the Mexican oil resources or to some other \ncollateral, because I am afraid the American people may not get their \nmoney back.\n  Many who are advocating this are going around saying it will not cost \nus anything. But I have been in this body since 1978, and the House \nsince 1975, and I have heard this again and again, and the U.S. \ntaxpayers frequently end up paying the bill.\n  The second thing that troubles me a great deal is the Chile example. \nEconomists tell me that the example of what happened in Chile in the \nearly 1980's is almost perfectly analogous to what is happening in \nMexico. For example, in Chile in the early 1980's they had a similar \neconomic crisis where their money had been devalued and Chile was \nunable to get any assistance from the United States at that time \nbecause General Pinochet, the dictator, was not approved by the United \nStates and the United States had cut off all aid and even economic \nrelations with Chile so Chile had nowhere to turn.\n  Under General Pinochet's leadership Chile made economic reforms. They \ntightened their belt, they went through the steps necessary to restore \ntheir economic health internally, and today Chile is one of the most \nprosperous and booming countries in the world. Indeed, Chile is \nemerging like one of the supereconomies that we have seen emerge in \nAsia. Chile is the first such supereconomy of South America. And Chile \nnow seeks to join in a trade agreement with the United States. Its \nbusinesses are competing around the world.\n  If we roll history back and imagine that in the early 1980's Chile \nhad been a democracy and we had been giving aid to Chile, we would have \ngiven Chile a series of loan guarantees and aid and Chile would not \nhave made the necessary economic reforms. And Chile would probably \nstill be a struggling Third World country today.\n  So I say the same is true with Mexico at this time, 1995. Mexico has \nnot taken many of the strong measures necessary. I had great hopes for \nthe last Salinas government. It seemed, as it got toward the end of \nthat time, Mexico, and the PRC, in wanting to win the election, took \nsofter and softer economic policies, devaluing, trying to create \nartificial wealth, printing money, and doing all the things they are \nnot supposed to do in terms of sound economic decisions.\n  Now should the American taxpayers be asked to pay for that? Once \nagain we are in one of these circumstances where a lot of aid would be \ngoing to some of our large bond funds and banks in the United States. \nMutual bond fund types who bought a lot of the Mexican paper would be \nbailed out. We would be bailing out a lot of our own mutual bond funds, \nbanks and others.\n  We are also bailing out the Mexican politicians who did not make the \nright decisions and the hard decisions, who did not tell their people \nthe truth in their speeches as they went about Mexico. But the worst \npart of the whole thing is, aside from bailing out private groups who \nmaybe do not deserve it, the worst of all is that we may well be \ndelaying real reform in Mexico. Would it not be better to let 6 months \nor 1 year pass and observe that Mexico is taking some of those tough \neconomic measures? Why do we have to act on this so quickly?\n  I think Mexico should be required to make internal economic reforms \nand also to collateralize the loan guarantee. The Mexicans refuse to \nsell their publicly owned oil fields and oil industry, which was \nnationalized at one point. It is a socialistic endeavor and a very \nunhealthy one in terms of what it produces for Mexico. Here we are, a \nfree-enterprise country, giving a noncollateralized guarantee to Mexico \nwhile not requiring them to sell their oil industry. The economists \ntell me if they were willing to privatize their oil industry, they \ncould have far in excess of the billions of dollars they are seeking \nfrom the United States.\n  So in closing I would like to say, let us call this what it is. It is \na bailout. There are many arguments that are made--the specter of \nrefugees coming across the border, et cetera, et cetera. But we are \ngoing to have the same problem again in 2 or 3 years unless Mexico \nmakes the economic reforms that are necessary. Let us look at the Chile \nexample, the example of a country that made the reforms, did not get \nany aid from anybody, and is one of the healthiest countries in the \nworld today.\n  In terms of foreign aid, I have observed over the years the countries \nthat have developed the most economically in the world have been those \nthat have not received economic aid from the United States--with one or \ntwo exceptions. All the tigers of the Far East did not receive aid \npackages from the United States. They did it themselves. Many of the \ncountries that we have consistently given foreign aid to have faltered, \nhave not made internal decisions, have expected a handout, and have \nremained very, very poor. So we have not done these poor people a \nfavor. As Chile, when they needed help and they were looking for \ninternational grants and aid--nobody gave it to them. They have become \nthe most prosperous country in South America as a result of it.\n  So I think there is something to be learned here. I know it may sound \nharsh. Maybe it sounds cold and calculating. But if we really want to \nhelp people, sometimes we should require they make reforms before we \ngive them aid, or we should try to give them trade rather than aid. \nAlso, I point out the huge budgetary deficit we have in our own country \nand the number of people we have in need of some kind of small business \nassistance here within the United States.\n  So, I have made it known to the leadership I was disappointed that \nboth sides, both the President and Republican and Democratic \nleadership, endorsed this plan without further consulting and assessing \nthe feelings of other Members of the Congress. As a member of the \nFinance Committee, I do not feel obligated to support this until I see \nmuch more collateralization, until I see much more performance on the \npart of the Mexicans in terms of getting their house in order, and \nuntil I see the American taxpayers reassured.\n  Recently I have been in on some debates about privatizing public \nbroadcasting in this country, and I have been criticized for things I \nhave never said. I find that privatizing sounds bad to some people \ninside the beltway. The fact of the matter is, there are ways that \npublic television can make a great deal of money through programming \nrights, through working with regional communications companies, and \nthrough working with other communications companies. In terms of \nmarketing the product that they have, they can make a lot of money and \nthey can save the taxpayers money. But in the whole debate the taxpayer \nis almost forgotten.\n  So it is with the Mexican debt issue. Let us think about the \ntaxpayers of this country as we consider the Mexican debt situation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n   [[Page S1299]] The PRESIDING OFFICER.

YOU BE THE JUDGE OF THAT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the incredibly enormous Federal debt is a \nlot like television's well-known energizer bunny--it keeps going and \ngoing--at the expense, of course, of the American taxpayer.\n  Many politicians talk a good game--when they are back home--about \nbringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt under control. But so \nmany of these same politicians regularly voted in support of bloated \nspending bills during the 103d Congress, which perhaps is a primary \nfactor in the new configuration of U.S. Senators.\n  This is a rather distressing fact as the 104th Congress gets down to \nbusiness. As of Friday, January 20, 1994, the Federal debt stood--down \nto the penny--at exactly $4,796,537,934,595.60, or $18,207.74 per \nperson.\n  Mr. President, it is important that all of us monitor, closely and \nconstantly the incredible cost of merely paying the interest on this \ndebt. Last year, the interest on the Federal debt totaled $190 billion.\n  Mr. President, my hope is that the 104th Congress can bring under \ncontrol the outrageous spending that created this outrageous debt. If \nthe party now controlling both Houses of Congress, as a result of the \nNovember elections last year, does not do a better job of getting a \nhandle on this enormous debt, the American people are not likely to \noverlook it in 1996.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1299-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               A TRIBUTE TO SEATTLE'S BRAVE FIREFIGHTERS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, four Seattle firefighters \ndied in the line of duty: Lt. Walter Kilgore, Lt. Gregory Shoemaker, \nand firefighters Randall Terlicker and James Brown. They are heroes in \nthe truest sense of the word. Jon Gillis, president of the Seattle \nFirefighters Union, said these four men gave their lives for the \nnoblest of causes, for the safety and protection of others. I join him \nin that sentiment.\n  In the midst of this tragedy, the community came together to pay \nhomage to these fallen firefighters. But the pain of this loss extended \nbeyond Seattle: More than 10,000 firefighters, police officers, \nparamedics, and citizens from across North America and from as far away \nas Australia, came to Seattle to honor these firefighters.\n  Too often, we fail to say thank you to these brave men and women who \nserve us as firefighters, police officers, and members of the Armed \nForces. The professions they have chosen are full of risk. Seattle \nMayor Norm Rice recently reminded us these guardians of our society \nplay a special role, and, tragically, sometimes pay the ultimate price \nfor their service. They are extraordinary individuals and make a real \ndifference in our lives and in our communities. They are quiet heroes \nwho deserve our respect, our admiration, and our gratitude.\n  Their families also share the hardships and pain that come along with \nthese jobs. I know because one of my brothers is a firefighter in \nTacoma, WA, and I can tell you the danger inherent in his job is felt \nby his immediate and extended family. I would like to take this \nopportunity to personally thank the men and women, and their families, \nwho dedicate their lives to protecting our communities.\n  I am deeply saddened by the death of these four firefighters, and \nwant to pay tribute to the sacrifice these extraordinary individuals \nhave made. Lt. Walter Kilgore, Lt. Gregory Shoemaker, and firefighters \nRandall Terlicker and James Brown truly represent what is best about \nAmerica.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1299-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ON THE LIFE OF MARIYAMA DOROTHY COLE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to take this \nopportunity to remark on the life of Mariyama Dorothy Cole, who passed \naway this month.\n  Mariyama, a resident of Windsor, was an inspiration and joy to her \nfamily and friends. She was Marie to all who knew her. Marie was a girl \nof unique and distinctive beauty, but it was her inner strength and \nserenity that were most remarkable.\n  To understand what made Marie a person so deserving of recognition \none must know the awesome changes Marie helped inspire and the \nincredible perserverance she demonstrated on a daily basis.\n  Today, because of Marie, children in the State of Connecticut who \nhave complex health care needs of disabilities are better able to live \nat home with their families. Mariyama and her family challenged \nexisting policies that were contrary to family unification. She was \ninstrumental in the passage of several pieces of legislation that will \nfoster better services for families and children. She was the first \nchild with special needs to attend totally inclusive classes in her \nhometown high school.\n  Throughout her 18 years of life, Marie gave more love and educated \nmore people than most individuals do in two lifetimes.

Mr. President, this year marks the 30 year anniversary of \nthe establishment of the National Foundation on the Arts and the \nHumanities. In 1965 Senator Jacob Javits and I sponsored this \nlegislation to foster the development of excellence in American art and \nculture. After a long and distinguished history of nurturing the arts \nin our Nation, the National Endowment for the Arts has in recent years \nbecome the subject of some controversy concerning the funding of \ncertain works which many of our citizens consider offensive. In light \nof this, I would like to explain why I believe that the National \nEndowment for the Arts has been a tremendous boon to our Nation and \nshould continue as a viable entity for the support of American culture.\n  Our Nation's Arts Endowment provides critical assistance for cultural \nworks and presentations in music, theater, literature, dance, design \narts, and folk arts around the country. This year, in my own State of \nRhode Island, the Endowment provided funds to renovate painting and \nsculpture facilities in the Museum of Art at the Rhode Island School of \nDesign, supported an after-school arts education program for minority \nneighborhood youth in the fourth and fifth grades, and funded the \nTrinity Repertory Theater, one of the Nation's premier theaters. In \nother areas, the NEA funded a Music in our Schools program in \nProvidence and aided a folk arts apprenticeship program. Without this \nfunding, Mr. President, many of these programs would simply not exist. \nIn this context, I ask unanimous consent that these editorials from the \nProvidence Journal and others from around the country in support of the \nNational Endowment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Providence Journal, Jan. 15, 1995]\n\n                            We Need the NEA\n\n       The Newt Congress has cast a cold eye on the National \n     Endowment for the Arts, the federal agency that provides \n     grants to arts organizations and individual artists.\n       As federal budget items go, the NEA is no behemoth. Its \n     allotment this year is $167.4 million, nearly $3 million less \n     than the endowment had to work with a year ago, and an annual \n     outlay of roughly 65 cents for every man, woman and child in \n     America. (When was the last time you could get into \n     [[Page S1300]] even a neighborhood puppet show at that \n     price?) Compared with governments in most Western European \n     nations, ours expends a pittance on art. And the NEA budget \n     is dwarfed by the $9 billion Americans give privately to the \n     arts each year.\n       Yet despite its modest draw on federal revenues, the NEA \n     has for some time been a favorite target of some \n     conservatives, who like to focus on the few projects they \n     consider obscene, and an offense to family values, while \n     ignoring the much greater sums that help keep small \n     orchestras, ballet troupes and less controversial artists \n     going.\n       In Rhode Island, $829,700 in NEA money went to 15 artists \n     and arts groups in the fiscal year that ended last September. \n     The bulk went to the Rhode Island Council on the Arts, which \n     distributes support to a variety of projects. Other stipends \n     went to four individual artists (in visual arts, dance, \n     literature and translation), and to such groups as the Rhode \n     Island Philharmonic, Trinity Repertory Theater, RISD, Brown \n     and the Langston Hughes Center for the Arts.\n       Massachusetts, during the same cycle, garnered 153 grants \n     worth $4.9 million.\n       A legitimate philosophical question lies beneath the often \n     vituperative attacks on the NEA. That is, should the federal \n     government play any role at all--however small--in supporting \n     the arts? In an era of deficits and taxpayer discontent, the \n     question has new urgency. Certainly no program should be \n     shielded from a rigorous appraisal of cost-effectiveness; and \n     all agencies must share in overdue federal fiscal discipline.\n       In the 1960s, when the NEA was conceived, the rationale \n     seemed simple. Most popular forms of entertainment (movies; \n     TV; recordings) paid for themselves. But what about the \n     artistic and cultural experiences that many people had less \n     contact with?\n       Who would make opera accessible to more than just the \n     wealthy; assure that painters received training and a chance \n     to paint; and help keep classical musicians playing? The \n     government saw a role for itself in nourishing work that \n     might not instantly withstand the judgment of the marketplace \n     but might enrich culture over time.\n       Minus certain Cold War distortions, the rationale for \n     subsidizing the arts was little different from that for \n     supporting academic and scientific research. Not every \n     American should have to agree with the worth of each \n     individual project; it was the idea that the general category \n     was a good to an advanced society.\n       But why not imply turn all of this over to the private \n     sector--nonprofit institutions supported by business and \n     individuals? First, such institutions are simply not equipped \n     now to shoulder what for them would be such a heavy transfer \n     of obligation. Many arts organizations would be left \n     foundering during the interim. Additionally, federal arts \n     dollars function as seed money, attracting extra financing \n     from local governments and the private sector. The federal \n     imprimatur lends legitimacy, and helps to guide private \n     involvement. As a result, it is easier for artists and arts \n     groups to raise the money they need than if they had to \n     appeal solely to the private sector.\n       But finally, a federal arts program has important symbolic \n     value. Merely by existing, it makes a statement about what we \n     as a nation vlaue--in this case, something beyond getting and \n     spending. If values truly are the fundamental crisis in this \n     country, as conservatives suggest, eliminating the NEA would \n     send exactly the wrong message. Congress should spare it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From The New York Times, Jan. 13, 1995]\n\n                    Don't Ax Federal Support for Art\n\n       The National Endowment for the Arts, now in its 30th year, \n     has been a brilliant though sometimes controversial success. \n     At a modest cost to the taxpayers, $167 million this year, it \n     has helped channel private donations to an impressive variety \n     of nonprofit arts institutions across the country. \n     Institutions report that each dollar granted by the Endowment \n     generates an average of $11 in matching private funds. As a \n     result, many more Americans have been able to experience \n     original art firsthand, and talented artists have been \n     encouraged to pursue their work.\n       This is just what the Endowment was created to do. But now, \n     for a variety of reasons, some conservative Republicans want \n     to use their new Congressional majorities to cut off funds \n     for the Endowment and shut it down. They should not be \n     allowed to succeed.\n       The Endowment has some devoted conservative Republican \n     defenders, for example Senators Orrin Hatch and Alan Simpson. \n     But other conservatives remain ideologically opposed to \n     public subsidies for the arts. Yet subsidies by governments \n     and wealthy patrons are an ancient and necessary tradition. \n     Even artists whose greatness has been acknowledged by \n     posterity have had to struggle to support themselves during \n     their lifetimes, particularly if their originality consisted \n     in challenging received tastes. Enlightened societies all \n     over the world recognize that there is a clear public \n     interest in supporting such talents and to sustaining the \n     traditions represented by an museums, libraries, symphonies \n     and dance, opera and theatrical companies and making them \n     available to wider audiences.\n       This is a wise and historically validated role for \n     governments. The real risk of government subsidies lies not \n     in overgenerous use of the taxpayers' money but in the the \n     potential for political interference or censorship. The \n     Endowment's designers wisely guarded against this danger by \n     leaving initial grant-making decisions to panels of people \n     knowledgeable about the arts. The awards are then subject to \n     two higher levels of expert review. Most grants are awarded \n     not to individual artists or productions but to institutions \n     with a good track record. But a good track record in the arts \n     includes a willingness to take the occasional risks on a \n     promising new or controversial talent.\n       It is these risks that have gotten the Endowment in trouble \n     with demagogic politicians like Jesse Helms who will seize on \n     provocative aspects of particular exhibits or performances \n     put on by institutions receiving some Endowment support to \n     caricature the whole of the Endowment's work. The most recent \n     controversy, for example, centered on a bloodied paper towel \n     flung by a performance artist, Ron Athey, at the Walker Arts \n     Center in Minneapolis. The Endowment had awarded some \n     $100,000 to the Walker to help support its entire season. The \n     Walker in turn awarded about $150 of this money to Mr. Athey.\n       Not all great art is controversial and not all \n     controversial art is great. But themes like eroticism, \n     homosexuality and the provocative use of religious imagery \n     that so upset the Endowment's critics have been entwined with \n     great art for centuries. In recent years, the Endowment has \n     tried to play it safe on these issues to appease its \n     Congressional critics. But excessive caution shortchanges an \n     important part of the Endowment's mission.\n       The zealous and small-minded are always willing to attack \n     art and artists. But there is no reason to elevate their \n     attacks to general Government policy. To do so would be a \n     distortion of the mandate of the November election. To be \n     blunt about it, prominent New York Republicans with ties to \n     the city's extraordinary cultural institutions have an \n     obligation to see that their more rambunctious members of \n     Congress do not destroy the National Endowment for the Arts.\n                                                                    ____\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Jan. 13, 1995]\n\n                Maintain Subsidies To Support the Arts.\n\n       American voters say they want a leaner, more effective \n     government. And like most federal programs, the National \n     Endowment for the Arts could survive with less. But it would \n     be a mistake to eliminate the NEA and its $167 million \n     budget.\n       Attacking the NEA has become good symbolism for political \n     conservatives. They believe the federal government has no \n     business subsidizing the arts and they object to the choices \n     the NEA makes in choosing which artists to subsidize.\n       We disagree on both counts. In our view, government can \n     play a legitimate role in subsidizing the arts, and political \n     disagreement over which artists to subsidize is both \n     inevitable and worth it.\n       By any definition, the arts are important to the nation's \n     quality of life. There is no evidence that self-interested \n     consumers, corporations and foundations can adequately meet \n     funding needs.\n       Since the NEA was founded in 1965, grants have been awarded \n     to traditional as well as avant-garde artists. These grants \n     often serve as vital seed money for artists, projects and \n     arts organizations. For every $1 individual artists and \n     groups get from the NEA another $11 in private donations is \n     raised.\n       The arts also have positive economic impact. Museums, art \n     galleries and theaters attract tourists and conventions. On \n     an annual basis, the arts generate $37 billion in revenues, \n     employ 1.3 million people and pay $3.4 billion in various \n     taxes.\n       Eliminating federal subsidies also would cripple state and \n     local arts programs which get 35 percent of their funds from \n     the NEA. The Illinois Arts Council for example, will get \n     $896,000 or 11.7 percent of its $7.6 million budget, from the \n     NEA.\n       The world would not come to an end if the NEA were \n     eliminated. But all that would be satisfied are the political \n     aims of today's congressional leadership. In the real world, \n     the federal government is running an annual budget deficit of \n     $203 billion. Cutting $167 million for the arts would do much \n     more harm than good.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 13, 1995]\n\n                    Shunning the Yahoo Point of View\n\n                          (By Raymond Sokolov)\n\n       As the new Congress starts to debate whether to zero out \n     the pitifully small ($176 million) budget of the National \n     Endowment for the Arts, everyone should take a look at the \n     section of ``Gulliver's Travels'' where Gulliver visits the \n     Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos. The Houyhnhnms are equine \n     intellectuals, the Yahoos hairy, uncouth louts in human form. \n     In our day, while the cultivated Houyhnhnms whinny and prance \n     in futile protest, we are well on the road to becoming a \n     nation of Yahoos.\n       Christina Jeffrey's appointment as historian of the House \n     of Representatives was a warning. Speaker Gingrich was \n     rewarding her because in 1993 she had supported his attempt \n     to keep his course at Georgia's Kennesaw State College alive \n     while other faculty there were protesting it as improperly \n     contaminated with politics. But Ms. Jeffrey, an associate \n     professor of political science, was not just a complaisant \n     right-winger at a Podunk college. She was already on record \n     in \n     [[Page S1301]] 1986 denouncing a federal history program \n     about genocide because it did not include the Nazi point of \n     view on the Holocaust. When this statement resurfaced a few \n     days ago, Speaker Gingrich said he hadn't connected Ms. \n     Jeffrey with its author because she had used her maiden name \n     back then (before he met her). So, to stem the tidal wave of \n     furious public outrage, he up and canned the lady.\n       This flaplet raises several interesting questions, but the \n     most interesting is, What kind of intellectual milieu could \n     bring Speaker Gingrich and Ms. Jeffrey into contact as \n     historians?\n       Wishing to believe in the good faith of all parties, I \n     accept that the speaker did not know about the Nazi memo, \n     that he agrees with the angry protesters, and that the \n     intellectual milieu in Georgia where this odd couple found \n     common cause is exactly the kind of unenlightened backwater \n     in which the Holocaust can be blithely dismissed by a \n     professional historian as a subject primarily of interest for \n     religious discussion (as Ms. Jeffrey argued to the federal \n     government).\n       Anyone who thinks that way is an unreconstructed anti-\n     Semite, of course, but, worse still, such a person has \n     managed to remain completely untouched by the over-whelming \n     facts of history as they have been documented, discussed and \n     accepted by historians and others in the overwhelming \n     majority of mainstream America and the rest of the world. It \n     is one thing to hate Jews. Any moral dwarf can do that. But \n     it takes an especially ignorant and fact-resistant sort of \n     historian to believe that there is a viable Nazi point of \n     view on the subject.\n       But let's stop for a moment and try to take Ms. Jeffrey \n     seriously. What would the Nazi point of view on the Holocaust \n     be? Why obviously it would be a positive point of view. \n     Unlike most of us who think the sadistic incineration of six \n     million people because they had at least one Jewish \n     grandparent was among the great crimes of history, the Nazis \n     believed it was a great and necessary achievement. The Nazi \n     point of view must have been that annihilating Jews was a \n     social good for Nazi Germany and the world. And, on \n     reflection, I agree with Ms. Jeffrey that any good course on \n     the dynamics of genocide would have to include this point of \n     view, expressed as vividly as possible with documents and \n     photographs. This is actually the approach that the Holocaust \n     Museum on the Mall in Washington takes, and it is an \n     extremely effective method of discrediting the Nazi point of \n     view.\n       The trouble with Ms. Jeffrey's point of view about the Nazi \n     point of view is that she thinks the Nazi point of view has \n     real merit worth airing in a classroom. Ms. Jeffrey has \n     obviously not considered the unusual facts of the Nazi \n     record, or she wasn't interested in them. She is therefore a \n     historian outside history. She is a Yahoo.\n       Does that sound like the harrumph of a member of the \n     cultural elite? I certainly hope so, because I think that the \n     Jeffrey affair obliges people committed to the preservation \n     of our heritage to defend the idea of cultural elitism \n     against the Yahoos. If we who speak for culture retreat from \n     the fray now, we really are an effete corps of impudent \n     snobs, in Spiro Agnew's immortal phrase.\n       What we should be saying, as the fight for the National \n     Endowment budgets and their survival begins, is that the arts \n     are everybody's province, that their health is a matter of \n     highest national interest.\n       Speaker Gingrich, no doubt trying to look like a non-Yahoo \n     in an effort to assume presidential stature, recently \n     expressed his admiration for the Metropolitan Museum of Art \n     in New York and for Atlanta Opera. He should go further, if \n     he wants to shake off the hairy mantle of Georgia Yahoo. He \n     should put his (our) money where his mouth is.\n       Newt, get down and support the arts. Don't zero out the NEA \n     budget.

The tentative \n     date for hearings on reauthorizing the endowment is Jan. 20, \n     and the 104th Congress is loaded with newcomers eager to cut \n     government spending who look to Gingrich for guidance.\n       First, Alexander ought to disabuse Gingrich and his \n     following of the misconception that a significant blow can be \n     struck for deficit reduction with the demise of the \n     endowment. As vital as its support is to needy arts groups, \n     its budget--$167 million or about one ten-thousandth of all \n     federal spending in fiscal '94--is minuscule by comparison \n     with the billions in cuts required to restore fiscal sanity \n     in Washington.\n       Second, Alexander needs to counter the fiction that the \n     endowment is a plaything of the affluent and the avant-garde. \n     True, some cultural colossi, like New York's Metropolitan \n     Opera, receive funding from the endowment and have enough \n     wealthy patrons that they might be weaned without great \n     sacrifice. True, too, a few experimental artworks funded by \n     the endowment have turned out to be highly offensive, but the \n     chances of recurrences should be minimized thanks to new \n     accountability procedures instituted by Alexander.\n       The point for Alexander to stress is that if the endowment \n     were terminated, the real victims would be medium-size and \n     smaller arts organizations scattered throughout the country, \n     too little appreciated except in their own back yards. In \n     Gingrich's bailiwick, that would include Marietta's splendid \n     Theatre on the Square and by extension a host of Atlanta \n     assets--the Symphony, the Opera, the Ballet, the Center for \n     Puppetry Arts, the High Museum, the Alliance Theatre and so \n     on.\n       What these institutions have managed to do ought to be \n     celebrated by the GOP cost-cutters as a triumph of public-\n     private partnerships--leveraging each dollar of endowment \n     funding into $11 from private and other public sources. They \n     are able to attract that support mainly because recognition \n     by the endowment is widely viewed as a national seal of \n     artistic merit.\n       There are other good reasons to save the endowment--its \n     youth education mission, its anti-crime programs, even the \n     beneficial economic spinoffs from the arts attractions it \n     supports. But the clincher ought to focus on this \n     generation's legacy to posterity.\n       John Boehner of Ohio, chairman of the House GOP conference, \n     opposes the endowment because he calls it ``living high off \n     the hog and passing on the bills to our kids and grandkids.'' \n     But what kind of country will our kids and grandkids inherit \n     if the quality of our serious music, art and drama is \n     diminished and concert halls, theaters and galleries go dark \n     for want of the endowment's precious seed money?\n       No one disputes that the endowment must maximize its \n     efficiency. But above all, the NEA deserves to survive.\n                                                                    ____\n\n    [From the Washington Edition--Los Angeles Times, Jan. 11, 1995]\n\n GOP Has a Song for NEA: Taps--Some Congressional Republicans Seek To \n                     Abolish Federal Arts Endowment\n\n       What kind of art should our hard-earned tax dollars go to \n     support, traditional American folk art or sexually explicit \n     avant-garde art? ``Neither,'' the new Republican majority in \n     the House seems poised to answer. That's a shame.\n       Two years ago, the arts-funding question was shaped by the \n     scandal of Andres Serrano's ``Piss Christ,'' Robert \n     Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs and Karen Finley's nude \n     performance art, all of which had enjoyed some degree of \n     support from the National Endowment for the Arts. But even \n     though the Supreme Court struck down a ``decency clause'' \n     that the NEA imposed under pressure, the entire controversy \n     subsided as the federal agency, under the leadership of Jane \n     Alexander, simply exercised better discretion in selecting \n     artworks to endow.\n       This year, however, the philosophical ground has shifted. \n     The House Republican leadership wants to abolish the NEA on \n     principle. Its claim, a familiar conservative one, is that, \n     in the words of House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Tex.), \n     ``there is no constitutional authority for this agency to \n     exist.'' This year, as a result, federal funding for all art \n     is in equal jeopardy, including funding for such mainstream, \n     old-fashioned arts festivals as ``Masters of the Folk \n     Violin'' and ``Masters of the Steel String Guitar,'' both \n     sponsored by the National Council for Traditional Arts.\n       Plain-folks art does not cost as much money as fancy-folks \n     art. Putting together an evening of ``Sacred Harp Singing,'' \n     another NCTA effort, or the annual ``Cowboy Poetry \n     Gathering'' does not cost as much as mounting a great \n     classical ballet. But it doesn't come free, either, and the \n     NEA has spent much of its modest appropriation as seed money: \n     small matching grants and other sensible efforts to help \n     groups like the NCTA, Chicago's Old Town School of Folk Music \n     and Los Angeles' Craft and Folk Art Museum find their way to \n     private support.\n       The argument that there is no constitutional authority for \n     an educational agency such as the NEA rests on the truth that \n     the Constitution makes no provision for public education of \n     any kind. If from that fact we must infer that there can be \n     no funding for an arts endowment, then there can also be none \n     for a National Endowment for the Humanities, a National \n     Science Foundation or any other federal initiative in higher \n     education.\n       Armey and the Republican majority can argue against funding \n     the NEA even if the constitutional authority for the agency \n     exists. But if and when they do so, we hope they will not \n     pretend that only a wealthy elite has been served by the NEA, \n     for the opposite is the case. Through the NEA, the spirits of \n     millions of ordinary Americans have been lifted through the \n     traditional craft, song and story of their native land. Those \n     Americans will be spiritually poorer, and the American \n     tradition weaker, if the \n     [[Page S1302]] budget line of the NEA is spitefully reduced \n     to zero.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Dec. 17, 1994]\n\n                         America's Art and Soul\n\n       Conservatives looking for Government fat to trim say they \n     can't wait to take a cleaver to the National Endowment for \n     the Arts--That naughty, left-wing frill in the federal \n     budget. They should look and think before they chop, because \n     the NEA is hardly a luxury. It's American bedrock, as solid \n     as the summer concerts on the town green, or dance programs \n     at the local high school, or the puppet shows at the \n     community center.\n       While the NEA has hit the headlines for controversies, most \n     notably the funding for photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, the \n     endowment's primary business is supporting family-oriented \n     entertainment, about which it has received little publicity \n     since it was founded in 1965.\n       In Boston the NEA money goes to such places as the Handel \n     and Haydn Society, the Berklee College of Music, the \n     Huntington Theater Company, the Boston Ballet, the Chinese \n     Culture Institute, the Boston Center for the Arts and Boston \n     Dance Umbrella, to name a few. The list reflects a national \n     portrait of community involvement and grass-roots culture \n     that is as vitial to a country's strength as the defense \n     budget or a jobs program.\n       The NEA's budget is $167 million--approximately 65 cents \n     for every American. This investment provides 5,000 grants, \n     which put up seed money to be matched by local funding. It \n     also stimulates the economy, for the arts put 3.2 million \n     people to work and provide $3.4 billion in federal income \n     taxes. According to the NEA one study showed that the arts \n     generated $37 billion to local businesses around the country.\n       A wise investment, not only for the psyche but also for the \n     bottom line. Members of Congress eager to wield the axe \n     should consider the real work and economics of the NEA rather \n     than the aberrations that have made news. Since 1965 it has \n     provided 11,000 individual artists with fellowships--42 \n     Pulitzer Prize winners, 47 MacArthur grant recipients and 28 \n     National Book Awards authors. The grants came to people as \n     they were struggling to create their art. A country that \n     fails to encourage this loses its genius and its soul.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I fully understand that many Americans are \ntroubled when they hear of works distasteful to them that are funded in \npart with their tax dollars. Nevertheless, while the Endowment has \nawarded well over 100,000 grants, fewer than 40 have resulted in any \ncontroversy whatsoever--a success rate of 99.96 percent. Over the last \nyear Chairman Jane Alexander has instituted a series of most valuable \nchanges in the agency's procedures. The agency will no longer accept \napplications from organizations, other than the State arts councils, \nwhich subgrant Endowment funds out to other projects. In addition, the \nEndowment will now require that progress reports be submitted before \nthe release of the final third of a grant award. Permission from the \nagency will be necessary before a grantee can modify its activities \nfrom those approved by the Endowment. These changes give the chairman \ngreater oversight over Endowment grants and I believe they will go a \nlong way toward addressing the concerns of many of our citizens.\n  Chairman Jane Alexander has increased the Endowment's focus on rural \ncommunities and the inner cities. The Underserved Communities Program \ngrants $8.7 million specifically to broaden public access to the arts. \nEven the very limited funds appropriated for the Endowment help keep \nticket prices reasonable, thus enabling lower income citizens, young \npeople, the elderly, and the disabled to gain access to our common \nculture.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth than the suggestion that \nsupport for the arts provided by the National Endowment constitutes a \nsubsidy for the wealthy. One of the primary missions of the Arts \nEndowment has been to encourage the spread of American culture beyond \nthose individuals, communities, and regions affluent enough to afford \nit on their own. Uncharacteristically among Federal programs, Endowment \ndollars multiply and foster national support for the arts. Yearly \nEndowment grants draw matching grants of approximately $1.4 billion \nfrom private, State, and local patrons. Thus, before the National \nEndowment for the Arts came into existence, there were only 22 \nprofessional theaters in the entire country and 1 million people \nattended each year. Today, our Nation boasts 420 and 55 million attend. \nThere were 58 orchestras before the agency, today, there are over a \n1,000. Fifteen million more Americans attend symphony performances each \nyear.\n  I think it is rather unfair to our citizens for some individuals to \nassert that only wealthy Americans are interested in the development of \nthe arts. I firmly believe and the evidence supports the fact that \nAmericans from every walk of life, from every economic level, strongly \ndesire and seek access to cultural events in their communities for \nthemselves and for their children. The National Endowment for the Arts \nis a testament to the continuing development of our unique culture, to \nour enduring faith in our own creativity and to our world leadership in \nartistic achievement.\n  From an economic point of view, the dollars sent by the Arts \nEndowment to communities around the Nation have been an extraordinarily \nsuccessful investment. For every dollar the Endowment invests, there is \ncreated a tenfold return in jobs, services, and contracts. The arts \nfostered by the National Endowment encourage national and international \ntourism, attract and retain businesses in our communities,\n stimulate real estate development, increase production of exportable \ncopyrighted materials and contribute to the tax base. Governors and \nmayors from around the country can attest to the manner in which \nEndowment-supported projects have breathed new life into the downtown \nareas of their towns and cities. New businesses and tourists congregate \nin those areas which have a developed cultural life. San Antonio, TX; \nCleveland, OH; Greenville, MS; Oklahoma City, OK; and Birmingham, AL \nare among the cities whose studies have shown the enormous economic \ncontribution of the arts.\n\n  Mr. President, every parent knows that the arts are crucial in our \nschool curricula because they teach young people creativity, increase \nself-discipline, and are a critical means of passing on an \nunderstanding of American culture and civilization to the next \ngeneration. Study of even a single artistic discipline is of immense \nvalue to a child, who may go on to become an avid amateur or patron. \nLast year, the Arts in Education Program distributed millions of \ndollars in partnership grants to the States to pay for artist \nresidencies in schools and art teacher training.\n  I am most gratified that Chairman Kassebaum and Chairman Jeffords \nwill be holding hearings over the next few weeks on authorization of \nthe Endowments. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nshare with those of us on the committee their concerns and ideas so \nthat we can work together to shape the Endowment's future role in our \nsociety as effectively as possible. This tiny investment in our \nNation's culture makes a statement to ourselves and to the world that \nwe view the development of American culture and its availability to our \ncitizens as of significant importance. We must not become the only \nWestern industrialized nation to declare that our Government cares \nnothing for the development of our culture. National support for the \narts fosters the creation of community--locally and on the national \nlevel. Regardless of our differences of wealth, race, religion, and \npolitical belief, our cultural development binds us together, develops \nour character as Americans, and establishes our common heritage. As \nPresident John F. Kennedy once said:\n\n       Art and the encouragement of art is political in the most \n     profound sense, not as a weapon in the struggle, but as an \n     instrument of understanding the futility of the struggle \n     between those who share man's faith. Aeschylus and Plato are \n     remembered today long after the triumphs of imperial Athens \n     are gone. I am certain that after the dust of centuries has \n     passed over our cities, we too will be remembered not for \n     victories or defeats in battle or politics, but for our \n     contributions to the human spirit.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1299-5", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to curb the practice of imposing unfunded \n     Federal mandates on States and local governments; to \n     strengthen the \n     [[Page S1303]] partnership between the Federal Government and \n     State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition in \n     the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal \n     mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without \n     adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other \n     essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the \n     Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those \n     governments in complying with certain requirements under \n     Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I look forward to the beginning of \nthis week and beginning debate on S. 1, our efforts to curb these \nunfunded Federal mandates.\n  I have comments I would like to make which give an overview of the \nbill itself, what an unfunded mandate is, a couple of examples, why we \nare now on our sixth day of debate, what has transpired to this point, \nand what is the likelihood as we proceed.\n  Mr. President, because the Senator from Oregon has a time constraint, \nI would like to yield so the Senator from Oregon could make his \ncomments on S. 1 and following that then I would like to give the \noverview of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President. I am speaking today as a supporter and \noriginal cosponsor of the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. I feel \nvery strongly that this legislation before us strikes a balance between \nthe Federal Government's responsibilities: First, to acknowledge the \nburden that unfunded mandates have on State and local governments, and, \nsecond, to ensure the rights of all persons contained in the U.S. \nConstitution are protected.\n  The Federal Government has imposed over 170 unfunded laws on State \nand local governments which have resulted in thousands of unfunded \nFederal regulations. The Federal Government has not viewed itself as \ndependent on State and local governments in the past two decades.\n  I want to underscore that point, Mr. President, because we have been \ntalking about dollar obligations that are involved in these unfunded \nmandates. But much of that is because of the thousands of regulations \nthat follow these mandates. In fact, it has been estimated that perhaps \nas much as $500 billion is expended each year to administer at the \nFederal, State, and local levels mandates initiated and adopted by the \nFederal Government.\n  The major policies of the Federal Government have reflected a \nWashington D.C.-based arrogance; ``we''--``we'' the Federal legislators \nand ``we'' the bureaucrats--know best how to solve the problems of the \ncountry. In many respects, the Federal Government has overstepped its \nbounds in its relationship with State and local governments, and the \nintergovernmental system has ceased to function. This problem became \nvery clear over the recent debate over health care. Washington believed \nit could prescribe a solution with a single piece of legislation. This \napproach was not the answer to health care problems and it is not the \nanswer to any issue that requires intergovernmental cooperation.\n  I have received numerous letters from national organizations praising \nthis legislation for making the decisionmaking process for future \nFederal proposals and regulations more open, accountable, and informed. \nThe number of letters and the diversity of groups which have written in \nsupport of this legislation speak to its importance to our Nation.\n  More importantly, this national support is joined by hundreds of \nletters of endorsement from local governments throughout the State of \nOregon. In the past few years, officials from local governments have \nwritten to me about the problems that unfunded mandates pose for Oregon \ncommunities. While the letters ask for support of mandate relief, they \nalso note the need for Congress to make more informed decisions related \nto mandates for State and local governments. The Unfunded Mandate \nReform Act of 1995 addresses both of those issues.\n  My support for this legislation does not mean I will turn my back on \nmy responsibility to uphold the Constitution to ensure all persons are \ntreated equally in this country or protected from health and safety \nrisks, and, of course, civil rights. We must not forget what good the \nCongress has done for people throughout history, including passing \ncivil rights laws, voting rights laws, and ensuring the rights of the \ndisabled through the Americans With Disabilities Act. Some--and I would \nsay probably most--may view these bills as unfunded mandates, \ntechnically. I view them as the Federal Government playing its proper \nrole in ensuring persons that their rights, their constitutional rights \nand their civil rights, as guaranteed under the Constitution prevail.\n  We must also remember that the same Federal Government which has \nmandated certain actions in the past, is also ready to help citizens \nwho have suffered enormous loses in the recent flooding in the State of \nCalifornia and earthquakes in California. It was not so long ago that \nmy State was hit with an earthquake which caused severe damage--and \nthat same Federal Government provided relief and assistance to \nliterally thousands of people in need. The Federal Government does have \nan important role to play in this country, and we should not dismiss it \nlightly.\n  Mr. President, while the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act looks into the \nfuture at new unfunded mandates, it does not look back at the current \nregulatory burdens that are imposed on State and local governments in \naddressing the needs of their citizens. We must look back as well as \nforward, and that is why I introduced S. 88, the Local Empowerment and \nFlexibility Act of 1995, on the first day of this Congress. The need to \nprovide flexibility to local and State governments is enormous, and \nthat is why I submit S. 88 as an amendment to the unfunded mandates \nbill before us.\n                           Amendment No. 181\n\n(Purpose: To increase the overall economy and efficiency of Government \n    operations and enable more efficient use of Federal funding, by \nenabling local governments and private, nonprofit organizations to use \n    amounts available under certain Federal assistance programs in \n           accordance with approved local flexibility plans)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 181.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Local Empowerment and Flexibility \nAct is designed to create a new spirit of cooperation among Federal, \nState, and local governments. It is important to remember that the \nsolution to the problems in our intergovernmental system is a \nrecognition that all of our bodies of government--Federal, State, \nlocal, and school districts--are interdependent. Each part of our \nsystem brings special talents, special skills, and special needs to the \nservice of the people of the United States. It is time to transform the \nFederal-State-local relationship. This transformation must build on the \nstrengths of all of the different governments in our country and must \nbe based on trust, cooperation, and flexibility.\n  The Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act will lead to strategic and \nrealistic decentralization and deconcentration of power throughout the \nGovernment. The idea behind this legislation has four key aspects.\n  First, different governments of this Nation have different strengths. \nThe Federal Government does two things well: Effectively establishing \nbroad goals that tie us together as a Nation; and achieving certain \neconomies of scale which cannot be attained at the local level. The \nFederal Government often forgets that local governments bring a great \ndeal of resources to the table. Perhaps the greatest strength is that \nStates and local governments are innovators. Local and State \ngovernments have demonstrated again and again that they find the most \ncreative ways to tackle problems in solutions \n[[Page S1304]] that fit the local context. This legislation recognizes \nthe fundamental interdependence of governments and builds on the \nstrengths of all governments that deliver services.\n  I might note that many of our national laws that we feel today \nperhaps even originated at the national level did not do so. They were \ntried. They were experimented with. They were created by local \ngovernments at the State level, particularly Social Security, \nunemployment compensation, industrial accident compensation, and civil \nrights. Many of these things were tried at the local level as part of \nthe creative nature of our federalism, our whole idea of federalism.\n  Second, the Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act will not only \npermit variation in how local governments meet national goals, but will \nencourage solutions that best fit the local context. Federal laws and \nregulations have tended to treat every area of the country the same. \nUniversal requirements force Congress to legislate to the lowest common \ndenominator, and consequently, few governments perform to their full \ncapability.\n  We are penalizing the progressive States like my own State in order \nto find that common denominator. We all strive to meet the average \ninstead of to excel. Politically, socially, structurally, local and \nState governments are very different from one another. Why should the \nFederal Government declare that citizens in Oregon have the same needs \nas people in Florida, Kansas, or Maine? Adding flexibility to the \nFederal-State relationship will encourage local governments to find \nsolutions that fit the local context. In addition, providing \nflexibility will eliminate regulations that force local governments to \nsolve problems that they do not have.\n  Third, this legislation will create a new system of accountability. \nCurrently, the Federal Government holds State and local governments \naccountable through regulation, procedures, and paperwork. The existing \naccountability structure is very good at determining where Federal \nmoney is spent,\n but it tells us very little about whether we are actually achieving \nresults. Hundreds of hours and dollars are invested in complying with \nthese regulations, and the investment in bureaucratic processes does \nnothing to improve the quality of services that we deliver to citizens. \nMoreover, our current structure of accountability has made us very \nresponsive to each other. That is, we are responsive bureaucrat to \nbureaucrat at all levels of our government, rather than to the people \nwho we serve. We need to reorient our system of government and to view \ntaxpayers as investors and our citizens as customers.\n\n  Fourth, we must help retool all new governments for this new \nrelationship. We need to reequip our Nation's governments to function \nin a new, cooperative environment. The Federal bureaucracies need to \nrecreate the ability to listen to local governments. In the 1980's, we \nwitnessed the destruction of the intergovernmental affairs offices at \nmost Federal agencies. They were supposed to be the focal point of \ncooperation, of listening. The Federal Government must actively solicit \nand use the ideas and experience of State and local governments.\n  I believe these two bills, Senate bills No. 1 and No. 88, strive to \naccomplish many of the same goals, including better informing the \nlegislative process in Congress, stressing the need for flexibility for \nState and local governments to better meet the needs of the people they \nserve in an efficient and effective manner, and making it a goal that \nthe Federal Government actively seek out and consult with State and \nlocal governments through the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, I commend those who have worked so diligently in \nbringing this legislation before us, especially the author, Senator \nKempthorne of Idaho. It is important that the balance contained in this \nlegislation I alluded to earlier be kept intact. It is equally \nimportant that we pass this legislation.\n  As it is not my intention to bog down this important bill, I want to \nindicate that at a particular moment in time I will withdraw my \namendment. I will, however, pursue action on Senate bill No. 88 at the \nearliest opportunity. I am very hopeful that I can get the ear and the \nattention of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I will personally \nvisit with Senator Roth, the chairman of that committee, and the \nranking member, in order to get some assurance that this proposal, \nwhich has had its experience proven by the experience in my State of \nOregon.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator \nfrom Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for the common sense and wisdom of what he \njust stated. I know in our case, in Idaho, we know that Atlanta, ID, of \na few hundred people is quite different from Atlanta, GA, of a million \npeople. We have to have flexibility. The requirements have to fit. I \nhave met with Senator Hatfield in his office and discussed the proposal \nand I was taken by the common sense of it, and by the enthusiasm by \nwhich he is proceeding with this. Again, I thank the Senator from \nOregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, we now have before us Senate bill No. \n1, our efforts to curb unfunded Federal mandates.\n  This begins now the sixth day of debate on this bill. During the \ncourse of the debate, we had concerns that were expressed because \ncommittee reports were not available. That has been rectified. So all \nMembers of the Senate now have committee reports in their possession, \nwhich they have had the opportunity to read. It is, through the \nprocess, necessary for us to deal with any committee amendments that \nwere added in through either the Governmental Affairs Committee or the \nBudget Committee. We have taken those. Whereas, in some instances, \ncommittee amendments will be agreed to, en bloc, with this particular \nbill, it was necessary because of concerns expressed by Members of the \nSenate that we take them one at a time. We have now dealt with all of \nthose committee amendments, so that we now have the actual language of \nthe bill before us and we can begin discussing the amendments that \nMembers of the Senate would like to suggest be made part of this bill. \nThere are something like 60 amendments that we have been notified may \nbe brought forward.\n  We talk about an unfunded mandate, but what does that really mean? \nWell, the definition is that it is an enforced, nonvoluntary duty \nimposed by the Federal Government on State and local governments, \ntribal governments, or the private sector. Enforced, nonvoluntary.\n  In doing that, the Federal Government has not followed the practice \nof providing the funds to carry out those responsibilities of those new \nFederal programs. The reality is that it precludes State and local \nofficials from being able to set their own priorities. Again, as a \nformer mayor, I know when we would begin a new year and talk about our \npriorities, we knew full well that those priorities that we thought \nwere important at the local level would be impacted by what the Federal \nGovernment then sent down as an unfunded Federal mandate saying, ``You \nwill do this.'' You do not have a choice and you will provide the funds \nto do it. Oftentimes, cities and counties, for example, have no \nrecourse but to use local property taxes to pay for these unfunded \nFederal programs.\n  It is estimated that anywhere between 10 and 15 percent of a local \ncommunity's budget right off the top goes to pay for the Federal \nprograms. At the State level, I have heard numbers as high as 25 and 35 \npercent right off the top that must go to pay for these Federal \nmandates. What are the costs of these mandates? Well, I think the \nAmerican public has now come to realize that while we have practiced \nthe imposition of these unfunded mandates, Congress has not been \nrequired to ask before making a decision, ``How much do these cost?'' \nThey are multimillion and multibillion dollars in size and, yet, our \npractice has been that someone might ask as we are voting during that \n15-minute period, ``Does there happen to be a mandate in here and does \nanybody have an idea as to how much it might be?'' because it was not \nrequired.\n  [[Page S1305]] I find it amazing because I cannot think of businesses \nor many other entities that can make multimillion-dollar decisions and \nnot know the impact or dollar amount before they make those decisions. \nSo, really, these take on the nature of a hidden Federal tax paid for \nby local property taxes. In Moscow, ID, it was pointed out that during \n1994, local property taxes and user fees went up 73.5 percent because \nof unfunded Federal mandates; a 73-percent increase. In Boise, ID, at a \nwater treatment facility it was determined by the Federal Government \nthat the standards needed to be adjusted. In order to do that, it \nrequired that that treatment facility had to be reconstructed at a cost \nof $15.5 million. Now, that cost of the reconstruction was not done \nbecause of any health risk, because of any increase in customer load, \nand was not done for any greater efficiency for the delivery of water; \nit was done because a Federal standard was adjusted. And so the \nratepayers had a 30-percent rate increase.\n  From Kooskia, ID, which is a community of just a few hundred people, \nI received this letter the other day from Inge Stickney, who is the \nmayor of Kooskia, ID. She started off by saying:\n\n       On C-SPAN today, I listened to you as did a lot of my \n     neighbors. Many phone calls later, all of us agreed that you \n     served us and the State of Idaho very well today.\n       The unfunded mandates are not only an impossible burden for \n     all of us to carry, most of them are senseless.\n       Nobody wants to cut down the last tree, we all want clean \n     air and good, clear water. Reality is that more and more \n     people are going to require that much more of those precious \n     resources. No amount of preservation will save this planet \n     for humankind until we face the facts, all of which you well \n     know.\n       I am mayor of Kooskia, a small logging town in Idaho \n     county. It is of the greatest concern to me to where we are \n     headed in the 21st century. Our small town has spent \n     thousands of dollars on water tests which do not reflect our \n     geological area. With our revenue declining, we struggle to \n     be in compliance with State and Federal laws, some of which \n     make no sense and cost too much.\n       As a private small trailer court owner, I am facing the \n     loss of a business which was supposed to see us through our \n     older years. I am 68 years young now. I cannot afford water \n     testing costs in excess of thousands of dollars yearly. We \n     have 15 trailer spaces and three one-bedroom apartments. We \n     charge $50 per trailer space and $125 for the apartments. \n     Most of our renters have been there for many years. They are \n     old people who live on a monthly income averaging below $500 \n     per month. We do not make enough money off this small court \n     to pay for the expensive tests. We have an excellent well \n     with beautifully clean water, never had trouble with the well \n     water. The EDQ people told me to raise the rent. Well, for \n     our renters, even $5 more a month is a problem. The EDQ \n     people told me to sell * * *, well, where will those people \n     go?\n       Because we have another income, we have chosen to maintain \n     status quo for now. We are willing to do everything we can to \n     comply with all laws, as long as we can afford it.\n\n  I think this drives the point home, Mr. President. In Kooskia, ID, a \nsmall business operator who happens to be the mayor of Kooskia, with a \ntrailer community of 15 trailers, and some people in Government are \nsaying, ``Well, if you can't afford it, then you should sell.'' Well, \nif Inge sells, the next owner is going to have to raise the cost of the \nrental on those trailer spaces and then, really, these people that live \nthere and have lived there for years, many of whom are retired loggers \nand farmers, will not have much choice. It will push it beyond their \nincome. It may push it to the point that they then need to have \nGovernment help in order to continue their livelihood.\n  But, that shows you the extent of the decisions that we make here at \nthe Federal level. Therefore, I think it is incumbent upon us to have \nas much information as is meaningful before we cast these votes. So \nthat is what S. 1 is all about.\n  To give you just an overview of the process, the first thing that \nhappens is that the committee considering this proposed legislation \nwill notify the Senate Budget Committee of its intent to consider the \nlegislation so that the Congressional Budget Office can begin the \nprocess of assembling the statistical data to develop cost estimates.\n  Next, at the request of the chairman or ranking member of any House \nor Senate committee, the Congressional Budget Office shall study this \nlegislation for its cost impact. In doing that study, CBO will consult \nwith State and local elected officials--the very people that are going \nto be impacted--firsthand so that we have their input at that stage of \nthe process.\n  Also, Federal agencies are to provide the Congressional Budget Office \nwith the information and assistance it needs to fulfill its cost-\nestimating responsibilities. I expect that most committees would take \nadvantage of this provision because they will be charged with cost \ninformation that they will need to ultimately write the bill. That is \nwhy S. 1 enhances this whole process.\n  Next, the committees will have hearings, and all interests, both \npublic and private, will have an opportunity to express their views. \nBoth public and private interests will make known if they have concerns \nabout this proposed legislation that the committee is considering.\n  At any time during the process, committees have a choice. They can \neither seek to comply with the provisions of S. 1, meaning that they \nwill get the cost estimates and funding for public sector mandates; or \nthey can decide that they wish to have a waiver of this process. And if \na majority of this body agrees with that, then the waiver is granted.\n  Committees will then markup the bill. And for the first time, \ncommittees will know that the Congressional Budget Office has looked at \ncost mandates to both the public and private sectors and that State and \nlocal officials were consulted in that process. Armed with this \ninformation, committees can decide, again, either to seek the waiver of \nthe point of order, or it can decide to provide direct spending for \neach fiscal year or to provide an increase in receipts or to identify a \nsubsequent and specific appropriations bill that will fund the mandate.\n  I want to emphasize a key point here. S. 1 says that authorizing \ncommittees should be responsible for funding the mandates that they \nestablish. We keep the responsibility for the funding of these mandates \non the authorizing committees, which is where the mandates originate.\n  Suppose the appropriators--we have the authorizers and then, of \ncourse, the appropriators--that provide the actual money do not fund \nthe mandates? S. 1 takes that issue into account. In the authorizing \nbill, committees need to do two additional tasks: Designate the agency \nresponsible for establishing procedures for imposing less costly \nresponsibilities on State and local governments to meet the objectives \nof the mandate to the extent that appropriations may pay for the \nmandate; or designate a responsible Federal agency and establish the \ncriteria and procedures to declare the mandate ineffective on October 1 \nof the fiscal year.\n  Once committees have approved legislation that includes Federal \nmandates, they must submit the legislation to the Congressional Budget \nOffice and identify mandates contained in the bill.\n  Once committees have approved legislation that includes Federal \nmandates, they must submit accompanying committee reports that identify \nand describe the Federal mandates in the bill.\n  The committee report must also state the degree to which a Federal \nmandate affects both the public and private sectors, the extent to \nwhich Federal payment of public sector costs would affect a competitive \nbalance between State and local governments and the private sector, and \nwhether there are any adverse impacts to the private sector as a result \nof the funding modification or termination of public sector mandates.\n  Next, if the bill contains any intergovernmental mandates, the \ncommittee report must include a statement of the amount, if any, of an \nincrease or decrease in the amount of authorization of appropriations \nto pay for the mandate, whether the committee intends for the mandate \nto be partly or entirely funded, and sources of funding to pay for the \nmandate.\n  Again, if it is a mandate on the public sector that exceeds $50 \nmillion annually, then the Federal Government should provide the funds \nfor that.\n  Committees must also include a cost estimate from the CBO director in \ncommittee reports.\n  The Congressional Budget Office must estimate the direct costs of all \nintergovernmental mandates that exceed $50 million in any of the 4 \nfiscal years following the first year funds are \n[[Page S1306]] provided; the amount, if any, of increase in \nauthorization or appropriations under existing Federal financial \nprograms that will be used to pay for the mandates that are contained \nin the bill; and the amount of private sector mandates in excess of \n$200 million a year.\n  If the committee fulfills all of these requirements, then this point \nof order does not lie against the bill.\n  I will also make the point, Mr. President, that the point of order is \nnot self-initiating. A Member of the Senate must proceed in making the \npoint of order.\n  Mr. President, a very important point, and that is, this bill is not \nretroactive. It does not affect existing mandates that are currently in \nplace and on the books.\n  While I say that, Mr. President, I would like to make this point. \nWhen we say this bill is not retroactive, I think the debate has been \nretroactive. I have found so often while we have debated this bill, the \ndifferent occasions when you may have Members on this side of the aisle \nor Members on that side of the aisle who will stand up and say, ``But \ndon't you remember back in 1974 when your side did this?'' ``Oh, yes, \nbut don't you remember back in 1979 when your side did this?'' ``Yes, \nbut that is because you had done this to us previous to that.''\n  Mr. President, I think that the debate should not be retroactive. \nThis piece of legislation is bipartisan. We have 63 Senators that have \nput their name on this bill saying this is a bill they are proud of and \nthey want to go forward. It was developed by the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Governmental Affairs Committee, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, my office, and many, many people from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I will close by just issuing this invitation to all \nSenators that have amendments that have been filed at the desk, or \nnotified us of amendments, that, to the extent and as early as \npossible, you make copies of those amendments available to us so that \nwe could determine those amendments that we find acceptable, that make \nimprovements to this bill, so that we could move on through this list \nof 60-plus amendments and get to the point that we can have the final \ndiscussion and final vote on S. 1, our efforts to curb unfunded Federal \nmandates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I had noticed three amendments to this \nlegislation and had sent them to the desk early Friday morning. So they \nhave been properly filed and called relative to a unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  I inquire of the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Ohio--I \nwould very much like to proceed, as well. I think the points made by a \nnumber of Senators are well taken. I am very interested in proceeding \nto debate the amendments that I have offered and vote on those \namendments.\n  Let me ask if it is appropriate to call up one of the amendments and \nwe could set it aside. I know there is at least one other Senator who \nwishes to speak on at least one of my amendments. If other Senators are \ninterested in speaking on the amendment I would call up first, then we \ncould call for a vote on that amendment and have it after 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. GLENN. Parliamentary inquiry. As I understand our situation, \namendments can be called up today, we can debate them during the day, \nbut it is just that no votes will occur until after 4 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, but there is an \namendment by Senator Hatfield.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, has that order been set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not at this point.\n  Mr. GLENN. Would we need to formally set that aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unanimous consent would have to be requested.\n  Mr. GLENN. So that we can get on with the business of the Senate on \nthis, I ask unanimous consent that the Hatfield amendment be \ntemporarily set aside so we can continue with debate on other \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 180\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the treatment of Federal requirements for the \n             utilization of metric systems of measurement)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan) for himself, \n     Mrs. Kassebaum, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered \n     180.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 38 after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 205. TERMINATION OF REQUIREMENTS FOR METRIC SYSTEM OF \n                   MEASUREMENT\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsections (b) and (c) and \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, no department, \n     agency, or other entity of the Federal Government may require \n     that any State, local, or tribal government utilize a metric \n     system of measurement.\n       (b) Exception.--A department, agency, or other entity of \n     the Federal Government may require the utilization of a \n     metric system of measurement by a State, local, or tribal \n     government in a particular activity, project, or transaction \n     that is pending on the date of the enactment of this Act if \n     the head of such department, agency, or other entity \n     determines that the termination of such requirement with \n     respect to such activity, project, or transaction will result \n     in a substantial additional cost to the Federal Government in \n     such activity, project, or transaction.\n       (c) Sunset.--Subsection (a) shall cease to be effective on \n     October 1, 1997.\n       On page 41, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (4) Treatment of requirements for metric systems of \n     measurement.--\n       (A) Treatment.--For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), the \n     Commission shall consider requirements for metric systems of \n     measurement to be unfunded Federal mandates.\n       (B) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``requirements \n     for metric systems of measurement'' means requirements of the \n     departments, agencies, and other entities of the Federal \n     Government that State, local, and tribal governments utilize \n     metric systems of measurement.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me describe this amendment. But before \nI do, let me also explain that I intend to speak and, hopefully, offer \ntwo amendments today. I have three amendments that I have noticed, one \nof which I will hold until tomorrow. The two amendments I hope we can \nconsider today--and I would like to receive a vote on both--are this \namendment, which is the issue of mandating the metric system \nrequirements on State, local, and tribal governments. I will discuss \nthis amendment in a moment.\n  The other amendment relates to the ultimate mandate which may occur \nthis week: That is, the Federal Reserve will meet again and mandate \nincreased interest rates in our country. And my amendment with respect \nto the Federal Reserve is very simple. It simply says that when the \nFederal Reserve Board meets, as always in secret, and mandates an \nincrease in interest rates that will affect virtually all Americans, \nthat within 30 days of taking that action they shall submit to the \nCongress and submit to the President a report assessing how much that \nmandate has cost the Federal Government in interest payments on the \ndebt, and has cost State and local governments and the rest of the \nprivate sector. So that will be the second amendment I will offer.\n  Again, I have no intention of delaying these things. I would very \nmuch like to offer them and debate them. There are a number of Senators \nwho want to speak on the Federal Reserve Board amendment. My intention \nwill be to move forward these two amendments, and vote on them.\n  Let me, if I can, describe the metric system amendment that I have \ncalled up.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Based on your comments--and I appreciate them--this \nis how we need to proceed. Would the Senator be willing to enter into a \ntime agreement?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would enter into a time agreement on \nboth amendments, but before I do that, give me a little time to check \nwith the other folks who want to speak. I would not expect either \namendment to take a great length of time. Let me, if I \n[[Page S1307]] might, speak on the amendment I have called up first. \nSenator Kassebaum and Senator Reid may wish to speak and I do not know \nwho else wants to speak on the metric system amendment. I do not expect \nto consume a great deal of time. At the conclusion of both amendments I \nwill ask for a recorded vote on each.\n  Let me describe the amendment with respect to the metric conversion. \nThis country, some many years ago, decided that it wanted to proceed to \nenforce the utilization of the metric system of measurement in our \ncountry. I do not have any strong feelings one way or the other about \nthe metric system of measurement. I do have some feelings about the \nFederal Government's enforcement of it in a manner that really defies \ncommon sense.\n  We can, it seems to me, get to the point where the Federal Government \nsays we shall move toward the metric system of measurement and we will \nenforce that by requiring the Federal Government to be the leader. What \nwe do at the Federal level is tell the Department of Transportation we \nwould like the Department to go out in the country and tell all the \nStates to take down all their green highway signs that say how many \nmiles it is to the next rest stop or how many miles it is to the next \noff ramp on the highway. We replace those signs with signs that tell \nthe American people how many kilometers it is to the next rest stop or \nto the next exit or ramp.\n  I have been in Congress for 14 years and I have yet to have a \nconstituent write to me and ask if we could not please make some \nadjustment in the road signs. I have not had a constituent tell me it \nbothers them they cannot get into their car and access information \nabout kilometers to the next rest stop or fuel stop. Not one \nconstituent has ever indicated to me that that is a major problem.\n  But the Federal Government says that there is a problem and here is \nthe solution. The solution is we spend money to take down the English \nsigns and put up metric signs.\n  This controversy brings me to the floor today. I will give another \nexample of one little project. We are trying to build some houses, the \nmoney for which has already been appropriated to house health service \nworkers on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation, workers that are \ndesperately needed to staff a health service center that is being built \nto address very serious health problems on this Indian reservation.\n  The problem is that they do not have housing available and we need to \nbuild some housing units. So, money was appropriated to do that. The \nplans, then, to build the houses proceeded. But then we discover that \nthese houses, I believe it is some 20-housing units, to house health \nservice workers, have to be built in the metric system on the Turtle \nMountain Indian Reservation.\n  Why? Because a Federal agency says they must. It is an enforced \nmandate. What is the consequence of that? The consequence is that it \nwill cost more and it will take longer. The consequence is that if we \nhave contractors up there that do not have workers skilled in using \nmetric measurements, we have to get contractors from somewhere else. If \nwe have suppliers that cannot supply in metric units, we buy from \nsomewhere else.\n  This does not make any sense. Does it make sense for General Motors \nto use the metric system when it is engaged in commerce in other \ncountries, selling products where the metric system is standard? Of \ncourse it does, and they do. The market system tells them what to do \nand when to do it. But there is no market system I know of that says \nthe Federal Government ought to enforce a metric system when building a \nfew houses on an Indian reservation in a manner allowing us in the end \nto say this cost more and took longer because we want to satisfy a \nrequirement that someone had some time ago to say we want to enforce \nthe Metric Conversion Act.\n  Senator Kassebaum, Senator Reid and I are proposing a 2-year \nmoratorium on any Federal department or agencies requiring State, \nlocal, and tribal government to use the metric system of measurement.\n  I am not suggesting we go back and revisit everything that has been \ndone, but I am saying that in the next 2 years we should ask the \ncommission that will study all Federal mandates to also evaluate the \nconsequences and the costs of requiring the metric system of \nmeasurement on State, local, and tribal governments and who will bear \nthose costs.\n  My amendment would impose a moratorium on metric mandates to State, \nlocal, and tribal governments for a 2-year period. During that period \nthe Commission that is called for to study mandates in this legislation \nwill study and evaluate and report to Congress the cost of metric \nmandates.\n  There are some who will argue that ``we have been through this debate \nand the metric system makes good sense.'' I will not contest that. The \npoint I am making today is not that there are not some areas in this \ncountry where we already have moved to the metric systemn and where we \nwill continue to convert to the metric system in the future. My point \nis when we are short of money and when we are discussing unfunded \nmandates, I would like us at the same time to at least put the brakes \non this conversion--a conversion manifested by virtually every Federal \nagency with a metric enforcement officer.\n  From my perspective, requiring the few little houses up on the Turtle \nMountain Indian Reservation to use the metric system is a good example \nwhy some good ideas do not make much sense and have an impractical \nimpact on some small projects out in the country.\n  My hope is that the Senator from Idaho and others reviewing this \namendment will decide that a 2-year moratorium will make some sense. \nAgain, I am not repealing the Metric Conversion Act nor am I suspending \nall metric conversion activities in the Federal Government. I am simply \nasking for a 2-year moratorium to have the very Commission we are \ndescribing in this bill study it and report back to us.\n  This is a classic mandate, one which I think we should address. As I \nhave said before, Senator Kassebaum and Senator Reid will be over to \nsupport this legislation, as well. I will be happy, after I consult \nwith their offices, to reach a time agreement so we can get a time \ncertain on this.\n  I will be happy to yield the floor at this point.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nis there any estimate as to how much costs have been sent to the States \nto comply with the metric law as passed and as now being administered?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Ohio, I have no estimate of \nthat. That is part of the problem and part of what has caused this \nlegislation to come to the floor today. We have very little information \nabout who does what and on whom our various costs are imposed. That is \nwhy I simply want to just suspend metric mandates for 2 years.\n  I should say to the Senator from Ohio, there is an exception here. If \nyou have an agency or other entity of the Federal Government with a \nproject that is well down the road, and the termination of the metric \nrequirement they now have with respect to that project would result in \nsubstantial additional costs, the project would be able to continue. I \ndo not intend to interrupt that at all. I do not know what metric \nmandates are costing State and local governments. That is precisely why \nI think it would be useful to have this Commission study it for 2 \nyears.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will look at this later today, and we \nwill listen attentively as others speak on this subject pro and con, \nbut let me give you my impression of the metric bill that was passed \nsome years ago.\n  I supported it then, for a very good reason; I thought and still \nthink that we have to become more metric literate in this country and \nmore competitive in this particular area in our worldwide commerce. So \nit takes on a new relevance to me when we are moving with GATT and all \nthe increased international trade that expands every year that we have \nmore of our businesses, particularly small business, for example, that \nbecome metric literate so they can compete in the international \nmarketplace.\n  My distinguished colleague mentions some of the manufacturing that \ngoes on. I think where you have the big \n[[Page S1308]] international manufacturers of Ford and GM and Chrysler, \nand others, they already have moved into metric because it is required \nin the international marketplace, and to do business, they have to have \nmetric.\n  So they have moved in that area. One reason I supported this \nlegislation earlier--and, in fact, was interested enough in it I made a \nnomination to the metric board--one of our newspaper editors in Ohio, \nPaul Block out of Toledo, the Toledo Blade, was very interested in this \nmetric conversion. He was a scientist in his own right, a chemist, and \nwas concerned that we be competitive in the international marketplace \nand that we move to metric as most of the rest of the world has; that \nwe are not completely alone in our adherence to the old English \nmeasuring system, and so on. We are certainly in the minority of the \nmajor manufacturing areas of the world in not basing our manufacturing \non a metric system.\n  We have seen our major industries convert, but I have been encouraged \nthat we seek more metric literacy so that our students and our people \ngrowing up understand it better and understand how a kilogram relates \nto a pound and all the other measures and the number of screw threads \nper inch or per centimeter that is important in manufacturing. So I \nhave supported this.\n  I would be interested if there are any figures, or if other speakers \ntoday on this particular amendment can provide any figures as to cost \nestimates of how much costs have been increased to the States by this \nparticular piece of legislation.\n  It was my impression, and I would have to go back and check the law \non this, that the road signs that were referred to by my colleague were \nonly required to have metric on them if replaced. It was not a \nrequirement that the States take down every road sign and go out and \nhave metric on every single road sign. I thought that it was as those \nroad signs had to be replaced, which was over a period of time, that \nthen metric had to be included on them. I may be wrong on that. We have \nto go back and check the requirements on it.\n  I would be particularly interested in any cost estimates as to how \nmuch this has cost the States to comply with this mandate.\n  Let me say something else. I visit schools in Ohio on a reasonably \nregular basis. I have been encouraged to go into some of these \nclassrooms and find out now for the first time they are requiring \nstudents to get into the metric system and really understand it, not \njust as some passing thing where you can look up in a book how to \nconvert, but actually use it and understand it.\n  That bodes very well for the future because as these students come \nout and move into business themselves, they are far more literate in \nthis area and much more able to conduct business in the area of \ninternational commerce than they otherwise would be.\n  So I would be interested in any estimates of costs that have been \nincurred or estimates thereof that we could use in this debate today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I observe that the appetite for agencies \nto enforce is a never-ending appetite. I would not expect the Senator \nfrom Ohio has a great deal of faith in the bureaucracy looking at \nenforcing mandates and then deciding, ``Well, let's do this in a \ncommonsense way; let's do this only when the highway sign wears out so \nwe have one highway sign that says `Next exit 30 kilometers' and then 2 \nmiles later, another highway sign that says `Next exit 18 miles.'''\n  What happened there? One sign had worn out and the other sign had \nnot. So you have a highway that has kilometers and miles.\n  The fact is, the Department of Transportation and the enforcement \nofficers intent on enforcing this have a scheme in mind of tearing down \nthe highway signs that exist and putting up metric signs accross the \ncountry. The problem is, that costs an enormous amount of money. It \ncosts the American taxpayers a substantial amount of money they ought \nnot have to spend.\n  All of the things the Senator from Ohio said I largely agree with. It \nis in this country's best interest, where it is engaged in \ninternational trade, to trade in units where those with whom we are \ntrading are using those common units. In many cases, that is the metric \nsystem.\n In trade-sensitive industries, they have long since converted to \nmetric. But you get a perverse result, it seems to me, when we have an \nenforcement mechanism in the Federal Government to require State, \nlocal, and tribal governments to convert to metric.\n\n  That is my only point. I really believe that every good idea is taken \nto the end of its pendulum swing by someone whose belief it is to be an \nenforcement officer. I would like us to find out what is the answer to \nthe question the Senator from Ohio raised. What is the ultimate cost to \nthe taxpayer? And then maybe we can evaluate the cost-benefit with \nrespect to a mandate.\n  So that is the purpose of my amendment. Again, I have no quarrel with \nthe notion that in order to trade internationally we ought to deal in \nthose units. Last week, we discovered with last month's trade figures \nthat this year we well have the worst trade deficit in the history of \ncivilization. Not just this country, but the worst trade deficit anyone \nin the world has ever known. So it may just be that with that kind of \ntrade strategy and those kinds of trade deficits, we will someday, of \ncourse, be directed to do certain things by others who now have enough \nAmerican dollars in their pockets to order mandates in this country \nthat they choose. But my hope is that we will straighten out this trade \nmess and redefine what global responsibilities are long before we get \nto that point.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio for his comments and think that we do \nnot disagree on the merits of using the metric system where it is \nimportant and where it is useful for the interests of this country or, \nconversely, the merits of using the English system of measurement where \nthat is important and where that is useful to the interests of this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, in response, I do not know who the Senator \nreferred to as those who are scheming, as he put it, to go beyond what \nwas originally intended with this law. If there are those in the \nagencies who are doing exactly that, then we have to disabuse them of \nthat and bring them up short in a very short period of time.\n  I am interested in what the law actually provided, period. What we \nrequired the States to do, what we required schools to do, \nuniversities, whatever. We gave some latitude to the metric board, the \ncommission that was formed to administer this. But as far as other \npeople being able to scheme to force the States to take highway signs \ndown or to force action like that, quite apart from what was provided \nin the law, then I think we ought to be very careful of that. We all \ncould give chapter and verse of examples where the people over in the \nagencies writing the rules and regulations pursuant to well-intentioned \nlegislation passed here in the Congress go too far and they have to be \nbrought up short.\n  There are two ways we do that in our regular, normal scheme of things \nin Government. One, all the regulations are to be submitted to the \nOffice of Management and Budget and the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs, and they are to pass on what rules and regulations \nare legitimate and permit them to go forward and make sure at that \npoint, at OMB and OIRA, the requirements of law are being carried out \nand nothing more.\n  So we do not propose to let the people over in the executive branch \nof Government in a particular agency administer the laws up here to \ntheir own liking. And if that is being done, then I will join my \ndistinguished colleague today or any time in the future in seeing that \nwe bring them up short on that and make sure they do not go beyond the \nrealm of what was in the law itself as written here and what the \nlegislative history shows is the intent of the law. If they are going \nbeyond that and requiring things that the law as written and signed \ninto law by the President did not provide, then we should stop them \nimmediately.\n  So I would join him in that effort here. But I have not seen any \nevidence \n[[Page S1309]] yet that that really is a major problem. I have not \nheard any real major complaint from the States in that regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might make one additional comment, \nthere are some areas where the mandate will require someone to pay more \nand take more time because there is a conversion and some areas where \nit will not. Let me give you an example with respect to the highway \nsigns.\n  The taxpayer is the one who pays for the replacement of the highway \nsigns. Whether it is the taxpayer paying Federal taxes or State taxes \nprobably has less importance to the taxpayer because they still have to \npay the taxes.\n  In August 1993, DOT announced in a notice in the Federal Register \nthat ISTEA now permitted Federal aid to reimburse States for costs that \nwill be incurred when they install the metric highway signs.\n  What they said is we are now prepared to give you funds for \nconverting those signs. They are not talking old signs or new signs. \nThey are saying here are the funds available, and of course what they \nwill do is find devices to say there are no funds, there is no cost to \nthis mandate. But this is a mandate. Go do this.\n  My point is I do not want the American taxpayers to have to be paying \nout of any pocket for any mandates that are not mandates considered by \nthis Congress. And that is the reason I bring this to attention in this \npiece of legislation. The fact is they are paying for an activity the \nAmerican taxpayer should not have to bear at this point. We do not have \nto take down perfectly good highway signs and put up new signs with \nkilometers. That is an enormous waste of money, in my judgment.\n  I just have, I guess, enough experience to know that the bureaucratic \nsystem, left to its own devices, will try to find the end of this \npendulum swing, and I think it will end up costing the taxpayers money. \nThat is why I would like to put on the enforcement brakes for 2 years \nand have this commission study it. Now, if the study determines that \nthis is not imposing any significant costs on anyone, is not very \ntroublesome, then that is fine. That is an answer, I guess, that we \nwould have then that we do not now.\n  If they find, on the other hand, that this can impose a substantial \namount of additional costs with very little additional gain, I say let \nus step in here on the part of the American taxpayer and give them a \nlittle help. At least let us get the facts before someone runs ahead \nwith the mandate.\n  That is the point I am making in the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I might speak in \nmorning business for not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1302-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1309-S1310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           UNFUNDED MANDATES\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, if urgent work comes up on behalf of the \nmanagers, I will step aside. But I just want to make some brief \ncomments about a fascinating activity observed here by me on the Senate \nfloor for these past several days.\n  I noted this with some whimsy, because I recall that after the \nNovember election returns there was a great deal of speculation as to \nhow the minority party would act, now, in its wake. What would the \nPresident now try to do to, say, out-Republican the Republicans? Would \nthe Democrats hop on board the Republican train or would they lie down \non the tracks?\n  Interesting questions, all of them. Questions were also asked about \nhow the Republicans would deal with having the majority. Would the \nHouse Republicans provide for a more open process, more consideration \nof minority views, or would they resort to the same ramrod tactics that \nthe Democrats employed with some apparent relish, at least as I have \nobserved it for 16 of the past 40 years?\n  Somehow lost to the media amid all of this questioning is a \nfundamental difference between Republicans and Democrats as to how, \nreally, willing the two parties are to be on record, to have their \nvotes scrutinized, and to be held up to the folks back home. Anyone who \nhas watched the proceedings here in the Senate or the House the last \nseveral years has witnessed the strain and the energy that the \nDemocratic Party has had to employ to avoid being put on record on any \nnumber of sensitive issues. Let me just cite a few examples I could not \nhelp but think of.\n  When we had the pullout from Somalia, and that was considered, the \nHouse Rules Committee attempted to protect the Democrats by adopting a \n``King of the Hill'' rule. You remember that one--the rule that enables \nyou to vote for one pullout date and then immediately following another \none, a different one that supersedes it. We have another name for \nthose. The Democrats seem to truly, truly enjoy those ``CYA'' \namendments, one after another, so you can send the press release home, \nstill having not done anything, but cover yourself nicely.\n  Then you remember the balanced budget amendment. Do you remember that \none? We had enough cosponsors to pass that one last time around. But \nevery manner of contortion was used to enable the Democratic sponsors \nof the balanced budget amendment to find some reason to vote against \nthe balanced budget amendment which they had cosponsored--a little bit \nof hypocrisy; just a touch.\n  I think we recall the vexations facing the House Rules Committee last \nyear when they were confronted with health care legislation of the type \nwhich the Republicans favored more than did the President. They had to \nkeep it from getting to the House floor because they knew it would \npass.\n  You name the issue--whether it is the death penalty, gun control, \nterm limits, balanced budget--the list is endless. And the struggle in \nthis Chamber for years has been between Republicans trying to force \nvotes on these issues and the Democrats attempting to prevent them, \nwith all sorts of rationale, all thinly veiled, and all of that veil \nremarkably pierced on November 8.\n  So the Democrats would shriek ``gridlock'' when we would introduce \none of these amendments for Senate consideration. But it was nothing of \nthe sort. Those bills favored by the majority--virtually every one of \nthem--did eventually pass but not before Senators had put themselves on \nrecord on a number of issues. Finally, all the chickens came home to \nroost in November. Finally voters across the country realized that the \nman or woman they had sent to Washington really did not believe in the \ndeath penalty after all, did not really believe in lower taxes, did not \nreally believe in spending cuts, did not really support the balanced \nbudget amendment, and they sent them all packing.\n  Why do I review this litany of activity? Because it is highly \nrelevant to the situation we find ourselves in and found ourselves in \nthis past week. I found in speaking to my Republican colleagues on the \nHouse and Senate side that the question has come up as to how open and \ninclusive our legislative process should be. Invariably, the answer has \nbeen, ``Of course. Of course, we can keep it as open as is humanly \npossible because unlike the previous Democratic overlords of years \npast, we have precious little to fear from the Democrats forcing votes \non various issues. What can they possibly make us vote on that we are \nless willing to confront than are the Democrats? Where, precisely, are \nwe out of step with the body politic, while they are in step, \nespecially with our constituents?''\n  Put that way, it becomes clear that the Republican majority have \nprecious little to fear from the various stonewalling tactics from the \nother side. So I personally, having watched the Democratic minority at \nwork here, am not in the least troubled by this remarkable strategy. It \nhas deprived me of some light rest, but not of any certainty that we in \nthe majority will prevail. In fact, I wonder with which political \nconsultants they are working? Has \n[[Page S1310]] someone advised the Democrats that there is a political \nbenefit to be gained from trying to block the unfunded mandates \nlegislation, congressional accountability legislation, and the balanced \nbudget amendment, or any one of a host of measures so eagerly awaited \nby the American public? If my Democratic friends wish to be shown to be \non the wrong side of those issues, while at the same time pretending to \nsupport them, by all means I would hope they would be my guest because \nI will enjoy watching it.\n  I feel many of those measures are going to pass anyway because of the \noverwhelming support they enjoy from the American public and the \nmajority in both Chambers. Many are going to pass.\n  I must say it astonishes me--and somewhat amuses me and bemuses me \ngreatly--that somehow the opposing party has found someone who is \nwilling and who is telling them to be seen as a party of trying to \ndelay this train, to continue to support endless Federal mandates on \nStates, counties, localities--and that means local taxpayers. We all \nknow the saying: Lead, follow, or get out of the way. The Democrats \nseem to want to add a fourth option--lie down on the tracks.\n  I actually read in the paper the other day that the Democrats were \nconsidering making a court challenge to the rule recently passed in the \nHouse requiring a supermajority to raise taxes. Now there is a \npolitical masterstroke. Sue the Representatives and the American public \nin order to be able to raise their taxes. How stunningly brilliant that \nis.\n  So let me just close by thanking my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle for tactics employed this week and last on the unfunded \nmandates legislation for a piece of legislation that has been requested \nby most thoughtful people who administer local government. I think it \nmakes me even more certain that the Republicans will enjoy a majority \nfor many years to come.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1309-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1310-S1339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have to rise to comment on the statements \njust made by my distinguished colleague from Wyoming.\n  I think we need to review what has happened here. This revisionist \nview that was just expressed of what happened last year, and what so \nfar has occurred this year, is a little strange to me having lived \nthrough last year and what has happened this year.\n  You know, we voted it out of committee. I was chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee last year. We voted out in August the \nunfunded mandates legislation. Senator Mitchell wanted to bring it to \nthe floor. We tried to bring it to the floor. There was so much delay, \nI think we had 20 some cloture votes filed against the Republicans last \nfall. It was a scorched-earth policy and they were taking great pride--\nsome, not all--on the other side. Some absorbed what was going on to \ntheir credit. But on the other side there was a scorched-earth policy \nof, ``Don't let anything get through.'' And we found objection and all \nsorts of procedural matters being brought up just to delay, to delay. \nTo say now that after November 8 there is some great mandate that says \nthat we move forward on all these things that we considered last year \nand wanted to bring up and could not because of the Republican \nfilibusters on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and now to blame us for \nnot getting these things through, is about as clearly a revisionist \nview of what happened last fall as anything could be.\n  The statement was made that the Democrats enjoy this kind of delay, \nand we are putting through what was referred to as CYA amendments. And \nI think we all know on the floor what that means. Those are not my \nwords. Those are the words of the Senator from Wyoming.\n  No one enjoys delaying anything on our side that I know of around \nhere because most of the people on our side of the aisle are in favor \nof the unfunded mandates legislation. We just want to see it go through \nin a form that it can be administered and be good.\n  It was said that we put out our press releases on this thing, and \ntalked about how we ignored completely the fact; that the reason we did \nnot have congressional coverage legislation last year and unfunded \nmandates last year was somehow the fault of Democrats. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. We had them on the calendar ready to be brought \nup. That is fact. That is not a revisionist view of what happened last \nyear.\n  Now somehow my colleague from Wyoming indicates that the Republicans \nare trying to force this and the Democrats are opposing it as though \nthe Democrats were not for it last year, and we were being opposed by \nthe Republicans last year.\n  He talks about Democratic gridlock of the past. He says that November \n8 brought all of this home, that all the chickens came home to roost. \nWhy bring up this litany? Well, he said the situation of the past week \nwhere the Democrats were somehow--and I think I wrote down the words \ncorrectly--were trying to continue their policy of being ``overlords'' \nof years past. Those are harsh words. And the ``stonewalling''--that is \nanother word--``stonewalling'' of the Democrats, and that the majority \nwould eventually prevail; and that the Democrats seem to think with \ntheir gurus that there is some political benefit to blocking unfunded \nmandates.\n  Mr. President, those remarks are about as ridiculous as I can think \nof here after we tried last year to get congressional coverage and get \nunfunded mandates through and were blocked repeatedly because of \nprocedural steps taken on the Republican side to block us even from \nconsideration. We did not have time to consider unfunded mandates. We \nbrought them out of committee in August.\n  There were statements about we were trying to delay their train. No. \nThat is not true. Let me just recount for the record so we get the \nfacts straight. S. 993 was introduced last year in the Senate. That is \nwhat we were trying to get through. After the November 8 election it \nwas felt that the House was probably going to come up with a stiffer, \ntougher bill than S. 993, although all parties, including the big seven \nof State, county and, local officials--the big seven different groups, \nas they are called--were in favor of S. 993 last year, and we had some \n67 cosponsors. We could have passed it, just like that, if we had not \nhad the delay occasioned by the Republican's scorched-earth, do-not-\nlet-anything-go-through policy of last fall. We could have gotten it \nthrough last fall.\n  But what happened then after the election this year? I will tell you \nwhat happened after the election this year. They said the House is \ngoing to come up with a tougher bill and we had better move our bill \nhere to make it a little bit tougher so that perhaps the Senate bill \ncan prevail, something the whole Congress can get behind and get passed \nbecause we need to deal with unfunded mandates.\n So I did not fight that. Our staffs all worked together and came up \nwith some new proposals here, and there are some tougher mandates here. \nMaybe we have gone a little far in some of the consideration of our \npeople that were one or more of the 67 cosponsors of last year. But we \ncame up there with a new bill, S. 1.\n\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Senator Dole, the majority leader, went before the \nGovernors Association and said he thought this was important enough \nthat he would make it S. 1, the prime bill before the Senate, to be \nbrought up as the first bill this year. I agreed with that. I have been \nan advocate of correcting this unfunded mandates problem for a long \ntime. We worked on this for the better part of 2 years with my \ndistinguished colleague from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, the floor \nmanager on the other side. I did not quarrel with that. But now we are \nbeing blamed somehow for not going ahead with this. That is just not \nright.\n  But what happened this year? Let us follow this thing through. \nBecause of the priority accorded this legislation, it was referred to \ncommittee on the following timetable: Voted off the Senate floor to \ncommittee; sent to committee. It was introduced on the floor one day, \nand sent immediately to committee with a hearing to occur the following \nday, with the agreement that the \n[[Page S1311]] markup on the bill would occur the next day--one, two, \nthree; introduction, committee hearing, committee markup. Just like \nthat, and bring it back to the floor in short order.\n  Now what happened? We got it over and had the markup, and a lot of \npeople had some legitimate concerns about some of the things that had \nbeen put into the bill when it became S. 1 this year--using the basis \nof S. 993, but going beyond that. There were concerns about this. So I \nrequested that the committee markup not be done, as I recall, on a \nFriday. We asked that this be put off over the weekend so people could \nfind out what the changes were; so we would know what we were voting \non. This was not going to be a rubber stamp. There was no mandate that \ncame out of the November election that said we now have to approve \neverything the Republicans now suggest because they are in the \nmajority. We wanted to know what the changes were and let everyone else \nknow what the changes were. That was the purpose of asking that this be \nput off over the weekend.\n  So it was put off over the weekend. We had the markup on Monday. Then \nwhat happened? We went to the committee and we had a number of \nsubstantive changes--these were not frivolous or delaying items at all. \nThey were amendments that we had prepared. I had some and Senator \nLevin, in particular, who did a real analysis of this legislation, had \nsubstantive amendments about how specific parts of this bill would be \napplied. He wanted to clarify some of those things. Do you know what \nhappened in committee? In committee, we were not even permitted to \nbring up our amendments. We requested to bring up amendments and were \ntold, ``No, leadership wants this back up on the floor right away and \nany amendments will be dealt with on the floor.'' We thought this was \nnot the way to go. We objected and we had some rollcall votes on \ndifferent substantive things. These were not delay items, they were \nsubstantive items to be brought up in committee.\n  On a straight party-line vote, it was said, no; we cannot consider \nthose things. Those will be considered on the floor. We were voted down \non a party line basis. We got rolled on every single one of them. Then \nit was stated, ``We are going to send this to the floor without a \ncommittee report.'' The importance of a committee report--if anybody \nhas ever read through one of these bills with the technical language, \nthe whereases and therefores, and everything that makes it conform to \nthe whole United States Code, to the average layman, it is virtually \nunintelligible, and to a lot of Senators, too.\n  So what do we have? Normally, as a requirement, we have a committee \nreport, and it is carefully written. It explains in layman's language, \ngoing through each section of the proposed legislation, exactly what it \nmeans, giving the pros and cons on it so every Member and staff member \nworking on a particular piece of legislation, when it comes to the \nfloor, will be able at that point to have an understanding of what the \nlegislation provides.\n  By and large, we rely on those committee reports. That is the \nimportance of them. We objected to sending the legislation to the floor \nfrom the Governmental Affairs Committee without the committee report \nbeing filed. In fact, we thought it was important enough that after \nsome discussion of it, and we were still being denied that right, it \nwas brought up where we finally insisted on a record rollcall vote on \nit, and, once again, we got rolled--still with the provision that we \ncould bring up anything we wanted on the floor. So over our objection, \nit was voted out.\n  I understand that our committee chairman, Senator Roth, was under \nconsiderable pressure from leadership to bring this to the floor that \nday, no matter what. I appreciate his position on that. Let me just say \nthis. I have been around the Senate now for over 20 years, and I was \nchairman of the committee 8 years. Never in the 8 years I was chairman \ndid I ever have our majority leader say: I want you to roll this \nthrough committee no matter what, and bring it out to the floor without \na report on any piece of legislation.\n  Occasionally, we sent legislation from the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to the floor without a report, but only with the agreement of \nthe minority, and then usually only on bills that were comparatively \ninnocuous and not major pieces of legislation, as this is.\n  This is landmark legislation. This changes the way we have operated \nfor 60 years and starts moving things back in a different direction, to \na different Federal responsibility, a different relationship, Federal, \nState, and local. That is the reason I call this landmark legislation. \nIt makes the first steps--it is the first major piece of legislation \nthat makes steps in that direction.\n  What happened? We got to the floor, the bill is called up, and all at \nonce there is a move to try to curtail amendments, keep them to a \nminimum, saying ``We have to get this through; we have to beat the \nHouse,'' as though this was a legislative drag race, and more important \nthan the substance of this legislation.\n  I predicted in committee before this was voted out--first, I will \ngive a little bit of background. Usually, in committee, you try to take \ncare of all of the substantive amendments anybody has and they are \nfocused on that piece of legislation. Usually, you do not have a lot of \nextraneous amendments come up in committee because people are focused \non that piece of legislation. We were not permitted to do that this \ntime around. Then when a bill comes to the floor, if it has had all \nthat kind of due consideration in committee, what happens on the floor? \nThen you are on good grounds to say we have dealt with the substantive \nmatters as we see it in committee, and we brought this out as a pretty \ngood, clean bill.\n  If somebody really has something that deals with substance, let us \nconsider it. But other than that, we are going to try to defeat other \namendments that can be put on in the State, extraneous amendments that \ncan be put in, because the Senate has no germaneness rules, unless we \nare under cloture or for certain applications on certain appropriations \nbills. But we are going to say that--we will try to say, OK; whichever \nside of the aisle puts on extraneous amendments, we have dealt \nsubstantively with this in committee, and so we are going to oppose all \nthose, no matter how meritorious they might be on their own \nfreestanding bill, if it was put in as such. We are going to oppose it \nin legislation on the floor.\n  I predicted in committee that if we brought this bill out without the \nsubstantive amendments being taken care of in committee, this bill--I \nthink my words in committee were that this bill was going to draw \namendments like flies to honey. And it sure has. We got to the floor--\nand I think it is important that everybody understand this so the \nremarks of the Senator from Wyoming of a few minutes ago are \nunderstood. His revisionist view of what happens does not square with \nthe facts.\n  We got to the floor and what happened? Senator Byrd objected to the \nfact that we had not had the committee report. I indicated the \nimportance of that a few moments ago for legislation like this, which \nis landmark legislation. Senator Byrd very properly objected. He said \nthat this was important legislation, he wanted to see the committee \nreport. When could we have that committee report available?\n  That is what the debate was about, for about 2 days here. The debate \nwas not about the substance of whether unfunded mandates problems \nshould be corrected or not corrected. The debate was about the \nprocedure that was used in bringing this to the floor and whether we \nshould have a report so all Members would have the benefit of the \nthinking of committee members and would be permitted to put minority \nviews in that committee report.\n  Now, in committee they said that they would put the committee report \nin the Congressional Record. We said, ``What about the minority views \nthat usually goes along with it?'' They said, ``You could also put \nthose in the Congressional Record if you wanted.'' That is a very, very \npoor substitute for our normal procedures here. That is exactly what \nSenator Byrd disagreed with and what we fussed about back and forth on \nthe floor here for 2 days.\n  At the end of that time was when the majority leader decided that he \nfelt that there was delay on this and he filed a cloture motion. What \ndid that do? What did that do? Just as I predicted in committee, it \nflushed out more amendments than anybody \n[[Page S1312]] thought. Why? Because if your amendment is going to be \nconsidered and cloture is going to be voted, your amendment has to be \nfiled at the desk before cloture is invoked.\n  And do you know what happened? We had 117 amendments--117 \namendments--put forward to try to beat that cloture deadline, largely \nbecause of the procedure that had been used up to that time. Now that \nreally threw things in a cocked hat.\n  I did not know where we were going at that time, because I knew that \nthe Republicans--and both sides knew this--did not have the votes for \ncloture; did not have the votes for cloture. Did this mean, then, \nwithout having the votes for cloture with 117 amendments, was this \ngoing to kill our consideration of unfunded mandates? I did not know \nwhether it would or not.\n  It was in that context that I mentioned to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Idaho, who has been on this for a long, long time--and he and I \nhave dealt very straightforwardly with each other on this--I mentioned \nto him, if things really got bogged down--and it was bogged down over \nthe lack of a committee report and the fact we did have all the new \nprovisions in S. 1 that had not been in S. 993--that this was going to \ndelay things and it looked like we might not get it through the \nCongress at all--and I think it is important we are getting legislation \nthrough the Congress; I reiterate that I support this legislation, \nfought for it as chairman of the committee, brought it out of the \ncommittee last fall as S. 993--I suggested to my colleague from Idaho \nthat if push came to shove and it looked like we were not going to get \ncloture and it was going to be a long stalemate on this and maybe even \nhave to pull the whole thing down eventually, we might want to consider \ndropping back to S. 993 so we get something through. I think it is \nimportant we do that.\n  And while the big seven that I referred to a little while ago \ncertainly does want S. 1 more than they wanted S. 993 last fall--they \nwere happy with that; now that they have gotten more, the chance of \ngetting more, they are very much enamored of S. 1. I understand that--\nany drop back in that position to S. 993 would have been something that \nthey would abhor.\n  I mention this only in the context of where we were in the \nlegislative process at that time, with the possibility that there was \ngoing to be an inability of the Republicans to invoke cloture, which \nrequires 60 votes, and they only had 53 for sure and what they could \npeel off on our side. But that meant they had to get another seven \nvotes off the Democratic side and they could not do that, at least not \nin the early round on this. If it meant this was going to be delayed \ntoo much, then we were going to have to consider what we would do. \nWould we pull down S. 1, as I saw a possibility of at that time, and go \nback to passing something which everyone thought was adequate last \nfall, although they liked the additional provisions of S. 1 now? That \nwas the context of where I talked to my distinguished colleague from \nIdaho about that possibility.\n  The cloture vote was held. Cloture was not invoked. And so here we \nare, with all of the delay of the past week, with nothing having really \nsubstantively happened on this legislation.\n  Meanwhile, while all this was going on, we did have a group meeting, \nboth sides trying to define what amendments were important, which ones \nwere not, who really wanted to put their amendments in or who had put \nin frivolous amendments of the 117 that we had submitted at the time \nbefore the cloture vote. Fortunately, that group finally made some \nprogress on this. And so, after the Republican side did not invoke \ncloture, we fell back to what was reality, I guess, and said, ``OK, we \nwill now try to get a unanimous-consent agreement that only about 60 of \nthose ones that people said yes, they really wanted to put them in, \nonly about 60 of these would be eligible to be placed in consideration \nas amendments on this legislation.''\n  Meanwhile, we had gone through on the floor, during another 2 days or \n2\\1/2\\ days, we had worked our way through a number of amendments. But \nthe way those had been structured, they had been submitted as second-\ndegree amendments by the parliamentary situation we were in at that \ntime, so before we went to this unanimous-consent agreement, Senator \nDole moved to strike through a series of five amendments that he \nproposed. We went through the stripping of everything we had done \nthere. And that was probably the best thing to do. I do not quarrel \nwith that.\n  So now we start over with this finite list of amendments that can be \nconsidered, and those are all to be submitted by 3 o'clock tomorrow \nafternoon.\n  Now, today, we can get on with these amendments. We can debate \namendments today, but no votes will occur before 4 o'clock today.\n  Why do I go into all this detail? It is beginning to get a little \naggravating. I do not normally get up and gripe back and forth. I \nusually stay out of these back-biting things, where these inflammatory \nwords are used here. And I think my record on the Senate floor would \nshow that I only rarely get up and try to respond when some of these \nthings are said. I leave it to other people who sort of enjoy getting \nlocked into that kind of verbal combat, I guess, for whatever partisan \npurposes it may provide on either side of the aisle.\n  But for my distinguished colleague to come in this morning and talk \nabout us opposing this legislation when we tried to get it out last \nfall and were blocked by the Republicans; tried very hard to get it \nout. I was still trying down to the last 2 days of the session last \nyear to get it out on a unanimous-consent request and could not do it. \nWe had objections on both sides. The final objection did fall on the \nDemocratic side, let us be fair about this.\n  But the reason we got down to even considering it on a UC basis was \nbecause there had been this scorched-earth, do-not-let-anything-through \npolicy on the other side that had prevented consideration of a lot of \nbills, of which this and the congressional coverage bill were two.\n  To come on the floor and say that we are creating gridlock on the \nDemocratic side and say that we are using tactics we used when we were \n``overlords of years past'' and to talk about the Democrats \nstonewalling this legislation is about the biggest revisionist view of \nhistory that I can think of.\n  That there are political beliefs being pushed for unfunded mandates \nby our political gurus, our advisers, somehow advising us in this area \nthat we are trying to delay--``trying to delay this train'' was another \nquote--that just is not true.\n  The reason I have taken this time to lay out what happened on this \nbill is because I think it is important that everyone know exactly what \nhas happened. This is not a filibuster of S. 1 this year. The \nfilibuster, if there has been anything to be construed as a filibuster \non the floor of the Senate this year, is objections to the ramrod \nprocedures that were used to roll the minority in committee and not \neven permit a regular committee report to be sent to the floor with \nthis legislation.\n Now, that was flat wrong. I have never seen that done. I have been \nhere 20 years. I have never seen that done before on any committee I \nhave been on where at the specific request of the minority, even a \nrecord rollcall vote that the minority requested, to try to say a \nreport will accompany this legislation, did I ever, ever, hear the \nmajority say, ``No, it has to go. We cannot have a committee report. We \nwill just put something in the Congressional Record. If we want \nminority views they can be put in the Record. This is such a fast track \nwe have to bypass everything. We are in a legislative race with the \nHouse of Representatives so we do not get behind the people in the \nHouse somehow.\n\n  If this was some little innocuous bill that made no difference \nwhether it passed or not or of very little importance, I would not \nthink it is worthy of even standing up to correct the statements made \non the floor a little while ago that I am responding to.\n  This is not that kind of legislation. The days when I was growing up, \ndays of the Great Depression, were tough days. Okies headed west. \nPeople headed for soup kitchens and so on. There was unemployment of \nover 20 percent for 4 years, 25 percent for 1 year. They were tough \ndays.\n  Families had taken care of families up until that time, a Norman \nRockwell type of existence. In the days of the depression, people could \nnot do that anymore. People were hungry. There were \n[[Page S1313]] soup kitchens. People were moving out of whole sections \nof the country because communities and States could no longer take care \nof their own and do it in an adequate fashion. Either could not or \nwould not. What has happened? The New Deal came in. FHA was put in. \nThere were a lot of programs. I will not try to detail all of those.\n  Starting with that premise--that States and local communities were \nunable to take care of their own--was the premise of the New Deal, and \nit moved into a whole new area of Federal activity.\n  Now, have some of the programs over the last 60 years built up and \ngone too far? I would be the first to say that certainly we should \ncorrect those. There is a move now to go back to let the States take \nover a lot of these things that the Federal Government has been doing. \nI think that is OK in some areas but not completely. I would not agree \nwith all of it. We need to do this carefully to make sure that the \nsocial safety net that has been put together over the last 60 years and \nthat people have come to depend on, we can say rightly or wrongly, \ndepending on Democrat or Republican view, if that social safety net is \njust thrown out and we let some States take up these services and some \nStates not, that will deal very unfairly with millions of Americans.\n  Now, I am all for unfunded mandates legislation. I support it. I \nsupported S. 993 last year and am a cosponsor of S. 1 this year. Do we \nneed to consider it carefully? Yes, we absolutely do, to make sure that \nwe do not do some damage while we are trying to do good and prevent \nthese unjustified mandates. Many of them are being just heaped upon the \nStates, heaped upon the States, at the same time, over the past 5 or 6 \nyears, that we have been cutting down on some of the programs--\ncommunity development block grants, things like that. We have been \ncutting down on programs that have sent much money back to help the \nStates.\n  So we have to do this very carefully. And to think that somehow the \nminority is going to roll over and play dead and say, ``Yes, whatever \nyou want to do we will do it,'' without consideration of important \npieces of legislation, important amendments to correct some of these \nmatters.\n  Let me just very briefly--and I know I am taking a long time and \npeople are waiting--but let me just say this. Senator Byrd wants to \nhave an amendment, which was listed the other day, which would say, \nbasically, that as part of this bill where we say to an agency if the \nemergency is not there but there is less money available, the agency, \nthen, can bring this up or can somehow judge how the money will be \nspent and so on.\n  In other words, the question he raises is a good one. I am in support \nof S. 1. I repeat that again. What he raises is a question: Are we \npassing our legislative authority over to unnamed bureaucrats over \nthere; and what guarantee do we have that they will not go too far with \nthem. That is just one.\n  I have a series of some of the things that were left out with regard \nto color and age discrimination. That was one. Another as to when the \npoint of order would lie. Are we going to permit it on every single \namendment? Are we going to have a point of order lie to begin with or \nat the end of the amending process before final passage of whatever the \nlegislation is?\n  There is some uncertainty as to who would determine applicability \nwhere we have a judgment is something a mandate or not. Is that \njustified by the way the bill provides now with the presiding officer--\nfor example, meaning the Parliamentarian--who would determine what a \nmandate is, or should that be by the Governmental Affairs Committee? We \nhave an amendment on that. That is substantive.\n  We have some that would clarify the differentiation between what \nwould apply in a public sector--that is, governments--as opposed to \nwhat would apply in the private sector at the same time. We have \nanother one that would clarify that where a bill is reauthorized from a \npast provision of law, a bill comes up at the end of its time to be \nreauthorized--as the bill is now, it is not clear enough; it says that \nthis could not be challenged if it is over $50 million. We clarify that \nthe $50 million would only apply if a reauthorization went $50 million \nbeyond its previous requirements, which makes it compatible with the \nrest of the bill.\n  Senator Levin has some amendments. He wants to propose that this is \nimportant legislation, maybe we ought to sunset it so we are forced to \nreconsider the implementation at the end of a certain time period. He \nwould have another one that, if a committee determines that there is a \nsignificant competitive disadvantage to the private sector--for \ninstance, where there are competing electric generating plants between \nthe government and private sectors--should we clarify whether we are \nbeginning to have to move in and subsidize a requirement on the public \nsector and not do the same thing on the private sector, which would \ngive a major advantage in some areas of light generation, sewer \nprovision, water, whatever, where there are competitive interests \nbetween public and private businesses. I think that should be corrected \nalso.\n  We have a number of others here. I will not go through the rest of \nthem. I want to show that these are substantive.\n  Now, some put in over on the Republican side deal with judicial \nreview, when there is any question about a particular provision of the \nbill, if a person could file suit in Federal court right off the bat. \nCan we figure any way to possibly bring the Government to a halt faster \nthan that? By allowing everybody that disagreed with a particular item \nto say, ``We will file suit.'' What is substantive is the point I am \nmaking. I do not want to argue the merits. It is substantive. That \nwould be proposed by Senator Brown, I believe.\n  Motor-voter has been brought up again as a cost to the States. We \nwill have to go through motor-voter. Is that substantive? It certainly \nis.\n  Impact analysis for independent agencies by Senator Domenici would \nensure analysis for impacts included for certain independent regulatory \nagencies as FCC, FERC, FTC, and the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n  One on our list at this point that Senator Gramm may bring up is an \namendment requiring three-fifths of the Senate, making it much more \ndifficult to waive a point of order and get on with consideration of a \ncertain bill.\n  CBO estimates on conference reports would be required by another \namendment.\n  Senator Grassley has one that is on our list, at this point at least, \nand I do not know whether he intends to push it, which would extend \napplication of the act to past and current mandates. I do not know, if \nwe went back on all previous Federal mandates without some limitation, \nI do not know how many trillion dollars that might involve. That is an \namendment and it certainly is substantive.\n  I will not go on with these. There are a number of others like this. \nThe point I want to make by listing just some of these is that these \nare very substantive amendments. They are things that are important to \niron out so that this landmark legislation, when it is enacted--I hope \nit will be enacted--is done with all the best thinking of the Senate \nand the House of Representatives so it can be as workable as possible, \ncan be used for, really, changing the direction of the relationship \nbetween the Federal, State, and local governments.\n  Now, Mr. President, there are some others that I could list here \nalso, but I will not go through them. That is the reason I wanted to go \nthrough this and explain exactly what happened and how we got to where \nwe are. And the fact of the argument so far, the debate back and forth, \nhas been about 90 percent on consideration of procedure and whether we \nare adequately protecting everyone who might want to make substantive \nchanges to this piece of legislation, changes that might be very \nvaluable and be good and that all the big seven and everybody can agree \nwith are good.\n  And so being prevented from doing that in committee and the attempt \nmade here to push very rapidly once we got to the floor, that has been \nthe heart of the debate so far. That has been the disagreement so far.\n  So when I hear words that the Democrats are the ones delaying--it is \nDemocratic gridlock; it is just Democrats trying to be ``overlords of \nyears past,'' we are trying to stonewall--nothing could be further from \nthe truth. I do not care how many statements are made on the floor to \nthat effect.\n  [[Page S1314]] The statements that were made previously which \ntriggered my response here just were flat not true. I know from my \npersonal experience in caucuses on this side, what happened in \ncommittee last year, and having been in committee this year where this \nbig, unnecessary push was made to push this stuff through too fast. We \nneed to consider this. It is very, very important legislation. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to what my friend from Ohio has said. \nI listened to what my friend from Wyoming had said. I just go back to \nwhat I am trying to say, and that is, just as one of the critical \nelements of the Senate bill before us, S. 1, is the fact that it is not \nretroactive. I hope that we will refrain from being retroactive on the \nhistory of what may or may not have happened with this bill, that bill, \nwhat this side did, what that side did.\n  One of the benefits of S. 1 is the fact that there are 63 Senators \nwho sponsor this bill. I am proud to be a primary sponsor, but I would \nnot be here if I had not had the tremendous assistance of the Senator \nfrom Ohio, and I would not be here if we did not have, during the \nrecess, the great assistance of Senator Roth, Senator Domenici, and \nSenator Exon. Just in naming those individuals, I think we all realize \nit is bipartisan. So here is an opportunity for this new Congress to \ntake up this vehicle which has been developed in a bipartisan fashion. \nIt is what our partners in the State and local and tribal governments \nhave said they want. It is what the private sector says they want.\n  So I ask all--and I am speaking to my side also--let us start looking \nforward and not backward so that we can move this. I am committed to \nthe passage of S. 1, and I appreciate what the Senator from Ohio said \nas to why he was discussing S. 993. But I think we all agree that is \nnot an option at this point.\n  This is the legislation for this Congress to consider, to pass, and \nwe will take what time is necessary through the amendment process to \nperfect this so that a majority of Senators will know that this is \nexactly what should come out of this body.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \n30 minutes for debate on the pending amendment, to be equally divided \nin the usual form; and that no amendments be in order prior to the \ndisposition of the pending amendment; and that following the \nconclusion, or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on or \nin relation to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho retains the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Was a question put to me?\n  Mr. REID. I was just attempting to seek recognition.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I should point out that apparently \nthere has been an agreement that there will be no votes until 4 p.m. \ntomorrow, so that any votes that we establish will have to be after 4 \no'clock tomorrow.\n  Mr. GLENN. The 4 o'clock limitation was 4 o'clock today, was it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the 4 o'clock \napplies to tomorrow.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. GLENN. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wonder if I could go ahead with my \nstatement and they can work out the problem.\n  Mr. GLENN. That will be agreeable to the Senator from Ohio and the \nSenator from Idaho with the provision the Senator's remarks not be in \nthe middle of our conversation about when the votes are going to occur.\n  Mr. REID. My remarks are on the amendment that is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am in support of the legislation now \nbefore this body. I listened closely to what the Senator from Ohio and \nthe Senator from Idaho said, and I agree. This is bipartisan \nlegislation. I not only appreciate what the Senator from Idaho said, \nbut the manner in which he said it: That this legislation is sponsored \nby a majority of the U.S. Senate and, as a result of that, the \nlegislation should pass.\n  But one reason it will pass is that there is ample opportunity for \namendment, and that is what is now going on. There are amendments \npending. The amendment that is now before this body asks that the \nMandate Commission analyze the costs associated with mandating States \nconvert to the use of metric measurements. It does not prohibit the \nmetric system or our efforts to convert to the metric system. It simply \nrecognizes that these efforts cost money and this cost is often borne \nby State and local governments. This amendment requires the Mandate \nCommission examine these costs and report on their amounts.\n  The reasons I support this legislation are myriad. But one main \nreason why I support this legislation is that I have worked for a \nnumber of years, going back to 1992, with Senator Nickles, from \nOklahoma, on legislation that would require that when bills come before \nthis body, there would have to be a cost estimate as to how much this \nlegislation would cost.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, Senator Nickles and I would have \nrequired that before regulations were promulgated by a Federal agency, \nthey would have to affix the cost to that regulation. That seemed \nreasonable. Senator Nickles and I worked on this for a number of years. \nIn fact, it passed this body last year and was killed during the \nconference aspects of the legislation. The previous year, it almost \npassed.\n  The legislation that Senator Nickles and I sponsored would have \nrequired the General Accounting Office to do the things I mentioned: \nReport on costs to consumers and business, impact on national \nemployment, ability of U.S. industries to compete internationally, cost \nto State and local governments, cost to the Federal Government, and \nimpact on gross domestic product.\n  So the unfunded mandate issue has been approached in a number of \ndifferent ways. The way that Senator Nickles and I approached the \nlegislation was a way of handling the congressional mandate issue. This \nlegislation, S. 1, is a more direct method, which I support.\n  However, I believe that the amendment process is going to make this a \nbetter piece of legislation.\n  The amendment that is now before this body dealing with the metric \nsystem is highly pertinent to this legislation. When Federal regulators \nsay to State and local governments, ``You utilize the metric system,'' \nthey are saying a lot, because without question, Mr. President, that is \nan unfunded mandate.\n  What costs must the State of Wyoming bear as a result of changing all \nthe road signs? It is a cost. The State of Nevada has the same problem, \nand every other State. Federal regulators may impose this requirement \nfor the most well-intentioned reasons, but it can cost States a \nsignificant amount of money to comply. We must recognize the \nsignificance of requiring adherence to this new form of measurement and \nrecognize that there are increased costs associated this transition.\n  Are the costs necessary? That is what we are saying. These costs \nought not be shifted to State and local governments, and that is where \nthe cost is now being shifted.\n  While the amendment does not address this, maybe they really ought \nnot to be borne by private contractors also who do business with the \nFederal Government. And they also will have to bear this burden.\n  The amendment now before this body that is pending would remedy this \ncost shifting by establishing a 2-year moratorium on any Federal entity \nrequiring State or local governments to use the metric system of \nmeasurement. It \n[[Page S1315]] would allow agencies to continue pending projects if \nsuspension of the requirement would result in a significant increase in \ncosts.\n  This amendment, like the underlying legislation, is really about \nunforeseen costs. It is about the unforeseen costs associated with the \nimplementation of legislation that, if passed, would really be \nburdensome. And there may be some meritorious reason for the underlying \nmandate--unfunded, I might add, requiring the metric system \nconversion--there may be some meritorious reasons for that, but should \nwe not know the costs before we decide the merits of that issue? Under \nthis legislation that is now before this body, there is a mandate \ncommission which will study these types of costs and we will better \nunderstand them in the future. Under the amendment now before this \nbody, the Commission will be required to study the costs associated \nwith the Federal Government's mandating the use of metric measurements.\n  Metric conversion is costing my State money. If the Federal \nGovernment provides highway funds to Nevada, it can require that all \nwork be performed in conformity with metric requirements. I think that \nis a waste of money. It require metric measurements regardless of the \ncosts borne to carry out this mandate.\n  We are building a new courthouse in Reno, NV. I think it would have \nbeen a shame, as will be the requirement in the courthouse we are going \nto build in Las Vegas, that they submit their bids using metric \nmeasurements. The Las Vegas courthouse will require that. The Reno \ncourthouse that is now under construction did not require the \ncontractors to submit bids using metric measurements.\n  Mr. President, not only would this cost additional money for Nevada \nand the city of Las Vegas and the city of Reno, but it would also cost \nmoney to the local contractors. Indeed, this type of mandating \nneedlessly drives up costs of construction and frustration of the \npeople seeking these contracts. For these contractors that are unable \nto convert, too bad; their bids are deemed unacceptable because they do \nnot employ a measuring system which they were never taught or never \nknew would be required in the first place.\n  The State of Nevada and its cities are already suffering from the \nimposition of costly unfunded mandates. And one reason I support this \nlegislation is because I hear from so many Nevadans about these costs. \nLook, for example, to a small entity like Carson City, NV. According to \nPrice Waterhouse, the cost of Federal mandates for the fiscal year 1993 \nis over $4 million; for north Las Vegas, NV, about $1.5 million for \n1993. These costs have consequences because State and local governments \nare required to pay for them. Other programs, local in nature, are \nbasically laid aside because the money has to be spent on the mandate. \nThere is a limited amount of money to go around, and therefore there \nare a limited number of projects they can undertake--worthwhile \nprojects.\n  Requiring metric conversion is just an added unfunded mandate. In \nnorth Las Vegas, the money that was spent in 1993 for unfunded mandates \ncould be used to hire additional police to operate a safety key program \nfor children. That is one of the things they want but have not the \nmoney to do; to improve and enhance maintenance of the waste water \ntreatment system in north Las Vegas; provide additional parks or \nrenovation of parks, maybe even hire some people to make sure the parks \nare being operated correctly and are safe.\n  We could go on and on with the list of things that have not been done \nas a result of the unfunded mandate money that had to be spent. Why \nshould we add the metric system conversion as another unfunded mandate? \nBecause that is what it is. If it is important enough to do the \nunfunded mandate after the studies we require in the amendment, then we \nwill go ahead and do it. We can balance whether or not we need \nadditional police, more public works inspectors, improvement in our \nparks, all these things, or we could waive those. But if left \nunchanged, these costs simply will be used for things that the local \ngovernments feel are unnecessary.\n  So, Mr. President, I congratulate and applaud my friend from North \nDakota for his wisdom in being the author of this amendment. As soon as \nit was mentioned to me, I knew it was something I wanted to get \ninvolved in because it is the right thing to do. This is what unfunded \nmandates are all about. We have identified an unfunded mandate. Why not \nexamine the costs of this mandate?\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 180, as modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the support of my \nfriend from Nevada, Senator Reid. Again, to restate it in one sentence, \nI am not opposed to the metric system. I am opposed to the Federal \nGovernment imposing mandates across this country on the metric system \nin a way that does not make any common sense. I guarantee you, without \nsome intervention from this Congress in the past, we would already have \nhad road signs replaced all across this country that tell people how \nmany kilometers it is to the next rest stop because that is where the \nbureaucracy goes with a mandate.\n  My only point is that I do not think we ought to spend taxpayers' \nmoney pushing a mandate that makes no sense. If the private sector \nwants to use the metric system to compete in the European countries or \nwherever, fine. That is what they are doing; that is what the market \nsystem would direct them to do. I do not want us to spend precious \ntaxpayers' money doing things that do not make common sense, and that \nis the concern I have about the current mandate conversion act.\n  Now, Mr. President, I visited with the Senator from Idaho, and I \nthink the Senator from Ohio also understands--I visited with him as \nwell--I am willing to modify the amendment in a manner that I think is \nacceptable to the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Ohio. I would \nlike, if appropriate at this time, to say that my modification is at \nthe desk and ask the desk to report the modification of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify it. If there \nis no objection, the clerk will read the modification.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 180, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the modification be considered as \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 41, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (4) Treatment of requirements for metric systems of \n     measurement.--\n       (A) Treatment.--For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), the \n     Commission shall consider requirements for metric systems of \n     measurement to be Federal mandates.\n       (B) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``requirements \n     for metric systems of measurement'' means requirements of the \n     departments, agencies, and other entities of the Federal \n     Government that State, local, and tribal governments utilize \n     metric systems of measurement.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will simply observe that what I have \ndone with this modification is removed the moratorium portion of the \namendment but retained the portion of the amendment that will require \nthe Commission on Unfunded Mandates to give us the information in the \n2-year study of these costs so the next time we come with this kind of \namendment, we have the data necessary to support it.\n  I do not expect to cease and desist in my efforts to prevent the \nFederal Government from leading in a direction that I think is unwise. \nI admit, and I think others admit, we do not know what this costs. That \nis the point of it. Retaining that portion of the amendment will \nrequire the study be done to give us the information so that we do know \nwhat it will cost, and in 2 years I hope we can come back and squash \nthe requirement that exists for the Government to want to do things \nthat are unreasonable.\n  I might also say, in the middle of all this, we will intend once \nagain to prohibit DOT from doing anything that spends the taxpayers' \nmoney to convert road signs in the meanwhile. So with that, I ask that \nthe two managers of the bill support this modification.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I compliment my friend for moving in this \ndirection. I think this makes a lot of sense. Since there are a lot of \nquestions \n[[Page S1316]] about this, to do a study of it I think is fine.\n  I would like to clarify in the legislative history here on the floor, \nthough, as to whether it is the Senator's intent that the study being \ndone will include the estimated costs? After all, that is what this \nbill deals with and unless the costs were going to be above $50 million \nit would not be a threshold item for this particular item.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is my intention.\n  Mr. GLENN. In the remainder of the legislation, outside the part that \nwas stricken, I do not see any specific reference to costs. It said it \nwill consider requirements for a metric system of measurement to be \nFederal mandates. I would like the legislative history to show that \nwould include in this study that will come back to us an estimate, if \nat all possible, of the costs to the Federal, State, local, and tribal \ngovernments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is written in a manner designed to \novercome any problems that would have been imposed by the threshold of \nthe bill. This would require the Commission to study it irrespective of \nthe threshold.\n  Mr. GLENN. But I ask my colleague, is it his understanding this would \ninclude an estimate of the cost of executing this Federal mandate?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is the purpose of it. That is correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. That is fine. I am willing to accept it.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nNorth Dakota because, again, as I listened to the points he has raised, \nthis is exactly why we need to have a bill like S. 1. I listened to my \nfriend from Nevada, and I will have to paraphrase, but very close to \nthis: Senator Reid said that there may be merit to this unfunded \nFederal mandate, but should we not know the cost before we implement \nit? And he is absolutely right.\n  That is why with S. 1, once it is enacted, we are going to have that \nprocess so Congress will know the cost, any adverse impact to the \ncompetitive balance between the public and private sector, before we \ncast our votes.\n  Again, I appreciate what they have said. I think they are helping us \nto lay out the fact that there is a need and the fact, too, that S. 1 \nfills that need.\n  So I am happy to accept the amendment as modified from the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, and thank him for his amendment.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nDorgan's amendment, which seeks to address burdensome metric mandates. \nAs my colleague from North Dakota has stated, metric requirements \nimpose serious burdens on State, local, and tribal governments and \noffer a perfect example of the careless practice that the underlying \nlegislation seeks to address.\n  I became involved in the metric debate during the last Congress, when \nI introduced legislation that would have prohibited Federal agencies \nfrom requiring State and local governments to convert highway signs to \nmetric units. At that time, the Federal Highway Administration was \nconsidering plans which would have, in effect, forced financially \nstrapped State and local governments to cancel or postpone highway and \ninfrastructure improvements in favor of metric sign conversion.\n  Literally thousands of Kansans contacted me to protest this \nunnecessary and costly change and to ask why we in Washington write \nlaws and then pass the costs along to State and local governments. \nFortunately, their opposition and our efforts in Congress were \nsuccessful in convincing the Federal Highway Administration to abandon \nits plans for metric sign conversion.\n  While I was pleased with that decision, I remain concerned about the \nprospect of similar metric mandates and believe that we must act to \nensure that their effect on State, local, and tribal governments is \nfully understood. This amendment would accomplish that goal, and I urge \nmy colleagues to adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 180), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would also like to note Senator \nKassebaum, I know, has an interest in this issue. So we would like to \ncertainly note that. And, too, in S. 1, there will be a process, the \nACIR, which will look at existing mandates such as this mandate. So \nagain we have laid out a process that I think will be effective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 178\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n  System to submit a report to the Congress and to the President each \n   time the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the \n Federal Open Market Committee takes any action changing the discount \n        rate, the Federal funds rate, or market interest rates)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 178.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n              TITLE V--INTEREST RATE REPORTING REQUIREMENT\n\n     SEC. 501. REPORT BY BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE \n                   SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Report Required.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     Board or the Committee takes any action to change the \n     discount rate or the Federal funds rate, the Board shall \n     submit a report to the Congress and to the President which \n     shall include a detailed analysis of the projected costs of \n     that action, and the projected costs of any associated \n     changes in market interest rates, during the 5-year period \n     following that action.\n       (b) Contents.--The report required by subsection (a) shall \n     include an analysis of the costs imposed by such action on--\n       (1) Federal, State, and local government borrowing, \n     including costs associated with debt service payments; and\n       (2) private sector borrowing, including costs imposed on--\n       (A) consumers;\n       (B) small businesses;\n       (C) homeowners; and\n       (D) commercial lenders.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the term ``Board'' means the Board of Governors of the \n     Federal Reserve System; and\n       (2) the term ``Committee'' means the Federal Open Market \n     Committee established under section 12A of the Federal \n     Reserve Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might, I would like to describe very \nbriefly this amendment. I know Senator Reid would like to speak on \nbehalf of the amendment, as well, and I think there are a couple of \nother Senators, also. I would like to, following that, get a recorded \nvote ordered on this amendment. This is an amendment I shall not modify \nand I very much intend to get a recorded vote on.\n  This amendment deals with the Federal Reserve Board. The mere mention \nof the Federal Reserve Board puts students to sleep, at least in high \nschool and in college. Start to study issues of the Federal Reserve \nBoard and monetary policy and you very soon have a class that is fast \nasleep. Yet, the Federal Reserve Board and its conduct of monetary \npolicy in this country has a substantial impact on virtually every \nAmerican. The Federal Reserve Board controls America's money supply.\n  Why am I talking about it in the context of a bill on mandates? Very \nsimply, because the Federal Reserve Board will meet in a closed room, \nshut the door, and make a decision about America's money supply and \nmandate--it has at least in the last six instances--an increased \ninterest rate be paid by the American people.\n  That is kind of the mother of all mandates, if you think about it. \nEvery American will have their lives changed as a result of a decision \nmade by folks who portray themselves as a bunch of chaste economic \nmonks who get in this room and make decisions about money. What they \nare is a bunch of economists and bankers who find themselves a room \ndown in the Federal Reserve \n[[Page S1317]] Board. They convene in the room, incongruously named the \nOpen Market Committee, in a room that is closed. So I would like to \ncall it the Closed Market Committee. Let us no longer call it the Open \nMarket Committee. These folks go into the Open Market Committee in a \nclosed room, lock the door, and make decisions about America's money \nsupply. And at least in the last six instances over the last year, they \nhave decided to increase interest rates. That is, as I said, the mother \nof all mandates.\n  You do not enjoy the opportunity of saying, ``I am sorry, I disagree; \nI am not going to pay increased interest rates.'' Everybody pays them. \nThe Federal Government pays them. I will bet there are not many Members \nof the Senate who know how much the Federal Reserve Board's six \ninterest rate increases will have increased the Federal deficit in the \ncoming 5 years. Any guesses? Somewhere about $125 billion.\n  About 1\\1/2\\ years ago, we wrestled in this Chamber with this issue \nof deficit reduction. We had massive debates. The American people were \ninvolved. Some were upset and incensed and sending letters and calling. \nOthers were supportive. We were trying to reduce the Federal deficit in \na democratic way: Increasing taxes, decreasing spending. All of it very \ncontroversial, and all of it subject to great emotional debate in the \nopen. But the Federal Reserve Board goes into a room, shuts the door, \nand in a secret process decides we are going to mandate six interest \nrate increases, and they have imposed an additional cost on serving the \npublic debt of close to $125 billion.\n  In other words, they took back with no public debate one-fifth of all \nthat we did--one-fourth to one-fifth of all that we did--in this \ndeficit reduction debate that we had in Congress.\n  They did not ask us if they could do that, they just did it. But that \nis not the half of it. It is not just the $125 billion increase in \nserving the debt, debt service costs, that we will have experienced in \nthe next 5 years. It is the private sector. Everybody who has a home \nwith an adjustable rate mortgage is now paying more.\n  I had a fellow come up to me this weekend and tell me he is paying \n$125 more for his house payment than he did a year ago. Why? Magic? \nVoodoo? No. The Federal Reserve Board, that is why. They made decisions \nthat affect the lives of virtually every American. I mentioned what the \npublic sector cost is, just for the Federal Government, of the \ndecisions by the Fed, the mandate in interest rate increases: a $125 \nbillion increase in 5 years. What about the private sector? Mortgages \nthey pay, all kinds of other consequences? Mr. President, $218 billion \nin increased costs over 5 years for the private sector.\n  So the plain fact is the Federal Reserve Board imposes, by its \nmandate on interest rates, enormous costs on the American people. My \namendment is very, very simple. No one--not the slowest thinker--can \nallege not to understand this. My amendment says when the Federal \nReserve Board meets and increases interest rates--incidentally, they \nare meeting in the next week or so and some suggest they will probably \nincrease interest rates again--they have a responsibility within 30 \ndays to send to the Congress and to the President their evaluation of \nhow much additional cost they have imposed on, yes, the public sector, \nthe Federal Government, State and local governments, and also the \nprivate sector.\n  I asked Alan Greenspan in hearings some while ago: Do you, before you \nmake these decisions, assess how much you are going to impose on others \nin terms of costs? If they do, it is not available to us. So I do not \nknow. But I submit that they ought to. If someone will be making \ndecisions in this country that will increase the Federal deficit by \n$125 billion in 5 years, or lay on additional costs in the private \nsector of $218 billion over 5 years, they ought to be telling us that.\n  The Senator from Idaho, when he talks about mandates, or the Senator \nfrom Ohio--you can describe dozens of mandates--I defy anybody, and I \nam going to listen for the next week, I defy anybody under any \ncircumstance to describe for me any mandate that comes even close to \nthis mandate, comes even close to imposing $218 billion in added costs \non the private sector.\n You will not find one. This is the big mandate. This is the big one. \nThis is the one that imposes enormous costs, and it is done in secret; \ndone really without very much debate. It is interesting. Very few \npeople want to talk about interest rates in the Federal Reserve Board. \nAlan Greenspan, Chairman of the Fed, came up here the other day, and, \nhe said, ``I think that the Consumer Price Index really boosts \ninflation one-to-one and a half-percent beyond where it really is.'' I \nguess he said one-half of 1 percent to 1 percent. He said it overstates \nwhat inflation is.\n\n  We have had 4 successive years of decreased inflation. This year it \nis 2.7 percent. If Alan Greenspan thinks maybe that is a percent and a \nhalf over where it ought to be, that means the real inflation is 1.2 \npercent. Then I would ask him, if that is the case, what on Earth are \nyou doing increasing interest rates six times putting your foot on the \nbrakes to shut down the American economy and throw this country into a \nrecession if inflation is at 1.2 percent? What on Earth are you doing? \nOn whose behalf are you doing it?\n  We have different constituencies in this country. The Federal Reserve \nBoard serves it. I might say its constituency represents the large \nmoney center bank interests. In fact, the open market committee that \ngoes into the room and makes decisions there are people who are voting \non those decisions who are each regional Fed bank presidents that are \nappointed by no one that I am aware of except their private boards of \ndirectors which are controlled by bankers in their region. They are not \nconfirmed by anyone. So they are making public policy decisions in a \nmanner designed--I assume in a manner designed--to serve their \ninterests. Do you think they will come to town and say, ``The heck with \nmy board of directors, I could care less about those folks, and I am \ngoing to serve somebody else's interests?'' I have great trouble with \nthe whole concept of the way the Fed has been structured, and the way \nit has been behaving.\n  But my amendment in this circumstance is very clear and very simple. \nWhen the Federal Reserve Board takes action to increase interest rates, \nthat is the big mandate in this country. Let us have them within 30 \ndays send a report to the Congress and a report to the President saying \nhere are the costs from our assessment, here are the added costs that \nwe have imposed on governments and on the private sector.\n  I intend to seek a record vote on this. I would hope very much that \nit might be accepted. To those who are concerned about mandates, I say \nlet us not be concerned about the little ones, not the nuisance \nmandates so much. Let us be concerned about the biggest one. Let us be \nconcerned about the center pole in the mandates, the center pole \nFederal Reserve Board mandating mandates aside from the wisdom of the \nfact that what they are doing is completely out of sync with what they \nshould be doing. When they do it any time in the future, it seems to me \nthey have an obligation to report to us who will bear the cost of these \nmandates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note my colleague, Senator Reid \nfrom Nevada, is also going to speak on this issue.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid].\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to extend my congratulations to \nthe Senator from North Dakota of course for offering his amendment of \nwhich I am a sponsor, but more importantly for speaking out about the \nFederal Reserve.\n  For years I have sponsored legislation that would call for an audit \nof the Federal Reserve system. I have offered that amendment every \nyear. Every year the legislation gets nowhere.\n  I think it would be interesting to know about the Federal Reserve. I \nthink we should audit the Federal Reserve. It is taxpayers' money that \nis being used there. But we do not do that.\n  Senator Dorgan spoke out on the secrecy of the Federal Reserve \nsystem. He has spoken out on the Federal Reserve more than anyone that \nI know in either body. But even though there is no entity in the world \nthat controls \n[[Page S1318]] our lives more than the Federal Reserve System, his \nspeeches go unnoticed. And I am sorry to say that. People just do not \ncare it seems about the Federal Reserve. Maybe it is because it is a \nsubject that is not very interesting. It is not pornography. It is not \nmurder. It is not an issue that deals with the Wild West water, \ngrazing. It does not deal with issues that we talk about here a lot. \nBut we do not talk enough about the Federal Reserve and the impact it \nhas on our lives.\n  So I acknowledge the work that my friend from North Dakota has done \non this issue. I am sorry that his very lucid statement have received \nvery little attention.\n  I was thinking as the Senator from North Dakota was outlining the \nsecrecy of the Federal Reserve System that maybe what we should do--the \nCentral Intelligence Agency has received a lot of criticism lately for \nnot doing a real good job; one reason maybe is that they are not secret \nenough in some of the things they do--maybe we should combine them with \nthe Federal Reserve Board. What the Federal Reserve Board does nobody \nknows. Nobody knows what they are doing. It seems that everyone has \nsome idea what the CIA is doing. Maybe we could combine the two. It \nmight not be a bad idea.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six \ntimes since February 1994. If someone likes this legislation generally \nspeaking--that is, we are going to try to stop unfunded mandates--then \nthey should love this amendment. If the principle of unfunded mandates \nbeing stopped sounds good to Senators, then they should jump with joy \nand run over here and cosponsor this legislation because this really \novershadows all other unfunded mandates because these go on all the \ntime. Not only do they affect government because of the moneys that \ngovernments borrow, but they also affect the private sector \nsignificantly.\n  There is not a person that is listening to this debate who is not \nimpacted as a result of higher interest rates. It does not matter if \nthey are homeless or making a multimillion-dollar transaction on Wall \nStreet as we speak. Higher interest rates affect everybody in this \ncountry. What we are saying is that the Federal Reserve Board should \nprovide a report to Congress and to the President about anticipated \ncosts of changes in interest rates on the public and private sectors so \nwe are aware each time the Fed raises interest rates of how much more \nwe pay. We should have a little foundation as to what really we pay.\n  This amendment requires the Fed to prepare a report. This report will \ndetail the costs imposed by interest rate changes within 30 days after \nthe Fed decision to change those rates. The report will include an \nanalysis of the aggregate costs that interest rate changes would impose \non Federal, State, and local governments. It will provide a cost \nanalysis of interest rate changes on the private sector borrowing. This \nwill allow us to see the increases in borrowing costs for consumers, \nsmall business, homeowners and conventional lenders.\n  I am glad that there has been a rollcall vote called on this matter. \nI think it is important to people who are in favor of doing away with \nunfunded mandates--because they support the largest unfunded mandate we \nhave in America today.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Dorgan \namendment regarding the Federal Reserve. Actions by the Federal \nReserve, most notably the six interest rate increases in the last year, \nhave a huge effect on our economy. In impact, it is an independent \npowerful fourth branch of Government, a branch of Government that has \neffectively been able to deflect reasonable examination. The impact of \nthe Federal Reserve's actions needs to be better understood by the \npublic and by the Congress. This amendment is a very rational and well \nthought out step in that direction.\n  Many would argue that one of the most significant changes in \nGovernment policy was the passage of the 1993 Reconciliation Act which \namong other things reduced the deficit by $500 billion over 5 years, \nabout one-third of the way we needed to go to get to balance. Dozens of \narticles appeared on front pages of newspapers as that controversial \nhard fought measure went through the legislative process. The $500 \nbillion sum, was in fact, an amount suggested by Alan Greenspan, the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve. Each component was scrutinized by some \ndegree. Many parts of the measure involving less than 5 percent of the \nwhole were bitterly fought over.\n  In 1994, the Federal Reserve took what might be the second most \nsignificant Government action of the last 2 years. Six times, they \nincreased the interest costs on everybody from the Federal Government \nand local governments, to families with mortgages and credit cards, to \nalmost every business in the Nation.\n  While many fought bitterly against the tax increases that were \nincluded in 1993 Reconciliation Act, there was barely a word from most \nabout the huge tax increase that resulted from the Fed's rate \nincreases. While the first measure cost a typical family under $20 a \nyear in higher taxes, the second cost many modest income families with \nan adjustable mortgage over a $1,000 in a year, 50 times the impact.\n  This wave of interest rate increases has been estimated to cost the \nFederal Government $107 billion over 5 years. And, the cost to the \nprivate sector is probably a lot higher. That is a huge impact with \nminimal public discussion on a governmental decision so significantly \naffecting both the Federal Government, local governments, and the \nprivate sector.\n  This amendment would help us to understand the impact of the Fed's \nactions and that would be a significant improvement.\n  The six increases in interest rates were largely justified by the Fed \non the basis of their fear of rising inflation. In 1994, the CPI \nincreased by a meager 2.7 percent, exactly last year's rate of \ninflation. When more volatile food and fuel\n costs were taken out, the rate increased by 2.6 percent, the lowest \nlevel of inflation since 1965. And, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's Chairman \nsaid he believed that the CPI was actually overstating inflation by .5 \nto 1.5 percent. If he were right about the CPI, and I have my doubts, \nGreenspan has pushed a huge burden on our economy when he believes that \ninflation has been under 2 percent a year over the past 2 years.\n\n  Where is this inflation that the Fed has been expecting?\n  Now, there are indications put out by the Fed's rumor mill that they \nwill raise interest rates for a seventh time by another half percent or \nmore on February 1.\n  The Fed says it takes a long time for the pain of their interest rate \nincreases to work their way through the economy and cause the economy \nto slow down; that is, to cause enough people to be fired and for \nenough unemployed people to stay that way. It may take from 6 to 18 \nmonths.\n  I would like to ask: Is it logical to rush forward with a seventh \nincrease in interest rates when we have not seen the impact of the \nearlier increases? If the Fed Chairman believes inflation has been \nrunning at less than 2 percent, I would think he would want to wait.\n  I would think the Fed would not want the slope of interest rates to \nrise too quickly. Because the higher we climb, the harder it will be \nfor the economy to have the soft landing that we all want.\n  Some say that the Fed has an economic model that assumes that \nwhenever unemployment drops to a certain point, it will put pressure on \nemployers to provide some wage increases. And those wage increases will \ncause inflation. So, under this model, every time employment levels are \ngood and people are working, the Fed fights to get that favorable \nsituation reversed.\n  The Fed seems to work to create a guaranteed minimum level of \nunemployment and to minimize any general increase in wages.\n  I believe the Fed is, to some extent, fighting the last war.\n  Some have suggested that the tremendous growth in discount stores and \nthe growing willingness of consumers to use private labels creates a \nreal difficulty of manufacturers and retailers to raise prices. Some \npeople see a\n new culture developing in many manufacturing areas which place \nconsiderable pressure on suppliers to avoid cost increases and to \ndevelop new lower cost methods of producing goods. To some extent, \ngains in computer design are \n[[Page S1319]] providing methods to accomplish that goal.\n  And, as our country is more and more integrated in a world economy, \nthe ability to raise the price of many U.S. goods and the ability to \nseek wage increases not related to greater productivity are declining.\n  Coming back to the analysis required by this amendment, clearly, this \nis important information that the public and policymakers should have \nabout our economy and the effect of Federal Reserve actions.\n  Lastly, I wanted to comment on why this amendment should be on this \nbill. The Fed's interest rate increases are a mandate, a mandate on \nevery city, county, and State in the Nation that issues bonds. It is a \nmandate on every business in the Nation that has loans based on the \nprime rate. It is a mandate on every family with a variable rate \nmortgage and many other kinds of loans. As Senator Dorgan said, the \nFed's interest rate hikes are the mother of all mandates.\n  I commend Senator Dorgan for all of his work in this important area \nand urge adoption of his amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I feel compelled to rise in opposition to \nthe Senator from North Dakota's amendment--an amendment, which in my \nview is misplaced, unwise, and dangerously myopic.\n  The independent role of the Federal Reserve in setting monetary \npolicy remains critical to the long-term stability of this country.\n  Cries for more public input in monetary policy decisionmaking \nmisapprehend the necessary role of a central bank in our market system \nand jeopardize a carefully crafted balance between independence and \npublic accountability.\n  Public accountability, in contrast to public input, already exists \nunder the current structure of the Federal Resource.\n  The Fed and its activities are already highly scrutinized by both \nHouses of Congress pursuant to the Humphrey-Hawkins Act--and I dare say \nthat Chairman Greenspan spends about as much time on the Hill \ntestifying before one committee or another than he does at the Federal \nReserve engaging in monetary policy decisionmaking.\n  This amendment is not about public accountability, Mr. President. \nRather, this amendment is about a trade-off between long-term stability \nand short-term gain.\n  This amendment represents a rough attempt to influence monetary \npolicy for short-term political purposes.\n  And yet even if it were successful in its purpose--to try and keep \ninterest rates artificially low--it would still be ineffective, Mr. \nPresident, because long-term interests rates are not determined by U.S. \nmonetary policy alone.\n  The Fed does not make decisions in a vacuum. Long-term bond and \ncurrency values reflect international confidence in the conduct of our \nmonetary policy, not simply the Fed's pegged Federal funds rate. And a \nloose monetary policy, set through a politically influenced \ndecisionmaking process would send a strong message to the rest of the \nworld.\n  It would basically be telling our international neighbors that we are \nmore concerned with macroeconomic gain than price stability and strong, \nlong-term economic growth.\n  Mr. President, soft money means a soft economy. Adopt the view \nendorsed by this amendment and we won't have to worry about bolstering \nthe Mexican economy through billion-dollar subsidies--we can make the \npeso look good by encouraging a lack of confidence in United States \nmonetary policy and the dollar.\n  This amendment is not only unwise and myopic, it is misplaced.\n  It would force the Fed to report to Congress and the White House what \ncosts are imposed on the market every time it raises interest rates. \nHow do you define what comprises costs on the public and private \nsector? Do you net costs and benefits?\n  Would the proponents of this amendment agree the way many of them did \nduring the health care debate that the short-term costs are outweighed \nby the long-term benefits? It would appear so.\n  Even if you could quantify such costs--which I nonetheless believe \nwould be a specious exercise at best--this amendment is an unnecessary \nregulatory nightmare.\n  Congress already has the ability to ask the Fed about the costs of \nraising interest rates and it has, both through committee oversight and \nby individual Member queries to the Fed.\n  So what is the purpose of this amendment? To bog the Fed down in more \nreporting requirements and politicize its decisionmaking process by \ntriggering the reporting requirements only when the Fed decides to \nincrease interest rates.\n  Mr. President, the amendment also misapprehends its populist appeal.\n  It seems to me that on November 8 the American people were pretty \nclear about a couple of things--one of which is that they can rarely \ntrust Congress to conduct the responsibilities it already has, like \nmaking fiscal policy.\n  I'm quite sure that such a healthy skepticism for this body's \nabilities would certainly extend to any ideas of Congress extending its \nreach further into Fed monetary policymaking.\n  I bet the American people would be much more interested in seeing the \nCongress report on the costs to the public and private sectors every \ntime it votes to raise taxes.\n  I like low interest rates, too, Mr. President, but I'm not willing to \nsacrifice the long-term health of our economy to obtain them.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has nothing to do with unfunded Federal \nmandates, but instead is strictly about challenging the role of the Fed \nin setting monetary policy by making it more politically accountable to \nCongress.\n  Costs imposed by rising interest rates are not unfunded Federal \nmandates. As I've stated before, the Fed can only do so much to affect \ninterest rates, the market will influence the rise or fall in interest \nrates no matter what the Fed does.\n  If anything, this amendment is about imposing new mandates by \nrequiring the Fed to comply with new and extensive reporting \nrequirements.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not the appropriate piece of legislation \nfor this amendment and I would urge my colleagues to support the \nSenator from Idaho's motion to table the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What is the present parliamentary situation? Is there \nan amendment to be voted on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment by the Senator from North Dakota \nis pending.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Are we going to stay on that until 4 o'clock when we \nvote? Is that the ruling of the Chair?\n  Mr. President, while I do have the floor, could I put up an amendment \nor how can that be arranged? Will there be no more amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may ask consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily set aside \nthe pending amendment so that I can introduce one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. I thank the \ndistinguished managers of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about the biggest unfunded mandate of \nall, which is not just interest costs on the Federal debt, but the \nentire Federal budget. We just heard--and I want to join the leadership \nof the distinguished Senator from North Dakota and the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada in their concern relative to interest costs. I will \nmomentarily put into the Record a table that will show my colleagues \nexactly where we are.\n  Prior to that, let me speak to some of the problems facing our \nNation. We are really in crisis, Mr. President, with respect to our \nfiscal situation and also in crisis in our cultural situation.\n  We all know the litany: There are some 40 million Americans in \npoverty. Some 10 million are homeless, sleeping in the streets; another \n12 million children are hungry. The cities are a cesspool of crime and \nviolence; the land is drug infested; the schools have turned into \nshooting galleries. Even more alarming, we now find that of those \nbetween the age of 17 and 24, 73 percent cannot find a job out of \npoverty. In sum, we are dividing into a two-tiered society, the haves \nand the have-nots.\n  [[Page S1320]] The middle class that everybody seems to want to \naddress is disappearing. Rather than offering up a State of the Union, \nrather than coming up with contracts premised on the dismantlement of \nGovernment, what we need is a plan to start the Government back up \nagain, for it is only the Federal Government that can solve these \nproblems. With all 50 States joining hands and pulling together, we can \nwork our way out of this dilemma.\n  Mr. President, our security is like resting upon a three-legged \nstool. We have the first leg, the values we have as a country, and \nthose are very strong. We readily sacrificed lives to feed the hungry \nin Somalia; we sacrificed lives again trying to promote democracy in \nHaiti; and we are now willing to send earthquake relief aid to Japan. \nWe, as an American country--not as a middle class or lower class or \nunderclass or rich class--willingly sacrifice and give assistance where \nit is needed.\n  Similarly, the second leg of our security rests on the leg of \nmilitary power, and the strength of that is unquestioned. Finally, the \nthird leg is that of our economic security, and that leg is fractured, \nin disrepair, and about to break because of the very litany that we \nhave all enunciated on the floor.\n  We act as if it is the best of times, and all we need to do is give \nto the various interest groups their wants. For those in California, we \nwill now finally have a program on immigration after we just passed a \nmultibillion-dollar bill on that subject. It makes a difference. But we \nhave never even given the additional border patrols and everything else \na chance to work, including the new offices that were set up. The \nthrust of such pollster-driven policies would be to say, ``We have not \ndone anything,'' and ``Let us start doing something there,'' because \nCalifornia is important in the Presidential race.\n  Of course meanwhile, both sides are trying their dead-level best to \nflatter the middle class with gifts such as tax cuts. Mr. President, we \ndo not have anything to give. The tenor and tempo of the moment should \nrather be that of John F. Kennedy back some 30 years ago when he said, \n``My program is not a set of promises of what I intend to give the \nAmerican people, but rather a set of challenges of what I intend to ask \nof the American people.''\n  Rather than facing challenges and bringing reality, we are off on a \ntoot, chasing around in a veritable contest, a foot race, if you \nplease, trying to dismantle the Government and saying that the \nGovernment is the enemy. The truth of the matter is that the Government \nis a friend. We have valid programs working which need to be expanded \nupon--women, infants, and children feeding, 50 percent receive funding \nand 50 percent go wanting. But for every dollar I spend on women, \ninfants, and children feeding, I save $3. For if I do not spend that \nmoney on nutritional supplements, I have, by account, an increase low \nbirthweight infants. The average stay in an incubator for the low \nbirthweight infants is 30 days, at $1,000 a day, or $30,000.\n  Getting to the needs of the hour, we need to embellish the WIC \nProgram and the Head Start Program. We can furnish the studies that \nshow for every $1 that we invest in Head Start--not to the cities or to \nthe States or to get it back to the people or to dismantle it and all \nthe other gobbledygook they are giving us--Head Start saves $4.50 for \nevery $1 we spend. We ought to extend that to the other 40 percent of \nAmericans that are not participating.\n  With respect to funding for the disadvantaged, half of those eligible \nare not receiving benefits, but for every $1 we spend there, $6.25 is \nsaved. Biomedical research, which is a distressing thing to me, we have \ncut back under President Clinton's administration on top of the cuts \nthat we have had under Reagan-Bush. But for every $1 we spend in \nbiomedical research out at NIH, we save $13.50.\n  Indeed, the Federal Government has a lot of good roles to perform. \nWelfare reform--you are getting another unfunded mandate, Mr. Governor, \nI can tell you now. Some will get welfare and some will not. Those \nrecipients in the ``have-not'' States with the bigger burden will start \nmoving to those ``have'' States. In fact, that is what brought about \nthe Federal program.\n  I can tell you, once they get to welfare reform and try to set up \nthose jobs to make people work, no money is going to be saved. It is \ngoing to cost more. Welfare reform is going to cost more. Name the odds \nand I will take all bets.\n  Similarly with health reform. Yes, we can slow down the growth of \nrising health costs, but the savings that we achieve through reductions \nin all of the entitlements will leave us far short of our goal. My \npoint is while we may save some, we will not save enough. So, it is \nimportant that we come and start looking, if you please, at what we \nreally need in this land of ours. And I will get into that on another \noccasion, because I want to address the problem of this unfunded \nmandate, the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, we need a Marshall plan for America. If we are going \nto have a capital gains tax cut, we need to have it for inner-city \ninvestment to industry, not just for the rich just to write off. In \naddition, we need to promote savings. We need targeted IRA's and \nincentives to promote investment in research and development investment \nhere in the United States. With respect to technology, we need the \nadvanced technology program, which is subject to peer review by the \nNational Academy of Engineering and devoid of any political pork.\n  Regrettably, you see some shouting in the contract that these are \npork barrel programs. We have to get into competition with a \ncompetitive trade and industrial policy. We can go down the list of the \nneeds, but we do not have any money.\n  Looking at what is available, I find myself much like the famous \ncharacter in ``Alice In Wonderland,'' where to stay where I am, I have \nto run as fast I can; to get ahead, I have to run even faster.\n  Let me turn momentarily to the interest costs on the public debt. I \ncan tell you, before Chairman Greenspan raised interest rates, the CBO \nestimated $311 billion for the 1995 gross interest costs on the public \ndebt. Now, comes January, it has jumped some 28 billion bucks to $339 \nbillion and is projected to rise to $408 billion by 2002.\n  So what I have tried to do in this particular exercise is to bring \ninto focus the magnitude of our current fiscal situation. I have been \nin a drill now all this month with my staff and the best of minds. I \nhave summarized it on one sheet of paper. And I will ask my staff to \ndistribute this sheet to our friends on the floor and any others who \nare interested. Yes, statistics are boring, but it is a reality.\n  We start, Mr. President, with reality check No. 1, that it will \nrequire approximately $1.2 trillion in spending cuts to execute item \nNo. 1 of the Contract With America; namely, to balance that budget.\n  Now, balancing the budget is not a new thing. I have tried dutifully \nas a Member--and Senator Domenici and I are the only remaining Members \nsince the initiation over 20 years now of the Budget Committee--and as \na former chairman, I have conscientiously tried freezes. I have tried \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings--which, incidentally, my colleagues, Mr. Gramm \nand Mr. Rudman, joined in abolishing in 1990 when we went from fixed to \nfloating targets. We had the discipline. We needed to maintain that \ndiscipline, but in October of 1990, I guess it was--we will find out \nthe exact date--at around 20 minutes to 1:00 in the morning, I will \nnever forget making the point of order; the point of order was appealed \nand Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, for all intents and purposes, was abolished.\n  Do not say, ``It did not work.'' That is what I hear is said in these \nmeetings and seminars, that Gramm-Rudman-Hollings did not work. The \nfact of the matter is that it was not the law that failed, but rather a \nbipartisan failure on the part of Congress to meet the targets.\n  The problem continues to worsen--and I emphasize, Mr. President, \n``worsen''--because if we had had the freezes that my distinguished \nfriend on the other side of the aisle, the majority leader, Howard \nBaker of Tennessee, and I once offered, we would have a balanced budget \nthis very minute.\n  After failing with freezes, I then came with taxes. Now, I have been \nin public service 40 years and I am not some loon who is off trying to \nget a headline. I do not need it. Instead, I try to make headway.\n   [[Page S1321]] And I know that taxes are unpopular. Because of \npollster politics in this land, every politician is told, whether \nRepublican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, that Americans are all \nagainst taxes. Uniquely and ironically, we are in such a position that \nthe only way we can stop increasing daily interest taxes by $1 billion \nis to raise taxes.\n Now think about that statement. I said to stop increasing daily \ninterest taxes of $1 billion. Or save a few Sundays, we pushing gross \ninterest up to $339 billion. That interest cost to me is the worst tax \nof all, because it cannot be avoided. That is the first thing that \ncomes off the top. So, we have spending on automatic pilot and tax \nincreases on automatic pilot. That is why I say our country is in \ncrisis.\n\n  The truth of the matter is that we have not paid for the Congress in \nyears. We have not paid for the FBI in years. We have not paid for the \nDEA in years. We have not paid for the Departments of Commerce, the \nInterior, Agriculture, and other Departments in years. Why? Because if \nwe look to see domestic discretionary--not defense--domestic \ndiscretionary spending right this minute is $253 billion. Defense \nspending is $270 billion; international affairs is $21 billion for a \ngrand total in discretionary spending of $544 billion.\n  Get that figure in your mind and turn to the size of the deficit. The \ntrue deficit figure for 1995 is $283 billion and not the $176 billion \nthat the press continues to report. They do not want to speak the truth \nin budgeting. I offered the amendment along with my late friend, \nSenator Heinz, to prevent us from using the Social Security trust fund \nto mask the size of the deficit. They do not adhere to it. OMB and CBO \ngive two figures, one using the trust funds, one not using them.\n  As an aside, I might mention that Social Security is paying its way. \nIt is not in the red. In fact, by the end of the century we will owe \nSocial Security $1 trillion. One trillion dollars we have borrowed. We \nare using these little IOU slips in the trust fund drawer to mask the \ntrue size of the deficit.\n  Now we will jump back to the $253 billion we spend on domestic \ndiscretionary programs. The courts, the Congress, the President, the \nFBI, the judges--all of these Departments of Government add up to $253 \nbillion. Similarly, at the present time we have a deficit of $283 \nbillion. Thus, we could eliminate all of Government and we would still \nbe facing a deficit.\n  When we come around with the Contract with America and say we will \nbalance the budget with spending cuts, eliminate the Government, so to \nspeak, we will still have a deficit. This is the unpardonable crisis we \nhave worked our way into. I have continued to search for ideas. I \nappeared with the best of experts, Mr. Charles Walker, former \nUndersecretary of the Treasury, Dr. Cnossen of the Netherlands, who \nhelped write the Japanese value-added tax, the United Kingdom's value-\nadded tax.\n  I have been to countries like Argentina that are operating on a \nbalanced budget. I have been to Chile where they are operating on a \nbalanced budget, and I am lecturing them? I am embarrassed. I have the \nbiggest foreign debt. I have gross interest, the biggest domestic \naccount that we can possibly think of, and we act like all we are here \nto do is make the headlines with contracts, identify with the family, \nidentify with the middle class, identify with California on \nimmigration, and get past, if you please, the election.\n  I have tried to work on those entitlements. I wish Senators could \nhave been at some of the meetings that I had with Claude Pepper. I \nlearned that senior citizens were willing to sacrifice as long as \neveryone shared in shouldering the load. At a meeting with Claude and \nsome senior citizens, I asked everyone to raise their hands if they \nwere willing to just hold the line, freeze Social Security not cut it, \nbut not get any increase so long as no one else got any increase. I \nwould pick up half of Claude Pepper's audience. They would raise their \nhands and some would stand. After that, the distinguished Congressman \nfrom Florida and chairman of that particular committee quit inviting me \nto the meetings.\n  I have stood the fire on COLA freezes. Someone on the other side \nmight try and say, ``Oh, you did not vote that way in September 1985, \nwhen they wheeled in Pete Wilson for the Republican freeze of Social \nSecurity.'' That's true, I did not because it did not apply to every \nother particular program.\n  In addition, I have tried to reduce other entitlements. Along with \nthe Senator from Kansas, now majority leader, I attempted to reduce the \nwaste and inefficiencies in the Food Stamp Program, but the promised \nsavings never materialized. Instead, we saw more and more children \nqualify for the program. I can tell Members here and now what causes \nlatchkey children. It is that the average family's income has steadily \ndeclined. So both parents have to get out and they both have to hustle. \nThat is the case in my family and perhaps in your families and \neverybody's family. That is the fact of life.\n  Some of them have to get out in order to support their children. The \nchild is left at home.\n  And there it is. If you think you are going to save on aid for \ndependent children, look at what the distinguished majority leader said \nin the morning paper that I read: Babies having babies we deplore, but \nwe are not cutting the children off. I agree with him. It is a child \nproblem, it is not a political problem with the next election to \nidentify: ``I got hold of those riding around in Cadillacs and buying \nT-bone steaks with their food stamps''. I have heard that ad nauseam \nfor years and have written a book on hunger. We will talk on that at \nlength on a different occasion.\n  My point in this whole particular amendment is that we are really in \na crisis condition relative to spending on automatic pilot, and the \nneed of the hour is not a delay for a constitutional amendment.\n   The time for the discipline has passed, so to speak. What we need to \ndo is do it. We all are like a bunch of players that have run up into \nthe grandstand hollering, ``We want a touchdown; we want a touchdown; \nwe want a touchdown.'' Darn it, get down on the field and score a \ntouchdown. We are the players.\n  I remember when Ronald Reagan came to town. He said he was going to \nbalance the budget in 1 year. When he got here, after he had gotten \nelected on that pledge, he said, ``Oops, this thing is way worse. It's \ngoing to take me 2 years.''\n  We went back, thinking he was serious, in the Budget Committee and \nsaid, ``All right, we'll make it 3 years so it will be realistic and we \ncan get it done.''\n  That was 1981, and by 1985, we had not done anything. In fact, we had \nthis growth, growth, growth. We were supposed to grow out of our \nproblems and give the people back their money so they can spend it \nbetter than Washington. We have been through that.\n  But the fact of the matter is, by 1985 in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we \nhad to make a 5-year plan. Now they are jumping it to 7 years. If you \nagree to that, I can tell you the next Congress is going to come for 10 \nyears. Up, up, and away, just so long as you do not face the music.\n  I am saying now is the hour to face that music. We cannot do all we \nwant done. But we can make a good start of providing a Marshall plan to \nrebuild the economy of this land so that we can go back to providing \njobs for Americans.\n  The reality is that you cannot save enough on entitlements. What \nabout defense? There are those who want to increase it inordinately. \nThere are those who want to decrease it inordinately. I think the best \njudgment at this hour is to hold the line on defense and let the \nDefense Department really stabilize under the Bottom-Up Review.\n  With respect to domestic discretionary spending reductions, they have \nto come from freezes and cuts. But once you go over the list, you find \nout that there are not enough savings to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this cover sheet, with the \nlist of the cuts, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  I been trying to put us on a reasonable path to get our deficit down \nto zero. But to do that through spending reductions alone requires $1.2 \nbillion in cuts over 7 years and $37 billion in the first year.\n  Thirty-seven billion dollars in domestic discretionary looks \nattainable until you try it on. That is why I have listed them, doing \nmy dead-level best to get up to the $37 billion. I have listed the \nspace station, eliminate it; the community development block grants; \nthe lower-income home energy assistance; the arts funding, the funding \nfor campus-based aid; the funding for impact aid; the funding to \ncontrol drugs; SBA loans should be eliminated; the Federal aid to mass \ntransit; eliminate the Economic Development Administration; reduce the \nFederal rent subsidies; reduce overhead for university research; repeal \nDavis-Bacon--I am going down a list of all these things they have been \nthinking about.\n  I am going down a list of all these things they have been speaking \nabout.\n  Reduce the State Department funding and end miscellaneous activities, \nend P.L. 480 title I and title III sales, eliminate the overseas \nbroadcasting, the Bureau of

hospitals, reduce the number of political employees, reduce \nthe management costs for the VA health care, reduce the PMA subsidy, \nreduce below-cost timber sales, reduce the legislative branch 15 \npercent, eliminate the small business development centers, eliminate \nthe minority assistance on SCORE, technical assistance programs for \nwomen's business assistance, international trade assistance and import \nzones--all that is minority assistance gone, just like they did the \ncaucus over across the hall there--eliminate new State Department \nconstruction projects, eliminate the International Boundaries and Water \nCommission, eliminate the Asia Foundation, eliminate the International \nFisheries Commission, eliminate the Arms Control Disarmament Agency, \neliminate the National Endowment for Democracy, eliminate Fulbright and \nother international exchanges, eliminate the North-South Center, \neliminate the United States contribution to the World Health

(1994-1995).\n\n\n                          iv. eligibility age\n\n       A. Raise the Medicare entitlement age to 67:\n       Cost savings: Savings would begin in the year 2000 and \n     build as the increase is phased in over 26 years. The \n     potential savings would be approx. $60 billion per year \n     immediately after the entitlement age reaches 67 in 2027. \n     This amount is between $4.7 and $14.6 billion per year, \n     depending on the measure used.\n\n\n                            v. means testing\n\n       A. Establish an income-tested deductible for the sum of \n     payments under part A and part B of Medicare:\n       Cost savings: $55 billion annual savings. The authority of \n     this option (CATO) estimate that it would reduce the growth \n     of outlays from medical care by at least one percentage \n     point.\n\n\n              vi. health maintenance organizations (HMOs)\n\n       A. Standardize payments to HMOs:\n       Cost savings: $1.285 billion over 6 years. (OMB projection \n     for 1995-2000).\n\n\n                 vii. extend provisions of current law\n\n       A. Medicare secondary payment (MSP):\n       Cost savings: $2.680 billion over 2 years (HHS projection \n     for 1999-2000; no savings in 1995-1998 because the current \n     system covers up to 1998).\n       B. Permanently extend the data program to identify Medicare \n     secondary payment (MSP):\n       [[Page S1325]] Cost savings: $465 million over 2 years. \n     (HHS projection; no savings before 1999 because current \n     system is in effect through 1998).\n\n\n                  viii. administrative savings options\n\n       A. MSP Overpayments:\n       Cost savings: Savings from this proposal depend on \n     administrative action, including the allocation of sufficient \n     discretionary funding to the HCFA to collect the estimated \n     overpayments. While the maximum savings would be $961.6 \n     million in the first year, it is unlikely that all of this \n     sum would be collectable.\n       B. Increase Medicare oversight funding for the contractors \n     that do claims processing:\n       Cost savings (savings in mandatory spending, but costs in \n     discretionary spending):\n       Heritage Foundations--$5.4 billion over 5 years.\n       GAO--stated that CBO does not make estimates of this type \n     of savings but does not disagree with GAO.\n                Chapter 4: Proposals To Reform Medicaid\n\n       1. Institutionalized care.\n       A. Nursing facility care (NFC):\n       1. Mandate state regulation of growth in the number of \n     nursing home beds.\n       Cost savings: $625 million over 5 years. (CBO projection \n     for 1995-1999).\n       B. Institutions for the mentally retarded:\n       1. Reduce to legally authorized levels of Medicaid payments \n     to institutions for the mentally retarded.\n       Cost savings: $3.415 billion over 5 years. (HHS projection \n     based on annual savings of $683 million).\n\n\n                             miscellaneous\n\n       A. Managed care:\n       1. Require states to phases in managed care programs for \n     Medicaid patients.\n       Cost savings: $10 billion over 5 years. (1995-1999).\n       B. Merge Women Infants and Children (WIC) with Medicaid:\n       Cost savings: $4.4 billion over 4 years. (1992-1996).\n       C.

Eliminate Medicaid transition benefits for AFDC \n     recipients:\n       Cost savings: $750 million over 4 years (1992-1996).\n       E. Eliminate Federal matching in the Medicaid Program for \n     the State Medicare buy-in:\n       Cost savings: $3.6 billion over 6 years. (1992-1996).\n\n      Chapter 5: Proposals To Reform Federal Health Care Programs\n\n\n                  i. federal employees health benefits\n\n       A. End the pay-as-you-go policy for Federal employees \n     health benefits program and prefund Federal retirees' health \n     insurance (pay-as-you-earn policy):\n       Cost savings: $11.6 billion over 5 years. Estimates of \n     savings could vary greatly, depending on CBO's estimate of \n     the timing of a Postal rate increase to finance this \n     proposal. The recorded deficit would not change by adopting \n     this proposal because the increased agency payments would \n     simply represent transactions between accounts within the \n     budget. But the option's coverage of government enterprises, \n     primarily the Postal Service, would reduce the Federal budget \n     deficit in the near term. The option would increase agencies' \n     current costs, but the agencies could offset these increases \n     by absorbing the costs through program reductions, or by \n     increasing the postage and utility rates and thus decrease \n     the budget deficit. Almost all of the savings would come from \n     the Postal Service because it is highly labor intensive. Rate \n     increases could not be effective before late 1996 or early \n     1997.\n\n\n                      ii. health care block grants\n\n       A. Reduce funding by 50 percent for the maternal child \n     health (MCH) block grant and the preventive health services \n     block grant:\n       Cost savings: $1.7 billion over 5 years. (1992-1996).\n          Chapter 9: Proposals To Reform Means-tested Programs\n\n     Part 1: Proposals To Reform Supplemental Security Income (SSI)\n\n\n                         i. programmatic reform\n\n       A. Reduce the $20 exclusion from income in SSI:\n       Cost savings: $1 billion over 5 years.\n       B.

Review status of SSI child disability recipients upon \n     eighteenth birthday:\n       Cost savings: Not Available.\n\n\n       ii. administrative proposals that require no change in law\n\n       A. Overpayments and debts:\n       1. Report the admission of SSI recipients to nursing homes \n     in a timely fashion in order to stop overpayment of benefits.\n       Cost savings: $110 million over 5 years.\n       2.

Improve recovery SSI overpayments by offsetting \n     reductions in Social Security payments.\n       Cost savings through legislation: $120 million over 5 \n     years.\n       Cost savings without legislation: $46.5 million over 5 \n     years.\n\n                  Part 2: Proposals To Reform Welfare\n\n\n                         i. non-citizens/aliens\n\n       A.

Limit Federal participation in States' costs for \n     administering the Foster Care Program:\n       Option 1: This option would limit annual increases in \n     payments to each state for administrative costs to 10 percent \n     a year:\n       Cost savings: $150 million over five years (CBO Cost \n     projections).\n       Option 2: This option would limit annual increases in \n     payments to each state in the four following ways:\n       Cost savings: $1.793 billion over 5 years.\n       F. Require States to develop criteria and implement \n     procedures for assuring that foster care agencies refer \n     appropriate cases to State child support agencies:\n       Cost savings: $55 million over 5 years.\n\nPart 3: Proposals To Reform the Food Stamp and Child Nutrition Programs\n\n\n                      i. administrative proposals\n\n       A. Merge AFDC, food stamps, public housing assistance, the \n     earned income tax credit (EITC), and other welfare programs \n     into a cash assistance program requiring recipients without \n     children to work for assistance:\n       Cost savings: $10 billion over 5 years.\n\n\n            ii. changes in federal reimbursement procedures\n\n       A.

ALLOWANCES\n\n       A. Charge a penalty for early redemptions of saving bonds:\n       Cost savings: $240 million over 5 years.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, Mr. President, if you want your knees to buckle, \nread that. Dick Armey is right. If you want your knees to buckle, read \nthat one, or listen to the discretionary cuts. I would not favor half \nof these. I probably would not favor 70 percent of these cuts. I have \nnot gone down and said what I would cut.\n  I am trying, as I would, when I was chairman of the Budget Committee, \nto pose to the colleagues here the art of the possible. Here is what is \nnecessary. Here is what has to be done. And then, assuming it is done, \nthe key point here is those are 1996 outlay amounts. That amounts in \n1997 to only $58.407 billion in cuts. If you look at 1997, you have to \nhave $74 billion in spending cuts, so you are still $16 billion shy \nnext year when you work on the budget. The same will be true the year \nafter that, and the year after that, and the year after that.\n  You see, this is what my colleagues have to understand. If they do \nnot put the budget on a glidepath to zero now, you will always be \nplaying catch-up. The next thing you know, you'll be moving the \ntargets.\n  Now, let us not talk fancifully. I will never forget, Mr. President, \nwhen the distinguished Senator from New Mexico--we all act like \ngovernment started up when Gingrich came to town. We have been in \ngovernment for quite a while, and several items in the contract, of \ncourse, we not only have favored, we cosponsored 10 years ago. The \nline-item veto. I used the line-item veto as a Governor 35 years ago. \nSo it is not an invention in a contract. Last year, the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey, Senator Bradley, and I tried again. We got 53 \nvotes. The idea is separately enroll individual items so the President \ncan veto legislation like we do at the State level.\n  Many of these so-called new ideas have been tried before. Back in \n1986, the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee got nettled in the debate because colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle were chastising him saying, ``Why don't you put in the cuts? \nWhy don't you put in the cuts?'' So in a fit of, let us call it, \nsobriety, the Domenici-Chiles modified amendment was introduced \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that some 44 programs be terminated. \nAnd I will ask that the list be included in the Record. You hear the \nsame song in the Contract With America. We are going to do away with \nthe ICC. We are going to do away with weatherization assistance. We are \ngoing to do away with the community services block grants and the \ntravel and tourism administration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those programs be \nreprinted at this particular point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Reagan Budget Cuts--1986\n\n       Work incentive program (WIN).\n       General revenue sharing.\n       Conrail.\n       Trade adjustment assistance to firms.\n       Appalachian Regional Commission.\n       Economic Development Administration.\n       Urban development action grants.\n       U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration.\n       Export-Import Bank direct loans.\n       Community services block grant.\n       Rental housing development action grant (HODAG).\n       Section 312 rehabilitation loan fund.\n       Postal Subsidy.\n       FEMA supplemental emergency food and shelter.\n       Advanced communications technology satellite.\n       OPIC insurance programs.\n       Amtrak.\n       Interstate Commerce Commission (terminations and \n     transfers).\n       Washington Metro construction grants.\n       Maritime cargo preference expansion.\n       EPA sewage treatment grants.\n       Impact aid (type ``b'' students).\n       Library programs.\n       Small higher education programs.\n       State student incentive grants.\n       College housing loans (new loans).\n       Public Health Service (health profession subsidies).\n       Legal Services Corporation.\n       Certain soil conservation programs.\n       Federal crop insurance program.\n       Rural housing loans/grants.\n       Small Business Administration (eliminations and transfers).\n       Rental rehabilitation grants.\n       Section 8 moderate rehabilitation.\n       Section 202 elderly and handicapped housing.\n       Section 108 loan guarantee program.\n       Rural development program.\n       Rural Electrification Administration subsidies.\n       Weatherization assistance program.\n       LANDSAT (eliminate future subsidies for contractors).\n       Sea grant and coastal zone management grant programs.\n       Juvenile justice grants.\n       Justice State-local assistance grants.\n       Public debt reimbursements to Federal Reserve Banks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. So the Senator from New Mexico, under the best of the \nbest dismantlers of Government, President Ronald Reagan, made the \nmotion that we terminate these programs. In other words, what he did \nwas take the Reagan spending cuts.\n  Everyone has said, ``Oh, if they only took the cuts.'' They have \nclaimed that Congress went ahead with increases in defense and other \nprograms, but never enacted the cuts like we were supposed to do. We \ntried with a sense-of-the-Senate. Do you know how many votes they got? \nMr. President, 14 votes out of the 100.\n  So we have a track record. We have tried it before, 10 years ago. We \nwill try it again. But we have to face the facts as the facts face us. \nWe could not get it done then and I am sincerely concerned that we will \nnot get it done now. But that is no reason not to try. I am not trying \nto mislead the colleagues. I am willing to consider every spending cut \noffered by my colleagues. But my colleagues must realize that every \ndollar in savings we fail to achieve through spending reductions, we \nmust make up through taxes.\n  With a 5-percent VAT, we can get the job done. We had eight votes for \nthis particular initiative in the Budget Committee. The distinguished \nSenator on the other side of the aisle from Minnesota, Senator \nBoschwitz, and the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Senator \nDanforth, joined with the Senator from South Carolina and we were \nconscientious about our charge. And none of us wanted to vote for \ntaxes. If you want to run for reelection on this particular platform, \ndo not come to South Carolina. I tried it, and barely survived. I was \nknown as ``High Tax Hollings'' for putting out such proposals.\n  Nowhere did the press say I was trying to cut interest taxes. Nowhere \ndid the press say I was trying to cut spending. You cannot get that \nexplanation on a 20-second sound bite. So they take advantage of the \nprinted Record and they distort what you are trying to do.\n  If we exclude the trust funds, cut spending by $406 billion, and \nenact a 5-percent VAT, we can finally eliminate the deficit by 1999. \nEven then, though, we will still have annual gross interest costs of \n$368 billion--that is more than a billion a day--on interest costs on \nthe debt. So interest taxes are still on automatic pilot. It is not \nuntil the year 2002, when you have dropped from $368 billion to $354 \nbillion, that you have finally have gross interest costs on a downward \npath. But it has to be done.\n  I have one sheet of paper here that outlines the scope of the \nproblem. Here it is. This does not include the billions necessary for \nmiddle-class tax cuts. Both sides have been misguided in pandering to \nthe middle class. Brother, this is no time for middle-class tax cut \n[[Page S1328]] or any other tax cut. The problem is a shortage of \nrevenues. The only way to stop spending on automatic pilot, the only \nway to stop raising interest taxes is to make the spending cuts you can \nand to raise taxes. I have outlined one way of doing it.\n  I am going to introduce this amendment but I want to remind my \ncolleagues what we have created is a matter of record. It is what the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer has come into town to confront.\n  We were here and we went through this charade. We dignified it with a \ncommission. This Senator went through with it with President Richard \nMilhous Nixon. He said get rid of the Government and send it back in \nblock grants.\n  Then came President Reagan and he had appointed a Presidential \nAdvisory Committee on Federalism and the Coordinating Task Force on \nFederalism. This Senator, at the appointment of the distinguished \nPresident, served with other Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we have printed in the Record this list \nof commission members.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Presidential Advisory Committee on Federalism\n\n\n                               Governors\n\n       Gov.

Baker III.\n       Richard S. Williamson.\n       Martin Anderson.\n       Robert Carleson.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We went into the Cabinet room and sat around the table. \nYou could see the beginning of unfunded mandates for the cities, the \ncounties, and the States. They said get rid of the Government, get rid \nof it, send it back to the cities, the counties, the States. But what \nthey did was eliminate the money in October 1986. The first bill that \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Senator Howard Baker, \nintroduced was a revenue sharing bill. I had already introduced mine on \nFebruary 1, 1967. We had both come from State governments and we were \ncomplaining then about unfunded mandates.\n  So this has gone on from 1971 to 1995, some 24 years. I came to \nWashington and identified with the problem. We did get revenue sharing. \nBut then, we unfunded the edicts of the Congress in October 1986, when \nwe did away with revenue sharing.\n  Coming right to the point, I want to refer to the former director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, David Stockman. In the spring of \n1992 he had an article that appeared in a magazine called the New \nPerspective entitled ``America Is Not Overspending.'' That ought to \nthrow everybody into shock.\n  The distinguished Congressman from Georgia along with our friend, \nCongressman Kasich are putting government on trial. But I do not mean \nto tuck tail and run, as Lyndon says. I mean to try the case.\n  Where we can get a line-item veto, where we can get a balanced budget \namendment, where we can get progress on reducing the deficit, they will \nhave my vote. If we do not adulterate the legislation, like the \nunfunded mandates bill. I did not realize many of the changes made in \nS. 1 until the distinguished Senator from West Virginia came here and \nbrought them to my attention.\n  I publicly stated that I favored the legislation to address the \nproblem of unfunded mandates. Such a bill was brought to the floor last \nyear.\n  Unfortunately, in their zeal to demonstrate how they can really run \ngovernment up here, the Republicans have been overreaching. I want to \nhelp them. But I do not want to end up with a problem worse than the \none we started with. If we do not move in at this particular hour in \nhistory, how will we ever get on top of this spending hemorrhage?\n  Let me get back to David Stockman. I quote:\n\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the \n     Nation's fiscal stability. A noisy faction Republicans have \n     willfully denied this giant mistake of fiscal governance and \n     their own culpability in it ever since. Instead, they have \n     incessantly poisoned the political debate with the mindless \n     stream of antitax venom while pretending that economic growth \n     and spending cuts alone could cure the deficit. It ought to \n     be obvious by now that we cannot grow our way out.\n\n  Mr. President, very quietly, let me read that first sentence because \nit is almost heretic. ``The root problem goes back to the July 1981 \nfrenzy of excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the \nNation's fiscal stability.'' That is exactly what we have going on now. \nHistory repeats itself. As Ronald Wilson Reagan says, ``Here we go \nagain.''\n  As Governor of South Carolina, my first order of business was to \nraise some taxes, balance the budget, and get for the first time in our \nhistory a triple-A credit rating. Moody's has raised us back to us a \ntriple-A credit rating. We had lost it for the past couple of years. \nStandard and Poor's still has yet to do so. But the need to get that \ntriple-A credit rating reveals a funny juxtaposition of politicians \nrunning for office. I cannot run for Governor of South Carolina unless \nI promise to pay the bill; I cannot run for Senator of South Carolina \nunless I promise not to pay the bill.\n   As a House Member of the South Carolina House of Representatives in \n1950 I was trying to catch up with North Carolina. They had passed \ntheir sales tax for education in 1936. Following suit, I authored the \nsales tax. I heard arguments about its regressivity. But if we had not \npassed that 3-percent sales tax--which now is at 5 percent--we would \nnever have had the schools. In addition to balancing the State budget, \nwe would never have had the educational system to attract investment, \nto attract blue chip corporations, to attract Japanese and German \nindustries.\n  I was here in Washington the last time we had a balanced Federal \nbudget. We called back over to Marvin Watson and said, ``Ask the \nPresident if we can cut another $5 billion.'' The entire budget--\nMedicare, defense, domestic discretionary, everything else, interest on \nthe national debt--was $178 billion. \n[[Page S1329]] Watson called back and said, ``President Johnson said \ncut it another $5 billion.'' We cut it and gave President Richard \nMilhous Nixon a balanced budget.\n  I am hearing all this stuff about a revolution 40 years in the \nmaking. They are getting away with a lot of flourish and rhetoric and \nheadlines. But I have listened now since the beginning of the session, \nand somehow, some way we have to develop some bipartisanship. We are \nnever going to do that unless we can get some truth in budgeting.\n  If they do not want to raise taxes and want to balance the budget \nonly through spending cuts, then they are whistling Dixie. You have to \ndo both. You have to freeze everything to begin with, obey the caps, \nand then follow with additional spending cuts. And even with the \nspending cuts and the 5-percent VAT, you do not really get into the \nblack until 1999.\n  Mr. President it is a very, very difficult thing that the contract \nhas taken up. That is why this Senator is not trying to out-headline \nthe Republicans on the other side of the aisle. I prefer headway to \nheadlines. I will continue to work with my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle. I worked last year with Republicans on the \ntelecommunications superhighway. We have had hearings galore on the \nsubject and we had a bipartisan bill 18 to 2 out of the committee.\n  The overwhelming majority of Republicans, with an overwhelming \nmajority of Democrats, in a bipartisan information superhighway bill \nthat had been worked out with various groups who all wanted these \nservices to be extended to the poor and to the public education \nsystems. That was ready to be passed. But the distinguished majority \nleader--and it is of record--the Senator from Kansas held it up. I do \nnot say that lightly. I can show it to you in the Record. We were ready \nto go bipartisan then, and I am ready to go bipartisan now. Let us not \ncome with just the headline and no headway. As Tennessee Ernie Ford \nsang, ``Sixteen tons and what do you get, another day older and deeper \nin debt.''\n  Mr. President in closing I ask unanimous consent that a table \nentitled ``Senator Hollings on Truth in Budgeting'' which I have been \nreferring to throughout my speech be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 Senator Hollings on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: Not enough savings in entitlements. Yes, \n     welfare reform but job program will cost; savings \n     questionable. Yes, health reform can and should save some, \n     but slowing 10 percent growth to 5 percent--not enough \n     savings. No, none on Social Security; off-budget again.\n       Reality No. 3: Hold the line budget on Defense--no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes, cuts in \n     domestic discretionary--not enough to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     1996     1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 1995 (using trust funds)........      207      224      225      253      284      297      322\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998..........        0        0        0      -19      -38      -58      -78\nSpending cuts....................................      -37      -74     -111     -128     -146     -163     -180\nInterest savings.................................       -1       -5      -11      -20      -32      -46      -64\nTotal savings ($1.2 trillion)....................      -38      -79     -122     -167     -216     -267     -322\nRemaining deficit using trust funds..............      169      145      103       86       68       30        0\nRemaining deficit excluding trust funds..........      287      264      222      202      185      149      121\n5 percent VAT....................................       96      155      172      184      190      196      200\nNet deficit excluding trust funds................      187       97       27     (17)     (54)    (111)    (159)\nGross debt.......................................    5,142    5,257    5,300    5,305    5,272    5,200    5,091\nAverage interest rate on the debt (percent)......      7.0      7.1      6.9      6.8      6.7      6.7      6.7\nInterest cost on the debt........................      367      370      368      368      366      360      354\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Doesn't include billions necessary for middle-class tax cut.                                             \n\n                           Amendment No. 182\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CONGRESSIONAL \n                   ENFORCEMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate--\n       (A) that the Congress should move to eliminate the biggest \n     unfunded mandate--interest on the national debt, which drives \n     the increasing federal burden on state and local governments, \n     and\n       (B) that prior to adopting in the first session of the \n     104th Congress a joint resolution proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution requiring a balanced budget--\n       (1) the Congress set forth specific outlay and revenue \n     changes to achieve a balanced federal budget by the year \n     2002; and\n       (2) enforce through the Congressional budget process the \n     requirement to achieve a balanced federal budget in the year \n     2002.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, they always say, ``He who seeks equity \nmust do equity.'' If we are asking the other side to lay it out, then I \nthink it is our duty over here to lay it out, too. That is what I have \nattempted to do.\n  So, Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague wants to come \nback and be recognized. So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I want to commend my colleague \nfrom South Carolina for this amendment. I know there will be those who \nwill argue that this amendment is an inappropriate amendment on this \nparticular bill because we are dealing with unfunded mandates. But I \nsuggest, Mr. President, that the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina is consistent fully with the matter before \nus--unfunded mandates. In the likely event that we adopt a \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, particularly one \nthat includes a requirement that three-fifths of the Congress approve \nnew tax increases, we will be imposing a huge mandate on States and \nlocalities. It may not be a de jure mandate, but it will be a de facto \nmandate.\n  What Senator Hollings is suggesting with this amendment is a radical \nnotion, I suppose, in the minds of some. It is an outrageous idea that \nwe should have some idea of how this constitutional mandate requiring a \nbalanced budget in 7 years is going to be achieved. I know there are \nthose who think it is unfair to be asking such questions, but they are \nquestions we are asked as Members of the U.S. Senate by our \nconstituents all the time.\n  Many of our constituents are telling us, too, that they support a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. We all know the polling \nnumbers on this issue. Eighty percent of the American public supports a \nbalanced budget amendment as long as it remains a slogan or a simple \nstatement of principle. They are all for the concept of the balanced \nbudget. But what happens when people are presented with various \nspending cut options?\n  If you say, ``Do you want a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget?'' They say, ``Absolutely, we want that.'' But if you then say, \n``You understand, of course, that may include some cuts in Social \nSecurity.'' They say, ``Well, now, wait a minute, you did not tell me \nthat.'' You say, ``How about Medicare?'' They say, ``Wait, you are \ngetting a little far afield here. I said I want the budget in balance. \nThat is what I want. I did not say I wanted Social Security or Medicare \ncut.'' You say, ``How about education?'' They say, ``That is not what I \nmeant either. Just balance that budget.'' Then you start talking about \nhow you get there from here, and you start to get what you always get. \nIt is like the old saying that ``Everyone wants to go to Heaven, but no \none wants to die.'' So we all want a balanced budget but we are all \nvery nervous about how you get there.\n   [[Page S1330]] Let me back up a bit, because I listened to my \ncolleague from South Carolina talk about his history on this issue, and \nhe has a distinguished one, going back to the very days the Budget Act \nwas adopted. He is one of only two people who served on the original \ncommittee and chaired the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. President, I am familiar with the Senator's record because I \nworked with him on a number of important budget issues going back to my \nfirst days here in the early 1980's. I was the second Democrat after \nthe Senator from South Carolina to cosponsor the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nlegislation. Really, it was the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings-Dodd bill. I \nthought that the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New Hampshire \nand the Senator from South Carolina had a good idea, to try statutorily \nto get our arms around the budget of the United States. I will not take \na back seat to anybody in our efforts in try to achieve that goal.\n  In 1982, I offered a requirement that any new increase in spending \nmust be paid for fully--a pay-as-you-go budget. I offered this \namendment from the very last chair in the far corner of this floor when \nI was the most junior Member of this body. I got 22 votes. I was in the \nminority in those days, not unlike today. Had we done it then, we are \ntold we could have actually had the Federal budget in balance by 1986 \nor 1987. With all the talk about the need for constitutional \namendments, there are those of us who have been through these battles, \ntrying all sorts of ways to inject discipline into the process.\n  I hope, as we examine the constitutional amendment, we would answer \nour constituents' questions. They want to know how we are going to do \nthis. That's what this amendment requires. It simply says if you're \ngoing to talk the talk of balanced budget, you've got to walk the walk \nof how you get there. I hope it will be adopted so that we will be able \nto lay out to the taxpayers in our communities exactly how we are going \nto keep the promises that a balanced budget amendment would require.\n  The GOP spending cut plan is like Forrest Gump's box of chocolates--\nyou don't know what you're going to get when you dip your hand in.\n  All the Senator from South Carolina is suggesting is that we have a \ndescription of the chocolates before we put them in our mouths. \nOtherwise, we're talking about a huge potential stomach ache.\n  That is all this amendment asks. It does not say, ``Do not cut in \nthese areas.'' It just says, ``Tell us. If this is what you are going \nto do, at least somebody outline it.''\n  I might point out, there are some significant proposals outlining how \nwe might do some of this. I would like to lay one of these out, if I \nmay.\n  Mr. President, this is a chart based on the Republican budget staff \nproposal reported in the Washington Times earlier this month. This is \nthe so-called Republican path to a balanced budget amendment in the \nyear 2002.\n  The deficit estimates are lower then CBO and Treasury projections, \nbut they are still useful.\n  As you can see, the proposal estimates that it will cost more than $1 \ntrillion to balance the budget over 7 years. The GOP tax cut proposal, \naccording to the Republican staff analysis will cost $346 billion more.\n  The Treasury Department estimates that the tax increases will be \nsomewhat higher. I am not going to use these numbers, though, Mr. \nPresident. I will use only the staff numbers from the majority side of \nthe Budget Committee so that no one can accuse me of using biased \nnumbers prepared by a Democratic administration.\n  The GOP proposal also says that we are not going to reduce Social \nSecurity. That has been said over and over and over again by the \nmajority. In fact, we are told that Social Security will go up $12 \nbillion in the next 7 years.\n  We have been also told that there will be an increase in defense \nspending of $82 billion.\n  So if you take all of these numbers together--again, not numbers from \nthe Democratic Policy Committee, or the Department of the Treasury, or \neven the Congressional Budget Office, but from the Republican Budget \nCommittee staff--then the price tag for all of these promises is $1.53 \ntrillion. This is the total cost that will have to be made up by the \nyear 2002 if we are going to achieve a balanced budget in that year.\n  How will we pay for all of these promises? Where will they be made \nup? If we increase defense and Social Security spending, cut taxes, and \nbalance the budget, what will we cut?\n  This second chart shows where the cuts to pay for these promises will \ncome from. According to the Republican staff numbers, more than $970 \nbillion will come from Medicare cuts, Medicaid cuts, and other \nmandatory spending. And $386 billion will come from nondefense \ndiscretionary spending.\n  If we make these cuts, then we should get a debt service reduction of \n$164 billion. So that number in green here, is the number which would \ndepend upon these other two numbers being achieved. And that would get \nyou to $1.53 trillion, equaling the amount I mentioned earlier. That is \nhow we reach balance.\n  All this amendment says is, ``Would you mind giving us some idea so \nwe can go back to our taxpayers and constituents and tell them \nspecifically how we are going to achieve more than $1.5 trillion in \nspending cuts? Where will the cuts come from? Don't go around asking us \nto support a conclusion without giving us some idea of how we are going \nto achieve those results.''\n  Earlier the Senator from South Carolina introduced into the Record, \nMr. President, a list that was put together by our distinguished \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg outlining options for \nspending cuts. They include reducing student loan subsidies, means \ntesting Medicare, cutting in half funding for Head Start--maybe one of \nthe finest programs for children and early education ever devised--the \nmaternal child health block grants, and preventive health services \nblock grants, deferring military COLA's, cutting veterans benefits, and \neliminating Medicaid transition benefits for AFDC recipients. The list \nis 50 pages long.\n  I am not suggesting that these items should not be touched at all, \nbut it seems to me you are beginning to get some sort of a blueprint \nhere of what is involved.\n  As the Senator from South Carolina pointed out, when you start \ncounting whether or not you have 51 votes here for cutting out student \nloans--at the very time when working families are trying to make it \nmore feasible for their kids to afford higher education--you are going \nto realize you cannot pass these cuts.\n  Nor do you have the votes for cutting Head Start. I was responsible \nfor the reauthorization of the Head Start Program last year. There was \nnot a dissenting vote or voice out of 100 U.S. Senators on the \nreauthorization of Head Start--not one. It was passed unanimously by \nvoice vote. And yet now some are talking about cutting that program in \nhalf.\n  I do not know many Senators here who honestly believe you ought to be \ncutting Head Start in half. And if there are some, there may be 3 or 4 \nor 5 or 10. I do not think there are 51 here who studied the program \nand believe it should be cut. Head Start has not been a Democratic \nprogram, or a Republican program--it has always enjoyed broad, \nbipartisan support.\n  The distinguished Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] worked \ntirelessly to put together a good Head Start Program last year. Without \nher support, we would not have gotten it done. I am not going to speak \nfor her here. But again, there was not some great battle out here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate to reauthorize and fund Head Start.\n  Does anyone really believe there are 51 votes to cut veterans \nbenefits? Are we going to defer military COLA's--at a time when we are \ntrying to strengthen the military budget, and attract and retain the \nmost talented people we can find. Are there 51 votes? I do not think \nso.\n  It seems to me, before you start jamming this into the Constitution \nwe ought to think through all of these important issues. If a balanced \nbudget amendment is adopted and we are unable to balance the budget, \nthen we will turn the Supreme Court of the United States into a Budget \nCommittee deciding every major budget \n[[Page S1331]] choice. The Supreme Court will be deciding whether or \nnot the legislative branch achieved the constitutional requirement of a \nbalanced budget, and then they will decide how to allocate funding \nlevels.\n  I remember a few years ago people railing, and I think rightfully so, \nagainst an unelected, lifetime appointee sitting on a bench \nlegislating--legislating. I do not know how many speeches I heard in \nthis body objecting to the nine members of the Supreme Court \nlegislating.\n  That is the business of this body, to legislate. And yet, in effect, \nwe will be asking the Supreme Court of the United States to legislate \non the budget when we do not achieve, if we do not achieve, the balance \nwhich is required by an amendment in the year 2002.\n  So I again suggest and emphasize here what the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina is proposing makes some sense. We are likely to \ncreate a train wreck, an absolute train wreck.\n An absolute train wreck. Now, we have done that in the past. But the \nproblem in the past was not as significant because it was a statutory \ntrain wreck. It did not go to the organic law of the United States. \nWhat is being talked about here is changing the organic law of the \nUnited States. Of course we know when we do that we run the risk of \nhaving a far more difficult time adjusting if we are wrong.\n\n  In the 1980's, we did things by statute. We had the Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings proposal, and a number of freezes and the like. We found out \nthey did not quite work as expected. When tested, the theories did not \nadd up. We went back and changed the statutes and began to get on our \nfeet.\n  The people who paid the greatest price, of course, for our mistakes \nwere middle-income workers. They always do. And, they will be \nundoubtedly called upon to do so again when the next train wreck \noccurs. We always go back to the people that fight the wars and raise \ntheir taxes. They are the ones who will pay the bill if this does not \nwork.\n  The difference here is organic law. When we change organic law and \nthen discover a mistake, it is very difficult to correct. I think we \nshould proceed cautiously and carefully and ask the types of questions \nthat our constituents are asking of us.\n  Where will the cuts be made? How will you do this? Are you really \ngoing to go after Medicare? We saw what happened on the surveys \nconducted on the balanced budget amendment, 80 percent or so are for \nit. But when we talk about cutting student loans, education, Medicare, \nSocial Security, et cetera, the support for that amendment drops \ndramatically. I am not suggesting these programs should never be \nreduced. I would not want to suggest that we should never make changes \nin any of these programs. I would not subscribe to that view.\n  I have been here long enough to know what happens when we try to make \ndifficult budget choices. As I mentioned a while ago, I offered a pay-\nas-you-go proposal. I did not pick out a particular program. I said how \nabout paying for everything? We had 22 votes for paying for things. Now \nwhen we start requesting details, people start trying to take things \nentirely off the table. Forget Social Security some will say. That is \noff entirely. Others will say take defense spending off the list of any \npotential cuts. Although there is an argument being raised by some that \nwe can do with a lot less, I, for one, would raise some reservations \nabout that. The world is changed, more complicated, requires different \nthinking in this area.\n  I do not know of anyone who really believes, at least not a majority, \nthat we ought to take a meat ax to the defense budget. We have heard \nover and over again from the military leadership that it is difficult \nto retain good people. We do not have a draft any longer. We have to \nrecruit, and we need the best educated, sophisticated people in the \nmilitary that this country has to produce. And it does not make sense \nto be talking about slashing COLA's for people in the military.\n  Let me again point out if I can, Mr. President, what these cuts may \nmean. A recent study by the children's defense fund reports that the \ncosts of balancing the budget alone--while protecting Social Security \nand defense spending--would result in: 7.6 million children losing \nfederally subsidized school lunches--I do not think there are 51 votes \nhere to do that; 6.6 million children losing health care coverage \nthrough Medicaid; dropping more than 5 million child support cases that \nhold absent parents accountable for supporting their children; 4.3 \nmillion children losing food stamps; and 2 million young children and \npregnant women losing nutritional assistance through the WIC Program--\none of the strongest supported programs in Congress. The Women, \nInfants, and Children Program historically has had strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  This analysis does not consider the costs of financing the Contract \nWith America tax breaks at all--more than 30 percent of which would \nbenefit households with incomes of greater than $200,000.\n  So, Mr. President, I suggest we look through the eyes of a child at \nwhat this means. We should face the realities here. I do not know of \nanyone in the body who honestly believes that children ought to be \nasked to pay the price. We ought to be seeing to it that they will not \nbe disadvantaged. We are not talking about luxury items here. We are \ntalking about basic essentials that they need. So, again, I emphasize \nthat a good hard analysis of what all of this means, I think, is \ncritically important for all of us.\n  There is an old advertisement on television that may say it best. \nThat advertisement for a Wall Street firm says, ``We make money the \nold-fashioned way.'' Well, maybe we ought to reduce the deficit the \nold-fashioned way. That is, we ought to roll up our sleeves and go to \nwork on it.\n  I heard a lot of talk here over the last number of weeks about \nreducing the deficit. This administration over the past 2\\1/2\\ years \nhas achieved through the budget process real reduction in the deficit. \nThat is not my conclusion. That is the conclusion of the Congressional \nBudget Office and others who have no particular ax to grind. They have \nconcluded that we have achieved 3 consecutive years of deficit \nreduction, the first time since the Truman administration, to the tune \nof $700 billion in deficit relief. That is pretty significant.\n  We must continue on this path. We must look at current programs, and \nask these questions. How can we do a better job? Where can we cut back? \nWe must roll up our sleeves and do the job.\n  The one thing people are tired of and they expressed it strongly on \nNovember 8 is gimmickry. The blue smoke and mirrors, three-card monte, \nnow-you-see-it, now-you-do-not, kind of approach. Dynamic scoring. \nThreatening to do away with the Bureau of Labor Statistics if they do \nnot come up with the right numbers on inflation. That is not the way we \nachieve a balanced budget. We must not cook the books and make up the \nnumbers. People want Members to be honest and do the real work.\n  I would just warn those who are strong advocates for the \nconstitutional approaches, we have gone through more than 200 years of \nhistory. We have amended the Constitution, Mr. President, 27 times. I \nsee the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and I will watch him \ncarefully because if I am wrong on my numbers he will correct me with a \nnod; 27 amendments in 200 years, and I believe roughly 11,000 proposals \nto amend the Constitution of the United States in that same 206-year-\nperiod. Some 11,000 ideas. And never once have we decided to inject \ninto the Constitution economic theories that may be terribly wrong.\n  We have been through a great Civil War. We have been through two \nworld wars, and a Great Depression in this century. For a period of 15 \nyears we have had growing deficit difficulties. The last President to \nsubmit a balanced budget was Jimmy Carter. That was the last submission \nby a President of a balanced budget. In 1969, Lyndon Johnson submitted \nthe last budget with a surplus.\n  In 1981, the deficit was around $35 billion with a national debt of \nunder $1 trillion. After 200 years, we had a national debt of less than \n$1 trillion. In the last 15 years, 12 years of the administrations of \nPresident Reagan and President Bush, we have quadrupled the national \ndebt, and brought us to annual deficits hovering around $200, sometimes \n$300 billion a year.\n   [[Page S1332]] We all want to do what we can to balance the budget. \nBut I would strongly urge, Mr. President, that we ought not to take 15 \nyears of troublesome deficit spending and deny 205 years of \nconstitutional history in the process. We should go through the \nstatutory process, come up with whatever ideas we can. But, Mr. \nPresident, in my view, we will deeply regret monkeying around with the \nConstitution of the United States in trying to solve an economic \nproblem that has been created over the last 15 years that is not \ninsolvable. It is solvable.\n  By writing this into the Constitution and inviting the courts to \nbecome involved in deciding these matters we will only complicate the \nproblem, not make it easier. We are told all the time, some 42 States \nrequire a balanced budget in their State constitutions. Mr. President I \nwould suggest to Senators that without exception those States have come \nup with all sorts of ideas to avoid that responsibility.\n  Everyone knows about bonding. We bond things or create a capital \nbudget on the side so we do not have to meet that obligation. Every \nimaginable gimmick is used to avoid making the difficult decisions. I \ncan well imagine that future Congress' will employ some new dynamic \nscoring technique,\n or some new threat to the Bureau of Labor Statistics that, if they do \nnot come up with an inflation number they like, they will cut off your \nbudget. That is not healthy. That is not the way to be proceeding, not \nthe way to be proceeding at all. It poses serious, serious problems.\n\n  So, again, I strongly urge that we endorse unanimously the proposal \nof the Senator from South Carolina. I think it sends a positive message \nto people that we are concerned about what happens. I will tell you \nright now that it is not at all reassuring to hear the majority leader \nof the House of Representatives say that we cannot tell people out \nthere how we plan to balance the budget because their ``knees will \nbuckle.'' That is not a reassuring quote. I am sure my constituents are \ngoing to love to hear that one. We cannot tell you because your knees \nmay buckle. Well, I do not mind a politician's knees buckling, but I do \nnot think my constituents who depend upon Medicare should have to have \ntheir knees buckle or some child out there that needs a school lunch or \nHead Start Program should have to have their knees buckle in the \nprocess. Do they not have a right to hear from their elected \nrepresentatives in advance what we intend to do to them?\n  Is it a radical notion that somehow our constituents ought to get at \nleast some blueprint of how this is going to work and who is going to \nbe asked to pay? Is it outrageous of them--are they being insolent for \ndemanding of their elected representatives that we give them some idea \nof how this is going to be achieved? Should we not tell them because \nthey might not like what they hear? That is what we are saying, in \neffect, we should not tell them because they might not like what they \nare going to hear.\n  This is not a base closure commission we are talking about; we are \ntalking about making major changes to basic programs that people need \nto survive.\n  Again, if the pain is going to be shared, let us do it in an \nequitable fashion. But when you take off Social Security and take out \ndefense and you talk about huge tax cuts--30 percent of which go to \npeople making in excess of $200,000--are you being fair? I am not \nopposed to giving people in the upper incomes a tax break. I do not \nlike this class-warfare language. But in the distribution of pain, you \nhave to ask if 30 percent of the tax cuts should come from the people \nin that income bracket. I do not think so if it is going to be fair and \nequitable.\n  The Senator from South Carolina, I think, has proposed a reasonable \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support this effort to inform the \nAmerican public of the important budget decisions this body intends to \nmake in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, we are going to have wonderful opportunities, I \npresume, in the next few weeks, when the constitutional amendment on \nthe balanced budget comes to the floor, to engage in some significant \ndebate about that alone. But before we get there, I think we should lay \nout the details of how we plan to pay for our trillion dollar plus \npromises.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Hollings amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I know that we do have those Senators \nwho wish to address this issue. I know that the chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee also would like to address this particular amendment \nthat we have before us. I have discussed the following unanimous-\nconsent request that I will be making with the sponsor of the \namendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield? Can we make it 40 \nminutes? Instead of 30 minutes to a side, 40 minutes to a side?\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. All right.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 80 minutes for \ndebate prior to a motion to table the pending amendment, to be equally \ndivided in the usual form; that no amendments be in order prior to the \nmotion to table the pending amendment; that following the conclusion or \nyielding back of time, the majority manager, or his designee, be \nrecognized to make a motion to table the pending amendment; and that \nthe vote on the motion to table the pending amendment occur after 4 \np.m. tomorrow.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Also the yeas and nays. I am sure the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho, if it is agreed to--and I am perfectly willing to \nagree to it as he stated it--will also ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. That would be my intent.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, and I do not think that \nI will, Mr. President, I have an amendment that is similar. It is very \nmuch within the same framework, though without reference to date. I do \nnot think it would take me more than 10 or 15 minutes to offer this. I \nwonder whether I could, as a part of this unanimous-consent agreement, \nhave the opportunity to offer this amendment after this debate since it \nis exactly within the same framework. I would not take a great deal of \ntime with it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I will object because I think there are some Senators \nwho are probably not here this afternoon who may want to discuss this \namendment.\n  Also I note that no other amendments would be in order prior to the \nmotion to table this amendment. I thought we would have a time in which \nwe could offer amendments, possibly get some action on some of them and \nwith the understanding and the request being, which was ordered, that \nsuch amendments would have to be offered----\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. By no later than 3 o'clock----\n  Mr. GLENN. Offered by 3 o'clock tomorrow, no votes until after 4 \no'clock tomorrow.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. This specific unanimous-consent agreement is that \nthere are to be no other amendments offered to this pending amendment \nof Senator Hollings.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object. Knowing that we have to \nhave our amendments offered before 3 \n[[Page S1333]] o'clock tomorrow, would it be possible that there could \nbe a short window to allow those of us who only wish to offer \namendments in order to meet that 3 o'clock deadline to do so and thus \nbe assured that we will not end up inadvertently being precluded from \noffering our amendment?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I think that would be very appropriate. Also, I will \nnote that we have had other amendments sent to the desk this morning \nwhich we have laid aside. In the event, for example, some of those \nSenators who wish to speak on the pending amendment are not here, I \nthink it would be very much in order to lay it aside so we can continue \nto facilitate the Senators who wish to lay their amendments down.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I first would like to thank the Senator from West \nVirginia. I am really intending to make the same request. I think the \nSenator from Washington has the same interest. I would like the \nopportunity, now that I think I have clarification on this unanimous-\nconsent agreement, to at least be able to offer the amendment and have \nit laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's original \nrequest?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I object. I would like Senators to have an \nopportunity to further study this amendment. There may be some of us \nwho wish to speak on this amendment. Not many Senators were going to be \naround this afternoon because there was an understanding we would have \nno votes today. This does not keep the Senator from renewing the \nrequest on tomorrow or making the motion any time he wishes after the \nhour of 4 o'clock.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                  Amendment Nos. 183 and 184, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, let me just comment that of the two \namendments I sent to the desk, one of them assures that we would not be \ncreating a big, new, powerful bureaucracy at the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and the other one relates to the effect of this bill on nuclear \nwaste cleanup efforts. I am especially concerned about some at the \nHanford site in my own State. I will be speaking on these amendments \nlater, but I did want to submit them today under the previous unanimous \nconsent.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, has the Pastore rule run its course for the \nday?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, can I introduce a measure without the \nPastore rule applying?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator repeat his inquiry?\n  Mr. PELL. Does the Pastore rule still apply or can I talk on another \nsubject?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Pastore rule has expired.\n                     amendment no. 180, as modified\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I would like to commend and thank the able \nSenator from North Dakota on modifying his metric conversion amendment. \nWhile I opposed the provisions of the amendment that would have imposed \na 2-year moratorium, I am comfortable with asking the Commission on \nUnfunded Mandates, which would be created under this legislation, to \nlook into the impact on States and localities of using the metric \nsystem.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been a longtime proponent of \nconversion to the metric system. I believe we can't afford not to \nconvert to the metric system. Not converting has already cost this \nNation a great deal.\n  The United States is one of three nations in the world, along with \nBurma and Liberia, yet to change to metrics. More importantly, the \nUnited States is the only industrialized nation in the world that is \nnot a metric country. With a growing global economy, thanks in part to \nNAFTA and GATT, how can we as a nation expect to sell our products to \nthe rest of the world when those products literally don't measure up \nwith the rest of the world?\n  The United States stands to gain untold millions of dollars in \nexports that we are currently losing, because our nonmetric goods are \nalmost excluded from international markets. In fact, the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce estimates that U.S. exports could increase by as \nmuch as 20 percent by offering metric-sized goods.\n  Three instances of international trade problems caused by the \nproduction of non-metric goods highlight the difficulties caused by our \nnation's reluctance to go metric.\n  Saudi Arabia rejected a shipment of General Electric appliances \nbecause the power cords were 6 feet long rather than 2 meters as \nrequired by Saudi law.\n  A middle-eastern company was forced to rewire all the electronic \nequipment it imported from the United States because standard American \nwire sizes are different from international standards.\n  Countries around the world have great difficulty locating American \nlumber mills willing to produce cut lumber in metric sizes.\n  Mr. President, I agree that the Federal Government should not require \nStates to do that which it is unwilling to do. In that regard, I have \nand will continue to work to see that all portions of the Federal \nGovernment comply with laws already on the books and that it leads the \nway in converting to the metric system.\n  I am confident that the more we study the value of the metric system, \nthe more we will find that not joining the rest of the world will only \ncost us more in the long run.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 182\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to take just a very few minutes to \naddress the Hollings amendment. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. \nIt talks about the importance of interest on the national debt as far \nas being an unfunded mandate. But in part B, it says that prior to \nadopting, in the first session of the 104th Congress, a joint \nresolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution requiring a \nbalanced budget, a sense-of-the-Senate, then \n[[Page S1335]] one, that the Congress set forth specific outlay in \nrevenue changes to achieve the balanced Federal budget by the year \n2002; two, enforce the congressional budget process, the requirement to \nachieve a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  Let me address that briefly. I thought originally maybe that this did \nnot have any place being addressed on the unfunded mandates \nlegislation. This just says that we want to know in advance what the \nimpact is going to be. In other words, it is truth in legislating, as \nbest we can tell that truth, in advance.\n  I submit that is what this unfunded mandate legislation is all about. \nWe are trying to determine what the impact is in advance, and tell \nStates and local communities just exactly what Federal mandates are \ngoing to do to them in advance. And we require the Congressional Budget \nOffice to actually spell out the dollar impacts on them in advance.\n  That is what Senator Hollings is proposing with this legislation. Why \nshould we not do this? Why should we not, to the best of our ability, \nsay how a balanced budget amendment, if it goes into effect, will be \ndealt with? That is exactly what we are trying to do with this unfunded \nmandates legislation as it deals with the States and local communities.\n  Apropos to this, I think when we come to consideration of a balanced \nbudget amendment, I read some figures over the weekend, I believe in \none of the columns, that if we take the things that everyone seems to \nsay are off limits in the House and here also--Social Security, \nMedicare, interest on the national debt, and defense, those four \nitems--I do not know whether those can all be taken out and made exempt \nfrom any consideration when we get into budget cutting or not. If we \ncannot, if some of those come in, I say to the Social Security \nrecipients that some of your benefits are in danger. The same thing is \ntrue with Medicare. We know we have to pay interest on the national \ndebt. We do not want to cut defense. We feel it has been cut enough \nalready.\n  So if you leave Social Security, Medicare, interest on the national \ndebt, and national defense off budget, or off limits, what does that \nleave? As was pointed out in the column I read over the weekend, that \nthen would require approximately a little over a 30-percent cut in all \nthe other functions of Government; a 30-percent cut in all the other \nfunctions of Government. If you take Social Security, Medicare, \ninterest on the national debt, and national defense off budget, it \nwould be a 30-percent cut in every other program.\n  If we applied that across the board, this means that next time you \nclimb on an airliner after this, maybe, you will know that 30 percent \nof FAA funds; 30 percent of National Transportation Safety Board funds; \n30 percent of CDC, the Centers for Disease Control funds, trying to \ndeal with the AIDS problem, an enormous problem; 30 percent of NIH \nfunds, the National Institutes of Health dealing with cancer problems; \nFDA, trying to see what drugs are safe, are cut. You may say: We will \nnot deal with any of those; we would leave those fully funded. What \nelse gets cut? What else gets cut in that situation?\n  How about immigration? Do we want additional restrictions on \nimmigration? Do we want to provide the people to firm up the borders? \nWould that get its 30-percent cut? How about farm subsidies? There is \nan attractive one.\n We are going to cut these 30 percent or more to make up for keeping \nsomething else from this 30-percent cut. Then there are prisons, and we \ncould go on and on. We are dealing in this unfunded mandate legislation \nmainly with the impact on the States and local communities.\n\n  What do the States get right now? States, right now, under \ndiscretionary and entitlement funding, receive about $230 billion a \nyear, about 70 of that in discretionary funding and about 160 in \nentitlements. This is broken down into Medicaid, for instance, and $173 \nbillion goes into Federal and State, total, for Medicaid; 57 percent of \nthat is Federal, and 43 percent is State; that is $230 billion total.\n  I use that figure for this reason. If we pass something that says \nthat we are not going to say what we are going to cut, we are just \ngoing to do that after we, in effect, threaten ourselves and say, OK, \nwe are going to force ourselves to buy a balanced budget amendment to \nmake these decisions but we are not going to say in advance where the \ndecisions are made, then I submit that the States with what they \nreceive now, what is given to them now for all these various programs, \nthat $230 billion is going to be a very, very attractive target for \nbudget cutters looking for some way to balance the budget without \ngetting into cuts on Social Security, Medicare, interest on the \nnational debt, or defense.\n  What Senator Hollings has proposed is a how-to piece of legislation--\nknowing what we are going to do, giving us an idea of what we are going \nto do in advance to get to a balanced budget. All of us want to get to \na balanced budget. Certainly, I do. I do not think there is anybody \nhere who does not want to get to a balanced budget. What Senator \nHollings says is let everybody, the States included, know in advance \nwhether they will be the ones who will be unfairly dealt with in this \nother area if we pass a balanced budget amendment. Will the efforts to \nbalance the budget then come out of the State's hide of $230 billion \nthat we send from the Federal Treasury to the States every year?\n  Surely we would not take the other tack and say on Senator Hollings' \namendment that we would adopt in the first session a joint resolution \nproposing an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget, \none, the Congress should not set forth specific outlay and revenue \nchanges. Surely we would never add that should not and prohibit anyone \nfrom saying exactly how this is going to affect anyone by prohibiting \nthe listing of what the outlay and revenue effects would be. So all he \nsaid is that in the Constitution requiring a balanced budget, the \nCongress set forth specific outlay and revenue changes to achieve a \nbalanced Federal budget by 2002. It seems to me that we are just trying \nto predict and make forecastable what is happening between the Federal \nGovernment and the States with this unfunded mandate legislation.\n  All Senator Hollings is asking in his proposed amendment, it seems to \nme, is that we do the same advanced kind of planning in trying to get \nwhere the cuts or where the revenues would come from, what the impact \nwould be, the amounts, and trying to determine these things in advance.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Hollings' amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier I had offered two of the three \namendments which I have reserved for the purposes of having them before \nthe Senate prior to the 3 p.m. deadline tomorrow.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside for the singular purpose of allowing me to offer the third \namendment for consideration at a later date.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 190\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the exclusion of \n  Social Security from calculations required under a balanced budget \n                     amendment to the Constitution)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, while I know we are not considering it \ntoday, there is much discussion going on around this town and the \ncountry about our upcoming consideration of the balanced budget \namendment. I do not want to delay action on the bill before us, but I \nbelieve it is critical that we ease the fears of millions of older \nAmericans who are worried about their security.\n  I have long supported a balanced budget amendment, and I expect to do \nso again this year. There have been a number of issues raised \nconcerning the amendment--should there be a supermajority requirement \nfor tax increases; should there be truth in budgeting to require that \nthe cuts necessary to reach a balanced budget by 2002 be specified; \nshould we make provision for times of recession when there are more \ndemands on the Federal Government and tax receipts are down? Each of \nthese questions is very important and should be given the attention \nthey deserve. But, Mr. President, the one issue that is of greatest \nconcern, and the one I think necessary to address immediately by this \nbody, is whether Social Security should be allowed to be cut as part of \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  Should Social Security funds be included along with all the receipts \nand debits in calculating whether we have a balanced budget? I believe \nwe need to set the record straight about where the Senate stands on \nthis critical point. I hope the Senate could go on record unanimously \non this so that we can allay the fears that literally millions of older \nAmericans have.\n  I have received hundreds of calls, and even more letters, from older \nIowans who are scared to death that their Social Security is going to \nbe cut to balance the budget. Almost all of them subsist on little or \nnothing more than their monthly Social Security check. They live on \nfixed incomes and are struggling to meet the basics--pay their food, \nutilities, and medical bills. A cut in Social Security would literally \nmean for many not enough to eat or enough to pay heating, phone, \nmedical bills, and transportation.\n  To bring this home, I would like to read excerpts from letters a few \nIowans have written me. I have a letter here dated January 2, from Lime \nSprings, IA:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Will you please vote against any more \n     cuts in Medicare and Social Security. I am an 87-year-old \n     widow with Social Security of $440 a month, and I am trying \n     to stay off welfare. It is almost impossible for old people \n     who depend on Social Security to live anymore. Please help \n     us.\n\n  Another letter is dated January 4.\n\n       * * * I am a widow, age 78. I have been alone for 29 years \n     and never able to accumulate an estate, bonds, CDs, et \n     cetera. My income is $650 a month Social Security, and out of \n     that I must pay rent, electric, food, health insurance, \n     medical bills, doctors, prescriptions, et cetera, and I am \n     just barely able to cover the above expenses. There is no \n     money left over for clothes, recreation, et cetera, and I \n     would appreciate it if you would reject any cuts in Social \n     Security and Medicare.\n\n  Another letter is dated January 5 from Jefferson, IA. It says:\n\n       * * * We are semi-retired farmers facing higher property \n     tax, higher crop expenses and lower prices. If we don't have \n     money, we go without. Because my health has forced my \n     retirement at 62 years of age, I am now receiving a ``very \n     generous'' $334 a month Social Security. Now subtract $46.10 \n     for Medicare, $56 Blue Cross supplemental, and then try to \n     spread it thin enough to pay for heart, diabetes and \n     arthritis medication at $3,000 per year.\n       We have worked hard, still paying on some farmland, knowing \n     that if either of us need to enter a nursing home, it will be \n     gone. Social Security is not welfare.\n\n  Well, I have a lot of letters like this and I am sure, Mr. President, \nyou and other Senators are receiving letters like this from your \nconstituents.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am about to send to the desk I believe \nis eminently reasonable and should be quickly passed by this body. It \nis relatively short and straightforward.\n  I will not read the whole thing.\n  It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is supported by findings \nthat over 42 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, \nincluding 3 million children, and 5 million disabled workers; that \nSocial Security is only the pension program for 60 percent of older \nAmericans. Almost 60 percent of the \n[[Page S1337]] older beneficiaries depend on Social Security for at \nleast 50 percent of their income; 25 percent of recipients depend on it \nfor 90 percent of their income. Without it, 15 million Americans will \nbe thrown into poverty.\n  Basically, it is just a sense of the Senate that any joint resolution \nproviding for a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution \npassed by the Senate shall specifically exclude Social Security from \nthe calculations used to determine if the Federal budget is in balance.\n  Mr. President, when you talk about the average Social Security \nrecipient, you are talking about people of very modest means. The \naverage monthly Social Security payment now is $679 a month. That is \n$8,148 a year, just above the poverty level for a household of one. As \nI said, for many senior citizens, Social Security represents 90 percent \nor more of their entire income and it is particularly true of older \nwidows. For the majority of older widows, Social Security represents \nthe bulk of what they have to live on. So I understand them writing me \nletters saying they are fearful of these cuts.\n  Mr. President, I should also note that I am not just hearing from the \nelderly. I am also hearing from middle-age workers who are concerned \nabout the surplus in the Social Security trust funds that will be \nnecessary to pay the benefits when they retire. They are worried \nbecause they know it may be just too tempting for politicians to dip \ninto the growing Social Security trust fund surpluses to pay down the \ndeficit. And they have every reason to be worried.\n  Today, the Social Security surplus stands at about one-half trillion \ndollars. That is right. The Social Security trust fund has a surplus of \none-half trillion dollars,--$500 billion. By the year 2010, the Social \nSecurity surplus is projected to reach $2.1 trillion. And by 2020, the \nSocial Security trust fund will grow to an astounding $3 trillion. That \nsurplus, nearly two times the entire Federal budget for this year, will \nbe very tempting to dip into to pay down the deficit.\n  Some will say a little out will not hurt us. But, in fact, Mr. \nPresident, in the coming years, we will need to add to that surplus, \nnot take away from it.\n  The current projections are that even with a $3 trillion surplus in \nthe year 2020, the system will go bankrupt by around the year 2030, \nafter paying benefits to the baby boomers who will be retiring. So \nabout 35 years from now--and we have time within that 35 years to make \nthe necessary adjustment. So we need to make adjustments within the \nnext 35 years to further build up the surpluses after 2020 so that \nthose who are working now can be assured that their Social Security \nwill be there when they retire. So we need to add to the surpluses \nlater on, not take away from them.\n  Mr. President, I am certain that the amendment I am offering will be \nsupported by an overwhelming majority of Americans. Poll after poll has \nindicated opposition to the cuts in Social Security benefits by the \nelderly and by those now working.\n  So, Mr. President, it is a modest amendment. It is a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. I think we ought to express ourselves on this bill. \nEven though it does not have anything to do, I know, with unfunded \nmandates, I think we have to express ourselves as soon as possible, \nespecially now in the middle of winter when so many elderly people are \nconcerned about Social Security cuts. And I think, if I am not \nmistaken, that we will be on the balanced budget amendment right after \nthis bill is disposed of.\n  So, Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 190.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  On page 50, add after line 6 the following new title:\n\n                   TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 501. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING BALANCED BUDGET \n                   AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) social security is a contributory insurance program \n     supported by deductions from workers' earnings and matching \n     contributions from their employers that are deposited into an \n     independent trust fund;\n       (2) over 42,000,000 Americans, including over 3,000,000 \n     children and 5,000,000 disabled workers and their families, \n     receive social security benefits;\n       (3) social security is the only pension program for 60 \n     percent of older Americans;\n       (4) almost 60 percent of older beneficiaries depend on \n     social security for at least half of their income and 25 \n     percent depend on social security for at least 90 percent of \n     their income;\n       (5) without social security an additional 15,000,000 \n     Americans, mostly senior citizens, would be thrown into \n     poverty;\n       (6) 138,000,000 American workers participate in the social \n     security system and are insured in case of retirement, \n     disability, or death;\n       (7) social security is a contract between workers and the \n     Government;\n       (8) social security is a self-financed program that is not \n     contributing to the current Federal budget deficit; in fact, \n     the social security trust funds currently have over \n     $400,000,000,000 in reserves and that surplus will increase \n     during fiscal year 1995 alone by an additional \n     $70,000,000,000;\n       (9) this surplus is necessary to pay monthly benefits for \n     current and future beneficiaries;\n       (10) recognizing that social security is a self-financed \n     program, Congress took social security completely ``off-\n     budget'' in 1990; however, unless social security is \n     explicitly excluded from a balanced budget amendment to the \n     United States Constitution, such an amendment would, in \n     effect, put the program back into the Federal budget by \n     referring to all spending and receipts in calculating whether \n     the budget is in balance;\n       (11) raiding the social security trust funds to reduce the \n     Federal budget deficit would be devastating to both current \n     and future beneficiaries and would further undermine \n     confidence in the system among younger workers;\n       (12) the American people in poll after poll have \n     overwhelmingly rejected cutting social security benefits to \n     reduce the Federal deficit and balance the budget; and\n       (13) social security beneficiaries throughout the nation \n     are gravely concerned that their financial security is in \n     jeopardy because of possible social security cuts and deserve \n     to be reassured that their benefits will not be subject to \n     cuts that would likely be required should social security not \n     be excluded from a balanced budget amendment to the United \n     States Constitution.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any joint resolution providing for a balanced budget \n     amendment to the United States Constitution passed by the \n     Senate shall specifically exclude social security from the \n     calculations used to determine if the Federal budget is in \n     balance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask the manager, did the Senator \nintend to proceed with additional amendments now or prefer that we \nwait?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in discussing with the Senator from \nIowa, we do not have a problem laying aside the pending amendment while \nwe get additional information, and would note that the Senator from \nIowa has, I believe, a unanimous-consent request. I believe it would be \nappropriate to lay the pending amendment aside and proceed with the \namendment of the Senator.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, if it is in order, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I set aside the pending amendment and any pending \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 191\n\n(Purpose: To provide that certain legislation shall always be in order)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n   [[Page S1338]] The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 191.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, add after line 25 the following new section:\n       ``(4) Determination by reporting committee of applicability \n     to pending legislation.--Notwithstanding any provision of \n     paragraph (1)(B), it shall always be in order to consider a \n     bill, resolution, or conference report if such report \n     includes a determination by the reporting committee that the \n     pending measure is needed to serve a compelling national \n     interest that furthers the public health, safety, or welfare.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered today \nwill allow a reporting committee--that is, any of the authorizing \ncommittees--to ensure that a measure that committee determines is \nnecessary to serve a compelling national interest be given full \nconsideration by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, last week I raised several issues with my colleagues \nfrom Idaho and Ohio regarding Senate bill 1. Specifically, we discussed \nthe fact that under S. 1, it would be out of order to proceed on any \nlegislation that imposes a cost of more than $50 million on other \nlevels of government unless the Federal Government is willing to pay \nthe full costs incurred by those other levels of government. I realize \na point of order would have to be raised by a Senator for the \nlegislation not to be considered. Nevertheless, if the point of order \nis raised, then consideration of such a bill shall not be in order as I \nread the unfunded mandates legislation we are considering today.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we go too far when we say that the \nSenate should not consider a measure, regardless of its importance, \nunless the Federal Government can cover all public costs associated \nwith that measure. We can all think of cases of a compelling national \ninterest with which we should proceed even if the Federal Government \ndoes not intend to cover all the costs.\n  Some examples are control of nuclear waste, minimum wage laws, and \nthe control of terrorism. These are clear examples that I think most \nSenators will agree with. In those cases, it is appropriate to provide \na mechanism through which a committee reporting a measure, armed with \nthe Congressional Budget Office cost estimate required by this \nlegislation, can make a determination that it should be in order for \nthe full Senate to consider the matter, and that no point of order \nshould prevent that consideration.\n  Our Federal system functions best when there is a partnership of \neffort by local, State, and Federal Government, and tribal government, \nin some cases. Many of the most successful programs that we have in \nthis country have been pursued as a result of just such a partnership, \nconstructed by the Federal Government. Examples are the Interstate \nHighway System, Federal housing assistance, and the unemployment \ninsurance system.\n  If partnerships involving cost sharing by the different levels of \ngovernment are to occur, then under our Constitution, the Federal \nGovernment is set up as the final arbiter of the terms of those \npartnerships. It makes no sense for us to abdicate that responsibility \nentirely. Clearly, in any activity we choose to pursue in partnership \nwith the States, local government, or Indian Tribes, the Federal \nGovernment should do its best to cover the costs that relate to the \nbenefits that the country as a whole is to receive. Surely, the Federal \nGovernment should do a better job than it has in many cases in being \nsensitive to other governmental entities about costs they may occur.\n  But we should not, in my opinion, make it out of order to consider \nany and all legislation that requires action by other levels of \ngovernment unless the Federal Government agrees to pay the full cost of \nthat action. Partnerships between the Federal, State, and local \ngovernments and Indian tribes will be needed in the future, and it may \nbe appropriate in some cases for some of the costs of those \npartnerships to be borne by others than the Federal Government.\n  Under my amendment, the cost estimates would still be done, and no \none in the Senate would enter into the debate ignorant of the full \ncosts. Indeed, if the full Senate felt that the cost should be paid for \nentirely by the Federal Government, an amendment to this effect could \nbe offered. If the funding was not provided for all the costs, an \nestimate of which would be required under the amendment, the full \nSenate could vote the measure down after actual debate. A measure that \na committee determined to be needed to serve a compelling national \ninterest, however, would be assured a debate on its merits if it \nreached the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, this seems to be an imminently reasonable adjustment \nto the procedures outlined in S. 1. I urge the managers to support the \namendment. I urge my colleagues to agree to its adoption. I may speak \nagain in reference to this prior to final vote on the issue. I did want \nto put my colleagues on notice as to the import of this amendment.\n  I have two other amendments, Mr. President, that I have reserved the \nright to offer, and I intend to offer those later this afternoon or \nearly tomorrow. I do not have those with me at this moment.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. In response, Mr. President, to the Senator from New \nMexico, I think it is necessary to point out that if at any point \nduring this process, there truly is a compelling argument, that the \ncommittee, the chairman of that committee, may come to the floor and \nseek a waiver of this process of S. 1, and need not go through the \nremaining steps of that process.\n  But the idea, as I understand the proposed amendment, is to say that \nthe committee itself could exercise the jurisdiction of the full \nSenate, which I do not think is appropriate and is really a real short \ncircuit of what we are trying to do here with this process.\n  Earlier today we heard from the Senator from Nevada and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota on another issue, but they were saying that with this \nparticular Federal mandate that has been put into place a year or two \nago that there may be merit to this unfunded Federal mandate, but it \nwould have been so nice to have known all the implications and the \ncosts before this unfunded Federal mandate was implemented. What they \nwere describing is how nice it would have been to have S. 1 in place \nbefore that particular mandate had been imposed.\n  So, again, I think that S. 1 provides the process and rather than \nallowing the committee to have that sort of jurisdiction to say that \nbecause there is a compelling interest here we need not comply is not \nthe route that we should go. If that is the case, if there truly is a \ncompelling reason, then they can seek that waiver immediately.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I just respond to the concern that \nthe Senator from Idaho has raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, by my amendment by its language I am not \nexempting any piece of legislation from the requirements of cost \nestimates or reports from the CBO. What I am saying is that once those \ncost estimates and reports are obtained by the appropriate committee, \nif that committee determines that there is compelling national interest \nthat needs to be considered here, then it has the right to say that in \nits report and to have the legislation considered on its merits on the \nSenate floor. And it does not have to get past any procedural hurdle \nthat this proposed legislation would impose in terms of language that \nsays it is out of order to consider the proposed bill.\n  In my opinion, it is not wise for us to be writing legislation \nstating it is out of order to consider any and all Federal legislation \nwhere the Federal Government fails to pay the full cost of implementing \nthe legislation. There are too many examples in our Nation's history \nwhere it has been appropriate for the \n[[Page S1339]] Federal Government to proceed with legislation of that \ntype and where there has been a well-designed partnership between the \nFederal Government, State government, and local government to \naccomplish a recognized national purpose.\n  I am trying to make it clear that where there is such a circumstance \nin the view of an authorizing committee, then that authorizing \ncommittee should have the right to have its legislation, its reported \nlegislation, considered on its merits without having to overcome \nprocedural points of order to do so.\n  That is the intent of my legislation. It does not exempt any reported \nlegislation from the requirements of reports or cost estimates by the \nCBO. I do believe those are appropriate, and clearly the failure to \nhave those in some cases has worked a hardship on local governments, on \nState governments, on Indian tribes.\n  I wanted to clarify what the import of my legislation is. And with \nthat clarification, I hope that the Senator from Idaho, and all other \nSenators, can support it.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig).

Mr. President, we live in an era of technological \nmiracles--inventions, phenomena, and developments whose inventors and \ninitiators might have been burned at the stake as witches and warlocks \nin the so-called ``Dark Ages'' for even suggesting, much less producing \nor conducting, such things.\n  Automobiles, jet aircraft, space vehicles, CD records, microwave \novens, telephones, artificial hearts, organ transplants--inventions, \nopportunities, and creations that some of our ancestors only a century \nago might have found unbelievable, if not unimaginable.\n  But, Mr. President, perhaps the one modern invention that has had, \nand will have, the greatest impact on human life is television.\n  Imagine, if you will, the astonishment of George Washington, Thomas \nJefferson, or even Benjamin Franklin if any one of those men were able \nto sit down with us today in front of that vast wasteland, as Newton \nMinow referred to it--a television set.\n  Imagine being able to tune in with them on a one-on-one conversation \nacross the Atlantic with British Prime Minister John Major or German \nChancellor Helmut Kohl, to discuss Trans-Atlantic alliances or \ninternational trade issues, for example.\n  Or imagine the astonishment of U.S. Grant or Robert E. Lee had they \nbeen able in their time to sit before a television set and view the \nactual progress of the Siege of Vicksburg or the Battle of Gettysburg, \nas so many millions of everyday Americans viewed the progress of the \nGulf War or the shooting down of ``Scud'' missiles incoming over Tel \nAviv or Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n  Interestingly, perhaps even the Founding Fathers of the television \ndid not foresee the scope of television or grasp the possibilities that \nthis miracle offered in its earliest, fuzziest beginnings.\n  In those primeval days of television broadcasting--roughly, the late \n1930's and pre-World War II 1940's--the biggest star attractions \nconsisted primarily of telecast images of ``Felix the Cat'' and local \nstation test patterns, which fascinated people even though they offered \nthe crudest of images and practically no motion.\n  But following the end of the Second World War, several radio programs \nbegan ``simulcasting''--that is, broadcasting both on infant television \nnetworks and on the established radio networks at the same time.\n  Thus, in time, millions of Americans were enabled both to see and \nhear ``The Voice of Firestone,'' ``The Bell Telephone Hour,'' and ``The \nNBC Orchestra,'' conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Increasing numbers of \nAmerican families were exposed to the music of Beethoven and Schubert, \nand to the considerable talents of the finest musical figures of the \nMetropolitan Opera or La Scala.\n  In time, NBC introduced plays by some of America's leading \nplaywrights on ``The Philco/Goodyear Playhouse,'' and CBS on ``Studio \nOne''--plays many of which went on to be reproduced into classic \nmovies, and plays that introduced some of today's leading actors and \nactresses to millions upon millions of Americans who had been unable to \nwitness their Broadway and off-Broadway debuts.\n  For children in those early days of television, ``Howdy Doody,'' \n``Romper Room,'' ``Miss Frances'' on ``Ding Dong School,'' and \n``Captain Kangaroo'' provided often brilliant exposure to experiences \nand information unavailable to them anywhere else--experiences and \ninformation that conveyed values, taught serious while camouflaged \nknowledge, stretched tiny minds--tiny minds--and imaginations, and \nhelped untold millions of preschool children prepare for the serious \nbusiness of entering school and beginning their formal educations.\n  The apparent goal of television executives in those early days seemed \nto be to reach growing numbers of middle-class and upper-middle-class \nAmerican consumers whom sponsors wanted to attract to buy their \nautomobiles, bath soaps, refrigerators, and dish detergents--consumers \nwith high incomes and relatively good educations, and men and women of \nall income and educational levels who hungered for good music, \ncompelling drama, and intellectually challenging entertainment and \ndiversion.\n  Likewise in those days, sponsors were eager to have their names and \ntrademarks associated with ``quality culture,'' in hopes of winning and \nkeeping consumer loyalty and gratitude, both valued intangibles in the \nsupermarkets and department stores when viewers contemplated their \npurchases.\n  But as time passed, advertisers more and more craved only higher and \nhigher audience numbers. In the search for those numbers, sensation \ndrove out substance, and action cancelled out content.\n  In time, in pursuit of ratings, television producers lost their \nnerve.\n  If a single ``cowboy'' show caught the public's fancy, dozens of \ncowboy shows appeared, crowding out most other programming. If the next \nseason a single detective show garnered high ratings, off the \ntelevision range fled the cowboys, and detective shows proliferated \nacross the dial. The same held true of variety shows, quiz shows, \n``sit-coms,'' or spy shows.\n  In the process, children's programs with substance vanished, to be \nreplaced, hour after hour, with crudely composed ``action'' cartoons, \nin which scarcely believable and primitively drawn comic book \n``heroes'' exposed children to eternities of violence, mayhem, and \npointless fantasy.\n  Expert television analysts assert that, by the time an American child \nreaches his or her late teens, commercial television has exposed that \nchild to literally thousands of murders and other acts of violence, an \nexposure that predictably deadens that child to real-life violence and \nthat overtly and subliminally teaches that violence, in itself, is an \neffective means of solving problems and getting one's own way in this \nworld.\n  Should we, then, be surprised that here in the inner-city \nneighborhoods of Washington, or in Baltimore or New York or other great \nurban centers--and even in our comfortable suburbs--children are \nliterally murdering other children over the possession of sneakers, \nteam jackets, or over real or imagined slights? After all, again and \nagain without number, these child-murderers have witnessed the \neffective use of such solutions on commercial television, and a few \nweeks later, they had seen the same guy who gets shot or stabbed or \npushed out the window or strangled with a copper wire on some other \nshow in perfectly good health.\n  From the beginning of the adulteration of television, thoughtful \npeople have sought alternatives to the trash and vulgarity that have \nincreasingly contaminated the airwaves of this miraculous medium of \ncommunication.\n  [[Page S1340]] And, to the relief of millions of thoughtful \nAmericans, in time, ``educational television'' laid the foundations for \ntoday's public broadcasting stations.\n  As a result, as the public television network grew, children in our \ninner cities and in rural States like West Virginia and eastern \nKentucky could be reached by television images that stretched their \nimaginations, taught them stores by great authors, exposed them to \ninitial concepts in science and arithmetic, and challenged them with \nmainstream values such as telling the truth, respecting other children, \nobeying their parents, and becoming good citizens.\n  At the same time, the Public Broadcasting System, the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting, and National Public Radio increasingly filled the \nvoids left by the commercial networks when they turned their backs on \npeople in our society who crave good music, who hunger for good drama, \nwho desire to hear and see good public debates on important questions \nof our time, who are eager for good documentaries, and who yearn for \nsubstance and challenge in their entertainment.\n  Indeed, the Public Broadcasting System has evolved into a kind of \ncultural cutting edge--the pioneering network--that carved the \nfrontiers and plowed the first fields that have proved the market that \nsuch operations as the Arts and Entertainment network, the Discovery, \nand Learning Channels, the History Channel, Bravo, and other \nincreasingly culturally oriented systems are now exploiting.\n  But even in these commendable enterprises, PBS has been the pioneer \nto which these new cultural channels must look for guidance. As welcome \nas their entry into the cultural scene is, so much of their offerings \nwere first offered or grubstaked on public television.\n  The lamentable truth is that, in commercial television, the bottom \nline is money, and until certain kinds of programming prove themselves, \nmost commercial cable networks are unwilling to take risks on most \ntypes of programming--that is, until public television demonstrates the \nexistence of a market for that kind of programming.\n  Ken Burns' ``Civil War'' was an enormous gamble on which no one \noutside public television would have been willing to take a chance, \nuntil WETA made a leap of faith and underwrote a classic that will live \nfor decades. Millions upon millions of Americans have seen ``The Civil \nWar,'' and millions upon millions more will see it in coming \ngenerations. As a result, countless millions of Americans yet unborn \nwill understand in ways previous impossible the significance and the \nscale of the greatest conflict in American history--a conflict that \nstill defines us in many ways roughly 130 years later.\n  Currently, the hunt dogs are baying at the heels of PBS and the \npublic broadcasting network across our country.\n  We are informed that PBS is too liberal, too radical, too un-\nAmerican, elitist, left-wing.\n  Do these critics mean to say that William F. Buckley's ``Firing \nLine'' is an example of liberal programming?\n  William Buckley has been appearing on ``Firing Line,'' a program \nproduced admirably by South Carolina public broadcasting for years. \nIndeed, to follow William Buckley is to be disarmed by one of the most \nrational, intellectually charming, and persuasive conservative \npersonalities in American history, a man who has exploited ``Firing \nLine'' brilliantly in a committed effort to force millions of Americans \nto rethink, or to think for the first time, the seminal principles of \ntheir own political, economic, and social positions.\n  Or do the critics mean to include in their criticisms of the liberal \nand elitist descriptions of PBS the reruns of the ``Lawrence Welk \nShow,'' reproduced by Oklahoma public television, to the absolute \ndelight of millions upon millions of Middle Aged and Older Americans \nwho await each week the replay of some of the most beautiful music ever \ncomposed and performed in America?\n  Or do they mean ``Wall Street Week,'' presided over by one of the \nmost urbane and persuasive capitalists ever to advocate the free \nenterprise system anywhere and at any time?\n  Or do those critics include among left-wing elitists the conservative \nBen Wattenberg, whose weekly panels present a wide spectrum of \nchallenging intellects, right and left, in a balanced discussion, in \nunderstandable terms, of some of the most arcane issues of our day?\n  Or are we to assume that ``The Collectors,'' ``This Old House,'' \n``Cats and Dogs,'' concerts by the Boston Pops Orchestra, LeVar \nBurton's ``Reading Rainbow,'' or reruns of such classics as \n``Casablanca'' or Marlene Dietrich's ``Blue Angel'' are examples of \nelitist programming?\n  Or what of ``Washington Week in Review'' which we see every Friday \nevening here in Washington, by tuning in at 8 o'clock?\n  Year after year after year we watched Paul Duke, and we still watch \n``Washington Week in Review.'' It provides some of the most perceptive, \nthoughtful, and penetrating analysis available anywhere.\n  To be sure, much on public television rankles me, as I am sure it \nrankles people who do not share my values and philosophy of life.\n  But to stifle, shut down, starve, emasculate, or cripple our public \nbroadcasting system, by denying it the seed money that guarantees its \nvery survival in some of our most isolated rural communities, would be \nto kill one of the finest golden-egg-laying geese on the American \ncultural scene. To speak many truths is to risk making many enemies. \nLikewise, to speak many truths is to risk making many friends, as well. \nAnd because our public broadcasting system provides such a variety of \ntruths, it can boast mobs of both friends and detractors.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will think long and sincerely before we \npunish, dismantle, or destroy one of the most valuable assets in our \nnational cultural treasury, and risk reducing the Public Broadcasting \nSystem, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and National Public \nRadio to bad and ineffectual imitations of our commercial broadcasting \nnetworks, complete with underarm deodorant commercials and paeans to \ndog food and kitty litter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  [Disturbance in the visitors' gallery.]\n  Mr. BYRD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 192\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 192.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, add after line 25, the following new section:\n       ``(4) Application to Requirements Relating to the Treatment \n     and Disposal of Radioactive Waste--\n       Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (c)(1)(B), it \n     shall always be in order to consider a bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, or conference report if such provision \n     relates to a requirement for the treatment or disposal of--\n       (A) high-level radioactive waste, low-level radioactive \n     waste, or spent nuclear fuel (as such terms are defined in \n     section 2 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. \n     10101)); or\n       (B) byproduct material or transuranic waste (as such terms \n     are defined in section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, \n     (42 U.S.C. 2014)).''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering here is an \namendment to exempt measures concerning the treatment and disposal of \n[[Page S1341]] nuclear waste from S. 1. It is my understanding that the \nagency primarily responsible for this issue is the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission. It is one of the agencies that is not covered by title II \nof this legislation.\n  This amendment I have offered here would have the effect of ensuring \nthat both the NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Congress \ncan continue to have authority to take necessary action in this very \nimportant policy area. Without this amendment I have offered here, we \nare leaving the NRC with power to act in an area where it would also be \nout of order for this Congress itself to consider legislating. If a \nbill or an amendment is offered to increase the requirements to obtain \na license under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that bill would be \nsubject to a point of order. The NRC could do that by regulation \nwithout there being any objection raised.\n  But if the Congress tried by statute to raise the requirements on a \nlicensee under the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that \nwould be subject to a point of order. As the bill now stands, my \namendment would correct that. I believe it is important to look at this \nissue in a historical context.\n  Research on nuclear energy started without congressional approval and \nin fact in great secrecy, and only a few select Members of Congress \nwere kept informed about the Manhattan project during World War II, \neven though a large amount of taxpayer money was being spent to build \nthe facilities needed at Los Alamos in my own home State, in Hanford, \nand at Oak Ridge.\n  Moving quickly to assert its control over the nuclear program, \nCongress passed the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which created both the \nAtomic Energy Commission in the executive branch, which was charged \nwith managing the program, and it created a Joint Committee on Atomic \nEnergy within Congress to oversee and direct the program. Moreover, \nbecause private ownership was prohibited in the 1946 act, the Federal \nGovernment maintained absolute control over nuclear materials and \nfacilities. Consequently, the prospect of the nuclear program being \ntransitional to the civilian sector was very faint, and, therefore, \nCongress was enforced to enact legislation to develop the civilian \nnuclear power program in 1954 with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.\n  Because that act was extremely vague in its efforts to define safety \nconsiderations and in its overall regulatory program, the AEC, the \nAtomic Energy Commission, was responsible for promulgating safety \nregulations, and they had broad discretion. In fact, the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia noted years later that the 1954 \nact created--here is a quotation from one of their decisions:\n\n       The 1954 act created a regulatory scheme which is virtually \n     unique in the degree to which broad responsibilities should \n     pose in the administrative agency.\n\n  And it has a prescription in its charter as to how it shall proceed \nin achieving the statutory objectives. Mr. President, today that same \nvery broad discretion resides in the regulatory agency.\n  The initial administrative regulations parallel the 1954 act, and the \ntwo were very loose. Nuclear power has proven to be extremely complex \nand increasingly demanding. Nuclear power plants have grown larger and \nmore sophisticated, and they are requiring capable safety systems and \nbackups.\n  Very simply stated, the more complex these nuclear power systems have \nbecome and plants have become, the more things can go wrong. As a \nresult, nuclear regulation has had to keep pace with industry advances \nin order to protect the public health and safety. Recent accidents only \nserve to remind us of the potential of not maintaining close scrutiny \nof this industry. Chernobyl raised the awareness of Russia and Eastern \nEurope where dozens of unsafe plants exist that fall way below the \nWestern safety standards that have been promulgated by our own Federal \nGovernment.\n  Under the provisions of the pending unfunded mandates legislation, \nmany of the valuable laws that were created specifically in response to \nthe public health and safety concerns in this area would have been \nimproper for consideration. For instance, the Low Level Radioactive \nWaste Policy Act could not have been considered by Congress absent the \nwaiver of this unfunded mandates act. The low level waste act, passed \nin 1980, makes the States responsible for nuclear waste disposal; that \nis, waste that was generated within that particular State's borders. No \nFederal funding is provided in this program.\n  Moreover, I must note that the National Governors Association \nrequested this legislation. Indeed, the National Governors Association \nprovided much input into it. Essentially, the Governors believed that \nthe States were in a better position to select disposal sites within \nthose States. Nonetheless, under S. 1, the low level waste program \nwould come under the definition of a Federal mandate and would be \nsubject to the requirements of title I of the bill.\n  Additionally, in the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987, we \nauthorized the Office of Nuclear Waste Negotiator to find a State or an \nIndian tribe to host a permanent repository for a monitored, \nretrievable storage facility for nuclear waste.\n  This legislation we are considering today could frustrate his efforts \nif he were successful in identifying a potential host for such a \nfacility. In my home State of New Mexico we are seeing an effort to \nsite a nuclear waste repository facility on tribal land. And I feel \nstrongly that we in the Congress must preserve our ability to legislate \nand regulate in this area to protect public health and safety.\n  The reasons for this amendment are self-evident. Although I believe \nthat the Senate should always keep in mind the costs incurred by the \nprivate and the public sectors by any of its actions, I believe, as \nreporting committees apparently do, that in some areas of the law they \nare simply too important to create points of order against \nconsideration of legislation. I further believe that the treatment and \ndisposal of nuclear waste falls within that category.\n  Clearly, we have a responsibility to act and exert national \nleadership in an area that could have a profound impact on the health \nand safety of the American people, and in the future we may very well \nbe called on to do so. We need to be sure that we will be able to do so \nand that procedural roadblocks cannot be raised.\n  For this reason, I urge my colleagues to adopt this important \namendment. I understand that the managers of the bill are agreeable to \na time limit for additional discussion of this bill prior to its being \nvoted on.\n  I am glad to yield the floor or yield to questions.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I think I understand what the Senator from \nNew Mexico is trying to do, but I am not sure I understand exactly how \nthis would work. I would like to clarify. Let me make a statement. Then \nI would ask the Senator from New Mexico to respond.\n  If what the unfunded mandates bill is trying to do, of course, is to \nsay where we are putting a mandate on a State, we will consider the \ncosts up front, we will deal with those costs and either provide for it \nby passing those costs and saying, States you have to do it, or we \nwould provide the money. That is the purpose of this, so we will not \nbuild up these huge bills and put all of these costs on the States \noccasioned by what we do here with legislation involving the States.\n  It would appear to me that if we exempt the nuclear industry from \nthis process, you would set up the possibility that, if the proposal, \nwhatever it is, is exempted from the point of order, that you might \nfind the Federal Government is just going back and saying, States do \nit, with no money or no consideration of money required up front or \nanything else.\n  I cannot believe that is what the Senator from New Mexico would \nintend. Maybe I am wrong. But this would mean someplace like Hanford \nthat has all the problems out there at Hanford in Washington, with all \nthe problems of the so-called semiexplosive silos out there that we \nhave been concerned about for a couple of decades now, and all the \nother problems from that area as well as some 17 major nuclear sites in \nthe nuclear weapons complex in 11 different States, that we can in \neffect \n[[Page S1342]] say to those States, just take care of it. We put a \nmandate on you. You take care of it out there. Whether it is Hanford, \nor in my home State of Ohio, or wherever, we would just say, States, \ntake care of it.\n  I do not believe that the Senator from New Mexico intends that be the \nsituation. But I would submit, if I understand the amendment correctly, \nthat would be a possibility under this. It would seem to me that the \nStates are better protected by saying we stay under this point of \norder, if it lies, and then say we have considered the cost up front \nand here is how we will take care of those costs and help the States \ncomply with Federal law, which is what we do with other environmental \nconcerns, not just nuclear, clean air, clean water, and everything that \nwe provide mandates for around here.\n  All these environmental mandates so far are the biggest thing under \nthe unfunded mandates. What we set up is a point of order with regard \nto those where we either work out an arrangement where we share in the \ncosts that we are imposing to accomplish that good end, or we say we \nare not going to do that up front. But we have to consider the costs up \nfront on what our responsibilities are.\n  It would seem to me that in the nuclear industry in particular, and \nparticularly the nuclear weapons program, that we are still trying to \nrecover from all those secrecies that went into effect during the cold \nwar that let us build up huge stocks of material that now need to be \ntaken out and disposed of someplace. I would not think that we would \nwant to have that out from under the Government saving in the cost of \ndoing that. Yet, if I read the amendment correctly, that is exactly \nwhat it is. Am I wrong in my understanding?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond to the question. I do \nthink the Senator is wrong in his understanding.\n  First of all, let me make clear, my amendment does not exempt \nanything from the reporting requirements. The reporting requirements in \nthe bill, where you have to estimate the costs and estimate where the \ncosts would fall, remain in place.\n Those have to be obtained before any legislation comes to the floor, \nand none of that is changed under my amendment.\n\n  What my amendment does say, though, is that in this very important \narea related to treatment or disposal of nuclear waste, in that very \nimportant area, if the Federal Government determines that some action \nshould take place, you cannot raise a point of order that says it is \nout of order to consider the legislation, absent full funding by the \nFederal Government. That is all my proposed amendment does.\n  The Senator was saying this would open up the possibility of the \nFederal Government saying to the States: Washington State, you are \nresponsible for Hanford.\n  That possibility exists today. That possibility will exist in the \nfuture. Theoretically, we could do that at any point, just to the same \nextent we do it today. That is the way the Constitution set up our \nFederal system. So that possibility is always there for the Federal \nGovernment to step in and do that kind of a thing. Clearly, though, \nthat is not consistent with the way this country has viewed \nresponsibility, sharing the responsibility for nuclear power.\n  Mr. GLENN. If the Senator will yield. I am not sure I understand yet \nwhat he is proposing, or if that is his interpretation, because the \npoint of order is supposed to make certain that the Federal Government \nshares in the mandate they are sending to the State. If we do away with \nthat point of order, and as your amendment says, ``notwithstanding any \nother provision,'' paragraph 1(b), ``it shall always be in order to \nconsider a bill, joint resolution, amendment, or conference report, if \nit relates to the requirement for the treatment or disposal of,'' and \nit goes into radioactive waste and so on. That means a point of order \nwould not lie dealing with nuclear waste or disposal. That means the \nStates would have to pick up the bill. That is what we are trying to \nprevent, as there was too much in the past with clean air, clean water, \nand all the requirements we have put on the States without providing \nany Federal funding, if I understand this correctly.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me try to respond using another example which I \nraised, I believe, a week ago to the Senator from Ohio and the Senator \nfrom Idaho both. That is a circumstance we have in my home State, where \nyou have an Indian tribe negotiating now with various utilities to put \nin a nuclear waste repository, a monitored retrievable storage site. \nUnder the legislation as drafted and as presented here to the Senate, \nany effort by the Congress to impose requirements on an Indian tribe \nwith regard to the running of a site, the way that a facility such as \nthat would be conducted, if those requirements added up to more than \n$50 million, it would be out of order for us to consider the \nlegislation unless we paid for it.\n  In my view, it should not be out of order for us to consider that \nlegislation. In my view, that is exactly the kind of legislation we \nought to be considering.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I respond to my friend that in a situation \nlike that, where it obtains strictly to an Indian tribe that is trying \nto have some of this activity on their reservation, that should be \nbrought up just like everything else, and the Senate, in considering \nthat then would waive that requirement if it was appropriate in that \ncase.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me clarify that I think maybe the \ndisagreement here is--I have an instinctive reaction against putting \nlanguage in law that says a point of order can be raised against \nconsideration of any bill which meets the following requirements.\n  It seems to me that it should not be out of order to consider \nlegislation in an important field such as the treatment and disposal of \nnuclear waste. That is what the Congress was constituted to do, to \nconsider that kind of legislation. And here we are about to pass \nlegislation, the unfunded mandates act, which says that it is out of \norder for us to consider it. It strikes me that, at least in this area, \nwhere clearly there is a Federal interest, clearly there is a history \nof responsible Federal action --maybe not as responsible as some would \nlike, but at least the main action that has taken place here has \nclearly been Federal--I believe it is appropriate for us to say to do \nthe reports, but if you are going to legislate in this area, go ahead \nand bring that legislation to the floor and let the Senate dispose of \nit, either pass it or defeat it.\n  Mr. GLENN. Let me address another concern I have here and that is \nthis: This bill is designed to deal with Federal mandates imposed on \nother entities--State and local, whatever--to take care of those costs \nup front or say why we are not going to, and require the States or \nlocal communities to address what ever it is the proposal is we are \nmaking.\n  It would seem to me that what you are addressing is something else. \nWhere an Indian tribe on a reservation is initiating a plan on their \nown, that does not really have anything to do with what we are imposing \nfrom the Federal level, is that correct?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. No. Mr. President, let me respond that under the act as \nit now stands, as I understand it, the act does not apply to \nindependent regulatory agencies. They are exempted from the unfunded \nmandates act.\n  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is such an independent regulatory \nagency and, therefore, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission can impose \nobligations on a tribe, on a local government, on a State, by \nregulation, and the cost of that can exceed $50 million, or whatever \nfigure it has to exceed.\n  What we are doing, though, in the legislation as it now stands, is we \nare saying although the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is vested with \nauthority to impose those kinds of obligations, we are denying \nourselves that authority. We in the Congress are denying ourselves that \nauthority, and that strikes me as totally illogical. It strikes me that \nif we are going to have that authority vested in the Federal \nGovernment, clearly Congress should retain its ability to deal with \nthis in a responsible way.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico stated \nthat his amendment would in no way require anything other than the \nreporting requirements. They would still have to abide by the reporting \nrequirements. The key point is that his \n[[Page S1343]] amendment would, again, disavow that a point of order \ncould lie against the legislation.\n  In this very, very important issue of nuclear storage facilities--for \nexample, spent nuclear fuel rods--we know that we have a number of \ncommercial sites all over the United States. We know that there are \ncertain repositories. We know that there are certain States that may be \nreceiving the spent *naval fuel, as is the case in Idaho. This sort of \ndiscussion, as you begin to get a flavor of it here, is exactly the \nsort of discussion that ought to take place on the floor of the Senate. \nSo, again, this is another exclusion from the presumption that this \nlegislation says we are in favor of State and local governments \nreceiving the funds in order to carry out these Federal mandates. At \nany point, you can come and seek a waiver. It is a majority vote that \nwould allow that waiver of the point of order at any point during the \nprocess.\n  But I really believe that if we send this sort of a signal, you will \nfind that States are saying: If you are not going to abide by this, if \nwe do not have any likelihood that there will be Federal funds to carry \nthese things out, it will continue to be an unfunded Federal mandate in \nthe area of nuclear storage. For example, I do not think you will see \nany States that will want to step forward and say they would like to be \nconsidered as a possible solution for the long-range storage or \ndisposition of nuclear material. I would not blame them.\n  So, again, I just say let us not disavow the point of order. Let us \nallow not only the reporting requirements, the costs associated with \nthat and the impact, but let us also have a discussion so that a point \nof order could lie and we would have this sort of discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate instead of allowing the committee to have the \njurisdiction to say we do not need to allow Congress to consider this \nany further.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Idaho this: One \nconcern I have had here is under the language of the bill which he is \nproposing to the Senate, we exempt independent regulatory agencies from \nthe purview of the bill. So we are saying that if the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission wishes to impose expensive, onerous requirements \non a State, town or tribal government, to ensure safety in the handling \nof nuclear waste, that is fine.\n We have no objection. No point of order can be raised. And we are \ncertainly not suggesting one in this bill.\n\n  But Congress cannot do that. Congress cannot consider legislation to \ndo that unless it is willing to waive a point of order. So we are \nessentially denying to the Congress the very powers that we are leaving \nin the independent regulatory agency at the Federal level.\n  I have great difficulty understanding the logic of denying Congress \nthe very authority which the Constitution gives it to this area and \nrequiring somebody who comes to the Senate floor or some committee that \nreports legislation to the Senate floor requiring them to overcome a \nprocedural hurdle before they can, in fact, have their proposed \nlegislation considered on its merits.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the arguments that were \nmade by the Senator. But drawing the distinction with Congress, he is \ndealing with legislation. With a regulatory agency, you are dealing \nwith regulations. It may be that that regulatory agency is then, \nthrough those regulations, carrying out the will of Congress as \nestablished in that legislation.\n  Also, I know that Senator Roth, chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, will be holding hearings on regulatory relief to determine \nif, in fact, there are some areas in which we should be making \nmodifications.\n  But I do not believe that, by saying what the Senator may be \ndescribing as a problem with the regulatory process, we, therefore, \nshould make sure that Congress also follows that same process.\n  S. 1 is a process to give us accountability. Again, I believe that it \nwill give us the information that we need up front, so that we can have \nthese sort of meanings full discussion and not preclude that sort of \ndiscussion by agreeing to the Senator's amendment as proposed.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am beginning to doubt that I am going \nto persuade the sponsor of the bill of the merits of my amendment.\n  But let me at least conclude by saying that again my amendment does \nnot in any way take away the requirement that the information be \nobtained. It says the information must be obtained so that discussion \ncan and should take place on the Senate floor. I just doubt the wisdom \nof us putting in a Federal statute that it is out of order for us to \nconsider legislation dealing with the treatment and disposal of nuclear \nwaste. It should not be out of order for us to consider that \nlegislation. And a person who wants to consider legislation in that \narea should not have to come to the floor and overcome a procedural \nhurdle in order to have his proposed legislation considered on its \nmerits.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, or I am glad to respond if there is \nfurther discussion of the amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for the \nSenator from New Mexico, and that is why I take very seriously his \nsuggested amendment.\n  But I believe, in that last statement, I say to the Senator from New \nMexico, maybe there is a semantics problem. Because when the Senator \nsays that he does not feel we should have some process that makes it \nout of order for Congress to be discussing potential legislation \ndealing with the nuclear issue, I agree with the Senator.\n  But this process does not just automatically say it is out of order. \nIt says, here are the steps you must follow and if you follow those \nsteps as prescribed there is nothing that says you will be out of \norder. And you will be dealing with that very important issue of \nnuclear material or storage.\n  If, however, you find that one of those steps is illogical, onerous, \nat that point, then you can come and seek a majority vote to say we \nagree with you. We now waive this point of order, but the Senator's \namendment takes that away. It disavows the point of order, and that is \nmy concern.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, just to make it clear, I am focused on \nthe semantics and I think the Senator from Idaho is right. I am focused \non line 16 and 17, page 21, where it says, ``It shall not be in order \nin the Senate to consider'' and then it goes on and says any bill or \njoint resolution, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. That to me is not \nsemantics. That is more than semantics to say ``it shall not be in \norder in the Senate to consider.''\n  I think the whole purpose of the Congress in our Federal system is to \nconsider legislation of this type dealing with major national issues. \nTreating and storage of nuclear waste is just one of those. But I \nconsider that to be an area of concern peculiarly in the purview of the \nNational Government.\n  So I do think I have a concern when we pass legislation, as we are \ngetting ready to do here, as I understand it, that says, ``It shall not \nbe in order for the Senate to consider'' various pieces of legislation.\n  So there is a basic disagreement. I think it is more than semantics. \nI think it is the language of the statute.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to discuss it. I have another \namendment. I know there is another Senator ready to offer an amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside for the purposes of offering my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 193\n\n (Purpose: To provide that any State, local, or tribal government that \nalready complies with a new Federal intergovernmental mandate shall be \n        eligible to receive funds for the costs of the mandate)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nthat it be considered as offered for the purposes of the deadline \ntomorrow.\n   [[Page S1344]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 193.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following:\n       Nothing in this Act shall preclude a State, local, or \n     tribal government that already complies with all or part of \n     the Federal intergovernmental mandates included in the bill, \n     joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report \n     from considerations for Federal funding for the cost of the \n     mandate, including the costs the State, local, or tribal \n     government is currently paying and any additional costs \n     necessary to meet the mandate.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Briefly, Mr. President, this amendment clarifies a possible \nproblem in the bill that we are creating or will be creating a \ndisincentive for States to take action. Some States may well decide to \ndelay action on necessary and important measures in the hope that \nCongress passes a Federal law to do the same thing that they are \nconsidering doing and then provide some money to do it which otherwise \nwould not be available. This amendment will ensure that States are not \nineligible to receive funds if they are already meeting a Federal \nmandate under existing State law.\n  We are going to be discussing this tomorrow. I am not asking that the \namendment be accepted at this time, of course, but I wanted to present \nit. I think it is important that we not provide clear disincentives to \nStates to do things environmental or with regard to health care or \nwelfare reform or in any way. Should we be giving the States a message \nthat we want them to just sit around and not do anything if they \nanticipate that down the road a Federal mandate may be passed that \nwould provided the money for them to do it? It seems to me that is not \nwhat we are trying to accomplish here with this bill.\n  My amendment simply indicates that States will not be ineligible to \nbe considered for funding if, in fact, they are acting in a way that is \nprogressive and that, if a mandate then is passed, they will be \neligible to be considered for any money that they may have spent in \ncomplying with that mandate.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I had some discussion with the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin about this, and I understand the intent and I appreciate \nthe intent of this.\n  It sounds to me like it may be an incentive for States to continue to \nbe progressive and know that there may be ways of doing things in their \nparticular State that do not apply to other States and they ought to \nproceed.\n  I would like to have the opportunity later to have a meeting with the \nSenator from Wisconsin and with the Senator from Ohio and see if we \ncould not work out some language that we could all agree to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again, I think the intent is very \nappropriate.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. As the Senator from \nIdaho and I both know, we have been working together and will continue, \nI am sure, to work together along with Senator Glenn and Senator Roth, \nSenator Exon, to find language that clarifies the purpose and that \nsatisfies all of our needs. I simply want to bring that to the floor. I \nappreciate your consideration and willingness to work with me on this.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as if in \nmorning business for a period 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1339-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1344-S1345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CRISIS IN IDAHO\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last Friday at about this hour I stood on \nthe floor of this Senate to describe a crisis that my State of Idaho \nand its citizens were at the brink of, a crisis that had resulted from \na Federal judge's order to immediately halt all economic activity on \nnearly 14 million acres of my State.\n  At the time I spoke, Idaho families and communities stood on the \nbrink of financial ruin, through, frankly, no fault of their own, but \nbecause the Federal Government had failed to perform its \nresponsibilities in a framework that was required by the law. Since I \nspoke on Friday many of my colleagues have asked me about the situation \nin my State.\n  I rise this afternoon to give Members a status report to the Senate \nand, frankly, to the Nation. I say to the Nation, because we will not \nfind this story reported on the front page of any newspaper outside the \nState of Idaho, probably because nobody would believe the magnitude of \nthe potential catastrophe that was at hand in my State.\n  This action was taken in the name of saving an important Idaho \nresource--the salmon, three species of salmon--on the Snake and \nColumbia River systems of the Pacific Northwest, an anadromous fish \nthat spawns in the headwaters of my State of Idaho and listed as \nthreatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.\n  But surely it was not necessary to shut down virtually all activities \non six national forests with only 1 day's warning to save these species \nof fish. This action occurred because a Federal agency, National Marine \nFisheries, had not finished its review of another Federal agency's \nwork. The so-called consultation process was being mired down inside \nthe bureaucracy, whether it was because of staff time or inadequate \nfunding or simply they just had not gotten to it. The bottom line was \nthat it had not been done and a Federal judge reacted.\n  I received from local officials worried about a situation of nearly \n2,000 people being put out of work, a population frightened that on \nMonday morning, this day, they would not have the jobs to go to that \nthey had demanded immediate action. That injunction was to go through \non Friday.\n  Now our problem was to be, what would happen? So on Friday I got in \ntouch with National Marine Fisheries, Rollie Schmitten at his agency \nand he assured me the work would be completed on January 31--that is a \nweek from now--that it would satisfy National Marine Fisheries \nconcerned about Forest Service activities and that it might well \naddress the consultation process in its conclusion.\n  What is important to remember is that the court injunction issued \nover a week ago was not issued because salmon were being endangered by \nfolks at that moment in time. They were not being placed in jeopardy at \nthat moment in time. But a judge reacted with an injunction that could \nhave stopped jobs in the area and would have threatened thousands of \nfamilies at this moment in time. In other words, the bureaucratic \ngridlock could have put my State of Idaho out of business and put \nthousands of people's jobs on the line.\n  This brings to the forefront, I think, the most recent example of the \nbalancing act we must pursue when saving a species of plant or animal. \nUnfortunately, I believe it is the Endangered Species Act that is out \nof balance, not the people of my State of Idaho, and not their actions, \ninside the law, inside the Federal rules and regulations of the Forest \nService of course now being examined by the National Marine Fisheries.\n  In the coming days and weeks I will be working with Members of the \nSenate, and the Idaho delegation will be working to try to resolve this \nissue. Here is what the problem is in the short-term: National Marine \nFisheries must expedite that consultation, accepting the decision of \nthe Forest Service on some of these areas. I have asked the Clinton \nadministration to enact emergency regulations to resolve the problems \nbetween the two departments, the National Marine Fisheries and the \nForest Service. Rollie Schmitten is going to live up to his \n[[Page S1345]] deadline of January 31. I trust they will get that done.\n  Now, of course, in the long term, the legislation of reauthorization \nof the Endangered Species Act is what is critical and what has to be \ndone.\n  Well, did anybody lose their job today? The answer is no. In the last \nhour, the Justice Department asked for us a stay through the Forest \nService, and it was granted by the judge. We have 1 week's breathing \nroom.\n  But the reason I bring this, of course, is just to give you an idea \nof the kind of crisis, the frustration, the anger, the depression that \nthe citizens of my State went through. Men and women calling my office \ncrying, frightened that their very jobs would be destroyed and taken \naway from them because of a bureaucratic boondoggle? Absolutely. It is \ngoing on in my State of Idaho right now, it has gone on in other \nStates, and it will continue to go on as long as this Congress closes \nits eyes, turns its back, and walks away from the responsibility of \nreauthorizing the acts of Congress, the laws of the land, and in that \nprocess, reexamining whether they work or do not work, whether they \ncomply or are out of compliance with the intent of Congress and \nwhether, in fact, they truly address the needs of the American people \nand the wants, and that is to save plants and animals who are \nendangered. But we in the Senate know today that that is not the way \nthe act is working.\n  While for the short term, the Idaho congressional delegation has \nsolved an immediate crisis in Idaho, the clock ticks. What happens on \nFriday or Saturday of this week if these deadlines are not met, if \nthere is no reality to the human compassion that ought to be expressed \nby these agencies in carrying out the mandate of their laws or their \nregulations within the law?\n  I will continue to report to the Senate as the Idaho congressional \ndelegation and I continue to act to try to resolve this immediate \ncrisis. Mr. President, we have a responsibility in the U.S. Senate now \nto address the Endangered Species Act so that we can say once and for \nall, ``Yes, we're concerned about the protection of or the development \nof a mitigating plan to save a given species of plant or animal that \nmay be endangered. But while we are doing it, let us not endanger the \nlives or well-being of thousands of citizens across this country who, \nthrough no fault of their own, have fallen on the tracks of a Federal \nlaw that is out of control and the train that rides on those tracks now \nbears down upon them with the risk of destroying them.''\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Idaho and the \nSenator from Ohio, I have one additional amendment which the Senator \nfrom Iowa has joined me in offering. It is amendment No. 179, which is \nat the desk. Inasmuch as the Senator from Iowa is here and ready to \nspeak on the amendment, it may be that we could very quickly dispose of \nthat amendment.\n  I intend also to ask for a recorded vote on that amendment. That \namendment deals with the Consumer Price Index and the calculation of \nthe Consumer Price Index and a mandate required, or at least seeming \npublic mandate required, of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of at least \none prominent Member of Congress.\n  We are willing to discuss that, offer it, and seek a recorded vote, \nand follow the first recorded vote that has already been ordered, if \nthat would satisfy the desire and interests of the two Senators who are \nmanaging the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . CALCULATION OF THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System has maintained that the current Consumer Price \n     Index overstates inflation by as much as 50 percent.\n       (2) Other expert opinions on the Consumer Price Index range \n     from estimates of a modest overstatement to the possibility \n     of an understatement of the rate of inflation.\n       (3) Some leaders in the Congress have called for an \n     immediate change in the way in which the Consumer Price Index \n     is calculated.\n       (4) Changing the Consumer Price Index in the manner \n     recommended by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System would result in both reductions in Social Security \n     benefits and increases in income taxes.\n       (5) The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has \n     responsibility for the Consumer Price Index, has been working \n     to identify and correct problems with the way in which the \n     Consumer Price Index is now calculated.\n       (6) Calculation of the Consumer Price Index should be based \n     on sound economic principles and not on political pressure.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) a precipitous change in the calculation of the Consumer \n     Price Index that would result in an increase in income taxes \n     and a decrease in Social Security benefits is not the \n     appropriate way to resolve this issue; and\n       (2) any change in the calculation of the Consumer Price \n     Index should result from thoughtful study and analysis and \n     should be a result of a consensus reached by the experts, not \n     pressure exerted by politicians.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Harkin, from Iowa, \nwho will speak on this, had to leave the floor for a moment to take a \ntelephone call. Let me make a few comments on this amendment, which I \noffer on my behalf, on behalf of Senator Dodd, and on behalf of Senator \nHarkin.\n  This amendment deals with an issue that is technical but very \nimportant. The amendment deals with the Consumer Price Index. We saw \nabout a week ago a story in Washington, DC, in the press, that the \nchairman of the Federal Reserve Board came to the Congress and he \ntestified on one thing or another. In his testimony, he opined that the \nConsumer Price Index probably, in his judgment and in the judgment of \nthe Federal Reserve Board, actually overstates the rate of inflation by \nanywhere from one-half of 1 percent to 1.5 percent.\n  Shortly after the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board made that \nstatement, some others in Congress began to climb in and say, well, if \nthat is the case, if the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation, \nthen let us force the Bureau of Labor Statistics to get active and do \nsomething about it. In fact, one prominent Member of Congress indicated \nthat we will give them 30 days down at the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nto either change it or we will zero them out, get rid of them.\n  Well, Mr. President, here is the consequence of what seems like an \ninnocent sounding recommendation. If someone--the Fed--says we think \nthe Consumer Price Index actually overstates inflation, it does not \nsound like it means very much, does it. Leave aside for just a moment \nthe question of if that in fact is what the Fed thinks, if in fact that \nis what they believe, what on Earth has the Federal Reserve Board been \ndoing down there. They have increased interest rates six times because \ninflation rates were too high. We have low rates of inflation for 4 \nstraight years, and if inflation is overstated by 1.5 percent of the \nConsumer Price Index, that means the real rate of inflation is only 1.2 \npercent.\n  By what justification could these folks down at the Federal Reserve \nBoard be imposing on America a mandate of increased costs by higher \ninterest rates across the board? What justification could they have for \nthat?\n  Well, I will debate that another time. They have no justification. It \nis a wrongheaded policy that injures this country, puts the brakes on \nthe economy, and will send this country into a recession. The Fed, \nunfortunately, does not know what it is doing. What it is doing is the \nwrong thing for our country. But that is a debate for another day, and \na debate I have already had and one I will have again, I am sure.\n  The proposition is this. If you say that the Consumer Price Index \nreally overstates inflation, what are the consequences of that? Well, \nthe consequences are you are able to reduce the spending on Social \nSecurity because you have a smaller COLA adjustment on Social Security \nrecipients' cost-of-living adjustment. So you save money by not giving \nas much in a cost-of-living adjustment to those folks who live on \nSocial Security.\n  In fact, the estimates are we are talking around $27 billion, I \nbelieve, on the Social Security issue. If one assumes the Federal \nReserve Board's calculations, the decrease to Social Security \nrecipients would be very substantial. And if one assumes the Federal \nReserve Board's calculations, it also means that you have other \nconsequences in the Federal budget. And the Federal budget deficit, \nwhich the Federal Reserve Board should care about, is increased by \nthis.\n  So what the Senator from Connecticut, and the Senator from Iowa and I \nare concerned about is this discussion about this subject in the \ncontext of politics rather than science. The question of what is the \nConsumer Price Index and how should it be changed, if it should be \nchanged, is a technical question, to be sure.\n  Most of the discussions about whether the Consumer Price Index is \naccurate or not come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In fact, most \nof the information for any studies that exist come from the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics. So someone who sees this on a comment by the Chairman \nof the Fed to say, ``Let's change the Consumer Price Index immediately \nand if they don't do it, we will in 30 days zero them out,'' they are \nsaying we are going to impose a mandate, a political mandate on the \nBureau of Labor Statistics.\n  I say that is the wrong way to do things. We have developed a \nresolution, a sense of the Senate, that says a precipitous change in \nthe calculation of the Consumer Price Index that would result in both \nan increase in income taxes--and the reason for that is that the \npersonal exemption has to do with the Consumer Price Index. As the \nConsumer Price Index goes up, the personal exemption is indexed to it \nso that goes up. If it is shown not to go up so much, the personal \nexemption does not go up as much, and therefore one's taxes are \nincreased. So you have two consequences here. One is increased income \ntaxes and second is a lower Social Security payment by changing the \ncalculation of the Consumer Price Index.\n  But our sense-of-the-Senate resolution says a precipitous change in \nthe calculation of the Consumer Price Index that would result in an \nincrease in income taxes and a decrease in Social Security benefits is \nnot the appropriate way to resolve this issue. Any change in the \ncalculation of the Consumer Price Index should result from thoughtful, \nstudied analysis and should be a result of consensus reached by \nexperts, not pressure exerted by politicians.\n  Our point is we have had two major political figures seize on a \ncomment by the Chairman of the Fed to suggest we are going to impose a \nmandate on the bureaucracy to change the calculation of the Consumer \nPrice Index, and our point is this. This has consequences. Words have \nconsequences and so do actions, and actions to change the Consumer \nPrice Index for political purposes might well reduce the Federal \ndeficit but how is it done? By increasing taxes and by cutting Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  We would never have raised the subject in this context except that \nsome leading figures say this must be done and must be done now and \nsoon and, if not, we will zero out funding for the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics.\n  There is no evidence that what the Chairman of the Fed has said is \ncorrect. Some say the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation. Some \nsay it is about right. And there are some who will allege that it \nunderstates inflation through a series of five or six very complicated \nquestions that are debated aggressively among economists.\n  I am not here today to try to debate that or resolve that. I am only \nhere to say that the final lesson in what the Consumer Price Index \nought to be ought to be a lesson that we study from scientists and from \nthose who know \n[[Page S1347]] and from economists and others who do a thoughtful \nanalysis, not from pressure brought by politicians.\n  That is the issue, and that is why I hope we will have a vote on this \nand the vote will say that the Senate concurs: we do not believe a \nprecipitous change in the Consumer Price Index should result from \npolitical pressure. It ought to result from thoughtful analysis by \nthose who know and who study and who give us their expert \nrecommendations.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Iowa is in the Chamber, and I \nwould be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, might I make one other unanimous consent request while \nI am on my feet. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] asked to be \nincluded as a cosponsor of the amendment that I offered on the Federal \nReserve Board, and I would ask unanimous consent to achieve that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota for offering this amendment, for his thoughtful insight \ninto what some people in the Republican party over on the other side \nare calling a technical correction in the Consumer Price Index or CPI, \nour basic measure of the rate of inflation. I think that is what the \nleaders of the other body called it, a technical correction. Well, you \nknow, some people said ketchup was a vegetable once, too. These \ntechnical corrections at some time have very serious consequences.\n  So while you can call it a technical correction, it is nothing less \nthan two things. It is a stealth tax on the middle class, and it is a \ncut in Social Security benefits for the elderly, both of which I might \nadd are just the opposite of what my friends in the Republican Party \nhave said they want to do.\n  So I think this amendment would help my friends on the other side \nclear up the issue. It would make it clear that we do not in any way \nwant to put pressure on the independent Bureau of Labor Statistics to \nsomehow come up and rush through and make a finding on the basis of \npolitical pressure but that, indeed, it ought to be thought through \nvery carefully.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely right that this change in \nthe CPI has consequences, big consequences--about $21 billion in higher \ntaxes annually by the year 2000 and $27.5 billion cut in Social \nSecurity in that same year. And that has to do with the fact that when \nyou pay your income taxes, the personal deduction, the standard \ndeductions that we all get, that middle-income families get are all \nadjusted by the CPI, and so if you ratchet down that CPI, you may say, \nwell, it is technical, but it is a 1 percent reduction. And what that \nwould mean is that every year the amount that you could claim for \ndeductions in the standard deduction would be less, so you would pay \nmore in income taxes. And, as I said, after 5 years, the Federal \nReserve estimates about $21 billion in higher taxes. And that would \nmostly come from moderate and middle-income taxpayers.\n  Now, I wish to be as fair as I can, Mr. President. On the merits, \nthere may be--and I use the words ``may be''--an overestimation of \ninflation in the CPI statistics. This has been known for many years.\n  Now, the technical reasons are very complex, and the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics has and is accurately working on making adjustments. A \ncouple of small adjustments are planned for next month and a key change \nis scheduled to take effect in 1998.\n  And funds for part of a 6-year effort to improve the CPI were \napproved in the fiscal year 1995 Labor-HHS appropriations bill which I \nchaired and which was supported on both sides of the aisle.\n  I also want to point out, Mr. President, that in 1987 Congress \nrequired the BLS, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to set up an \nalternative CPI weighted for the elderly. We asked them to do that in \n1987 because the elderly pay much more for health care. And that CPI \nfor the elderly now shows a higher level of inflation for the elderly \nevery year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the Record \nan article that outlines the results of the experimental CPI authored \nby Nathan Amble and Ken Stewart in the May 1995 monthly Labor Review.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Labor Review, May 1995]\n\n             Experimental Price Index for Elderly Consumers\n\n                   (By Nathan Amble and Ken Stewart)\n\n       An experimental consumer price index for older Americans \n     rose somewhat faster than each of two published BLS Consumer \n     Price Indexes; as might be expected, expenditures for medical \n     care accounted almost entirely for this difference.\n       The Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics measures the average change in prices over time \n     for a fixed market basket of goods and services for two \n     population groups. The CPI for All Urban Consumer (CPI-U) \n     represents the spending habits of about 80 percent of the \n     population of the United States. The CPI for Urban Wage \n     Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) is a subset of the CPI-U \n     and represents about 32 percent of the total U.S. population.\n       The 1987 amendments to the Older Americans Act of 1965 \n     directed BLS to develop an experimental index for a third \n     population of consumers: those 62 years of age and older. In \n     its 1988 report to Congress, BLS observed that from December \n     1982 to December 1987, the experimental consumer price index \n     for older Americans rose slightly faster than the CPI-U and \n     CPI-W.\\1\\ (See table 1.)\n     \\1\\Footnotes to appear at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This article updates the analysis of the behavior of the \n     experimental index for older Americans for the period from \n     December 1987 through December 1993. Over this 6-year period, \n     the experimental price index rose 28.7 percent, slightly more \n     than the increases of 26.3 percent for the CPI-U and 25.5 \n     percent for the CPI-W.\n\n\n                   methodology, data, and limitations\n\n       Although the study discussed in this article indicates a \n     higher overall inflation rate for older Americans compared \n     with the rates for the official CPI population groups, any \n     conclusions drawn should be used with caution because of the \n     various limitations inherent in the methodology.\n       Expenditure weights. For each CPI population group, item \n     strata are weighted according to their importance in the \n     spending patterns of the population. The population of older \n     Americans used for the experimental price index was defined \n     to be all urban noninstitutionalized consumer units that were \n     either\n       1. unattached individuals who were at least 62 years of \n     age; or\n       2. members of families whose reference person (as defined \n     in the Consumer Expenditure Survey) or spouse was at least 62 \n     years of age; or\n       3. members of groups of unrelated individuals living \n     together who pool their resources to meet their living \n     expenses and whose reference person was at least 62 years of \n     age.\n       In the 1982-84 Consumer Expenditure Survey, which is used \n     as the source of expenditure weights in the current CPI, 19 \n     percent of the total sample of eligible urban consumer units \n     (3,135 out of 16,500) met this definition. Because the number \n     of consumer units used for\n      determining weights in the experimental index was relatively \n     small, expenditure weights used in the construction of the \n     experimental price index have a higher sampling error than \n     those used for the larger populations.\n       For each population group, the base expenditure weight of \n     any component represents the actual expenditure on that \n     component in the base period. The relative importance of any \n     component is its expenditure weight (updated for changes in \n     relative prices) and represents the proportion of that weight \n     to total expenditures for the population. The relative \n     importances of selected components for each of the three \n     population groups are shown in table 2 for December 1987, the \n     first month of the study.\n       Areas and outlets priced. The experimental consumer price \n     index for older consumers is a weighted average of price \n     changes for the same set of item strata collected from the \n     same sample of urban areas as are used in calculating the \n     CPI-U and CPI-W.\n       Retail outlets are selected for pricing in the CPI based on \n     data reported in a separate survey representing all urban \n     households. The experimental index also uses the same retail \n     outlet sample. Thus, the outlets selected may not be \n     representative of the places where older persons purchase \n     their goods and services.\\2\\\n       Items priced. As with retail outlets, a major limitation of \n     the experimental index is that the categories of items to be \n     priced are selected using expenditure weights calculated from \n     the expenditure surveys for the urban population. As a \n     result, the specific item classes selected for each stratum \n     may not be representative of those classes used by the older \n     population.\n       Prices collected. A final source of uncertainty about the \n     appropriateness of using the CPI-U prices for the index of \n     the older population concerns the availability of discount \n     prices for older Americans. For example, senior-citizen \n     discount rates are used in the CPI-U in proportion to their \n     use by the urban population as a whole. To the extent that \n     senior-citizen discounts take the form of a percentage \n     discount from the regular \n     [[Page S1348]] price, this may not be a problem. If, however, \n     the discount is not a fixed percentage of the price, the \n     scarcity of senior-citizen discount prices in the current CPI \n     could lead to error in the experimental index.\n       Because of the preceding limitations, any conclusions drawn \n     from the analyses presented in this article should be treated \n     as tentative.\n\n\n                   relative behavior of price indexes\n\n       Table 3 gives the annual price changes in the all-items \n     CPI-U, CPI-W, and experimental price index during the period \n     1988-93. Table 4 shows the behavior of these three indexes at \n     the major component levels during the same period.\n       Over the 6-year period from December 1987 through December \n     1993, the reweighted experimental price index for older \n     Americans rose 28.7 percent. This compares with increases of \n     26.3 percent for the CPI-U and 25.5 percent for the CPI-W.\n       Examining the indexes in more detail, we see that medical \n     care prices during the period rose slightly more than twice \n     as fast as the average for all items in each population \n     group. Because the elderly typically spend more on medical \n     care than does the\n      population as a whole (see table 2), the medical care \n     component accounted for most of the difference between the \n     experimental index and either of CPI-U and CPI-W. In the \n     experimental index, this component increased 59.4 percent \n     during the period 1988-93. By contrast, inflation for the \n     medical care component of the CPI-U was 53.3 percent and \n     that for the CPI-W was 53.3 percent.\n       The price change for each major expenditure component \n     varied by population because the expenditure weights of the \n     items that comprised the major components varied among the \n     three population groups the indexes served. The expenditure \n     weight that an item had in a particular population reflected \n     the importance of that item as a proportion of the total \n     expenditures of that population. For example, the relatively \n     high expenditure weights of the medical care component of the \n     experimental index may largely be attributed to the \n     differences in the nature of the demand for medical care \n     services by the elderly, compared with the demand for such \n     services by all urban consumers or by urban wage earners and \n     clerical workers. Within the medical care component, the \n     elderly had larger out-of-pocket costs relative to both of \n     the other groups chiefly because those groups had employer-\n     provided health care benefits more readily available to them. \n     An analysis of the relative importance of the various \n     subcomponents making up the medical care component for the \n     elderly and for all urban consumers indicates that older \n     Americans devote a substantially larger share of their \n     medical care budget to physicians' services, followed by \n     hospital room stays and commercial health insurance coverage.\n       Of the seven major expenditure components, the apparel \n     category registered the smallest price change for all three \n     population groups over the 1988-93 period.\n       Within the transportation component, public transportation \n     items such as airline fare, intercity bus fare, intercity \n     train fare, and taxi fare had higher relative importance for \n     the elderly than for all urban consumers. These items \n     contributed to the observed overall higher inflation rates in \n     the transportation component of the experimental index.\n       Like medical care, another expenditure component that rose \n     significantly in all three indexes during the study period \n     was the ``other goods and services'' category. However, \n     unlike medical care, this component recorded the smallest \n     increase in the experimental price index (41.8 percent), \n     compared with the CPI-U (47.0 percent) and the CPI-W (46.2 \n     percent). The reason for the lesser rise could be found in \n     differences in the composition of the three populations. For \n     instance, the CPI-U and CPI-W, with their relatively larger \n     concentration of younger people, had a significantly higher \n     relative importance for college tuition, which increased \n     faster than the average of all items in each year of the \n     study. In addition, the populations of all urban consumers \n     and urban wage earners and clerical workers spend \n     proportionately more for tobacco and other smoking products, \n     which have also typically increased faster in price than the \n     ``other goods and services'' component, of which they are a \n     subcomponent. These items have thus contributed to the faster \n     rise in the ``other goods and services'' component of the \n     CPI-U and CPI-W relative to the experimental price index for \n     older Americans.\n                       cost-of-living adjustments\n\n       Adjustments to Social Security Benefits are currently based \n     on the percentage change in the CPI-W, measured from the \n     average of the third quarter of one year to the third quarter \n     of the succeeding year.\n       While the Senate Special Committee on Aging stipulated that \n     the current study cover persons 62 years of age and older, \n     this population is not likely to be the most appropriate one \n     for defining and developing an index for use in indexing \n     Social Security benefits.\n       The reason is two-fold. First, many Social Security \n     Beneficiaries are younger than 62 years and receive benefits \n     because they are surviving spouses or minor children of \n     covered workers or because they are disabled. The spending \n     patterns of this younger group are excluded in the weights \n     for the experimental index for older Americans. Second, a \n     substantial number of persons 62 years of age and older--\n     especially those 62 to 64 years--do not receive Social \n     Security benefits at all. Although these older consumers are \n     included in the population covered by the reweighted \n     experimental index, they presumably should be excluded from \n     an index designed to reflect the experience of Social \n     Security pensioners. In short, an index designed specifically \n     to measure price changes for Social Security beneficiaries--\n     that is, one that excludes older persons who do not receive \n     benefits, but includes younger persons who receive survival \n     and disability benefits--might well show price movements that \n     differ significantly from those of the experimental index set \n     out in this article.\n\n   TABLE 2.--COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELATIVE IMPORTANCES OF SELECTED   \n           COMPONENTS OF CONSUMER PRICE INDEXES, DECEMBER 1987

Price Indexes--the Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), \n     Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), \n     and experimental index for Americans 62 years of age and \n     older--for the period December 1987 through December 1993. \n     Analysis of the relative behavior of the three indexes at the \n     all-items level reveals that the experimental index rose \n     slightly faster than the two published indexes.\n       The experimental price index, reweighted to incorporate the \n     spending patterns of older consumers, behaves more like the \n     CPI-U than the CPI-W. This is to be expected, because the \n     CPI-U comprises the expenditures of all urban consumers, \n     including those 62 years of age and over. The CPI-W, on the \n     other hand, is limited to the spending patterns of families \n     of wage earners and of clerical workers and, therefore, \n     specifically excludes the experience of families whose \n     primary source of income is from retirement pensions.\n       As an estimate of the inflation rate experienced by older \n     Americans, the experimental index has several limitations. \n     One of these is that the samples from which expenditure \n     weights for the index were calculated are substantially \n     smaller than those used in either the CPI-U or the CPI-W. \n     This means that the experimental price index is subject to \n     larger sampling errors than either of the two official \n     indexes.\n       To produce a more precise CPI for older Americans, sample \n     sizes would need to be strengthened for the Consumer \n     Expenditure Survey to reflect the spending habits of the \n     elderly more accurately. In addition, the point-of-purchase \n     survey and the pricing surveys would need to be improved to \n     reflect which retail outlets and items should be sampled for \n     older Americans. These improvements in the sample design \n     could yield altogether different results from those obtained \n     in the study described in this article. Finally, it should be \n     noted that the medical care component of the CPI has a \n     substantially larger relative weight in the experimental \n     index than in the CPI-U or CPI-W. As a result, this component \n     of the experimental index tends to have a larger impact on \n     the elderly than it does on either all urban consumers or \n     urban wage earners and clerical workers.\n                        [[Page S1349]] Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\Charles C. Mason, ``An Analysis of the Rates of Inflation \n     Affecting Older Americans Based on an Experimental Reweighted \n     Consumer Price Index,'' report presented to Congress, June \n     1988. During the period from December 1982 through December \n     1987, the CPI-U rose 18.2 percent, the CPI-W increased 16.5 \n     percent, and the experimental index for older Americans grew \n     19.5 percent. Over the 11-year period from December 1982 \n     through December 1993, the CPI-U rose 49.4 percent, the CPI-W \n     increased 46.2 percent, and the experimental CPI for older \n     Americans grew 53.8 percent.\n     \\2\\The sample size of the current point-of-purchase survey is \n     not adequate to determine whether older Americans typically \n     shop in different types of outlets from those frequented by \n     the general population.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So, while some say the CPI is overestimating inflation, \nwe now know that for the elderly the CPI underestimates inflation. So \nif you are now going to arbitrarily cut back the CPI with this sort of \ntechnical correction, by 1 or 1.5 percent, without some further study \nand analysis and finely tuning it, not only will you have the increase \nin taxes that we talked about, you will have the Social Security cuts. \nIt will hit the elderly the hardest, because they rely most heavily on \nSocial Security for their basic needs. And on top of that their costs \nfor prescription drugs and Medicare and their supplemental insurance \nand things like that continue to rise much faster than the basic rate \nof inflation.\n  I have not addressed myself directly to the issue that Senator Dorgan \nspoke about, but he is absolutely right. This idea of somehow \nthreatening the Bureau of Labor Statistics to come up with the desired \nresults within 30 days or their funding would be cut off was a threat \nmade by the Speaker of the House. He was quoted widely in newspapers as \nsaying he would cut off their funding if they did not come up with the \nresults in 30 days.\n  I hope the Speaker will reflect upon his words and come up with a \nmore moderate statement, because efforts to threaten professional staff \nwith budget cuts if they do not come up with the results desired by \nelected officials I think is very dangerous. We need nonpolitical, \nobjective career professionals producing statistics that Government and \nthe private sector use to develop their policies. I think we have that \nnow. If each party that wins an election puts in people who only give \nthe answers they want regarding economic statistics rather than the \nbest professionally developed figures possible, then I think we are \ngoing to be in real big trouble. Fortunately, I hope we are going to \nback off this so-called dynamic scoring, the justifications that were \nused to quadruple the public debt in the 1980's. I think they are \nbacking off of that. I am hopeful now my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle will back off from any attempt to improperly pressure the \nBureau of Labor Statistics.\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Dorgan for his amendment. I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor. We must maintain the highest professional standards for \nstatistical services in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces \nthe CPI and other statistics on which the Federal Government and our \nentire economy depend. They must continue to operate without any \npolitical interference.\n  I urge all Senators to support the amendment of Senator Dorgan. \nAgain, first, to send a clear signal we are not going to politically \ninterfere; and, second, that we need to proceed very cautiously on this \nto get the best information possible for any future adjustments in the \nCPI; and, third, to state clearly that any adjustments in the CPI, of \ncourse, ought not to lead to arbitrary cuts in Social Security or taxes \non the middle class.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, if I may, in the midst of this interesting \ndebate, I would like to return the focus of the debate to S. 1 itself; \nto unfunded mandates, to the impact that those mandates have had on \nState and on local governments, and to the urgent necessity of seeing \nto it that this bill is passed and it becomes law.\n  I have gotten a great deal of correspondence from local governments \nand the State of Washington on the subject of unfunded mandates. But I \nwould like to start with one the focus of which is a little bit \ndifferent than many of the particular complaints about unfunded \nmandates.\n  The mayor of the city of Kennewick wrote to me and said:\n\n       Congress needs to understand the long range impacts of its \n     actions when it passes amendments [to legislation].\n\n  I agree. But I am inclined to think that the mayor of Kennewick could \nhave gone considerably further. And I also reflect on why it is that a \nmayor of a city some 2,500 miles from here should have to say this to \nus. Of course, the Congress of the United States should have to \nunderstand the long-range impacts of the laws that it passes. That is a \nresponsibility we ought to take on ourselves, not one we should have to \nbe reminded of by mayors or Governors or county commissioners. Yet it \nhas been my experience that very frequently we attempt to avoid \nunderstanding long-range impacts in passing feel-good legislation, \nsometimes legislation for valid social purposes but social purposes \nwhich we are unwilling to fund.\n  In my case, I think I would make the statement somewhat stronger than \nthe mayor of Kennewick does. I would revise it to say: ``Congress needs \nto be responsible for the long-range impacts of legislation that it \npasses.''\n  No group of individuals is likely to be responsible when they can do \nsomething that pleases other groups or other individuals without any \nconsequences for the cost of pleasing those individuals or groups. When \none separates the authority to make requirements, to pass mandates, to \nset policy, from the responsibility to pay for the consequences of \nthose actions, one inevitably is led to irresponsibility. And it is \nresponsibility and accountability that this legislation is all about.\n  In dealing with this legislation I, in common with many of my \ncolleagues, have asked my local governments to report to me the impact \nof mandates which we have already imposed on them without understanding \nthe consequences and without taking responsibility for the \nconsequences. I should like to share a few of them with my colleagues \nand with the record here this afternoon.\n  The mayor of Colfax, WA, wrote to me that the money spent to comply \nwith Federal mandates--and I am now quoting him--\n\n       * * * no matter how well intentioned, will inhibit the \n     city's ability to provide a pump station to supply the \n     community hospital, provide wellhead protection for our \n     primary water source, and to repair a critical reservoir. \n     These are only a few of the most important projects that may \n     be delayed or not completed.\n\n  It does seem to me to be self-evident that the citizens of Colfax \nought to be allowed to determine whether those are higher priorities \nthan priorities imposed upon them by Members of Congress in a general \nfashion all across the country. And to a very significant degree that \nis what this debate is all about.\n  The board of county commissioners of San Juan County wrote to me to \nsay:\n\n       The excessive testing and monitoring required by \n     [environmental mandates] puts such a burden on the limited \n     financial capabilities of small water systems that they don't \n     have the money left to maintain their systems! The effect is \n     greater and greater cost with no improvement in service or \n     public safety.\n\n  This particular letter, of course, applies to the Safe Drinking Water \nAct, a subject on which this Senate debated in the last Congress and \ndid, in fact, remove at least a number of unjustified, unfunded \nmandates.\n  Unfortunately, the Congress as a whole was not successful in passing \namendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, and those mandates remain to \nthis day in full force and effect.\n  The mayor of Tenino says that the city has been:\n\n     forced to shift revenue desperately needed for social \n     services and programs to pay for the costs associated with \n     [mandates]. Although we have not raised taxes to pay for \n     these services, this action will soon become our only \n     recourse.\n\n  This is a small rural town, the jobs of many of whose citizens have \nbeen affected by grave restrictions on harvests in our national and in \nour private forests, where unemployment is high or where extra money is \nhard to come by.\n  In the city of Langley, the mayor says that compliance with the Safe \nDrinking Water Act alone will cost each water user an additional $54.\n  The mayor of South Bend, a very poor community in monetary terms, at \nleast, of less than 2,500 people, wrote in to say that:\n\n       [[Page S1350]] Last year our water department was in \n     compliance with every phase of its operation while serving \n     approximately 900 customers. Today, we are considered out of \n     compliance and the costs to bring us back in with the Clean \n     Water Act by 1996 will cost us over a million dollars. How we \n     are going to finance this, God only knows.\n\n  The clerk of the town of Fairfield wrote to say:\n\n       The effect [of mandates] is, in one word, Disaster! * * * \n     These mandates will do the same thing to small communities as \n     they'll do to small businesses--they will bankrupt them. \n     There is just no way to come up with the dollars these \n     mandates will require. Congress has to come to the \n     realization that the taxpayer's purse is not a bottomless \n     pit.\n\n  The chairman of the county commissioners of Asotin County described \nFederal mandates by saying:\n\n       Frustration is the real issue I guess. We do not know with \n     any degree of certainty which way to go. A small county with \n     a limited revenue base, a population of only 18,000 people \n     and a per capita income of nearly $17,000 has very few \n     alternatives.\n\n  Finally, the mayor of a very small town, Washtucna, wrote in to say:\n\n       * * * any federal mandate legislation that requires a local \n     government to comply with, but allows no funds to implement \n     these mandates, places small communities in a financial \n     crisis. In fact, many cases could be prohibitive to the point \n     to force some small towns into bankruptcy and \n     unincorporation. Many of the federally mandated regulations \n     have little or no positive consequence to small rural farm \n     communities and therefore are not beneficial to a community \n     that can ill afford the added tax. If it were possible for \n     our small community to afford an additional tax, we would \n     prefer a new water supply tank, new water lines, sidewalks \n     and street improvements.\n\n  I am absolutely certain that mayors of small towns and large towns, \ncounty commissioners and State governments, have written to each and \nevery Member of this body with similar stories. They come down to one \nmajor point: We in our communities want to set our own priorities. We \nare not necessarily objecting to national priorities or national \nmandates. But if you Members of Congress and members of the executive \nwish to impose these mandates on us, please pay for them.\n  By an overwhelming majority, these men and women who constitute our \nState and local governments have written to us and called to us to ask \nus to pass this bill. My only fear with respect to this bill, with all \nof the admiration I have for the two Senators who are managing it, is \nthat it is likely to be a disappointment to these local officials \nbecause, of course, it is not retroactive. We are having enough \ndifficulty with the bill as it is. It would be impossible to pass it if \nit were retroactive. So it will not solve a single one of the specific \nproblems created by mandates already in existence. Nor will this bill \nguarantee that there are no further unfunded mandates. It will still be \npossible, even if this bill becomes law, to impose an unfunded mandate \nof a considerable nature on our local communities if we simply waive \nthe point of order which is appropriate to present in the case of a \nbill carrying with an unfunded mandate, and we will be able to grant \nthat waiver by a mere 51-vote majority here in the U.S. Senate, a \nsimple majority here and in the House of Representatives.\n  Does this mean that the bill is of little or no meaning? No, Mr. \nPresident, I do not think that is the case. I think this is an \nimportant piece of legislation because at the very least, that waiver \nvote will mean that Members who vote for the waiver must be conscious \nof the fact that they are imposing an unfunded mandate. In most cases, \nthey will have a fiscal note attached to it that will indicate just how \nmuch that unfunded mandate is likely to cost. And they therefore will \nbe accountable to the people of our States, our counties, and our local \ncommunities for having imposed that unfunded mandate. They will lack \nthe excuse that they did not know what they did. Those mandates will be \nimposed consciously and deliberately.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, I think while unfunded mandates will \nnot end in the Congress, people being what they are, they will probably \nbe somewhat less frequent in the future. If this Congress succeeds in \npassing some of the priorities which led to this Congress having such a \ndifferent face as its predecessors and removing at least some of the \npresent unfunded mandate burdens, we will have more of our States and \ncommunities able to set their own priorities in the way which has been \nso important in the development of the United States of America \nthroughout its entire history.\n  So I know that the sponsors would like an even stronger bill. I \nbelieve that they are to be congratulated on doing as much as they have \ndone in connection with this bill. While I find the other debates which \nare going on in connection with this bill, those on consumer price \nindexes, on the metric system, and on the Federal Reserve Board to be \nmost interesting, it seems to me at least in the third week of debate \nupon this bill, on this charter of independence, on this liberation for \nour States and local governments, that the time is nigh on us that we \nshould deal squarely and directly with the subject matter of this bill, \nthat we should pass it and settle any possible minor differences with \nthe House of Representatives, send it to the President, and liberate \nour States and local governments from the immense burden of unfunded \nmandates, at least as far as the future is concerned.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we turn to \namendment No. 190, the amendment that is in the form of a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution, offered by Senator Harkin, at this time and lay the \namendment now pending aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will speak briefly on the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution offered to this body. I do it because last year I \noffered an amendment to the balanced budget amendment that would have \nexempted Social Security. I did not prevail at that time.\n  There has been, since that time, a significant amount of debate on \nthe balanced budget amendment. And without exception, everyone who has \nbeen asked what should happen to Social Security in relation to the \nbalanced budget amendment has said ``leave it alone''--Democrats and \nRepublicans, the Democratic leaders, Republican leaders, and even those \nnew leaders, like Speaker Gingrich, have stated Social Security should \nnot be part of the balanced budget amendment.\n  I felt it was appropriate that I speak on this legislation offered by \nthe Senator from Iowa, because I have held a press conference earlier \non saying that I am a supporter of the balanced budget amendment. But I \nam going to have everyone stick to what they have said: The balanced \nbudget amendment should exempt Social Security. Why? We have gone to a \nlot of trouble to make Social Security an independent agency.\n  They are in the process of now appointing the board of directors, in \neffect, of that agency, this new Social Security agency. Its funds will \nno longer be part of the general funds of this country. The program \nshould stand or fall on its own merits. This year, there will be about \na $70 billion surplus in the Social Security fund. By the year 2002, \nthe surplus will reach about $800 billion.\n  I had the pleasure of serving with Senators Danforth and Kerry on the \nentitlement commission. I know--we all know--that Social Security is \nsomething we must watch very closely to make sure it is actuarially \ncorrect and sound. I repeat that Social Security should rise and fall \non its own merits. If we had to pick a contract with America, the \noriginal, the most important contract with America, has been the Social \nSecurity system.\n  Mr. President, I will speak more at length about this when the \namendment comes up. But as a young boy, one of the first things I \nremember about Government is that my grandmother could not walk from \nhere to that wall, as she was always infirm, but her only independence \nwas she got what she referred to as her old age pension check. I was a \nlittle boy and did not realize that Social Security was a new program \nat that time. It gave my grandmother, who was born in England, \nindependence and some security.\n  I want to make sure that my children and my children's children have \nthe ability to enjoy the benefits of Social Security. I do not know \nwhether this sense-of-the-Senate resolution will pass or not. We all \nknow that sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, in the overall scheme of \nlegislative activities, are not the most important things. But they do \nsend a message. I think we should send a message to the American \npeople \n[[Page S1351]] that we are going to try to save Social Security, and \nthis is a prelude to the amendment that will be offered by this \nSenator, Senators Conrad, Dorgan, Harkin, and Feinstein, at the time \nthe balanced budget amendment is brought up.\n  The Social Security program we have in America is a simple, binding \ncontract. Individuals collect Social Security payments after paying \ninto a trust fund with their employer over a period of years. I want to \nmake sure, Mr. President, that the Social Security trust fund is a \ntrust fund and not a slush fund. We should not be able to use the \nmoneys out of Social Security to pay for highways in New Hampshire or \nhighways in Nevada. We should not be able to use the Social Security \ntrust fund to pay for subsidies for farmers in Iowa or in Missouri. \nThose moneys that we collect into this trust fund should be used only \nfor Social Security recipients, and that is all.\n  When I practiced law, I had a trust fund that I set up. I had to do \nthat; we were required by the rules of the bar association. If I had a \ncheck that came for settling a case, as an example, the money went into \nthe trust fund and I had to be very careful what I did with those \nmoneys. It was different than moneys that were in my general account \nthat I could use to pay rent and salaries of my employees. I could not \nuse that trust fund money to pay anything other than what was allowed \nby law. If I did anything else, I violated that trust that was \nestablished, and then I could be disbarred or even criminally \nprosecuted. So the Social Security trust fund, I believe, Mr. \nPresident, should be treated the same way.\n  Congress has an obligation to uphold its end of the contract. So this \nunique, binding contract upon which millions depend should be \nprotected, and it should not be a giveaway or an entitlement, even \nthough it is not and even though people lump it into the entitlement \ncategory.\n  I congratulate my friend, the junior Senator from Iowa, for offering \nthis sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I hope that all Senators will give \nthis very serious consideration, as I know they will. We understand \nthat this is a prelude to the real debate that will take place, which \nwill be substantive law, and that is to exempt Social Security from the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1345-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT OF A NEW CIA DIRECTOR\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition this afternoon \nto speak briefly about the pending appointment of a new Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and how we ought to structure a new term to \nreally strengthen that position and, in effect, professionalize the \nposition of Director of Central Intelligence.\n  I have talked to a number of my colleagues about the idea of \nlegislation which would create a 10-year term for the Director of \nCentral Intelligence, just as the Director of the FBI has a 10-year \nterm. That legislation for the FBI was enacted relatively recently to \nstrengthen the hand of the Director and to give independence and \nstrength to that position.\n  It is my view, based on the experience that I have had on the \nIntelligence Committee--and I now serve as chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee--that there is a real need for additional \nstrength in the position of the Director, as we have seen what has \nhappened to the CIA with the Aldrich Ames case, and as we take a look \nat the role of the Central Intelligence Agency and the national \nsecurity interests of the United States into the foreseeable future.\n  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, I believe, has to \ncome to that position in the Central Intelligence Agency, in that \nunique culture there, and say to the establishment: Look, I am going to \nbe here longer than anybody else who was here, and it is my \nresponsibility to do what is necessary to correct the problems of the \nagency and to do what is necessary to reorder the priorities and set \nthe agency on a course which will protect the security interests of the \nUnited States.\n  We had the threat assessment hearings the week before last where the \nDirector, James Woolsey, testified about the threats to the United \nStates and responded, to some extent, about the Aldrich Ames case. \nThere is no doubt that the unique culture of the CIA--I prefer to call \nit their ``unique culture,'' rather than the slang expression the ``old \nboy's network''--was at work in allowing Aldrich Ames to stay in a \nposition where he could abuse the trust of the CIA and really do great \ndamage to the United States' national security interest, even though \nthere were many signs which should have led to his ouster. He failed a \nlie detector test, he was living beyond his means, he was drunk on \nduty, he had classified documents, he visited foreign agencies and \nforeign embassies without any justifiable reason.\n Many of the CIA contacts were killed as a result of what he had done. \nMany were placed in jeopardy. And that should have been corrected long \nbefore it finally came to light.\n\n  I believe that if we had a Director who had tenure, 10 years, in \neffect, being able to say, ``I am going to be here longer than the \npeople I am confronting with,'' that kind of strength would do a great \ndeal to enhance our national security.\n  We are facing some very perilous times. People ask, is there a real \nrole for the Central Intelligence Agency? Based on the experience I \nhave had on the Intelligence Oversight Committee, and now as chairman \nof that committee, I say, absolutely ``yes.''\n  We are looking at some very critical intelligence operations in \nassessing, for example, what is happening with North Korea with their \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons. I, frankly, have grave reservations \nabout the agreement which exempts the North Koreans from inspection on \nthe fuel rods for some 5 years, which is the best way to tell what they \nare doing with nuclear weapons. And as the hearing the week before last \nwith Director Woolsey showed, the North Koreans now have the capacity \nto hit Alaska. The North Koreans are working with Iran on ballistic \nmissile tests. When asked what is the potential for reaching the \ncontinental United States, nobody could give assurances that that is \nnot an imminent problem.\n  When you take a look at the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the old \nSoviet Union, there are real problems to see to it that organized crime \nin Russia does not take over and place those weapons at the disposal of \nrogue nations. When you take a look at the role of CIA in terrorism or \ndrugs or economy issue, where many intelligence agencies of government \nhelp the trade deficit, there is a vital role in the intelligence \nagency.\n  There has to be reform, first, of not having a repeat of the Aldrich \nAmes case and doing the job of the future.\n  I intended to introduce this legislation and to comment on it this \nafternoon and not to unduly interrupt the flow of this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1351-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1351-S1356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 195\n\n              (Purpose: To propose a substitute amendment)\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending being \namendments will be set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 195.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  (Mr. INHOFE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this amendment--and I do not want to scare \nanybody who may be watching and listening to this and I will give my \nreasons for submitting this amendment--this amendment is the old S. 993 \nthat we brought out last year. I wanted \n[[Page S1352]] it to be on file and be available to be considered if we \nreach a point where that might be necessary. But I hasten to add \nimmediately that, at least the way we are going right now, I do not \nthink that will be necessary.\n  The situation we had gotten into here on the floor last week was \nsuch--and I will not go through all of what led up to it, but it was at \na point where the majority leader filed cloture and did not have the \nvotes to invoke cloture. There were some 117 amendments that had been \nput in from both sides of the aisle--mainly, about two to one, from the \nDemocratic side, but from both sides of the aisle--and we found \nourselves in a situation where it looked as though there might not be \nany move out of that parliamentary situation that we were in.\n  What would we do in that situation? What had happened was that S. 993 \nthat came out last year with approval by the big seven, and we were \nhappy to get it to the floor, but the situation that developed was we \ncould not get it through last year.\n  Over the holidays, with the changed political climate, it was \ndetermined that what the House was liable to do and the movement that \nwe would have to make toward what the House might do to enable a Senate \nbill to have a chance at passage meant that S. 993 should be amended or \nchanged and somewhat toughened up. Now that was done with S. 1, using \nS. 993 as the basic structure from which to start.\n  The situation we found ourselves in, though, last week, the \nparliamentary situation, was that I could see the possibility that \nmaybe nothing was going to move. S. 1 had generated some opposition for \nvarious reasons. Cloture, which was filed, could not be invoked. We had \nthe vote on that. And there we sat in basically a stalemate.\n  I am committed to getting through unfunded mandate legislation. I do \nnot want anyone to think that I am not.\n  But I would rather, if we got ourselves into another quagmire like \nthat, I just want S. 993 refiled as a potential amendment--and I say \npotential; I am not planning to bring it up--but I want it filed so \nthat if we reach another situation like that--and I hope we do not--\nthat we would have that as a fallback position which would be better \nthan getting nothing through; certainly much better, because we all \nviewed S. 993 last year as being fine legislation.\n  I understand where the Governors and the County Commissioners, \nmayors, and so on are coming from now in support of S. 1. It is tougher \nfrom their standpoint. But it also has some opposition.\n  Now, what would I foresee as a situation that might develop where we \nmight want to drop back? Obviously, there are a number of different \nthings that could happen on that. If we wound up with a filibuster on \nS. 1, which I do not anticipate we will, but if there were some \nprovisions voted in here on the Senate floor that may be unpalatable, \nthen we might have something like that required.\n  The amendment that I am putting in or will put in today and another \none after this one and probably a couple more tomorrow morning address \nvery substantive changes in the bill, procedures in the bill that I \nthink should be corrected. They were things we were not able to bring \nup in the committee because of the rush to get it to the floor, which \nwas another situation we talked about earlier today for a little while.\n  But you have several other concerns that do address specifically how \nthis bill would operate, and I think those are important things to be \nconsidered. Those are not show stoppers, as I see it. Failure to put \nthose things in are not basically things that would require us to go \nback to S. 993.\n  But let me just bring up some of the amendments that have been put in \nor proposed, some from the other side, as a matter of fact, some \nRepublican-proposed amendments, such as judicial review.\n  Now, I think if judicial review was lodged against this where anyone \nwho felt that the estimate on a particular proposal was not adequate \nand they would have the right in that case to file a case in Federal \ncourt and in effect stop legislation in its tracks, if judicial review \nwas put in and passed, to me would be a way of stopping almost all \nlegislation or a very high percentage of legislation that comes before \nthe Senate. So I think if judicial review came in, was voted in here, \nthis would result in such concern that I think--I am the last one that \nis going to threaten a filibuster--but I think that would cause a \ngreat, great deal of concern.\n  Now, another one that is coming up that would be very controversial, \nand I understand is going to be called up, were amendments that were \nproposed dealing with motor-voter, as it is called. There is a lot of \npassion involved with motor-voter, as we know from the very extended \ndebate that took place on the Senate floor when motor-voter was put in \nlast year. That would draw serious opposition.\n  Another one, a supermajority point of order requiring a 60-vote point \nof order. In other words, 60 votes would be required to grant a waiver \nto proceed with a bill. Now that sounds great, because it says, well, \nyou are getting a supermajority of the Senate. But it does something \nelse. It puts a great deal of power in the minority if you can garner \n41 votes.\n  I do not want to see us get into a situation where we would have, in \neffect, a tyranny of the minority.\n  We had another one that would be a very, very important amendment, if \nbrought up and if possibly passed, one that we would have to really \ntake very, very seriously, and that is an amendment that I understand \nmay be proposed which would extend the application of the act to past \nmandates as well as current mandates.\n If we did that, I do not know whether we would be getting into \ntrillion dollar estimates and funding requirements if we passed that \nwith no sorts of other restrictions on it than those I am aware of at \nthis time. That is another one that would be a real threat to passage \nof this bill.\n\n  Now, I am not saying any one of these by itself would be a complete \nshow stopper and block to passage of the bill. The reason I put S. 993 \nback in is to cover a combination of possibilities. Say that some of \nthe corrections we wanted to put in committee are voted down here, and \nsay that some of these amendments that I understand are going to be put \nin--I do not believe they have been put in yet--amendments on the \nRepublican side that deal with the things that I just mentioned such as \n60-vote point of order and the motor-voter and judicial review and the \nretroactivity. Say that several of these things passed. I think in that \nsituation the view of S. 1 would change rather dramatically, and I \nmight add, probably on the Republican side as well as on the Democratic \nside.\n  I wanted to point out the possibilities just to point out the reason \nwhy I am putting S. 993 back in, as a possible substitute amendment. It \nwould be a fallback in case we have some of the dire things I have \ntalked about happen, and got into a situation here we could not get out \nof, which we thought we were in last week when I mentioned the \npossibility of this. I am putting it back in, but do not plan to bring \nit up at this time.\n  I think we are in a whole different situation than we were in last \nweek because last week we were faced with a situation where cloture \ncould not be invoked. The votes were not there. There were great \nconcerns about S. 1. There were some 117 amendments that were filed in \nadvance of the cloture vote, because if cloture would happen to be \ninvoked then amendments cannot be put in. Cloture was defeated. The \nnumber of provisions we debated last week have been stripped back. We \nhave now under the new agreement, some 60 slots, I believe, 58 or 60 \nslots, available for amendments that have to be filed by Tuesday \nafternoon at 3:00. Votes, then, will start not later than 4 o'clock \ntomorrow afternoon.\n  This is much more manageable now. People have been coming to the \nfloor and offering their amendments. We will have votes on them. We are \nin a whole different situation. I am not putting S. 993 back in as any \nscare tactic but there are possibilities that loom out here that this \nwould be a last-gasp stopgap measure we could put in if really \nnecessary. I want to stress that. I know there was a considerable \namount of discontent in some quarters last week when I even brought \nthis up. I wanted to make sure it was not misunderstood now.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n   [[Page S1353]] Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, strike beginning with line 16 through line 4 on \n     page 22 and insert the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--\n       ``(A) Statement required for reported bill.--It shall not \n     be in order in the Senate, after third reading or at any \n     other time when no further amendments are in order, to \n     consider any bill or joint resolution that is reported by a \n     committee unless the committee has published a statement of \n     the Director on the direct costs of Federal mandates in \n     accordance with subsection (a)(6) before such consideration.\n       ``(B) Legislation or threshold.--(i) It shall not be in \n     order in the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report--\n       ``(I) after third reading or at any other time when no \n     further amendments are in order, if the enactment of such \n     bill or resolution as amended; or\n       ``(II) if such bill or resolution in the form recommended \n     by such conference report differs from the bill or resolution \n     as passed by the Senate, and if the enactment of such bill or \n     resolution in the form recommended in such conference report, \n     would increase the direct costs of Federal intergovernmental \n     mandates by an amount that causes the thresholds specified in \n     subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) to be exceeded, unless the conditions \n     specified in clause (ii) as satisfied.\n       ``(ii) The conditions referred to in clause (i) shall be \n     satisfied if--\n\n     Redesignate the clauses following accordingly.''\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this takes care of what I think is a \ndifficulty in the bill. It would correct what I think is something we \nprobably should have dealt with earlier on. That is this: The bill \ndeals with points of order and when they will lie against legislation \ncoming to the floor, to have the overall expense or the cost to the \nStates and local communities considered in advance of considering the \nlegislation and whether Congress will fund those costs.\n  As now crafted, as now structured, the bill would permit a point of \norder when the bill with Federal intergovernmental mandates first comes \nto the floor. Then there would be no more points of order that would \nlie against the bill but there could be points of \n[[Page S1354]] order invoked any amendment that may or may not contain \nan intergovernmental mandate. If we think about how a bill normally \nworks its way through the Senate, a number of amendments can be brought \nup here on the Senate floor. They may well change completely the nature \nof the bill by the amendments and the cost of amendments that are \nincurred during the amending process here on the floor.\n  Now, I think it would be more appropriate the bill be subject to a \npoint of order after we know what all the amending process has done to \nit. To have the point of order apply to possibly every amendment all \nthe way through creates a situation that could be used if a Senator \nreally wanted to filibuster something. He or she could put in a dozen \ndifferent amendments containing Federal intergovernmental mandates, \neach maybe over $50 million, that might not even apply and might not be \ngermane or relevant to the bill being considered and would then go \nthrough all the process of point of order on everything that was \nbrought up in each of the amendments. I could see this as a possibility \nof a means of really creating a lot of delay.\n  What we are really interested in, it seems to me, is the final bill \nas amended on the floor before we vote on it. And at that point, we \neither say yes, we go ahead with these unfunded mandates because it is \nimportant for everybody in the whole country for whatever reason and \ntherefore we waive the point of order. Or we say no, all these total of \namendments here plus what the cost of the original bill should be \nsubject to the points of order requiring cost estimates and funding.\n  It seems to me that is a more appropriate way to go than having the \npoint of order lie on all amendments.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would apply the points of order in two \nplaces, not at the start of consideration on the floor as S. 1 \nrequires, but it would apply at the end of consideration of legislation \non the floor--just prior to third reading--and, at a second point, when \nit comes back from conference, because when it comes back from \nconference, sometimes it might be a completely changed bill from what \nwent to conference with the approval of the Senate.\n  So my amendment would apply points of order at those two places. As I \nsaid, my concern in applying the point of order requirements for CBO \ncost estimates and State and local funding of floor amendments, as S. 1 \ncurrently does, is that it may unnecessarily bog down the legislative \nprocess, particularly for the first year or two when this act goes into \neffect. It is possible someone might raise points of order, as I said, \non almost every amendment that is offered to any one bill.\n  I understand points of order can currently be raised under the Budget \nAct on amendments that affect Federal direct spending but have not been \nscored by CBO. However, the Budget Act scoring process has been in \nplace for some time and the procedures in S. 1, on the other hand, are \nbrand new. So we should not overload the Senate with these new \nprocedural requirements on floor amendments, as I see it.\n  As I said, the amendment would see that the points of order lie in \ntwo places: First, just prior to final passage and then on the \nconference report. That way, only amendments that have been adopted \nwould have to be scored by CBO, rather than having them score all \namendments prior to their being offered, as would have to be done under \nS. 1. So the burden on CBO might be reduced. Only amendments adopted \nwould be required to be scored, not amendments offered. Of course, \nMembers bringing an amendment to the floor may wish to have a CBO cost \nestimate in order to know precisely what the effect of the amendment \nwill be. My amendment will ensure conference reports will also still be \nscored, as is the case under S. 1.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                      Unanimous-consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 \np.m. tomorrow, the Senate resume consideration of amendment No. 182, \nthe Hollings amendment; that there be 30 minutes for debate prior to a \nmotion to table, to be equally divided between Senators Hollings and \nDomenici; that following that debate, it be in order for the majority \nmanager, or his designee, to move to table the Hollings amendment; and \nthat the vote occur on the motion to table immediately following the \ndisposition of the Bingaman amendment No. 192.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot, where is the Bingaman amendment in the hierarchy now? Is that No. \n4 that we have on our list?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, that is correct. This will be No. 5.\n  Mr. GLENN. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside so that I may send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask it be considered as offered as required under the \nunanimous consent agreement under which the Senate is currently \noperating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 198.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, strike lines 7 through 10, and insert the \n     following:\n       (3) Committee on Appropriations.--Paragraph (1)--\n       (A) shall not apply to any bill or resolution reported by \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate or the House of \n     Representatives; but\n       (B) shall apply to--\n       (i) Any legislative provision increasing direct costs of a \n     federal intergovernmental mandate contained in any bill or \n     resolution reported by such Committee;\n       (ii) any legislative provision increasing direct costs of a \n     federal intergovernmental mandate contained in any amendment \n     offered to a bill or resolution reported by such Committee;\n       (iii) any legislative provision increasing direct costs of \n     a federal intergovernmental mandate in a conference report \n     accompanying a bill or resolution reported by such Committee; \n     and\n       (iv) any legislative provision increasing direct costs of a \n     federal intergovernmental mandate contained in any amendments \n     in disagreement between the two Houses to any bill or \n     resolution reported by such Committee.\n       (C) Upon a point of order being made by any Senator against \n     any provision listed in Paragraph (3)(B), and the point of \n     order being sustained by the Chair, such specific provision \n     shall be deemed stricken from the bill, resolution, \n     amendment, amendment in disagreement, or conference report \n     and may not be offered as an amendment from the floor.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is very basic. It would \nextend a provision of the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act to cover \nappropriations bills. As reported by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, appropriations legislation was exempted from S. 1. I wish to \nrepeat, appropriations legislation was exempted from this legislation.\n  This amendment would establish that any legislative provisions \ncontained in an appropriations bill or conference report that create an \nunfunded mandate would also be subject to the point of order called for \nby this bill.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, this important legislation sponsored by \nSenator Kempthorne is a proposal that warrants swift passage. Over the \nlast year, \n[[Page S1355]] every Member of Congress has likely heard pleas for \nassistance from State and local officials in their home States for \nrelief from the steadily increasing burdens of unfunded Federal \nmandates, and understandably so.\n  As the Governmental Affairs Committee noted in a report on this \nissue, State and local officials from across the country sent a \npowerful and unified message to Washington that:\n\n       * * * unfunded Federal mandates imposed unreasonable fiscal \n     burdens on their budgets; limited their flexibility to \n     address more pressing local problems; forced local tax \n     increases and service cutbacks; discouraged innovation at a \n     local level; and hampered their ability to effectively \n     govern.\n\n  The burdens which have been placed on the shoulders of States, \ncities, and counties in America have become intolerable. The CBO \nestimated the cumulative costs of Federal regulatory mandates on States \nover a 7-year period are as high as $12 billion.\n  A study released by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1990 \nestimated that the total annual costs of environmental mandates to \nState and local governments would rise a total of 67 percent by the \nyear 2000.\n  The mayor of one of America's largest cities said that:\n\n       When you pass a mandate down to us and we have to pay for \n     it, the police force goes down, the firefighting force goes \n     down. Recreation departments are in disrepair * * * because \n     our capital budget is being sopped up by * * * the need to \n     pay for federal mandates.\n\n  I strongly sympathize with these views and those that I have heard \nfrom so many city and town officials in my State of Arizona. The \ncumulative weight of the involuntary spending requirements that the \nCongress has been foisting upon State and local governments has finally \nreached the breaking point, and it is important that we pass this \nlegislation to address the problem early in the 104th Congress.\n  There is, however, a significant omission in the bill we have before \nus. S. 1 applies only to legislation emanating from authorizing \ncommittees, and exempts appropriations bills. This is a big loophole, \nMr. President, and given the tendencies of many Members of Congress, I \nfear it is a loophole that will be taken advantage of in short order.\n  If we exempt appropriations bills from the point of order procedure \nof this unfunded mandates bill, we will be tacitly allowing a process \nwhere Members will be tempted or pressured into using appropriations \nbills as vehicles to levy mandates upon State and local governments. \nSuch an exemption would undermine the important objectives of what S. 1 \nis so admirably trying to achieve. This amendment to subject any \nlegislative language in spending bills to a majority point of order \nregarding unfunded mandates will help ensure that doesn't happen.\n  The intent and impact of this amendment is simple, straightforward, \nand entirely reasonable, Mr. President. If a bill reported out of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee or the Labor Committee which \ncreates a new mandate on State or local governments, those committees \nare required to authorize funding to pay for it. A point of order would \nlie against the bill if it were not properly funded. Surely we should \nestablish this same procedural hurdle for appropriations bills if they \ncontain new unfunded mandates.\n  I fully recognize, Mr. President, that existing Senate rules already \nbar appropriations bills from being used as vehicles for \nauthorizations. If this restriction was uniformly adhered to, \nappropriations bills would only factor into concerns about unfunded \nmandates to the degree that they were adequately delivering Federal \nfunds to State and local governments.\n  As all of my colleagues well know, however, this is often not the \ncase. Appropriations bills can and have been used by the Senate for \nlegislative purposes. This fact necessitates the amendment I am \nproposing here today.\n  It is surely not an unwarranted leap of faith, Mr. President, to \nanticipate that Members and staff in the Congress might be tempted to \nutilize appropriations bills as a vehicle for unfunded mandates in the \nfuture. Minds far sharper and more creative than my own could craft \nlanguage into an appropriations bill that in effect would impose a new \nunfunded mandate on a State, local, or tribal government.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, if past experience on legislative language \nbeing inserted in appropriations bills is a guide, we should expect \nthis to happen. I am concerned that exempting appropriations measures \nfrom S. 1 will be akin to locking the barn door while leaving a ground-\nfloor window wide open. This exemption is a loophole that will surely \nprove too tempting for enterprising Members of Congress to leave \nuntested, and we should act to close it before they do.\n  Furthermore, for my colleagues who may question whether this \namendment is necessary, I would like to note the dilemma we already \nface in the case of appropriations legislation passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. According to Senate precedent, appropriations bills \ncontaining legislative language sent over from the House is deemed \ngermane, and is not subject to a point of order.\n  We already experience problems with exceptions being made to the \nSenate rule that prohibits legislative language on an appropriations \nbill, so I hope we will not exacerbate this situation by creating a \nspecial new exemption for appropriations bills regarding unfunded \nmandates. Let us not miss this historic opportunity to stem the tide of \noppressive Federal mandates by allowing them to be imposed by way of \nappropriations bills or conference reports.\n  Mr. President, if the basic rules of the Senate are followed and \nappropriations measures contain no new unfunded mandates, then this \namendment would not affect them in any way. We should improve this \nimportant bill to curb the Congress's penchant for passing on millions \nof dollars of mandatory spending requirements onto States and local \ngovernments by adopting this amendment. To leave appropriations \nlegislation exempted from the provisions of S. 1 is to leave a sizable \nloophole in the bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment to remedy it.\n  I again thank my friend from Idaho who has probably had enough praise \nover the last week to last him for a long period of time, but he \ndeserves every bit of it. I must say he has done a magnificent job. But \nI also point out to my friend from Idaho and remind him that when I \nasked him why were appropriations bills exempted from this bill \nlanguage, his response was, ``Well, we could not get the bill passed.''\n  Then my question is, to him and to the other sponsors of this bill: \nWhy is it, then, if we are not concerned about legislation being \nenacted on an appropriations bill and it not being subject to a point \nof order, then why should there be any objection whatsoever to this \namendment? It seems to me by the very act of exempting appropriations \nbill from this point of order procedure we are tacitly saying we do not \nwant to tangle with the Appropriations Committee and we do not want to \nmake sure that there is not a loophole in this legislation by allowing \nlegislation on appropriations bills.\n  I also say to the sponsors of this bill, if you do not think we have \nlegislated on appropriations bills then I have a lot of legislation to \nshow you. We have. It has happened time and time again where \nappropriations bills have been the vehicles for authorizing legislation \nwhich are stuffed into bills, many times in the dead of night, or in a \nconference committee, a conference between the two Houses so the rest \nof us who are not Members of that conference are unable to know about \nit.\n  This is a very serious issue. And I have to say after my 9th year, if \nI have grown a little bit cynical it is because I think I have reason \nto be so. We cannot allow authorization on appropriations bills. If we \ndo not allow it then this amendment should cause no problem for anyone. \nThe only reason you can assume why this bill exempted appropriations \nbills is because of the possibility in the future of authorizing \nlegislation on appropriations bills.\n  I think I have made my point. There may be a desire to engage in \nextended debate on this issue. I do not intend to leave a loophole of \nthis size in this unfunded mandates bill, which is a very critical \nbill, and then go back to the people I represent and say everything is \nfine. Because it is not going to be fine if we allow people to \nauthorize on an appropriations bill and not be subject to the same \npoint of order that there is on the authorizing legislation.\n   [[Page S1356]] I again thank Senator Kempthorne for his outstanding \nwork on this very important and critical piece of legislation. If I \ncould just tell him, I met with the mayors of my State a couple of \nmonths ago, I met with the county supervisors of my State, and there \nwas one issue and one issue only they wanted to talk about and that was \nSenator Kempthorne's legislation. So he is even famous in the State of \nArizona as well as the State of Idaho.\n  So I thank my friend from Idaho and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I just wish to thank the Senator from \nArizona for his kind remarks and also to acknowledge his strong and \nenthusiastic support to curb these unfunded Federal mandates. He is one \nof the stalwarts in this effort. So I thank him.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, last week we began a colloquy with the \nmanagers of the bill on some of the uncertain provisions and ambiguous \nprovisions in the bill. I thought we could pick that colloquy up this \nevening. I have a number of amendments that have been offered. There \nare two additional amendments to be offered that have been listed for \nme. I think the number of the issues which have been raised, even \nthough amendments both are filed and to be filed, could be clarified if \nI could discuss with the managers of the bill some of the provisions \nwhich I consider to be ambiguous. In order to do that, I thought I \nwould again use the same hypothetical. If I could get copies of this to \nthe two managers of the bill, this hypothetical Senate bill is the one \nI used last week. We went into the first ambiguity and then after about \n3 hours of debate clarified it with an amendment.\n  This bill, hypothetical, to be offered after the effective date of \nthis law mandates reductions of dangerous levels of mercury from \nincinerator emissions after October 1, 2005. Under this hypothetical \nbill the EPA is designated to determine what constitutes a mercury \nlevel dangerous to human health. The first question is when is this \nbill effective? That is not a theoretical question. That is a very \ncritical question because there must be an estimate of the cost of an \nintergovernmental mandate the first year that it is effective. When a \nbill or amendment is effective becomes a critical issue and could mean \nthe life or death of the bill or amendment because if the estimate of \nthe mandate is more than $50 million in any year starting the first \nyear it is effective, for 5 years, then certain things are triggered. \nVery significant things are triggered. Estimates, authorizations, \nlanguage relative to appropriations, all must be in the bill. Agencies \nhave to be designated to pull back from or to relieve the local \ngovernments of the mandate. That estimate and its effective date are \nabsolutely central to this new version of the bill.\n  Last year we had a bill which had broad cosponsorship, including \nmyself, where there was an estimate required but there was less hanging \non it, on its specificity, on its certainty, on its length, and as to \nwhen it is first effective, when the mandate was first effective. A lot \nless was hanging on that because you did not have this mechanism, this \nnew point-of-order mechanism, relative to the appropriation of funds. \nThat is one of the things which is new this year. Unless we do it right \nit is going to complicate this process beyond anyone's wildest dream or \nnightmare. So that is the area that I want to discuss with my friends.\n  Last week I asked the Senator from Ohio what is the effective date of \nthis mandate in my hypothetical bill. He basically said, well, it would \nhave to be sometime before October 1, 2005. So I thought to clarify the \nsituation I would give an actual or a hypothetical CBO estimated direct \ncost of the local government in my hypothetical so we can get some \nclarification and some legislative history as to what is intended by \nthe mandate.\n  The chart that I have up gives the following CBO estimated direct \ncosts for these 87,000 State, local, and tribal governments. In this \nhypothetical in fiscal year 1996, the estimated direct cost is $6 \nmillion. In fiscal year 1997, the estimated direct cost is $8 million; \nin 1998, $10 million; 1999, $15 million; \n[[Page S1357]] 2000, $20 million; 2001, $25 million; 2002, $30 million; \n2003, $50 million; 2004, $100 million; 2005, $200 million. Let us \nassume that is the way the estimate comes back.\n  How they can make this estimate is a different question. Last week \nthe Senate decided that if it was impossible to make the estimate that \nwe would allow them to say it is impossible. That took an awful lot of \ndebate on this floor and had been rejected in committee on a party-line \nvote. But we ought to be grateful for progress. We made some progress \non that narrow issue. The CBO can be honest. The way the bill was \noriginally written they were allowed to be honest relative to the \nprivate sector, but they were not allowed to admit it was impossible to \nestimate the direct cost of a mandate relative to the intergovernmental \nsector if it was. The amendment that was adopted last week permits them \nto make an honest statement if it is impossible to make an estimate in \neither or both sectors.\n  OK. You make an estimate. It comes back the way this is laid out on \nthis chart.\n  Now my question to the managers of the bill, and last week again the \nSenator from Ohio saw the dilemma that we are all in, and said well, it \nhas to be earlier than October 1, 2005, because if that is the \neffective date of the mandate within the meaning of the bill there will \nnever be any cost because it sounds like October 1 is the effective \ndate of 2005. The way I read it sure sounds like it because under my \nhypothetical bill it says it mandates reductions of dangerous levels of \nmercury from incinerator emissions after October 1, 2005. That sounds \nlike the effective date is October 1, 2005. Most of us, and I think \nmost ordinary readers of that language would say the effective date is \nOctober 1, 2005. But if it is 2005, if that is the first effective \ndate, there will not be any costs. Nothing would ever be triggered \nbecause all the money would have been spent before that in order to \nmake sure it complies by that date.\n  The Senator from Ohio said that would be troubling and he said there \nwould be some years prior to that that the CBO would have to make some \nestimate. I do not know how. But somehow or other, it would have to \nmake an estimate. An awful lot is hanging on this. The life or death of \na bill or amendment can be hanging on this because you must have the \nestimate in order to get by the point of order. In order to pursue this \nissue and to get the thinking of the managers who are the prime \nsponsors of this bill, I thought I would give them this hypothetical \nestimated direct cost.\n  My question to both Senators would be, in this chart what would be \nthe first fiscal year that this mandate would have a direct cost? What \nis the fiscal year to trigger that 5-year issue? If I could go through \nthe Chair to ask the managers if they would be able to engage me in a \ncolloquy on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to that--and again, this \nis the first time that I have seen this scenario--one of the things \nthat I would caution everyone, including myself, is that it can be \ndifficult in a debate situation to take a hypothetical or a scenario \nand then try to answer all of the questions here.\n  My initial view of this is that when we look at the bill, it clearly \nstates that we will consult with our State and local elected officials. \nI do not know that we can answer that question based upon what the \nSenator has in front of us.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield. This is the CBO estimated cost. \nThey have now consulted. By the way, that raises a whole other series \nof issues which we will get to later. This assumes that all that \nconsultation has taken place, and this is the document that comes back \nto us, the estimated direct cost. This is the piece of paper which CBO \nhands to us.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Then I believe, again, based upon input from the \nState and local officials, that input, in addition to this document, if \nit is----\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is the document created, if I may say so, following \nall of the input. The CBO has done its work and has consulted with \nState and local officials. After consultation, it then tells us that \nthis is their best estimate. This is what is going to determine now all \nthe points of order. They come back to us saying we have consulted and \nwe have talked to the 87,000 State and local governments in the last \nweek, and this is our best estimate.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The CBO is to make a 5-year estimate. Based upon the \ninput from State and local officials, I would think the committee would \nthen ask either CBO, or based upon the input from those State and local \nofficials: What is the effective date? Again, I do not know that we can \nderive that from this document.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I may say so, we are introducing a tremendous \nambiguity, because we are saying in the bill that the first fiscal year \nafter the effective date, and each 4 fiscal years thereafter, we will \ndetermine a critical estimate. I am giving the managers and the \nsponsors of the bill what the CBO tells us. I am laying it out. I \ncannot be clearer than that. The CBO comes back and says these are the \n10 years prior to that effective date of October 1, 2002. We just \ncannot simply say, well, they will determine the effective date. The \nsponsors of the bill would have an intent, I hope, as to what is the \neffective date for the purposes of this bill.\n  I think it is going to be absolutely essential that we get an answer \nto that question because there is an awful lot that is going to hinge \non when the effective date is. The way I wrote the hypothetical, it \nsaid: You must reduce dangerous levels of mercury from incinerator \nemissions after October 1, 2005. That is the way the bill hypothetical \nstates it. When I asked the Senator from Ohio last week when is the \neffective date, the Senator said--and I happen to agree with him, since \nmuch of the costs are going to be before 2005, probably all of the \ncosts, because they want to be in compliance by the October 1, 2005, \ndate. So over the weekend, I decided we would come up with an actual \nCBO estimated direct cost. Here it is.\n  The sponsors of the bill, it seems to me, should say what the intent \nof the bill is. We know there are costs in each of the 10 years. The \nfirst year that there are direct costs is 1996. That is what the CBO \ntells us. That is the first year. The second year is 1997. If we are to \ntake this legislation on its face, it says the first year that it has a \ndirect cost will be the first year it is effective. The next 4 years \nthereafter, if any of those 5 years are above the $50 million \nthreshold, it triggers certain very critical things. This sounds \ntechnical and dry, and it may, indeed, be almost impossible for people \nstudying the legislative process to know what it is that is going to \nhappen. But surely we have an obligation to clarify, to the extent we \ncan, what is the intent of this bill.\n  I have laid it out. So now I am asking the managers as to whether or \nnot it is the intent of this bill that 1996 be the first year, since \nthere is a direct cost, according to the CBO estimate, in that year. \nThat is my question. Is that the first fiscal year, since there is a \ndirect cost in that year?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to that, again, I do not \nknow that we can answer that just based on this. Again, I have to go \nback to what S. 1 is all about. It is a process. Is the requirement to \nremove mercury a current mandate? That would be a question. Is the \nrequirement to remove mercury a current mandate?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Current before the hypothetical laws if this is adopted?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The point is that you are asking the CBO to make an \nestimate. I am telling you what their conclusion is. I am telling the \nSenator what the conclusion of the CBO is so we can have a discussion. \nIt makes no difference in my hypothetical whether there is a current \nmandate or not. The only thing that is important is this CBO estimate. \nI am giving the Senator the estimate and now asking the Senator if that \nis their estimate.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am trying to determine what went \ninto coming up with this CBO list and the analysis. But, again, is the \nrequirement to remove mercury a current mandate in your hypothetical?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It would make it a relevant hypothetical because CBO is \nmandated in the bill to come up with the direct cost. In order to have \na discussion of when the first fiscal year is \n[[Page S1358]] triggered, I am saying this is the CBO conclusion.\n  Assume for the moment that you do not disagree with the conclusion. \nAssume for the moment that there is no basis to disagree with the CBO. \nAssume for the moment that everybody accepts it. This is the given I \nwant to debate. This is the conclusion of the CBO. And I add further \nthat every single Member of the U.S. Congress says: That sure looks \ngood to us; they have really done their work, and they have consulted \nwith every 1 of the 87,000 local governments in the last 2 weeks. They \nhave taken into consideration all of the factors that could be taken \ninto consideration. Is there a current mandate or is there not? They \nhave done everything perfectly right, and this is their conclusion.\n  My question is: What is the first fiscal year? I can understand if \nthe Senator says, well, maybe the CBO is wrong. But that is a different \nissue. My assumption is that the CBO is correct, that they have done \ntheir homework and everybody concludes that is a very good, solid \nestimate. They have done their work and they have read the bill \ncorrectly. So much hangs on when is the first fiscal year that this \nmandate is effective, and we better understand going in that we are \ngoing to have points of order on this floor. We are going to ask that \npoor Parliamentarian up there to rule. Do we want the Parliamentarian \nto rule as to when the first fiscal year is that the mandate is \neffective? Do we want the Parliamentarian to rule whether there is a \nmandate? I guess so. But in order to have some clarity of congressional \npurpose here, I am simply giving the CBO estimate, and I want you to \nassume, if you will, that it is correct and that we all concede that \nthis is the correct CBO estimated direct cost. We must know when that \nfirst fiscal year starts. When does that clock start running? If we do \nnot know it now when we are passing the legislation, we are never going \nto be able to figure it out later.\n  This is where folks will come back for guidance. What was the \nlegislative intent? This is it. This is where we are trying to create \nlegislative intent, to the extent it is relevant these days--and it \nstill is relevant--this is the moment where we have to lay out what our \nintentions are.\n  The reason this is different from last year's bill, in last year's \nbill there had to be an estimate. That was fine. If there was not, it \nwas subject to a point of order. That was fine.\n  And, by the way, last year's bill had the support of the Governors \nand the support of local officials. And, as far as I am concerned, that \nwas fine, too.\n  But in this year's bill, we have a new point of order. And in this \nyear's bill, an awful lot is going to hinge on that estimate, including \nsome critical appropriations language that did not exist last year.\n  And I will repeat, the life and death of an amendment or a bill can \nbe determined by the answer to this question. And it is a \nstraightforward question.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. In the report of the Committee on the Budget with \nregard to S. 1, when you look at this, you have the CBO estimate, and \nthat is what we are talking about here. And, Mr. President, as you can \nsee, you have all of the information, the steps that CBO would go \nthrough in order to get this, which may look similar to what the \nSenator's large chart looks like.\n  But, again, in this hypothetical, the Senator is not allowing us to \ngo through this process. The Senator has simply gone to the conclusion \nof numbers by year. But, again, I do not think you can conclude this \nbased on that because you are not allowing us to go through what a CBO \nprocess would go through.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If my good friend will yield again, the only way we are \ngoing to clarify congressional intent is if we state, as I have stated, \nthat after you go through the CBO process, after the CBO goes through \nall of their process, after they have consulted with 87,000 local \ngovernments, after they have considered whether there is a current \nmandate or not a current mandate, they have done everything right, and \neveryone in the Senate concludes CBO is right and this is their \nconclusion.\n  Now, if that is their conclusion, my question is, when is the first \nfiscal year that that mandate is effective?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again I would be interested in this \nand we would have to reconstruct this whole scenario. We would have to \ncontinue with more hypothetical points. What does CBO recommend? Does \nCBO recommend what the effective date would be?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is that the intent of the sponsors, that the CBO \nrecommends? We do not give them any guidance? That the sponsors of the \nbill just throw it off to the CBO?\n  We are writing a bill here. What are we urging the CBO to do?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the legislation would identify the \neffective date, but it would be based, again, upon input from a whole \nvariety of resources and sources. Again, with all due respect, I do not \nthink you could simply take one chart, numbers, and say, ``Now, go back \nand reconstruct this whole scenario and tell me what it all \nconcludes.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, I think there is a serious ambiguity here and, to \nsome extent, an abdication if we let this go without clarification. The \nabdication is that we must, as a Senate and a House, later on know what \nthe legislation intended. It is central to the bill that the first \nfiscal year in which a mandate is effective is a critical date in the \nbill. A new point of order is created based upon it.\n  Last week, I asked the question whether or not the language in my \nhypothetical meant that the mandate was effective October 1, 2005. And \nI am going to read that again, because one sentence says yes, it is \n2005. In the hypothetical, the Senate mandates reductions of dangerous \nlevels of mercury from incinerator emissions after October 1, 2005.\n  Now, the average reader, the average person reading that bill, would \nsay that is the effective date of the mandate. If it is, again, and I \nthink my friend would agree with me, as the Senator from Ohio agreed \nwith me last week, if the effective date of the mandate is October 1, \n2005, when all emissions must comply, then it will never be triggered \nbecause all the money is going to be spent before October 1, 2005.\n  But I do not think we can have it both ways. We cannot say ``Well, it \nis not the date in the statute, October 1, 2005, because all the money \nis going to be spent before that date, in order to have the emissions \nbe in compliance.'' And that is correct. I think that is a logical \nresponse. If it is going to have any effect at all and any meaning, you \ncannot say that the date in the statute, October 1, 2005, is the \neffective date for the purpose of the point of order. You have to find \nthe effective date prior to that.\n  And, according to this bill--and I am just reading the bill--the \nfirst fiscal year that there are direct costs to local and State \ngovernments is year 1. That is year 1. And you go 5 years. And if, in \nany of those 5 years, this mandate costs more than $50 million, certain \nvery, very significant things happen. And if they do not happen, very \nserious points of order lie.\n  I do not think we can have if both ways. We cannot say the effective \ndate that is in the bill is not the one that governs because it has to \nbe before that date and, on the other hand, we are not going to give \nany guidance down the road as to what the first fiscal year is.\n  I think that we cannot have it both ways; that we are leaving a \nmassive ambiguity in the law. It is an example of where the new bill, \nbecause it places so much importance on the mandate, goes too far.\n  Unlike last year's bill, which had more balance to it and which did \nnot link the appropriations of that estimate together, this year's bill \nmakes an estimate in the year 1995 that is going to have an impact 10 \nyears down the road or 20 years down the road. And I believe there is a \nlot of uncertainty and ambiguity, and that means legislative mischief, \nbecause there is no clarity on just this one point.\n  This is just one point.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I believe what the Senator has described--and I must \ngive him a great deal of credit, because \n[[Page S1359]] he has been very thorough and meticulous on this \nlegislation. For that, I think we have already made some perfecting \nlanguage that has been helpful.\n  But, really, he is providing us one piece of a puzzle and then he is \nsaying, ``Well, because with this one piece of the puzzle you can't \ntell us the whole picture, then the picture does not exist.''\n  This scenario, for example, I think lacks the actual legislative \nlanguage. It lacks information from State and local governments and the \nFederal agency on the impact of the legislation. It lacks the text of \nthe CBO letter indicating the basis of the estimate, including CBO's \nassumption on the effective date based on the legislation when a \nregulation is written.\n  We could continue to construct this scenario and somehow try to back \ninto it. But I would add that, through this process, it is on an \nindividual basis. These will be devised by the authorizing committee \nbased upon not strictly one piece of paper, but based upon much of what \nI just went through in the list. And again, it resides with the \nauthorizing committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my understanding, if the Senator would \nyield, that the Congressional Budget Office is the one that makes the \nestimate. Is that correct? Is that the intent of the statute, that the \nCongressional Budget Office makes the estimate?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. For the legislation, yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, now, under my hypothetical the \nCongressional Budget Office has made an estimate. It has taken into \nconsideration each of the items that have been mentioned in the \nauthorizing bill. I could not agree more with the Senator from Idaho \nthat there are many items in the authorizing bill that affect these \ndirect costs. There could be hundreds of them. The CBO is mandated by \nthis bill to make an estimate. I would not only hope but it is the \nassumption of this chart that the CBO has taken all of the authorizing \nbill's factors into account. After taking them all into account, which \nit is required to do, and after consulting with the State, local and \ntribal governments, it has reached this conclusion that I set forth on \nthis chart.\n  I do not think it is accurate to say there is a puzzle here of which \nthis is a part. This chart is the conclusion of the CBO after putting \ntogether the puzzle. They have taken each piece of the puzzle and put \nthe puzzle together and that puzzle leads them to this conclusion. The \nCBO under my hypothetical has each piece of that puzzle together and \nreached the conclusion that has been set forth on this chart. It is \ntrue that there are many pieces. It is the CBO that has to consider \nthose pieces and then give an estimate. Unless we can tell them now, in \na hypothetical such as this, when is the first fiscal year in which \nthat estimate is effective, we are closing our eyes to a major \nambiguity and we are going on to the next ambiguity. We are throwing up \nour hands. We are not defining the first fiscal year in which a mandate \nis effective.\n  I do not think that that is a way to legislate that will give \nguidance to folks who will be bedeviled by the points of order unless \nthey understand what the legislation means and what the intent is of \nthe folks that wrote it.\n  Now, again, I emphasize, there was a requirement in last year's bill \nfor the CBO to make an estimate. I support that. But last year's bill \nwas very different from this year's bill in that it did not contain \nthis additional requirement relative to the appropriations of funds. \nMuch more hangs on the accuracy of this mandate in this year's bill \nthan in last year's bill. In last year's bill there had to be an \nestimate, there had to be an authorization for an appropriation to meet \nthe estimate.\n  What last year's bill did not have and what this year's bill does \nhave, is a point of order which makes it improper to consider a bill \nthat does not have additional language in it which directs that if an \nAppropriations Committee after the mandate is effective does not \nappropriate money at least equal to the estimate that then a bill must \ndirect an agency to cut back on that mandate or eliminate it or be \nsubject to a point of order. That is one of the places where this \nyear's bill goes too far. The fact that there is no answer to this \nquestion on this chart is evidence of the fact that this bill goes too \nfar in that respect.\n  Now, I will press forward because I know that there are folks that \nare trying to end this session at a reasonable hour tonight. Again, I \nraise these hypotheticals as somebody who has had local government \nexperience, and frankly had the same frustration with the Federal \nmandates that I think just about everyone has, whether they had local \nexperience or not. My good friend from Idaho had greater local \nexperience than I did. I was a mere council president but I was \nfrustrated, deeply frustrated by mandates that the Federal Government \nimposed.\n  I want to act but act in a way which is practical, which works, which \nwill reduce the number of mandates, which will force the Senate to \nconsider mandates, but which will avoid plunging the legislative \nprocess into this pit of ambiguity.\n  Next question, and I welcome any guidance from the other manager of \nthe bill on this issue. We spoke last week. I am happy to yield to the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will be very brief because I do not have \na ready answer, as the Senator knows from our previous conversations on \nthis.\n  I think the things he brings up here as to the implementation of this \nbill are very, very good. And I do not want to rub salt into old \nwounds. We have talked about it enough. These are the kind of things \nthat normally we should have worked out in committee. That is where it \nis normally worked out. I do not have a ready answer for this.\n  Ordinarily if we are lumping a program or putting some program on to \nFederal, State, or local governments, we would look at what the total \nimpact of this would be. Now, that is one way to look at it. The other \nway to look at it is 10 years out, nobody can make an estimate that far \nout. There may be some new technical development that enables us to \ntake away mercury in a new way that is cheaper; or an intractable \nproblem that winds up more expensive. A nuclear cleanup at the 17 \ndifferent major sites all around the country in 11 different States in \nour nuclear weapons complex, the original estimate of cleanup as I \nrecall in committee, we would take care of the whole thing for $8 to \n$12 billion. That was in 1985, I believe. Here we are in 1995 and 10 \nyears later it has gone up to $300 billion and it may go higher than \nthat. That is how indefinite some of these estimates are.\n  So, while I would like to say that a CBO estimate of costs, whatever \nthe total cost of the project is, that would trigger the point of \norder. Then we come up with the uncertainty of 10 years and we may be \nknocking a lot of things out that should be considered.\n  So, here we are on the floor working out things like this and trying \nto make acceptable language where we should have been able to do this \nin committee. I will not belabor that because we have already talked \nabout it some today. I think we should take whatever time is necessary \non the floor to work these things out because they are very, very real.\n  Now, on the other hand, too, let me make another caveat. That is \nthis: This bill was never intended, nor was S. 993, the predecessor, \nintended to take care of absolutely every possible permutation, every \npossible what if that we could dream up. They were meant to, in most \nlegislation where there were estimates and we knew what the estimates \nwere within some factor of confidence, that in those which are probably \n90 percent of the bills that go through here, we would have a process \nset up for CBO estimates and points of order to lie.\n  The distinguished Senator from Michigan who has gone into this \nlegislation in, really, a lot more detail, I think, than almost any \nother Senator, I think is to be commended for bringing this up. And \nwhere possible we should work things like this out. I would come back \nto the original intent of unfunded mandates legislation, and that was \nto get our best estimates and if there were problems like this we bring \nthem to the floor.\n  If a point of order lay because the total cost to this was $200 \nmillion and we had to have a point of order, fine, we would do that and \nget on with the \n[[Page S1360]] conclusion of the bill in the best judgment of the \nSenate as to what should happen.\n  I do not know that we will be able to answer every what-if type \nproblem on this. Certainly not now. And I only say one more time I wish \nwe had more time to work this out in committee. That is where details \nlike this are normally worked out rather than here on the floor taking \nup the time of the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio raises another issue. \nI want to discuss with him this question, and that is the outyears. As \nI understand this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office must \nestimate the direct cost of the mandate in all years in which the \nmandates are effective, once the threshold has been exceeded of $50 \nmillion in any of the first 5 years after its effective date. I am \nwondering if the Senator from Ohio would agree with me on that.\n  Mr. GLENN. I agree with that statement. I think that is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we can imagine a mandate which does not have a sunset \nprovision or is not a 10-year authorization or not a 5-year \nauthorization, it is just a permanent authorization, somehow or the \nother the CBO has to estimate the cost forever--forever--of that \nmandate on local government.\n  I want to ask the Senator from Ohio, who has perhaps had a better \nview of infinity than anyone in this body, whether he can conceive of \nforever, and how would the Congressional Budget Office possibly \nestimate the direct cost of a mandate, assuming that the threshold has \nbeen met, on local government for an indefinite period of time?\n  Mr. GLENN. Obviously, the answer is that nobody, not the \nCongressional Budget Office or anyone else, can go to infinity on their \nestimates. Normally around here, we do it for 5 years, and we rely on \nthose estimates. Under the Budget Act, you have a number of points of \norder lie there. The 5-year estimates are what would normally be made \nhere or whatever the mandate was, the length of time.\n  As far as how much it is going to cost out in the indefinite future, \nthere is no way the Budget Office or anyone else can estimate that \nbecause of inflation, changes in technology, and a whole host of \nthings.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question then of the Senator from Ohio is, since this \nis not an estimate of the 5-year costs, once that threshold has been \nreached--strike the five. I want to change my 5-year time. I do not \nwant to get two 5-year periods in here. It would just be confusing.\n  There is a 5-year threshold. If, in any of the first 5 years after \nthe mandate is effective, there is a $50 million cost to State and \nlocal governments, at that point an estimate is triggered. The \nestimate, though, is not just for the 5 years.\n  Under the bill--and I think the Senator from Ohio just concurred with \nme on this--under the bill, the estimate is for all of the years that \nthe mandate is in effect, and that is on page 23, lines 6 and 7: You \nmust identify a specific dollar estimate of the full direct cost of the \nmandate for each year or other period during which the mandate shall be \nin effect under the bill.\n  There is no 5-year limit, there is no 10-year limit, there is no 20-\nyear limit, there is no 50-year limit. If the authorization bill has no \nlimit, then somehow or another the CBO is supposed to estimate the \ndirect cost to local government for every year during which the mandate \nshall be in effect under the bill.\n  My question of the managers is, would they consider changing or \namending this bill so that there would be some finite limit on that \nestimate, even if the authorization bill itself is not limited? I am \nwondering if either of the managers might comment on that question.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am one who would advocate that \nCongress should not just establish some mandate in infinity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Or without a limit of years.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I think Congress ought to revisit these issues a \nlittle more often than simply saying now that we impose this mandate, \nit is here for infinity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering if the Senator is going to cosponsor my 10-\nyear sunset on this bill.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. No, but that is an interesting point. You make the \npoint as to why we should not sunset S. 1, because we need to keep this \nprocess in place to deal with these issues. It is an interesting point. \nAgain, I would be willing to sit down with you and pencil out what \nperhaps you are suggesting and see if there is some way to craft this.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with my friend from Idaho, by the way, that \nauthorization bills should have limits. But there is no saying that \nSenators cannot offer a bill that does not have a limit on the length \nof the authorization. They do it all the time. And if they do, under \nthis bill, the Congressional Budget Office is required to make an \nestimate. The managers may not like those bills, I may not like those \nbills, but everyone has a right to introduce those bills, and if they \nintroduce those bills, presumably they have a right to get an estimate.\n  My question is, how can the CBO make an estimate for each year during \nwhich the mandate shall be in effect if there is no 5-year or 10-year \nlimit in the bill on the mandate? That is the question that I have of \nthe managers. I am wondering if the Senator from Ohio might also be \nwilling to entertain some kind of a limit on how far out the CBO has to \nestimate a mandate if there is no limit in the bill on the length of \ntime that the authorization will be in effect.\n  Mr. GLENN. I say to my friend from Michigan, I do not have any answer \nto it right now. I think what you are bringing up is a very good point. \nLet us say, for instance, that we are not going to repeal the Clean Air \nAct, we are not going to say it only applies for a certain length of \ntime and then take it off.\n  As the States get into implementation of the Clean Air Act, Clean \nWater Act, or whatever, their costs may be completely different from \nwhat was originally estimated. If so, they come back to us again and \nthe appropriate committee should be cognizant of that and take action \nto make sure that is corrected so the States are not unfairly dealt \nwith.\n  I tend to think that in most cases, on most legislation we would deal \nwith, a 5-year estimate would be OK. You can bring up something else, \nthough. What if we got into a situation like we were in about a decade \nago--a little over a decade ago, about 15 years ago--where we had an \ninflation rate that ran 17 percent for a while? What if we got into a \nsituation like that and the value of $50 million changes? We might have \nto come back with additional legislation to change that.\n  Right now, you are talking about, looking at your 10-year chart on \nthe mercury problem and taking it over a 10-year period, as that $50 \nmillion threshold now becomes in actual current dollars worth $25 \nmillion, or something like that. I do not believe that has been \naddressed here either. I do not want to argue against our own bill.\n  There are problems like that, too, we do need to address in committee \nor either make corrections in this legislation that is on the floor or \nprovide something that takes care of those variables for the future \nalso.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio raises a very \nimportant question. I may offer an amendment to basically have an \ninflation factor built in so that we would reestimate every few years \nwhat that $50 million or $100 million or $200 million is to the nearest \n$10 million.\n  I have reserved a number of amendments, and one of those amendments \nwill probably be that feature of factoring in the inflation factor, if \nneeded, so we do not 10 years out from now have the same number.\n  The next question has to do with the range, the issue of range.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Sure, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would be happy to sit down and see what perhaps we \ncould design here because if in fact what the Senator is suggesting is \nthat rather than trying to have CBO give an estimate that is many, many \nyears down there, that there can be updated reestimates by CBO so that \nwe are being realistic in the funds that we are providing to the State \nand local governments to carry out that mandate. If \n[[Page S1361]] that is what the Senator is suggesting, then I think we \nare headed in the right direction.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is actually a related but somewhat different idea. If \nI have enough space on my amendments list, I intend to offer an \namendment on this matter.\n  The Senator from Ohio raised the same question, and this is what it \nis. Let us assume the estimate is that it is going to be $50 million in \neach of the 5 critical fiscal years, and therefore the threshold has \nbeen met. Therefore, the language must be in the bill or it is subject \nto a point of order. That could be 10 years away, that period that is \nbeing estimated. And let us assume that 10 years down the road there is \nnew technology, as my friend from Ohio said. Instead of it costing $50 \nmillion to address the mercury problem in these incinerators, there has \nbeen a whole new technology designed and now all of a sudden it is $5 \nmillion.\n  By the way, a lot of the previous estimates of costs to State and \nlocal governments have been overestimates. This is not new, totally new \nwhat is going on here. We have already required by law that there be \nestimates of costs to State and local governments, and there have been \nhundreds of them, approximately 800 of them, in the last 12 years. A \nlot of those estimates have been overestimates.\n  Now I wish to get back to the topic because I am going to try to \ndraft an amendment which would address this issue.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield just for a correction?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GLENN. I said a moment ago it raised questions about its \ninflation impact.\n  That is provided for in this legislation. The $50 million goes up \nwith a correction for inflation each year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering whether or not the $200 million figure also \ngoes up as well?\n  It does. All right. That is fine if there is an inflation factor \nalready built in. I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  Now, getting back to this question, let us assume that there is an \nestimate that the first affected year, the first fiscal year in which \nthe mandate is in effect, let us say it is the year 2001. That is what \nCBO says. We have no better information. It is a guesstimate probably \nat best, the way a lot of these are going to be. But that is it. And so \nthe threshold is now triggered.\n  At that point we have to put the critical language in the bill that, \nunless the Appropriations Committee in the year 2001 puts in $50 \nmillion to fund this particular mandate, an agency 5 years from now \nmust reduce the level of this mandate or, if no money is appropriated, \nmust take the local and State governments off the hook totally. That \nlanguage must be in the authorization bill that is passed now for 10 \nyears from now.\n  OK, now the CBO scores it, and they decide it is going to cost $50 \nmillion in the year 2001. That is their estimate--$50 million. Now, the \nfiscal year 2001 comes. The Appropriations Committee says: Wait a \nminute. There has been new technology for the last couple of years on \nthe question of mercury. That will cost one-tenth of what they thought \n5 years ago it was going to cost. There is brand new technology. And \nthey ask the CBO in the year 2001 to rescore it. CBO says absolutely \nthis thing is not going to cost $50 million; this thing is going to \ncost $5 million.\n  Under this bill, the agency is still required to reduce the mandate. \nNow, that is wasteful of taxpayers' dollars. I do not think we ought to \nbe appropriating $50 million to anybody if $5 million will do the job. \nWe are trying here presumably to create incentives to reduce costs to \nGovernment. In everything we do, we are trying to drive down costs to \nGovernment.\n  This language says unless we address it in some way that the \nAppropriations Committee has to appropriate $50 million in that year \nway down the road even though the CBO in that same year down the road \ntells us it only costs $5 million now because of new technology.\n  I ask my friends whether they will work with me on language which \nwould allow the Appropriations Committee down the road to appropriate \nless if they have a CBO estimate down the road which says that \ncircumstances have changed and it will not cost as much as was thought \nway back then when the estimate was originally made. I am wondering if \nthe managers would work with me on such language.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, if we were to work out the language, \nwould the Senator then support the bill and vote for it?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we could work out enough of these amendments, I would \nlike to vote for this bill. I can assure my friend from Idaho that I \nsupported the bill last year because I wanted to do something about \nthese mandates. But we have to do it in a way which is effective, which \ndoes not waste taxpayers' dollars, because that is the last thing my \nfriend from Idaho wants us to do, and in a way which allows us to \nfunction effectively as a legislative body.\n  So my answer is if we can work out enough changes in the bill that we \nhave discussed, I would like to be able to support this bill.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, as the Senator described it, if it is \na situation where we are in essence providing more funds than are \nnecessary to carry out the mandate, then, yes, we need to have a \nmechanism because that is taxpayers' precious money, and we do not want \nto abuse that by having it somehow go to purposes for which it is not \nintended.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend for that, and I will be submitting \nlanguage to the managers along this line.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. One other point, if I may. There is a process there \nwhich is the rescission process by the agencies. The agency that has \nbeen duly noted by the authorizing committee would deal with that \nissue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The rescission process is a complicated process, but there \nis that possibility.\n  The next question relates to range. Is the CBO allowed to estimate a \nrange of cost?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. No; the intent is for the CBO to give us a specific \non that number on that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The reason I asked that question is because the Budget \nCommittee on page 11 says that the committee--this is near the top of \npage 11 of the committee report.\n\n       The committee is concerned about and recognizes the \n     difficulty of making outyear estimates, particularly beyond \n     the 5-year window. The committee notes that the new \n     enforcement procedures are based on thresholds being \n     exceeded. However, if a range of estimates is made and that \n     range of estimates is less than to greater than the \n     threshold, the committee believes the enforcement procedure \n     should apply.\n\n  Which means that at least one of the two committees thinks that \napparently a range is going to be made at times and is going to be \nprovided instead of a specific dollar.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I know it was the Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nthere seemed to be a concurrence and certainly a statement that you \nwould take the higher number. So, again, you are not going to be \ndealing with a range but you take the higher number. That is why I \nthink in this scenario they are saying if you have a threshold and \nsomeone is suggesting numbers that are less than or greater than the \nthreshold, it is the larger number that you deal with. That would be \nthe number that we would take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that is what this one committee report \nsays. But last year, that was not agreed to in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, may I say. That was the subject of great discussion in \nGovernmental Affairs. There never was a resolution of that issue.\n  But there are two issues. First, is a range allowed and, if so, what \nis the number? And if we are saying if a range is given by CBO that, \nNo. 1, it is going to be allowed, then we have to figure out what the \nnumber is and the bill should be explicit on that question. My \nunderstanding is that a specific amount is required in this bill. That \nis the language in the bill. Yet, we got a committee report that talks \nabout the possibility of a range. So I think we \n[[Page S1362]] have an inconsistency between the bill and the committee \nreport.\n  But if a range is going to be permitted, then it seems to me the bill \nmust be explicit as to what will be that magic, specific amount upon \nwhich a point of order is going to either lie or not lie. I must say, I \ndo not see any logic in saying that if the range is from $10 to $60 \nmillion, we are going to assume for purposes of the point of order it \nis $60 million. Why not take the midpoint of the range?\n  I do not think there is any logic in saying the high point will \ngovern anymore than there is in saying the low point will govern. It \nseems to me the best approach will be to say the middle will govern. \nBut it seems to me in any event this bill is not clear on the question \nof whether or not a range is going to be permitted, and that it is \nimportant that we do so. Otherwise, we could have wild ranges where the \nCBO--in some of these cases, believe me, it is not beyond the realm of \nimagination that the CBO is going to say this is somewhere between $10 \nmillion and $100 million.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. In that hypothetical where you say it is between $10 \nmillion and $60 million, that you take the midrange, the reason that I \nwould be an advocate that you take the larger range is because S. 1 is \nbased upon the presumption we are going to provide the funds to State \nand local government, and therefore in order to protect them, you would \ntake the larger range. Otherwise, we have a real possibility that we \nare underfunding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The other possibility, if I may ask the Senator to yield, \nis that we are overfunding. We do not want to be appropriating more \nmoney or requiring the appropriation of more money than is needed to do \nthe job. They are both unacceptable, either to appropriate less money, \nif it is our determination to fund the mandate, or to appropriate more \nmoney than required.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If the Senator will yield, then we do have a \nrescission procedure that is in place.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We also have subsequent appropriations which are possible, \nas well. We are trying to legislate now on the basis of an estimate. \nThere is no logic in an estimate to say we are going to go with the \nhigh point of a range anymore than there is to say the low point of a \nrange. But the important point is that the legislation be clear, and it \nis not.\n  If I can say to my friend from Idaho, if we want to allow a range, we \nshould say so. If a range is going to be allowed, we should say what it \nis our intent that the estimate will be. That is simply my point. This \nbill is not clear on a very critical issue, which has been the subject \nof great debate.\n  Finally, on this issue, in last year's Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, the committee agreed that the range issue would need to be \nresolved on the Senate floor when S. 993 was brought up for \nconsideration. I urge the managers to clarify the range issue.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If the Senator will yield? I have been advised that \nCBO, with regard to the Budget Act, rarely uses ranges. And also, I \nremind all of us, with this process you do have the waiver. If there is \nsomething that comes up that you feel, therefore, you should bring to \nthe floor to convince a majority of Senators that there is a reason to \nwaive this point of order and those steps involved, you may do so. \nThere is flexibility in this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, contrary to S. 993, I think this piece of \nlegislation on which we had a debate last year--and I recall the \nSenator from Michigan was going to have a debate that dealt with some \nof this, this legislation--I believe what we provide here is that CBO \nwill make an estimate. If they cannot make an estimate, they say they \ncannot make an estimate and that is it. And we do not provide for a \nrange here, specifically. I think that is the way it should be.\n  If the range is of such order that CBO cannot estimate whether it is \ngoing to be above $50 million or not, then tell us that and that is \npart of the information we need, that it is that uncertain. So I think \nto try to force them into making an estimate of ranges, I would not \nfavor that. I think it would be better this way, in this bill, where we \nprovide for an estimate. If they cannot make an estimate that they say \nis within some range of being probable, then they tell us that and say \nthey cannot make an estimate and that is part of our fact pattern here \non the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it then the intent of the Senator from Ohio that if the \nrange estimate is made by the CBO, that that would be the same as no \nestimate?\n  Mr. GLENN. I think it would be very infrequent they would run into \nthat type of situation where it would spread over our threshold. That \nis the question you are talking about. We are not talking about whether \non a $50 million threshold the estimate is $75 or $100 million.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are two questions.\n  Mr. GLENN. In either case. As long as CBO can tell us in their best \njudgment it is going to exceed the threshold, that is what we need to \nknow, and have some estimate of that and give a figure. I think when we \nget into these ranges and you say what if the range is $10 million to \n$1 billion, for instance--just to pick numbers--then it is they could \nnot possibly do that and it would be of no use to us here on the floor, \nanyway. So I think we are on solid ground saying either pick an \nestimate and that is the figure we hopefully rely on, or if they do not \nhave any confidence in that figure, tell us that and they just cannot \nmake an estimate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am wondering whether the Senator from \nIdaho would agree we should prohibit ranges in this legislation? What \nthe Senator from Ohio is saying is we do not provide for ranges in this \nlegislation. It was a much-discussed issue.\n  I know a lot of time has been taken this evening on this issue, \nprobably 15 or 20 minutes already. More time was taken in committee and \nit was unresolved on last year's bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. The bill now is silent on this thing of ranges. It says \nCBO will make an estimate. That means to me they will make an estimate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No range.\n  Mr. GLENN. No range, is the way I interpreted that myself. If they \ncannot do that, then they just tell us that and we take that into \nconsideration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering whether the manager of the bill and chief \nsponsor agrees with the interpretation of the Senator from Ohio?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again we are not plowing new ground \nhere. We are following the procedures of the Budget Act. Again, I have \nbeen advised that rarely do they come up with a range.\n  If you have a range that is a wide range, from CBO, then I think \nperhaps the authorizing committee has not provided enough information \nso they can zero in on what that actual figure should be.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering whether the Senator from Idaho agrees with \nthe Senator from Ohio that in effect a range is not permitted or \nauthorized under this bill? And that if they cannot give a specific \namount, that they must then say it is impossible to give a specific \namount?\n  That is what the Senator from Ohio said. I am wondering whether the \nSenator from Idaho agrees with that interpretation of the manager on \nthis side?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Again, right now, I do not think this legislation \nstates what a range is--it is silent on that question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Ohio said in his judgment a range is not \npermitted under this bill and that if they cannot give a specific \namount and can only give a range, that the CBO must tell us it is \nimpossible to give a specific amount. That is what I understood the \nSenator from Ohio to be saying.\n  I am wondering whether or not the Senator from Idaho agrees with that \ninterpretation?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. No, I--again, I do not know if that is encouraging \nsome vagueness. I think the authorizing committee would say narrow that \nrange. If CBO comes back and says this is the figure or the figures, \nthen that is their estimate. It does not create the presumption that \nthey have not been able to provide an estimate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One last question on the range. I think the sponsor of the \nbill is basically saying the bill is silent. The \n[[Page S1363]] cosponsor of the bill, the Democratic manager, is saying \nin his view the bill would not allow for it. And I do not think that is \nthe right way for us to legislate. I think this is the time to clarify \nthat issue. It is an important issue, I can assure my colleague. It has \nbeen brought up in committee at some length.\n  In the event, I ask my friend from Idaho, there were a range given by \nthe CBO, and that range were $100 million to $500 million, what then \nwould be the specific amount that would have to be authorized in the \nbill in order for a point of order to be avoided?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again, I would be more than happy to \ndefer to a Senator who is on the Budget Committee to respond to this \nbecause again this is simply following that. So while this legislation \nis silent, CBO continually has been providing specific numbers. So I do \nnot know to what extent this is going to really create that unusual \nproblem and how many times. But in that event, again that number, or \nthe CBO's estimate, comes back to the authorizing committee where they \ncan deal with that and determine if they want to provide more \ninformation so CBO can then narrow it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  This is a very different process, may I say. The CBO would never have \nto determine whether or not there was a mandate that applied to local \ngovernment, what year it is effective, and it was never required to \ncreate with the specificity that is going to be needed here to avoid a \npoint of order, and involving appropriations what the estimate is of \nthe cost to 87,000 jurisdictions.\n  Sure, the CBO has made estimates before. I mean we know they have \nmade estimates for the cost to the Federal Government. But in this case \nthere are 87,000 jurisdictions. They may have to do this in a matter of \nhours.\n  OK. Let me just plow on here.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the way this is set up now is we are \nsupposed to get our estimate from the CBO. They give that estimate then \nto the Budget Committee. The Budget Committee then has authority, as a \nrange as I understand it--staff can correct me, if I am wrong on this--\nif the Budget Committee wished to, if the Budget Committee wanted to \npick a figure in their wisdom, then that would be up to them to do that \nand recommend it to the Senate. I think that is the way it is provided \nfor in the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that, when we are in \ncommittee before we get to the floor, all we have is the CBO's \nestimate.\n  Mr. GLENN. That is correct. But if the CBO has difficulty making an \nestimate or giving us a figure to go on, then it would be up to the \nBudget Committee to decide whether to give us the exact figure or to \nsay there can be no figure. I think that is the way the bill is \nstructured right now.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then the bill would have to be amended to provide that the \nBudget Committee would get involved prior to the markup of the bill in \ncommittee. Because as I understand it, it is CBO that makes the \nestimate and the Budget Committee does not become involved until the \nbill gets to the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. If the Senator will yield, I think he is correct. I think \nthe way it would work is in the committee, when you are considering the \nbill, the Budget Committee would not be involved at that point. You \nwould have a CBO estimate. There would be a range on that, and I would \nsay the figure would apply. It is when you come to the floor. Then the \nBudget Committee is required to put their judgment, their imprimatur, \ntheir approval on what the CBO has given to the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Unless the amendment of the Senator from Ohio is adopted \nthat says that the point of order is at the end of the process instead \nof the beginning--in other words, the way the bill is currently, it \nwould be out of order even to bring the bill to the floor with a range. \nThere is not a specific amount in the bill.\n  Let me just keep going to the next ambiguity. Let us assume that the \nCBO has made an estimate. Somehow or other they make an estimate that a \nbill in each of the five fiscal years is going to cost $40 million. \nThat is what the CBO estimates before the markup of the bill in \ncommittee, $40 million, in each of the five fiscal years. Nothing is \ntriggered as I understand it. Is that correct?\n  A Senator now wants to offer an amendment in my hypothetical that \nsays the following: This amendment that is in front of each of the \nmanagers says that because of a health emergency no new incinerator may \nbe built within 300 yards of a school or hospital after October 1, \n2005. That is an amendment to the bill. Again, the bill has to do with \nthe levels of mercury.\n  Question No. 1. Can a Senator even get an estimate under this bill? \nDo we have a right as individual Senators to get CBO's estimate as to \nwhat that amendment could cost? And would the managers of the bill \nsupport language which would indicate that individual Senators have a \nright to get estimates since our amendments can live or die depending \non whether we can get an estimate? If you cannot get an estimate, your \namendment is out of order. You do not even get to the point of the \namount of the estimate. If you cannot get an estimate, your amendment \nis out of order.\n  So will the Senator's support language which will allow an individual \nSenator or Member of the House to get an estimate so that his or her \namendment can be in order?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, yes. I would agree to that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend. That language is being worked on as we \nspeak.\n  The next question is this: That amendment, let us say, is to be \noffered. I am an individual Senator. I get the CBO to give me the \nestimate, and, by gosh, it comes back that that amendment is going to \ncost $20 million per year in each of the fiscal years. Here is the \nsituation we are now in. The bill says that mercury emissions change is \ngoing to be done by a certain year. CBO has scored it at $40 million a \nyear. It is not above the threshold, and nothing is triggered. I come \nalong now and offer this amendment on the setback. That is going to add \n$20 million in each year, and if adopted in committee by the committee. \nNow it comes to the floor.\n  My question is: Is the bill coming to the floor subject to a point of \norder for being above the threshold? CBO has scored the mercury \nemissions change at $40 million. The amendment adopted in committee \nwould add $20 million. The question is, Is it in order for the Senate \nto consider that bill?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, it would be my opinion that once you exceed \nthat threshold, that is a cost to the State that exceeds our Federal \nmandate for the threshold that is set and the point of order should \napply, would be my opinion. I have not gone back to the fine print. But \nthat would be what I think would be right because it would finally be \ngoing over the threshold of the State. That is what was set as our \nlimit.\n  One other comment on the Senator's hypothetical. I would think the \nhealth emergency that he mentions here, bona fide emergencies, are \nexempted from consideration of a point of order under this. If this was \nlet us say a Presidentially-declared emergency, that we have learned \nsomething new about mercury and whatever, and the distance from a \nschool or whatever, if it was a Presidentially-declared kind of an \nemergency, then I think it would all be exempted from any requirements.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to get to that issue of the emergency in a \nmoment.\n  I am wondering if the Senator from Idaho would agree that that $20 \nmillion committee amendment would push this above the threshold so it \nwould not be in order to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate, if \na point of order was raised, without raising that point of order.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes, I would agree with that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That raises two questions. One is, this is just a \ncommittee amendment, it has not been adopted by the Senate yet.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Would the Senator repeat that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The committee has adopted the amendment that costs $20 \nmillion, but the Senate has not. Why \n[[Page S1364]] would it be out of order to bring the bill to the Senate \nfloor?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes, perhaps I can clarify. I do not believe it would \nbe out of order to bring the bill up. A point of order could lie \nagainst the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, the amendment is $20 million, and $20 million is \nunder the $50 million threshold.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. But it is the mechanism that causes the threshold to \nbe exceeded.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the answer, then, if the amendment is adopted, then the \nbill would be subject to a point of order, or the amendment itself \nwould be subject to a point of order?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It is my understanding that the amendment itself \nwould be subject to a point of order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Ohio be willing to comment on that?\n  Mr. GLENN. State your question again, please.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The bill that comes out of the committee has a $40 million \nannual price tag in each of the 5 key years. There is a committee \namendment which would add $20 million to each of the 5 fiscal years, if \nthat amendment were adopted by the Senate, but it has not yet been \nadopted. The committee amendment is now offered in the Senate. Is that \namendment subject to a point of order?\n  Mr. GLENN. No, it would not be. What my proposed amendment I put in \nearlier today would say is that we would have a point of order lie at \nthe end of all consideration of the bill before a final vote. If there \nis a cumulative effect of exceeding the $50 million, then that would be \nvoted on as a point of order at the end of the process.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, there seems to be two different opinions on this \nissue. I think that it is important that the language of the bill be \nclear as to whether or not a point of order would lie against a bill \ncoming out of the Committee, which does not violate the threshold, \nbefore a committee amendment is considered.\n  Second, is the amendment of the committee subject to a point of order \nbefore it is even adopted? There are two different opinions on that \nissue from the managers, and I think that ought to be clarified. May I \nsay that, in any event, it would be another reason why the amendment of \nthe Senator from Ohio putting the point of order at the end is, I \nthink, a wise approach to this.\n  Mr. President, on the emergency issue--and I see that the majority \nleader is on the floor, and I have a hunch that means he would like to \nsee this colloquy come to an end. I think the managers may join him in \nthat feeling because it has been a long day for them.\n  I will just ask this last question and we will pick this up tomorrow. \nIf a bill says that there is an emergency situation, for instance, on \nthe setback issue on the school, how would a President declare an \nemergency? In other words, if the bill itself says that there is an \nemergency and the President signs the bill, does that meet the test of \nthis emergency requirement? The language on page 13 says ``that the \nPresident designates as emergency legislation.'' I do not know of any \nmechanism for that to happen. ``And the Congress so designates in a \nstatute.''\n  My question is: If the statute states that this is emergency \nlegislation, would not the signature of the President to it satisfy \nsubsection 6 on page 13? That is my question. If the answer is no, \nwould the sponsors tell me how does a President designate legislation \nas emergency legislation? Does that mean we could not induce the \nlegislation, that we would have to wait for some kind of a designation \nfrom the White House?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again, following the Budget Act, \nSenate bill No. 1 goes under the Budget Act. The current process is \nthat the President would send a letter to Congress stating that there \nis an emergency. The Congress would then include in the legislation the \nstatement that an emergency exists.\n  So it is a two-pronged approach. First, a letter from the President, \nand then the legislation which would include the acknowledgement of an \nemergency.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then my understanding of the answer of the distinguished \nmanager is that in order for this subsection to be invoked, and an \nexception to the point of order requirement or language be applicable, \nthe President must initiate by letter legislation and designate it as \nemergency legislation, and we as individual Senators, or Members of the \nHouse, could not introduce legislation with that designation and avoid \nthe point of order in the absence of that prior letter; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, that is the current procedure with the \nBudget Act. But I state to the second part of that, could not Congress \ninitiate something--again, you could seek a waiver of the point of \norder. That may be your justification.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there have been a number of statements on \nthe floor which are going to help me shape amendments. I think what I \nwould like to do--again, I see the distinguished majority leader on the \nfloor. I would at this point thank the managers of the bill for \nengaging in these colloquies. I think they are absolutely critical to \nclarify legislation which is going to affect just about every amendment \nand bill that comes to the floor, and new points of order are being \ncreated. We should think these through and make sure they are clear. \nSome of the amendments which I think now can be offered--some of which \nI believe will now have the support of the managers--perhaps will \nclarify that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I know the distinguished majority leader \nwants the floor shortly. But let me comment briefly here. I think \nSenator Levin has brought up a number of very good points. They are \nexcellent points and things we should have worked out before we go \nahead with this landmark legislation. It is landmark legislation. We \nare reversing a trend here of some 60 years, and we better do it right \nand make sure it is going to work.\n  When we talk about this on the floor--and I will not go through all \nof the arguments at this hour of the evening, but I doubt very much if \nwe are going to be able to answer all of the very good questions with \namendments by 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. I do not see how that is \npossible. We may want to think about this overnight and perhaps address \nthis tomorrow. I am not saying this is an effort to delay this. These \nhave been honest-to-goodness questions on how this would operate. There \nhave been 5 or 6 points made to things we do not have the answers to, \nand we should try to get answers for as many things as possible.\n  I do not think we can take every possible ``what if'' and make sure \neverything is covered perfectly, because this bill was designed to be a \ngeneral guidance-type bill. On the other hand, where specifics are \nbrought up that indicate there would be a problem, I think it is \nincumbent upon us to address these things when we can. I am not \nproposing that we extend the time tomorrow for proposals that would \ndeal with what the Senator from Michigan has brought up this evening. \nBut I wanted to raise this as a possibility, because I do not think we \nare going to be able to put this all together by 3 o'clock tomorrow \nmorning. Maybe the staffs can get together and we can talk about this \ntomorrow and see how we can work it out. I do not know whether the \nmajority leader has been listening in his office or working on other \nthings. I think he would have to agree that there are real questions \nthat should be worked out before we lock this up for final passage. I \nopen that up as a possibility for tomorrow that we want to consider \nsome time tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio. We will work \nhard overnight as well to try to cast language for the additional \namendments to address some of these issues and do our very best to meet \nthe timetable.\n  Mr. DOLE. And, of course, if the amendments are offered, we can have \na discussion after 3. I guess the question would be whether there are \nsome amendments that did not get offered. But if it is some critical \namendment, then I think, under the order, the two leaders could agree \nto make an exception to the 3 o'clock cutoff, which, if it \n[[Page S1365]] is a legitimate amendment, I think that is what we \nshould do.\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 178\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota raises some \nworthwhile points.\n  The formulation of monetary policy ought to be of interest to all of \nus, and he is right to raise questions.\n  I, too, have questions about the Fed's operation of monetary policy. \nI've been concerned for a long time that the Fed, despite its \nindependence, was forced to meet more policy goals than it is capable \nof meeting.\n  In fact, Chairman Greenspan has told me in a public hearing that the \nHumphrey Hawkins Act forces the Fed to act in such a way that he \nbelieves is not in the long-term best interest of American jobs and the \neconomy.\n  For this and other reasons, I plan to hold hearings in both the Joint \nEconomic Committee and the Banking Committee to examine amendments to \nHumphrey Hawkins. The Senator from North Dakota will, I'm sure, be very \ninterested in changing Humphrey Hawkins because such changes should \nkeep interest rates much lower than we have been used to.\n  We ought to save this debate for a few more weeks and not delay \npassing the unfunded mandates bill. I can assure the Senator from North \nDakota that the issue of monetary policy will be aired fully.\n  The Dorgan amendment should be tabled, and I encourage my colleagues \nto do so.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, State and local governments have been paying \nbillions of dollars to comply with unfunded Federal mandates since the \n1970's. As the Federal budget gets tighter it becomes more tempting to \npass legislation telling State and local governments how they must \nspend more and more of their resources. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office roughly 10 to 20 bills that are reported out of \ncommittees every year contain unfunded Federal mandates of over $200 \nmillion each. This seemingly endless stream of legislation imposing \ngreater burdens on our cities and States is what prompted me to \nintroduce legislation in the 102d Congress similar to what is being \nconsidered today.\n  The time is long overdue to focus attention not only on the benefits \nbestowed by legislation we pass, but also on the burdens imposed by the \nlegislation. Some of this legislation, while noble and well-intended, \nhas had the effect of thrusting Federal policymakers into the limelight \nas champions of a cause, while leaving the price tag for implementation \nwith the State and local governments. Unfunded mandates place an \nunbearable strain on local budgets that are already burdened by local \ndemand and, in effect, force back-door tax increases to cover mandated \ncosts.\n  State and local resources don't automatically rise whenever the \nFederal Government requires new spending. As a result, State and local \npriorities get subordinated. For example, suppose the top priority for \nthe city of Tallahassee is combating drugs and crime, or they need to \nreplace wornout firefighting equipment. When the Federal Government \nmandates that Tallahassee spend x dollars on housing and asbestos \nremoval, or face heavy fines for noncompliance, they effectively \nscuttle the city's top priority. The dollars used to build housing or \nremove asbestos are not available for addressing drugs and crime or \nfighting fires.\n  Some local governments have responded to the crush of mandates by \nraising revenue through imposing greater fee for building permits, \nwater and sewer hookups, and subdivision approvals. Localities have \nalso\n imposed development impact fees that total thousands of dollars. The \nNational Association of Home Builders estimates that the impact fees in \nthe State of Florida total $5,000 per home.\n\n  In a State like Florida, the issue of unfunded Federal mandates is \neven more serious given the tendency by the Federal Government to \nignore Florida's growth when determining the State's share of Federal \nfunds.\n  This legislation will help us focus on a problem that has been \ngrowing for decades. In the future we will not pass legislation without \nknowing what it costs and who is going to pay for it. It is simply \nunfair to force State and local governments to choose between complying \nwith Federal mandates and their more immediate local needs. I urge the \nswift passage of this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1356-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, recently, I had the pleasure of meeting with \nMr. Michal Strak, the chief of the Office of the Polish Council of \nMinisters. Mr. Strak brought to my attention Poland's activities with \nregard to Poles living in the former Soviet Union, and I would like to \nshare some of that information with my colleagues today.\n  With the end of the cold war, Poland has been able to reestablish \nlinks with ethnic Poles throughout the former Soviet Union. The Polish \ncommunity in the New Independent States is comprised of descendants of \nPoles who were exiled there during the 1930's. Poles suffered great \nlosses during World War II, due in part to the mass deportation of \nPolish citizens. Many were pressed into forced labor and others died of \nhunger and disease. Those who survived became victims of the Soviet \nsystem, isolated from their homeland. Until recently, their descendants \nhave had few opportunities to learn the Polish language or culture.\n  Poland, which itself is undergoing major reform, maintains an active \noutreach program to the Polish community in the former Soviet Union--\nparticularly Kazakhstan where more than 100,000 people of Polish origin \nreside. Many of these activities focus on language training, with \nPolish nongovernmental organizations providing Polish language teachers \nand textbooks, and the Polish Government offering scholarships for \nethnic Poles to study in Poland. The Polish Government is also seeking \nto encourage and support business links between the Polish community in \ncountries such as Kazakhstan and Poland.\n  These activities play an important role in helping the people of the \nNew Independent States establish ties with the West. The Government of \nPoland is to be commended for its efforts to assist the Polish \ncommunities in their democratization and economic reform efforts.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1365-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1365-S1366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GERALD F. HAMRA\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to pay \ntribute to a good friend and a favorite son of my home State of \nArkansas. I am referring to Gerald ``Jerry'' Hamra, a man known as much \nfor his charity and his devotion to family as he is for his success in \nthe competitive world of fast-food franchising.\n  Jerry Hamra grew up as the son of a clothing salesman in Steele, MO. \nHe likes to joke about his upbringing and his Lebanese heritage by \nreferring to himself as ``the rag merchant's son.'' Today, as chairman \nof the board and CEO of Wendy's of Little Rock, Inc., Jerry owns 33 \nWendy's hamburger franchises in Arkansas--not bad for a rag merchant's \nson.\n  I once asked Jerry what led him to get into the hamburger business. \nHe told me ``I didn't have any choice--I had just gone belly up in a \nswimming pool franchise business and I needed the work.'' That \nstatement belies the savvy and business acumen that we in Arkansas have \ncome to equate with Jerry Hamra.\n  Jerry first came into Little Rock in 1974 and opened his first \nArkansas-based Wendy's in 1975. It was the beginning of a remarkable \nsuccess story. He has been recognized time and again by Wendy's \nInternational for his commitment to excellence. In 1990, he received \nthe business' highest honor when he became the first franchisee to be \ninducted into the Wendy's Hall of Fame.\n  Those of us who have known him for so long also know that the success \nof Jerry Hamra, the businessman, is directly linked to the life of \nJerry Hamra, the human being. Jerry once told me that his priorities \nare ``God, \n[[Page S1366]] family, and then business--and business is way down on \nthe list.'' His concern for people dictates his outlook on business. He \nis a big believer in hard work, and his pet peeves are a wrong order \nand an unclean facility. But on the opposite side, his favorite way of \ndealing with employees is to find a way to compliment them.\n  Jerry is also known for his love of children--other people's as well \nas his own. Locally, he is what you might call the pied piper of \nhamburgers. He always carries coupons for free burgers in his back \npocket and passes them out to children wherever he sees them. But he \nhas also shown that generosity and compassion for children on a much \nlarger scale. In 1987, Jerry donated and dedicated the therapeutic pool \nat Arkansas Children's Hospital, the only one of its kind in Arkansas. \nIn 1992 he was named Citizen of the Year by the Arkansas chapter of the \nMarch of Dimes.\n  Jerry Hamra is truly known in Arkansas as much for his benevolence \nand his many kindnesses to other people as he is for anything he has \naccomplished in the business world. He once told me he was so \ncharitable because, as he put it, ``Arkansas has given me so much, I \ncan never fully pay it back.'' Well, on behalf of all Arkansans, I want \nto tell Jerry how grateful we are that, 20 years ago, he chose Arkansas \nas his home. Jerry is currently battling cancer, and I want him to know \nthat he and his fine family are very much in the thoughts of the Pryor \nfamily and of countless people across the State of Arkansas. I know my \ncolleagues join me in wishing Jerry a speedy recovery and continued \nsuccess.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1365-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CAVALIERS SOCCER TEAM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, approximately 1 year ago, on February 23, \n1994, Senator Warner remarked for this Record that the University of \nVirginia soccer team had reached an athletic pinnacle never before \nachieved: three successive NCAA national championships. I joined \nSenator Warner and Senator Robb in recognizing this team's achievement \nwith special ceremonies in the U.S. Capitol and with President Clinton \nand Vice President Gore at the White House.\n  I mention this as a prelude to the Cavaliers' most recent \nachievement. On December 11, the Virginia Cavaliers soccer team \ndefeated the Indiana Hoosiers by a score of 1-0 to claim an \nunprecedented fourth consecutive National College Athletic Association \ntitle.\n  The Washington Post reported that:\n\n       The Cavaliers (22-3-1) certainly had a lot to overcome. Top \n     ranked Indiana University (23-3) was considered to have the \n     best chance at knocking off fifth-ranked Virginia, which some \n     felt wasn't as strong as previous years. Midfielder Claudio \n     Reyna, the nation's top player the previous two seasons, had \n     left a year early to play for the 1994 U.S. World Cup team \n     and then professionally in Germany.\n       Indiana, on the other hand, had eight seniors who were \n     hungry for a title after falling short of expectations in \n     previous years. Its midfield also was rated as the nation's \n     best [with two All Americans]. But none of that seemed to \n     matter once the game started.\n\n  I was fortunate to attend the NCAA championship played at Davidson \nUniversity in North Carolina. I can report without equivocation that \nthe UVA Cavaliers showed grit, determination, and heart as they \nsuccessfully defended their NCAA championship. Each team member \ndisplayed courage time and again in a season marked with obstacles and \nduring a championship game described as ``more like a rugby match than \na soccer game.''\n  The significance of this team's triumph was best summed up by head \ncoach Bruce Arena, who commented that the team ``accomplished something \nthat may never be accomplished in Division I men's athletics again. We \nknew that things were a little tough going in, but great teams rise to \nthe occasion, and that's what happened here.''\n  Coach Bruce Arena and his fine staff--assistant coach George \nGelnovatch graduate assistant coach Bob Willen, trainer Sue Foreman, \nand managers Elizabeth Williams and Brighid O'Donnell--are to be \ncommended for their dedication and hard work.\n  Special recognition and attention must, Mr. President, be focused on \nthe team's seniors. Each senior--a winner of four national titles--will \nlong be remembered as the finest. A.J. Wood and Nate Friends as \nstrikers were the best combination of speed, power, and finesse in the \nNation. Clint Peay overcame injuries and a changed position to remain a \nstar. Tain Nix played steady, stellar soccer all year.\n  The fine young men who make up the team are true role models for our \nyouth, and they also deserve recognition and commendation. The names of \nall members of this great soccer team are to be included in the \nCongressional Record where they will become a permanent part of our \nNation's history:\n  Tom Baker, defender, Plymouth, MI.\n  Ryan Borst, midfielder/defender, Ridgefield, CT.\n  Diallo Bryan, forward/midfielder, Silver Spring, MD.\n  Sean Feary, midfielder/defender, Fairfax Station, VA.\n  Mike Fisher, midfielder, Doylestown, PA.\n  David Fitzmaurice, midfielder, Arlington, VA.\n  Sam Franklin, midfielder, Arlington, VA.\n  Nate Friends, forward, Great Falls, VA.\n  Scott Hodge, goalkeeper, Oakton, VA.\n  Adam Jacoby, goalkeeper, Clifton, VA.\n  Stephen Johnson, forward/defender, Lexington, KY.\n  Matt Laughlin, midfielder, Fairfax Station, VA.\n  Matt Leanard, forward, Fairfax Station, VA.\n  Christian Nix, midfielder, Fairfax, VA.\n  Clint Peay, defender, Columbia, MD.\n  Mark Peters, goalkeeper, Winchester, VA.\n  Brandon Pollard, defender, Richmond, VA.\n  Key Reid, midfielder, Searchlight, NV.\n  Yuri Sagatov, goalkeeper, Fairfax, VA.\n  Andriy Shapowal, midfielder, Chagrin Falls, OH.\n  Damian Silvera, midfielder, Huntington, NY.\n  Joaquin Targhetta, midfielder, Reston, VA.\n  Billy Walsh, midfielder, Chatham Township, NY.\n  A.J.

Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the statements \nmade by Bell Atlantic and others concerning the so-called privatization \nof public broadcasting. In my view, the so-called privatization of \npublic broadcasting could bring an end to the system of public \nbroadcasting as we know it. While this may be the goal of certain \nlegislators, this is not what the American people want. Three recent \npolls have concluded that the overwhelming majority of Americans \nsupport continued funding for public broadcasting.\n  I have always supported efforts to make public broadcasting more \nefficient and less costly. In the last Congress, I introduced a bill \ncalling for a freeze in the authorized levels of funding for public \nbroadcasting. Placing public broadcasting in the hands of private, \ncorporate entities, however, would simply turn public broadcasting into \nmore of the same advertising-driven, profit-motivated commercial \nbroadcasting that we have today. Americans already receive too much \nviolence and profanity on the commercial broadcast stations. What \nAmerica needs is more educational programming, more children's \nprogramming, more family-oriented programming. This is what public \nbroadcasting provides.\n  There is no substitute for the programming provided by public \nbroadcasting today. Cable television is received by only 60 percent of \nAmericans, while public broadcasting reaches 98 percent of the American \npublic. Almost twice as many children watch public television than \nwatch similar programs on cable.\n  Congress spends only $1 per American per year on public broadcasting. \nThis is a small price to pay for the education of our Nation's children \nand adults.\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1366-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/23/senate-section/article/S1367-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF DISASTER ASSISTANCE TO JAPAN--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM \n                                   2\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I have directed the Secretary of Defense to provide appropriate \ndisaster assistance to the Government of Japan in response to the \ndevastating earthquake of January 17, 1995.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional safeguards to protect taxpayer rights; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                     the taxpayer bill of rights ii\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am very sorry my colleagues and chief \ncosponsor of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II, Senator Grassley of Iowa, \nhas been detained. He is at the White House. I think later in the day \nhe will speak on this subject matter.\n  Mr. President, over the past several years, there has been extensive \ndebate over ways to achieve tax fairness for middle-income Americans. \nProposals are most often costly, and very, very partisan. But there is \none legislative package helping taxpayers, Mr. President, that \ntranscends political boundaries and costs very little--we call it the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights II.\n  So, as the debate once again heats up on ways to achieve tax fairness \nfor middle-income Americans, I want to draw attention to this \nlegislation which will help bolster taxpayer confidence in dealing with \nthe Government by ensuring taxpayers are treated fairly by the tax \ncollector--the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues in the Senate today were not \nhere in 1988 when Congress passed, and President Reagan signed into \nlaw, the first Taxpayer Bill of Rights. That bill was the first ever \ncomprehensive piece of legislation enumerating the rights of taxpayers. \nFor example:\n  The right of the taxpayer to be informed of their rights;\n  The right of the taxpayer to rely on written advice of the IRS;\n  The right of the taxpayer to representation; and\n  The right of the taxpayer to recover civil damages and attorneys fees \nfrom the IRS.\n  I might note that this particular legislation, the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights, which was signed into law in 1988, was the very first piece of \nlegislation throughout recorded American history that gave the \ntaxpayers of America their due rights.\n  Mr. President, these basic, commonsense provisions were codified by \nthe first Taxpayer Bill of Rights. The battle waged by a strongly \nbipartisan coalition for their codification was hard fought and their \nultimate enactment was a giant first step for the American taxpayer. \nBut the time is overdue to more fully develop and expand these rights.\n  Mr. President, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II is the next natural \nstep which builds on the first effort in 1988.\n  In 1992, I first introduced the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II with a \nconsiderable bipartisan backing of 52 of my colleagues. The bill passed \nCongress twice that year but was ultimately vetoed because it was \nincluded as part of two large tax bills with which President Bush did \nnot agree.\n  Since these two bills were vetoed, the Senate has not had the \nopportunity to consider the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II. However, Mr. \nPresident, I believe the time is now to enact this legislation, and I \nam committed to work along side my friend and colleague Senator \nGrassley to push taxpayer rights forward and in the coming months to \nlook for additional ways to ensure the IRS treats taxpayers with \nrespect.\n  Today, Senator Grassley and I come to the floor, once again, with a \nstrong bipartisan contingent in support of this bill--20 cosponsors--12 \nDemocrats and 8 Republicans--a bill which builds on the foundation laid \nby the original Taxpayer Bill of Rights and is the next natural step in \nrequiring the IRS to achieve higher standards of accuracy, timeliness, \nand fair play in providing taxpayer service.\n  The Taxpayer Bill of Rights II achieves these new standards through \n27 provisions, including:\n  First, expanding the authority of the taxpayer advocate to prevent \nhardships on taxpayers.\n  Second, create the right in small taxpayers to an installment \nagreement, and further, rights when installment agreements are denied \nor terminated.\n  Third, require the IRS to abate interest when it has made an \nunreasonable error or delay, and enable the courts the power to review \nthe interest abatement determination.\n  Fourth, increase the rights of taxpayers to recover civil damages \nagainst the IRS when it has acted negligently or recklessly.\n  Fifth, strengthen the code so a taxpayer may recover out-of-pocket \ncosts incurred in a case in which the IRS position was not \nsubstantially justified.\n  Sixth, and, prohibit the IRS from issuing retroactive proposed \nregulations unless the Congress provides otherwise.\n  These are some of the examples of the 27 provisions that Senator \nGrassley and our 20 cosponsors in the Senate in a bipartisan effort \nwill bring to this body for action later in this session.\n  Mr. President, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II contains many more \ncommonsense provisions designed to safeguard the rights of taxpayers, \nand I believe, will work to instill some confidence into our system of \ntaxation.\n  Mr. President, joining me later in the day, as I have mentioned, is \nmy friend and colleague, Senator Grassley. We worked very hard on these \nprovisions in the past, and we look forward to our work in the future.\n  Let me name one other individual who has worked very, very hard in \nthis field and that, of course, is Senator Harry Reid of Nevada.\n  Senator Reid came from the House of Representatives to the Senate. \nMr. President, one day I was presiding in the chair when the Democrats \nhad control of the Senate. I noticed over to my far extreme right that \nSenator Reid of Nevada was making his very first maiden speech in the \nSenate. And it was about taxpayers' rights. I, too, had been interested \nin this issue. I called for a page to come up, and I handed the page a \nnote. I said, ``Harry Reid, I want to work with you on this provision \nthat you are so concerned about.'' Ultimately, Senator Reid, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Levin, and many of us worked through the course of \nthat year in developing the Taxpayer Bill of Rights I, which was in \nfact signed into law.\n  So it has been a great pleasure and honor to have worked with these \nfine Members of the Senate, I must say in a very bipartisan way. As the \nFinance Committee continues its march of progress, let us say during \nthe next several months, I look forward to the development now of \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights II and working with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I think there are other Senators who seek recognition.\n\n[[Page S1370]]\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again sing on \nas a cosponsor to the bill introduced by Senator Pryor, the taxpayer \nbill of rights II. I was a cosponsor of this important legislation in \nboth the 102d and 103d Congress.\n  Over the years, many have cited abused by the IRS during tax audits \nand collection. Aware of these types of problems, Congress passed the \ntaxpayer bill of rights in 1988. While the original bill was in many \nways successful, it is clear that further action is necessary.\n  The taxpayer bill of rights II builds on the success of the original \nbill, and provides taxpayers with expanded protections against improper \ncollection techniques. This legislation expands protection for \ntaxpayers by requiring the IRS to pay legal fees when it loses in \ncourt, increases from $100,000 to $1 million the cap on damages a \ntaxpayer can collect from the IRS, and revokes the agencies authority \nto issue retroactive regulations.\n  The bill also establishes a better taxpayer advocate within the IRS \nwho will have the authority to intervene and help taxpayers cases, and \nincreases taxpayers' ability to get a fair hearing in disputes with the \nIRS.\n  It is unfortunate that this bill is necessary; however, in such a \nmonumental task as collecting taxes it is inevitable that there will be \nmistakes made. This bill will help to ensure that taxpayers are not \nforced to pay for the mistakes for which they had no control over.\n  I have heard too many times from anguished constituents in Nevada \nregarding their dealings with the IRS. While dealing with discrepancies \nwith the IRS is never an enjoyable experience, once this bill becomes \nlaw taxpayers will finally have their rights protected.\n  In past sessions of Congress, this bill has received overwhelming \nbipartisan support. I am hopeful that we can again join together, pass \nthis bill and give taxpayers the rights that they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                    Taxpayer Bill of Rights II (T2)\n\n\n                         A.--TAXPAYER ADVOCATE\n\n       Section 101. Establishment of Position of Taxpayer Advocate \n     within Internal Revenue Service. The Office of the Taxpayer \n     Ombudsman was statutorily created in 1987 in the Omnibus \n     Taxpayer Bill of Rights. The Ombudsman is presently hired by \n     and reports directly to the IRS Commissioner.\n       T2 will replace the Ombudsman with the new Office of \n     Taxpayer Advocate which will have expanded authority as \n     provided in A.2 below. The Taxpayer Advocate will continue to \n     be hired by and report to the IRS Commissioner.\n       Presently, the Office of the Taxpayer Ombudsman carries out \n     its duties and responsibilities in the local field offices \n     through the Problem Resolution Office (PRO). However, PROs \n     are hired, supervised, reviewed, and promoted by the local \n     IRS District Director, not the Ombudsman. T2 will provide \n     that the PRO will report directly to the Office of Taxpayer \n     Advocate.\n       T2 will require the Taxpayer Advocate to provide the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the U.S. \n     Senate two annual reports. The first report is on the \n     activities of the Taxpayer Advocate during the previous \n     fiscal year. The report must identify the initiatives the \n     Taxpayer Advocate has taken to improve taxpayer services and \n     IRS responsiveness, contain recommendations received from \n     individuals who have the authority to issue a TAO, contain a \n     summary of at least 20 of the most serious problems which \n     taxpayers have in dealing with the IRS, describe in detail \n     the progress made in implementing these recommendations, \n     include recommendations for such administrative and \n     legislative action as may be appropriate to resolve such \n     problems, and to include other such information as the \n     Taxpayer Advocate may deem advisable. The Commissioner is \n     required to establish procedures that will ensure a formal \n     IRS response to all recommendations submitted by the Taxpayer \n     Advocate. The first report is due not later than December 31 \n     for each fiscal year after September 30, 1995.\n       In the second report, the Taxpayer Advocate must furnish to \n     the tax writing committees its annual objectives, not later \n     than December 31 of each calendar year after 1994.\n       All reports should contain full and substantive analysis, \n     in addition to statistical information.\n       Effective Date.--The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment except for the specified due dates of the above \n     reports.\n       Section 102. Expansion of Authority of the Taxpayer to \n     Issue Taxpayer Assistance Orders. Under current law, section \n     7811(a) authorizes the Taxpayer Ombudsman to issue a Taxpayer \n     Assistance Order (TAO) if, in the determination of the \n     Ombudsman, the taxpayer is suffering or about to suffer a \n     ``significant hardship'' as a result of the manner in which \n     the tax laws are being administered by the Secretary.\n       T2 eliminates the qualifier of ``significant'' hardship \n     from section 7811 to allow PROs to assist taxpayers in \n     avoiding hardship before it occurs since the standard of \n     ``significant'' hardship presupposes that a taxpayer must be \n     some degree of hardship before any relief can be afforded.\n       Currently under section 7811(b), a TAO allows a PRO to \n     ``cease any [IRS] action'' with respect to a taxpayer. \n     However, section 7811(b) does not allow the terms of a TAO to \n     authorize affirmative steps to help a taxpayer.\n       T2 will authorize the terms of a TAO to ``cease any action, \n     take any action'' with respect to a taxpayer, and therefore, \n     allow a TAO to both stop IRS action and to take affirmative \n     steps with respect to a taxpayer. For example, the Taxpayer \n     Advocate's new scope of power will specifically include, but \n     not be limited to, the authority to (1) abate assessments, \n     (2) grant refund requests, and (3) stay collection activity. \n     Further, a TAO may specify a period of time within which the \n     TAO must be followed. The Taxpayer Advocate will have the \n     power to grant authority to his or her designees (i.e., the \n     Problems Resolution Officers).\n       Current law provides that a TAO may be modified or \n     rescinded by the Ombudsman, a district director, a service \n     center director, a compliance center director, a regional \n     director of appeals, or any superior of such person.\n       T2 provides that a TAO may be modified or rescinded only by \n     the Taxpayer Advocate and/or the IRS Commissioner.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n         b.--modifications to installment agreement provisions\n\n       Section 201. Taxpayer's Right to Installment Agreement. T2 \n     amends section 6159 to provide that, upon request, an \n     individual taxpayer has an automatic right to an installment \n     agreement if the taxpayer has not been delinquent in the \n     previous 3 years and the liability is under $10,000.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for installment \n     agreements entered after the date of enactment.\n       Section 202. Running of Failure to Pay Penalty Suspended \n     During Period Section 111 Installment Agreement in Effect. \n     Under present law, a taxpayer is subject to ``failure to \n     pay'' penalties even though he of she has agreed to pay his \n     or her tax liability with interest by entering into an \n     installment agreement.\n       T2 will amend current law to prevent the IRS from imposing \n     the ``failure to pay'' on installment agreements, under \n     section 111 above, where the taxpayer requests an agreement \n     on or before the due date of the tax return.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for installment \n     agreements entered after the date of enactment.\n       Section 203. Notification of Reasons for Termination of \n     Installment Agreements. Section 6159(b)(3) presently requires \n     the IRS to give the taxpayer a 30-day notice before \n     terminating an installment agreement, if it is determined \n     that the financial condition of the taxpayer has \n     significantly changed. However, no notice is required if the \n     taxpayer defaults for any other reason. In these cases, the \n     IRS may unilaterally terminate the installment agreement with \n     no notice to the taxpayer.\n       T2 will require the IRS to provide a taxpayer with a 30-day \n     notice before terminating an installment agreement for any \n     reason except when the collection of the tax is determined to \n     be in jeopardy. In addition, T2 will require the notice to \n     include the reason(s) why the IRS considers the installment \n     agreement to be in default.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective six months \n     after the date of enactment.\n       Section 204. Administrative Review of Termination or Denial \n     of Request for Installment Agreement. Under present law, a \n     taxpayer has no right to an independent review of a \n     termination or denial of his request for an installment \n     agreement.\n       T2 will require the IRS to establish procedures for an \n     independent administrative review of a termination of or \n     denial of a request, for an installment agreement. T2 will \n     also require the IRS to provide a written response to a \n     taxpayer who requested an installment agreement. The written \n     response must state the decision of the IRS and the basis for \n     such decision. Finally, T2 will require the IRS to include in \n     the instructions for filing Federal income tax returns the \n     rules and procedures for requesting installment agreements.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective January 1, \n     1996.\n\n\n                              c.--interest\n\n       Section 301. Expansion of Authority to Abate Interest. \n     Section 6404(e)(1) (Assessment of interest attributable to \n     errors and delays by the IRS) provides ``the Secretary may \n     abate'' interest on ``any deficiency in whole or in part to \n     [due to] any error or delay by an officer or employee of the \n     IRS (acting in his official capacity) in performing a \n     ministerial act''.\n       The ministerial act requirement too narrowly limits the \n     possibility of relief to the taxpayer with the result that \n     the IRS does not abate interest even if it is the IRS' fault. \n     Further, IRS rejection of a taxpayer request \n     [[Page S1371]] to abate interest cannot be reviewed because \n     section 6404(e)(1) provides no authorization for courts to \n     review an IRS rejection and no appropriate standard of \n     review. The resulting interest assessment may be especially \n     onerous on small taxpayers who do not have cash on hand to \n     invest in anticipation of paying future tax assessments.\n       T2 will provide that for qualified small taxpayers, as \n     defined in section 7430(c)(4)(A)(iii), the Secretary must \n     abate or refund interest when the IRS has made an \n     unreasonable error or delay. This will allow courts to review \n     the IRS determination on the abatement of interest issue for \n     small taxpayers. For nonqualified ``larger'' taxpayers, \n     courts will still not be allowed to review the IRS \n     determination on the interest abatement issue, however, the \n     new standard of review will allow the IRS more flexibility in \n     providing relief.\n       Section 302. Extension of Interest-Free Period for Payment \n     of Tax After Notice and Demand. When the IRS sends a first \n     notice requesting payment to a taxpayer, section 6601(e) \n     provides a 10-day interest-free period from the date of the \n     notice. The 10-day requirement is virtually impossible to \n     meet given delivery time to and from the taxpayer attempting \n     to timely remit payment.\n       T2 will extend taxpayers' interest-free period for payment \n     of the tax liability reflected in the first notice from 10 \n     days to 21 days, when the total tax liability on the notice \n     of deficiency is less than $100,000.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies in the case of any \n     notice and demand given six months after the date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n                           D.--Joint Returns\n\n       Section 401. Disclosure of Collection Activities. Present \n     law does not allow the IRS to inform either spouse as to the \n     efforts of the IRS to collect the tax liability from the \n     other spouse.\n       T2 will permit that, if either spouse or former spouse \n     makes a written request, the IRS is required to disclose in \n     writing whether the IRS has attempted to collect the \n     deficiency from his or her spouse or former spouse, the \n     general nature of such collection activities, and the amount \n     collected. The IRS may refuse such request in cases where \n     disclosure of such information may result in the threat of \n     physical danger or harassment to a taxpayer.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n       Section 402. Joint Return May Be Made After Separate \n     Returns Without Full Payment of Tax. Under section \n     6013(b)(2), taxpayers, who file separate returns and \n     subsequently determine that their tax liability would have \n     been less if they had filed a joint return, may not reduce \n     their tax liability by filing jointly unless they are able to \n     pay the entire amount of the joint return liability before \n     the expiration of the 3-year period for making the election.\n       T2 will repeal the provision requiring full payment of the \n     tax liability as a precondition to taxpayers switching from \n     married filing separately to married filing jointly status.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to taxable years \n     beginning after the date of the enactment.\n\n\n                       e.--collection activities\n\n       Section 501. Modifications to Lien and Levy Provisions. A \n     Notice of tax lien provides public notice that a taxpayer \n     owes the government money. Section 6326(b) requires the IRS \n     to issue a Certificate of Release for such notices for \n     erroneous liens only. This extremely narrow language prevents \n     the IRS from issuing the Release on premature or incorrectly \n     filed liens.\n       T2 will give discretion to the IRS to remove such liens \n     without prejudice when (1) the filing of the notice was \n     premature or not in accordance with administration procedures \n     of the IRS; (2) the taxpayer has entered into an installment \n     agreement for the payment of the tax liability with respect \n     to the tax on which the lien is imposed; (3) the withdrawal \n     of the lien will facilitate the collection of the tax \n     liability; or (4) the withdrawal of the lien would be in the \n     best interest of the taxpayer and the United States (with the \n     best interests of the taxpayer to be determined by the \n     Taxpayer Advocate).\n       T2 will require that, upon written request by the taxpayer \n     in the 4 cases cited above, the IRS shall make prompt efforts \n     to notify the credit reporting agencies specified that the \n     notice has been withdrawn. T2 will also require the IRS to \n     return levied-upon-property to the taxpayer in the 4 above \n     cited cases.\n       T2 will raise the levy exemption amounts of $1500 for \n     personal property and of $1100 for equipment and property for \n     a trade, business, or profession, which were set in 1990, to \n     the present indexed amounts of $1750 and $1250, respectively.\n       Effective date.--The provisions are effective on the date \n     of enactment.\n       Section 502. Offers-in-Compromise. Section 7122 provides \n     that the IRS may settle a tax debt pursuant to an offer-in-\n     compromise. Amounts over $500 can be accepted only if the \n     reasons for the acceptance are documented in detail and \n     supported by an opinion of the IRS Chief Counsel. Further, \n     section 6103(k) requires public disclosure of the names of \n     taxpayers whose tax debts are compromised, as well as the \n     amount owed and the amount accepted by the Government. These \n     burdensome requirements result in the IRS not pursuing the \n     offer-in-compromise route in settling even small tax \n     disputes.\n       T2 will provide that, in cases where the unpaid tax \n     assessment is less than $50,000, the opinion of the IRS Chief \n     Counsel is not required. However, the IRS shall subject these \n     offers-in-compromise to an IRS quality review. Further, T2 \n     will amend 6103(k) to provide that in cases where the unpaid \n     tax assessment is less than $50,000, the offer-in-compromise \n     will not be subject to public disclosure.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n       Section 503. Notification of Examination. Presently, in \n     many cases, the IRS is approaching taxpayers, requesting \n     books and records, but not notifying taxpayers of \n     examination. If the taxpayer is contacted and the agent \n     requests to review the taxpayer's books and records, a \n     written notice, followed by an examination report, should be \n     required.\n       T2 will amend section 7605 to require that the IRS give the \n     taxpayer written notice that the taxpayer is under \n     examination. The notice will be required for examinations \n     under all sub-titles of the Code. Such notice will include an \n     explanation of the process as described in section 7521 \n     (explanation of examination process, right to be represented \n     by an attorney, etc.).\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n       Section 504. Increase in Limit on Recovery of Civil Damage. \n     Section 7433 caps civil damage awards for unauthorized \n     collections actions against the IRS at $100,000. Section 7433 \n     also limits recovery to reckless and intentional'' actions of \n     the IRS.\n       T2 will increase the $100,000 cap for ``reckless and \n     intentional actions'' to $1 million, and in addition, T2 will \n     include recovery for ``negligent'' actions of the IRS capped \n     at $100,000.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to actions by IRS \n     employees that occur after the date of enactment.\n       Section 505. Designated Summons. T2 requires that issuance \n     of any designated summons with respect to a corporation's tax \n     return be preceded by review of such issuance by the Regional \n     Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel to the IRS, for the Region \n     in which the examination of the corporation's return is being \n     conducted.\n       In addition, T2 requires that the corporation whose return \n     is in issue be promptly notified in writing in any case where \n     the Secretary issues a designated summons (or another \n     summons, the litigation over which suspends the running of \n     the assessment period under the designated summons procedure) \n     to a third party. It is expected that the IRS generally will \n     meet this requirement by issuing such notice on the same day \n     that it issues such summons, and by transmitting such notice \n     to the corporation in a manner reasonably designed to bring \n     it to the prompt attention of an agent of the corporation \n     responsible for communicating with the IRS in connection with \n     the examination.\n       Effective date.--This provision applies to summonses issued \n     after date of enactment.\n\n\n                        f.--information returns\n\n       Section 601. Phone Number of Person Providing Payee \n     Statements Required to be Shown on Such Statement. Taxpayers \n     frequently need to contact payors issuing information returns \n     in order to resolve disputes. Presently, information returns \n     (e.g. W-2s, 1099s, etc.) require only the name and address of \n     the payor.\n       T2 will require the payor to also provide the phone number \n     of the payor's information contact. Payors may have the \n     option of providing the name of its customer service \n     department, if appropriate, an Form 1099.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to statements \n     required to be furnished after December 31, 1993 (determined \n     without regard to any extension).\n       Section 602. Civil Damages for Fraudulent Filing of \n     Information Returns. Some taxpayers have suffered significant \n     personal loss and inconvenience as the result of the IRS \n     receiving fraudulent information returns. These false returns \n     have been filed by payors whose intent is to defraud the IRS \n     or to harass taxpayers.\n       T2 will provide that, if any person files a false or \n     fraudulent information return with respect to payments made \n     to another person, with the intent of either defrauding the \n     IRS or harassing another person, the other person may bring a \n     civil action for damages against the person filing such \n     return. Further, T2 will provide that damage awards in such \n     cases be at least $5000, and that the plaintiff must bring \n     action within 6 years from the time the fraudulent return was \n     filed with the IRS.\n       Effective date.-- The provision applies to false or \n     fraudulent information returns filed after the date of \n     enactment.\n       Section 603. Requirement to Conduct a Reasonable \n     Investigation of Information Returns. Section 6212(a) \n     authorizes the IRS to determine tax deficiencies. The term \n     ``determine'' is not defined in the Code, and until recently, \n     courts have declined to inquire whether or not, and how, the \n     IRS made its determination. Further, courts have begun to \n     chip away at the long-standing presumption of correctness \n     afforded deficiency notices.\n       T2 will amend section 6212(a) to provide that a \n     ``determination'' must be ``a thoughtful and considered \n     determination that the United States is entitled to an amount \n     not yet paid.'' Portillo v. Commissioner, 832 F. 2d 1128 (5th \n     Circuit 1991). If the IRS fails to \n     [[Page S1372]] make a thoughtful and considered \n     determination, then the notice of deficiency will be invalid.\n       T2 will provide that where the taxpayer asserts a \n     reasonable dispute with respect to any item of income \n     reported to the IRS on an information return, the IRS, not \n     the taxpayer, will bear the burden of proof in any deficiency \n     or refund proceeding absent a showing that the IRS conducted \n     a reasonable investigation of the facts surrounding the \n     taxpayer's return.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n  g.--modifications to penalty for failure to collect and pay over tax\n\n       Section 701. Preliminary Notice Requirement. Section 6672 \n     imposes personal liability on those persons who are required \n     to collect employment taxes (``responsible officers'') and \n     who willfully fail to pay over these taxes to the IRS. The \n     Code additionally provides for a 100% penalty on responsible \n     officers failing to pay over such taxes. Taxpayers who may be \n     responsible persons are assessed the taxes owed and the \n     penalty without the right to an administrative review.\n       T2 will require the IRS to issue a preliminary notice which \n     will give the taxpayer the right to an administrative appeals \n     hearing.\n       Effective date.--The provisions applies to failures \n     occurring after the date of enactment.\n       Section 702. Disclosure of Certain Information Where More \n     Than One Person Subject to Penalty. The IRS may recover more \n     than the amount owed under section 6672 (since each \n     responsible person is jointly and severally liable). There is \n     no procedure to ensure that the IRS does not collect more \n     than 100% of what is owed.\n       T2 will require that a person liable for a section 6672 \n     penalty may request, in writing, that the IRS disclose any \n     other person who is liable for such penalty along with \n     general nature of the IRS' collection activities.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n       Section 703. Penalties Under Section 6672. Under current \n     law, unpaid, volunteers, who serve on boards of tax-exempt \n     organizations, may be held liable for the 100% penalty \n     depending on the duties and roles of the individual involved.\n       T2 provides that the 100% penalty will not be imposed on \n     unpaid, volunteer members of any board of trustees or \n     directors of a tax exempt organization.\n       T2 will also require the IRS to develop materials to better \n     inform employees and volunteers of their responsibilities \n     under the law.\n                 h.--awarding of costs and certain fees\n\n       Section 801. Motion for Disclosure of Information. Once a \n     taxpayer has substantially prevailed in his case with the \n     IRS, he may file a petition for an order requiring the \n     disclosure of all information and copies of relevant records \n     in the possession of the IRS with respect to the taxpayer's \n     case and the substantial justification for the position taken \n     by the IRS.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for notices \n     made and proceedings commenced after the date of enactment.\n       Section 802. Increased Limit on Attorney Fees. T2 will \n     amend section 7430 to provide that reasonable fees incurred \n     for the services of qualified taxpayer representatives shall \n     not be indexed for inflation occurring since 1981, currently \n     $110 per hour, and this amount shall be indexed to inflation \n     in the future.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to notices made and \n     proceedings commenced after the date of enactment.\n       Section 803. Failure to Agree to Extension not taken into \n     Account. Section 7430 requires the taxpayer to exhaust all \n     administrative remedies before costs may be awarded. T2 \n     provides that a taxpayer's failure to agree to an extension \n     of time shall not be taken into account in determining \n     whether a taxpayer has exhausted his or her administrative \n     remedies.\n       Section 804. Authority for Court to Award Reasonable \n     Administrative Costs. Section 7430 provides for the recovery \n     of administrative costs incurred on or after the earlier of \n     the receipt of the final decision of IRS Appeals or the \n     statutory notice of deficiency. Because, generally, no \n     administrative costs are incurred after this period, the \n     provision is ineffective.\n       T2 remedies the statute by deleting the time limitations on \n     the recovery of costs and by providing that the court may in \n     its discretion determine the commencement date of the running \n     of administrative costs on a case by case basis.\n\n\n                          i.--other provisions\n\n       Section 901. Required Content of Notices. Section 7522 \n     (Content of tax due, deficiency, and other notices.) requires \n     the IRS to clarify certain notices by identifying and \n     describing the basis for any tax due, as well as any interest \n     and penalties assessed. However, the IRS is not required to \n     separately set forth, in the notice, the components and \n     explanation for each adjustment.\n       T2 will amend section 7522 to require that the IRS set \n     forth the components and explanation for each specific \n     adjustment which is the basis for the total tax deficiency.\n       Section 902. Relief from Retroactive Application of \n     Treasury Department Regulations. T2 will generally require \n     that temporary and proposed regulations issued by the \n     Treasury Department are to effective prospectively from the \n     date of filing with the Federal Register except: (1) \n     temporary or proposed regulations may take effect from the \n     date any notice which substantially describes the regulation \n     is issued to the public, (2) Congress may explicitly \n     authorize Treasury to prescribe the effective date, (3) \n     Treasury may issue retroactive temporary or proposed \n     regulations to prevent abuse of the statute, (4) Treasury may \n     issue retroactive temporary, proposed, or final regulations \n     to correct a procedural defect in the issuance of a \n     regulation, (5) Treasury may provide that taxpayers may elect \n     to apply a temporary or proposed regulation retroactively.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies with respect to any \n     temporary or proposed regulation published on or after \n     January 5, 1993, and any temporary or proposed regulation \n     published before January 5, 1993, and published as a final \n     regulation after that date.\n       Section 903. Required Notice of Certain Payments. T2 will \n     provide that, if the IRS receives a payment from a taxpayer \n     and cannot associate that payment with any outstanding tax \n     liability, then the IRS must make reasonable efforts to \n     notify the taxpayer of such inability within 60 days after \n     receipt of such payment.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as many taxpayers are struggling in the \nmidst of the current tax filing season, the issue of taxpayer's rights \ntakes on a special importance. Although most IRS employees provide \nvaluable and responsible service, taxpayer abuse by the Government is \nan ongoing problem. With this in mind, I am very happy to be joining \nSenator Pryor and others in reintroducing the taxpayer bill of rights \nII. This is very necessary legislation that builds upon the original \ntaxpayer bill of rights that we passed into law in 1988.\n  I was unable to be here earlier today when the bill was introduced \nbecause I was taking part in the President's signing ceremony of the \nCongressional Accountability Act, of which I am the lead Senate \nsponsor. But, I'm glad to be here now to offer my strong support to \nthis ongoing effort.\n  Mr. President, for me, the long process of trying to ensure taxpayer \nprotections began in the early 1980's, when I was a member and then \nchairman of the Finance Subcommittee on IRS Oversight. We made \nprogress, but it was only the beginning.\n  Senator Pryor continued the cause when he succeeded me as chairman in \n1987. At that time, he took the initiative and asked me to work with \nhim in pushing for a taxpayer bill of rights by expanding legislation I \nand others had introduced. It took nearly 2 years, but we ultimately \nsucceeded in achieving this goal.\n  We now have a 6-year record of implementation regarding the taxpayer \nbill of rights. Great strides toward taxpayer protection were achieved \nthrough this legislation. However, the taxpayer bill of rights of 1988 \nwas never expected to be the final chapter of the book on taxpayer \nprotection. It was a major step in the continuing process of stamping \nout taxpayer abuse. And that process continues today, as we look into \nways to improve the current law.\n  In reviewing the record, it's clear that much more needs to be done. \nThere's no question that breakdowns in implementing the law have \noccurred, and there are gaps in the law that need to be filled. For \ninstance, we believe the current ombudsman position is too limited and \ntoo beholden to IRS insiders. Our legislation will turn the ombudsman \ninto a more independent office of taxpayer advocate that will have \nexpanded powers to help taxpayers.\n  We were successful in passing a very similar proposal through the \nCongress in 1992. However, the underlying legislation that the proposal \nwas attached to was vetoed by President Bush. So, we're back again in \nthis new Congress.\n  Since 1987, Senator Pryor and I have worked in a cooperative, \nbipartisan effort to further taxpayer rights. As our roles change \nsomewhat in this new Republican-controlled Congress, I hope to continue \nour successful teamwork.\n  Beyond the introduction of this bill today, Senator Pryor and I will \nbe working on further improvements and even more protaxpayer provisions \nthat will be offered at a later date.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort to help make the IRS \nmore responsible and more accountable to the taxpayers of this country.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 260. A bill to provide for the protection of books and materials \nfrom the Library of Congress, and for other \n[[Page S1373]] purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n              the library of congress book protection act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to help \nprotect the valuable resources of the Library of Congress. The Library \nof Congress Protection Act will help the Library of Congress stop \nabuses of its free book loan program by authorizing the Library to \nimpose fines for books that are long overdue.\n  I am reintroducing this legislation to empower Library of Congress \nofficials to crack down on individuals who seriously abuse their \nLibrary privileges, by keeping books too long or failing to return \nthem. Library of Congress officials should not have to tolerate the \nfact that many individuals are apparently unconcerned about returning \nthe books that taxpayers provide for them. Congress should not prevent \nthe Library from instituting strengthened policies to hold severely \ndelinquent borrowers responsible for their tardiness.\n  This legislation will enable the Library of Congress to implement a \nreasonable overdue book charge policy similar to those of most public \nlibraries across America. By doing so, the many Members of Congress, \ncongressional staffers, and executive branch employees who benefit from \nthis magnificent institution will have an added incentive to comply \nwith the generous loan policies of the Library of Congress.\n  This proposal is very basic, but it will afford Library officials the \nleverage and flexibility they need to address this problem. This bill \nwill help Library of Congress officials keep better track of their \nresources, and will spur many delinquent borrowers to return the books \nthat taxpayers provide for them completely free of charge.\n  The Library of Congress Book Protection Act would direct the Library \nto implement an overdue book charge policy for books improperly held \nover 70 days. These individuals or offices will have their privileges \nsuspended until their fines are paid in full. Library of Congress \nofficials will, however, be able to waive such penalties when \nappropriate. The Library would also be authorized to retain the funds \nreceived from late book fines, as well. Finally, the offices of \nseverely delinquent borrowers and the fines they owe will be published \nin the annual report submitted by the Library to its oversight \ncommittees.\n  Figures published by the Library during the 103d Congress showed that \nout of the 20,000 books that were out on loan, over one-third were \nlisted as overdue. One half of the 4,200 books on loan to congressional \nstaff and the media were listed as overdue, and one in five books out \non loan to Members, committees, and congressional support agencies had \nbeen overdue for more than 2 months. Library of Congress officials \nstate that over 300,000 books are missing from their collections dating \nback to 1978, and the estimated cost of these thefts is $12 million.\n  I am concerned about the fact that it is all too easy for individuals \nto disregard their responsibility to return books to the Library of \nCongress in a timely manner. This negligence is not only unfair to the \nother users of the Library, but it also drains the Library's resources \nin chasing down overdue or missing books.\n  In addition to Members of Congress and congressional staff, the \nLibrary of Congress also makes loans to executive branch departments \nand agencies, the judiciary and diplomatic corps, the press, and other \ninstitutions. As I have mentioned, Mr. President, the Library of \nCongress is barred from charging late fees for overdue books in \ncontrast to virtually every other publicly funded Library in America. \nFurthermore, the Library cannot retain any funds that might be \ncollected due to the loss or damage of loaned books. It's clearly time \nto change these unwise restrictions and strengthen the Library's \nability to protect its resources, and I hope Members of the Senate will \nsupport this legislation to do so.\n  Surely it's not asking too much of the individuals and offices \nfortunate enough to the use the Library of Congress to do so in a \nresponsible manner. Even under the new borrowing guidelines that would \nbe instituted by this legislation, there really is no reason for any \nwell-intentioned borrower ever to have to pay late fines or have their \nprivileges suspended.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Local Empowerment and \n     Flexibility Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) historically, Federal programs have addressed the \n     Nation's problems by providing categorical financial \n     assistance with detailed requirements relating to the use of \n     funds;\n       (2) while the assistance described in paragraph (1) has \n     been directed at critical problems, some program requirements \n     may inadvertently impede the effective delivery of services;\n       (3) the Nation's local governments and private, nonprofit \n     organizations are dealing with increasingly complex problems \n     which require the delivery of many kinds of services;\n       (4) the Nation's communities are diverse, and different \n     needs are present in different communities;\n       (5) it is more important than ever to provide programs \n     that--\n       (A) promote more effective and efficient local delivery of \n     services to meet the full range of needs of individuals, \n     families, and society;\n       (B) respond flexibly to the diverse needs of the Nation's \n     communities;\n       (C) reduce the barriers between programs that impede local \n     governments' ability to effectively deliver services; and\n       (D) empower local governments and private, nonprofit \n     organizations to be innovative in creating programs that meet \n     the unique needs of their communities while continuing to \n     address national policy goals; and\n       (6) many communities have innovative planning and community \n     involvement strategies for providing services, but Federal, \n     State, and local regulations often hamper full implementation \n     of local plans.\n\n     SEC. 503. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) enable more efficient use of Federal, State, and local \n     resources;\n       (2) place less emphasis in Federal service programs on \n     measuring resources and procedures and more emphasis on \n     achieving Federal, State, and local policy goals;\n       (3) enable local governments and private, nonprofit \n     organizations to adapt programs of Federal financial \n     assistance to the particular needs of their communities, by--\n       (A) drawing upon appropriations available from more than \n     one Federal program; and\n       (B) integrating programs and program funds across existing \n     Federal financial assistance categories; and\n       (4) enable local governments and private, nonprofit \n     organizations to work together and build stronger cooperative \n     partnerships to address critical service problems.\n\n     SEC. 504.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CONGRESSIONAL \n                   ENFORCEMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (A) that the Congress should move to eliminate the biggest \n     unfunded mandate--interest on the national debt, which drives \n     the increasing federal burden on state and local governments, \n     and\n       (B) that prior to adopting in the first session of the \n     104th Congress a joint resolution proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution requiring a balanced budget--\n       (1) the Congress set forth specific outlay and revenue \n     changes to achieve a balanced federal budget by the year \n     2002; and\n       (2) enforce through the Congressional budget process the \n     requirement to achieve a balanced federal budget by the year \n     2002.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        GRAHAM AMENDMENT NO. 183\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 16, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       ``(iii) if funded in whole or in part, a statement of \n     whether and how the committee has created a mechanism to \n     allocate the funding in a manner that is reasonably \n     consistent with the expected direct costs to each State, \n     local, and tribal government.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a technical, yet \nextremely important, amendment to S. 1. My amendment would require \ncommittees that choose to pay for their public sector legislative \nmandates to report as to ``how the committee has created a mechanism to \nallocate the funding in a manner that is reasonably consistent with the \nexpected direct costs to each State, local, and tribal government.''\n  If the Congress chooses to pay for its mandates, and I believe the \nstrong presumption should be that it do so, certainly the intent of \nthis bill would be to have the funding reach those State, local, and \ntribal governments that will be impacted by the mandate rather than \nallocate funding State, local, and tribal governments through a random \nor arbitrary process.\n  For example, if a mandate is imposed on local school districts, it \nwould make more sense to ensure the money reaches local school \ndistricts rather than to State education agencies. If a mandate were to \nhave an impact on State and local government in rural areas, it would \nmake little sense to allocate the funding to our Nation's cities.\n  On the other hand, if a mandate were to specifically impact the \ncities of our country such as Philadelphia, Seattle, Louisville, \nBaltimore, Houston, and New York City, why would funding be allocated \nto the State capitals of Harrisburg, Olympia, Frankfort, Annapolis, \nAustin, or Albany? To do the latter would undermine the entire purpose \nof this bill. While Governors Ridge, Lowry, Jones, Glendening, Bush, \nand Pataki might love to receive such a windfall to their State \nbudgets, the cities could very well receive the mandate but none or \nvery little of the funding. In fact, to pay for the mandate, the \ncommittee may very well have eliminated a Federal aid program in which \ncities are largely the recipient. As a result, the cities could have \nFederal funding cut and also receive an unfunded mandate.\n  In such a case, Congress may have had great intentions in funding the \nmandate but fail miserably in actually achieving such a worthy goal. \nMayors, Governors, or whomever receives the hard mandate but phantom \nfunds will be far angrier at the Congress than they ever were before we \npassed this legislation. Certainly such circumstances would undermine \nboth this bill and our Nation's system of intergovernmental relations.\n  Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this legislation and fully intend \nto vote in favor of its passage. Some may argue that asking the \ncommittee to review and report how and whether its allocations are made \nin a reasonably consistent manner with the expected costs is \nunnecessary. They might argue that the various committees will do the \nright thing and accurately distribute funding.\n  [[Page S1378]] Based on the Congress' track record of both unfunded\n   mandates and outdated formula allocations, more attention needs to \nbe placed on both areas by Congress. While we have heard over the last \nweek about problems with unfunded mandates, no attention has occurred \nor been placed on how the Federal Government will go about compensating \nState, local, and tribal governments. However, as noted before, such \nattention is critical and fundamental to the success of this \nlegislation.\n\n  To give you just one example, what if last year's crime bill had a \nrequirement that all States must implement mandatory drug testing and \ntreatment of all its imprisoned felons?\n  If the committee or the Congressional Budget Office were to \nanticipate increased numbers of imprisoned felons over a period of time \nand therefore increased costs over a period of years, would the funding \nallocation reflect the anticipated growth in the individual States? It \nnot, what would be the impact on the budgets and policy implications \nfor States that actively attempt to put and keep violent criminals \nbehind bars and off the streets of this Nation? The law of unintended \nconsequences would arise. In an attempt to get people off of drugs and \nsquelch their propensity to commit crimes by mandating drug testing and \ntreatment, the funding formula could effectively have the contrary \neffect for unfairly impacted States.\n  And finally and most importantly, what if the funding formulas are \narbitrary or fail to allocate funding in a manner reasonably consistent \nwith expected costs? I offer this specific example because, in last \nyear's crime bill, the allocation formula for ``Residential Substance \nAbuse Treatment for Prisoners'' effectively allocated to some States \nsubstantially more dollars per inmate than to other States. Without \ncompelling evidence that the former States prison inmates are more drug \naddicted or expensive to treat, such a formula makes no sense.\n  If this were to happen in a circumstance of funding a mandate rather \nthan a block grant, the impact could be devastating. To have a \npartially funded mandate imposed on some States while others receive \nseveral times the funding in comparison to the cost of its mandate \nwould undermine the intent of this legislation. While funding formulas \nfor block grants are important and should always strive to be as fair \nas possible, it is imperative they be consistent with the \nintergovernmental location and scale when funding mandates, if we are \nat all concerned with achieving the stated intent of this legislation.\n  As a result, while my amendment would not require ``fair'' formulas \nto be established, it would require the committee to consider and \nexplain the allocation formulas established to pay for the public \nsector unfunded mandates in their committee reports. Due to the \nimportance of such allocations and need for thorough consideration by \nboth the committees and Congress, I urge this amendment's adoption.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        GRAHAM AMENDMENT NO. 184\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 6, strike line 3 and all that follows through line \n     10, and insert the following:\n       ``(ii) would reduce or eliminate the amount of \n     authorization of appropriations for--\n       ``(I) Federal financial assistance that would be provided \n     to States, local governments, or tribal governments for the \n     purpose of complying with any such previously imposed duty \n     unless such duty is reduced or eliminated by a corresponding \n     amount; or\n       ``(II) the exercise of powers relating to immigration that \n     are the responsibility or under the authority of the Federal \n     Government and whose reduction or elimination would result in \n     a shifting of the costs of addressing immigration expenses to \n     the States, local governments, and tribal governments; or\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to first reaffirm my support for \nthe objectives to S. 1 and look forward to voting for it on final \npassage. Many of my colleagues have discussed at length the financial \nimpact that mandates have on their individual States or localities. I \nwould add that mandates tie the hands of or effectively displace the \npriorities of political leaders in State and local government. As \nOffice of Management and Budget Director Alice Rivlin wrote in her book \nentitled ``Reviving the American Dream,''\n\n       The Federal Government's own weakness has not made it any \n     less eager to tell States and localities what to do. Indeed, \n     when its ability to make grants declined, the Federal \n     Government turned increasingly to mandates as a way of \n     controlling state and local activity without having to pay \n     the bill.\n\n  Furthermore, unfunded mandates create a situation whereby voters \ncannot accurately ascertain where responsibility lies for certain \nGovernment actions. As Rivlin adds,\n\n       Mandates add to citizen confusion about who is in charge. \n     When the Federal Government makes rules for State and local \n     officials to carry out, whether or not they have the \n     resources to do so, it is not clear to voters who should be \n     blamed, either when the regulations are laxly enforced or \n     when the cost of compliance is high.\n\n  As a result, I strongly support this legislation and offer the \nfollowing amendment with Senators Mack, Bryan, and Boxer to close an \nimportant loophole in the bill with respect to immigration and its \nimpact on State and local government.\n  My amendment would require Congress to recognize and address the cost \nshift to State and local governments for any action on the floor that \nwould delete or preempt the authorization of any Federal reimbursement \nprogram for immigration costs, such as in the Criminal Aliens Federal \nResponsibility Act. The amendment does not address funding levels for \nsuch programs in appropriations bills or address past immigration-\nrelated costs absorbed by State and local governments.\n  However, the amendment would place immigration reimbursement programs \nin the same circumstance as Medicaid, the social services block grant, \nthe Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants Program, child nutrition, \nand three other Federal programs. In this bill, if any of these \nprograms are financially capped or the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to provide funding to State and local government is \nreduced and State and local government lack the authority to amend \ntheir financial or programmatic responsibilities, then such an action \nwould trigger the definition of an unfunded mandate in the bill.\n  These are precisely the circumstances relating to immigration \nreimbursement programs such as the Criminal Aliens Federal \nResponsibility Act. As you will recall, the Criminal Aliens\n Federal Responsibility Act was successfully included in the crime bill \nlast session by a bipartisan group of Senators in an effort to have the \nFederal Government address its responsibility for immigration and the \ncosts imposed on States and localities of incarcerating criminal \naliens.\n\n  According to a recent report by the Urban Institute, more than 21,000 \ncriminal illegal immigrants are incarcerated in U.S. prisons at an \nannual cost of $471 million. Educating undocumented immigrants is even \nmore costly. More than 640,000 undocumented children are enrolled in \nprimary and secondary schools in the United States at a cost of $3.1 \nbillion a year.\n  In a policy brief from the Governor's office this week on the impact \nof unfunded mandates to the State of Florida, it is estimated that \nState costs relating to illegal aliens including education, emergency \nhealth care, prosecution and incarceration of criminal aliens and \npublic infrastructure. In fiscal year 1993 this unfunded mandate cost \nthe State of Florida $884 million.\n  An elimination of the authorization of such program would clearly \nreduce the Federal Government's responsibility to provide funding to \nState and local governments, while those entities have virtually no \nauthority or ability to amend their financial or programmatic \nresponsibilities.\n  In a letter to the Congress last year, the National Governors' \nAssociation wrote,\n\n       The Nation's governors have been in strong agreement that \n     immigration policy must be based on Federal responsibility \n     and fairness to State and local governments. As you well \n     know, immigration policy is solely a Federal concern. Yet \n     Federal law mandates the States to provide emergency health \n     care and education to undocumented immigrants who reside in \n     our States. State governments also are forced to pay for the \n     costs of incarcerating undocumented alien criminals.\n\n  Immigration is clearly much more like mandatory or entitlement \nprograms such as Medicaid than other discretionary programs such as \ntransportation and housing. State and local governments do not have the \ndiscretion \n[[Page S1379]] to amend or restrict their financial obligations for \nmandatory or entitlement programs.\n  In fact, I would argue that the status of unreimbursed Federal \nimmigration-related costs as an unfunded mandate is actually stronger \nthan that of programs such as Medicaid because the Federal Government's \nplenary role and responsibility for immigration and border control is \nunchallenged. In Traus versus Raich, the Supreme Court ruled in 1915 \nthat ``[t]he authority to control immigration--to admit or exclude \naliens--is vested solely in the Federal Government.'' States cannot \nmake treaties, hire border patrol, establish naturalization policy or \neven set much in the way of policy with respect to providing services \nto illegal immigrants. Border protection and immigration are clearly \nFederal obligations.\n  The implications of my amendment would be to allow Members of \nCongress to raise a point or order against legislation that would \nreduce or eliminate the authorization of Federal immigration \nreimbursement programs.\n  For example, if legislation were introduced that imposes a Federal \nmandate that the Congressional Budget Office estimates to cost State \nand local governments $350 million, the author of the bill could \nattempt to offset such costs by eliminating the authorization for the \nCriminal Aliens Federal Responsibility Act. Such an action would \neffectively pay for a federally imposed Federal mandate by shifting the \nfull costs and responsibility for incarcerating criminal aliens to \nState and local governments. Such a circumstance would certainly run \ncounter to the intent of S. 1. My amendment would clarify this loophole \nand allow a point of order to be raised for creating yet another \nunfunded mandate.\n  As a result, I urge the amendment's adoption.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, it has consistently been my position that \nthe Federal Government must assume greater responsibility for the costs \nassociated with immigration, both legal and illegal. My colleague from \nFlorida has offered an amendment which recognizes the problem of \nimmigration costs as an unfunded mandate, and I believe this amendment \nis a positive addition to the bill. Absent this amendment, S. 1 \ncategorizes only a select few immigration costs as unfunded mandates \nand ignores the myriad other expenses which accrue to the States, such \nas education and incarceration costs. These expenses and many others \nwould not be borne by the States. Only because the Federal Government \nhas failed to fulfill their duty to enforce our immigration laws is \nthis amendment necessary. I urge the adoption of the Graham amendment \nas an essential step in recognizing the burdens which the Federal \nGovernment's policy of abdication and default has placed upon the backs \nof the States.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      WELLSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 185\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: (  ) it is \n     the sense of the Congress that the Congress shall continue \n     its progress at reducing the annual federal deficit and, when \n     the Congress proposes to the States a balance-budget \n     amendment, must accompany it with financial information on \n     its impact on the budget of each of the States.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      WELLSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 186\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE proposed an amendment to amendment No. 186 proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 1, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``(  ) It'' and insert the following: \n     ``the sense of the Congress that the Congress should continue \n     its progress at reducing the annual federal deficit and, when \n     the Congress proposes to the States a balance-budget \n     amendment, should accompany it with financial information on \n     its impact on the budget of each of the States.''\n                                 ______\n\n\n                     MURRAY AMENDMENTS NOS. 187-188\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY proposed two amendments to the bill, S. 1, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 187\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following: \n     The provisions of this Act and the amendments made by this \n     Act also shall not apply to any agreement between the Federal \n     Government and a State, local, or tribal government, or the \n     private sector for the purpose of carrying out environmental \n     restoration or waste management activities of the Department \n     of Defense or the Department of Energy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Amendment No. 188\n\n       On page 21, insert between lines 13 and 14 the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Time limitations for statements.--(A) The Director of \n     the Congressional Budget Office shall provide the statement \n     as required by this section--\n       ``(i) relating to a bill or resolution ordered reported by \n     a committee, no later than one week after the date on which \n     the bill or resolution is ordered reported by the committee; \n     and\n       ``(ii) relating to an amendment or conference report, no \n     later than one day after the date on which the amendment is \n     offered or the conference report is submitted.\n       ``(B) Failure by the Director to meet the time limitations \n     in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall vitiate the \n     provisions of subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        GRAHAM AMENDMENT NO. 189\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 33, strike lines 10 through 12 and insert the \n     following:\n       This title shall take effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and shall apply to legislation considered on and \n     after such date.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        HARKIN AMENDMENT NO. 190\n\n  Mr. HARKIN proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 50, add after line 6 the following new title:\n\n                   TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 501. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING BALANCED BUDGET \n                   AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) social security is a contributory insurance program \n     supported by deductions from workers' earnings and matching \n     contributions from their employers that are deposited into an \n     independent trust fund;\n       (2) over 42,000,000 Americans, including over 3,000,000 \n     children and 5,000,000 disabled workers and their families, \n     receive social security benefits;\n       (3) social security is the only pension program for 60 \n     percent of older Americans;\n       (4) almost 60 percent of older beneficiaries depend on \n     social security for at least half of their income and 25 \n     percent depend on social security for at least 90 percent of \n     their income;\n       (5) without social security an additional 15,000,000 \n     Americans, mostly senior citizens, would be thrown into \n     poverty;\n       (6) 138,000,000 American workers participate in the social \n     security system and are insured in case of retirement, \n     disability, or death;\n       (7) social security is a contract between workers and the \n     Government;\n       (8) social security is a self-financed program that is not \n     contributing to the current Federal budget deficit; in fact, \n     the social security trust funds currently have over \n     $400,000,000,000 in reserves and that surplus will increase \n     during fiscal year 1995 alone by an additional \n     $70,000,000,000;\n       (9) this surplus is necessary to pay monthly benefits for \n     current and future beneficiaries;\n       (10) recognizing that social security is a self-financed \n     program, Congress took social security completely ``off-\n     budget'' in 1990; however, unless social security is \n     explicitly excluded from a balanced budget amendment to the \n     United States Constitution, such an amendment would, in \n     effect, put the program back into the Federal budget by \n     referring to all spending and receipts in calculating whether \n     the budget is in balance;\n       (11) raiding the social security trust funds to reduce the \n     Federal budget deficit would be devastating to both current \n     and future beneficiaries and would further undermine \n     confidence in the system among younger workers;\n       (12) the American people in poll after poll have \n     overwhelmingly rejected cutting social security benefits to \n     reduce the Federal deficit and balance the budget; and\n       (13) social security beneficiaries throughout the nation \n     are gravely concerned that their financial security is in \n     jeopardy because of possible social security cuts and deserve \n     to be reassured that their benefits will not be subject to \n     cuts that would likely be required should social security not \n     be excluded from a balanced budget amendment to the United \n     States Constitution.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is a sense of the Senate that \n     any joint resolution providing for a balanced budget \n     amendment to the United States Constitution passed by the \n     Senate shall specifically exclude social security from the \n     calculations used to determine if the Federal budget is in \n     balance.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       BINGAMAN AMENDMENT NO. 191\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1, supra;

as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``That'' and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) social security is supported by taxes deducted from \n     workers' earnings and matching deductions from their \n     employers that are deposited into independent trust funds;\n       (2) over 42,000,000 Americans, including over 3,000,000 \n     children and 5,000,000 disabled workers and their families, \n     receive social security benefits;\n       (3) social security is the only pension program for 60 \n     percent of older Americans;\n       (4) almost 60 percent of older beneficiaries depend on \n     social security for at least half of their income and 25 \n     percent depend on social security for at least 90 percent of \n     their income;\n       (5) 138,000,000 American workers pay taxes into the social \n     security system;\n       (6) social security is currently a self-financed program \n     that is not contributing to the Federal budget deficit; in \n     fact, the social security trust funds now have over \n     $400,000,000,000 in reserves and that surplus will increase \n     during fiscal year 1995 alone by an additional \n     $70,000,000,000;\n       (7) these current reserves will be necessary to pay monthly \n     benefits for current and future beneficiaries when the annual \n     surpluses turn to deficits after 2018;\n       (8) recognizing that social security is currently a self-\n     financed program, Congress in 1990 established a ``firewall'' \n     to prevent a raid on the social security trust funds;\n       (9) raiding the social security trust funds would further \n     undermine confidence in the system among younger workers;\n       (10) the American people overwhelmingly reject arbitrary \n     cuts in social security benefits; and\n       (11) social security beneficiaries throughout the nation \n     deserve to be reassured that their benefits will not be \n     subject to cuts and their social security payroll taxes will \n     not be increased as a result of legislation to implement a \n     balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any legislation required to implement a balanced budget \n     amendment to the United States Constitution shall \n     specifically prevent social security benefits from being \n     reduced or social security taxes from being increased to meet \n     the balanced budget requirement.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        GLENN AMENDMENT NO. 197\n\n  Mr. GLENN proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1, supra;
