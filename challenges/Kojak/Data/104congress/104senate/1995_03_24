Mr. President, there has been considerable media \ndiscussion lately about the decline of civility in our public \ndiscourse. I agree that political rhetoric often seems quite harsh \nthese days. I have also observed that the people who report on \npoliticians, and who are often among the first to decry the incivility \nof politics, seem more inclined lately to allow their reporting to \ncross from tough to cruel.\n  That said, I cannot claim with certainty that manners in either \npolitics or the press have truly degenerated to new lows. I suspect \nthat every American generation in our history has had occasion to be \nrepulsed by unnecessarily mean attacks from within and upon politics \nthat are unavoidable in a free society. Political cartoonists, for \ninstance, have throughout our history spared few public figures from \nridicule. Often the ridicule is earned. Sometimes it is not. Sometimes \neven the license given cartoonists cannot excuse an especially \nmalignant attack.\n  Such was the case last Sunday when Mr. Garry Trudeau decided to use \nhis comic strip to scorn the military service of the majority leader, \nSenator Dole.\n  The author of the comic strip ``Doonesbury,'' Mr. Trudeau has made it \nhis business to lampoon not only Republicans, but anyone whose devotion \nto the looniest of left wing causes he suspects is less robust than his \nown. His increasingly strident attacks have forsaken whatever humor \nmight have once distinguished his cartoons from the silly rantings of \nyour garden variety conspiracy theorist. Even former admirers of his \ncomic strip tell me that he has become decidedly unfunny in recent \nyears.\n  For this singular contribution to American culture, Mr. Trudeau feels \nhe should be permitted to dispense with the encumbrances of good \nmanners. Apparently, artists of his caliber cannot be burdened by the \nbonds that hold most of us together in our disparate society--bonds \nlike honor and respect.\n  Ordinary Americans, of course, feel it appropriate to show gratitude \nto Americans who have ransomed their life to the defense of their \nfreedom. Ordinary Americans would recoil from the suggestion that there \nis humor in ridiculing the sacrifice borne by an American \n[[Page S4528]] who took up arms to defend them, and sustained grave \ninjury in that cause.\n  Ordinary Americans, Mr. President, would honor a service rendered to \nthem at such great cost.\n  But not Mr. Trudeau. His is far too important a calling for it to be \nconstrained by humility, gratitude, or ordinary good taste. I do not \nwant to dwell too much on Mr. Trudeau. He is not\n really worth the ink used to ridicule him. Suffice it to say that I \nhold him in utter contempt. I hold him in contempt for his small heart, \nfor the cruelty he inflicts on others to obscure the weaknesses in his \nown character, and for his immense ingratitude to those who have had \nthe strength of character to protect Mr. Trudeau's right to pollute--\nfor profit, of course--political debate in America.\n\n  I would rather talk a little bit about Bob Dole. Anyone who has read \nRichard Ben Kramer's book, ``What It Takes,'' knows what kind of man is \nBob Dole. He answered his country's call to take up arms in a war for \nthe future of the world. He helped save that world. Of course, he did \nso in a time when even political cartoonists believed such service to \nbe honorable.\n  As a proud young man of great promise and an excellent athlete, Bob \nDole went to Italy. Like others of his generation, he paid a dear price \nfor his love of country. He was gravely wounded. That he recovered at \nall from that wound is testament to the extraordinary courage that \ndefines Bob Dole, and that sets him apart from others.\n  Bob Dole bears the discomfort and the challenge of that wound today, \n50 years after he sustained it. He bears it with a quiet dignity that \nis--in every respect--worthy of our utmost admiration. I have known him \nfor a long time now. I have never--never--heard him complain about his \ninjury even though I know not a waking hour passes when he does not \nfeel that pain. Neither have I ever heard him use his injury for \npolitical advantage, although he is--as he should be--proud of his \nservice. Most people--indeed, almost everyone save Mr. Trudeau--is \nproud of him for his service and for the dignity with which he has \naccepted its consequences.\n  The problem for Mr. Trudeau, I suspect, is that he has never done \nanything for which he can be proud and therefore cannot understand how \nother people could take pride in the moment when they answered their \ncountry's call.\n  Mr. President, I am the son and grandson of admirals. Military \nservice has been my family's business since the American Revolution. I \nhave thus been blessed to have spent much time in the company of \nheroes. I know what they look like. I know how they act. Bob Dole is \nthe genuine article. Duty and honor are not relative concepts to him. \nThey are absolute standards. Thank God, ours is still a country that \nknows the worth of such men even if the odd cartoonist does not.\n  Mr. President, I have a hard time maintaining self-restraint when I \ncontemplate the injustice of Mr. Trudeau's disrespect for the brave \nservice of a young man who left his family and friends in a small town \nin Kansas to defend his country's interests on foreign soil, and who as \na consequence of his courage helped make the world safe--even for \ncartoonists.\n  It is a pity Mr. Trudeau never bothered to wear the uniform of his \ncountry. The experience would have no doubt improved his manners. Since \nlittle is likely to improve the poverty of his manners now, perhaps he \ncould just limit his cartoon to a subject better matched to his skills \nand his character--perhaps the O.J. trial. At a minimum, if Mr. Trudeau \ncannot find it in himself to honor the service of people like Bob Dole, \nI would hope he could just remain silent. I think he will find that \nfewer and fewer people are listening anyway.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield at this time to the Senator from \nNebraska and possibly at the end engage in a short discourse with the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I must state at the beginning I normally \nread, when I have the opportunity, Mr. Trudeau's comics or cartoons and \nfind much humor in them. In this one, however, not only did I find no \nhumor but I found in it great sadness and much in fact to be ridiculed.\n  First, let me say that I have only on a number of relatively small \noccasions been moved by the words of another politician. I say that \nstraight out. I sometimes say that I was moved. But it is rarely the \ncase where I am genuinely and deeply moved.\n  One such occasion was in, I believe, 1988 when--it might have been \n1987--Senator Dole announced his intent to run for the Presidency in \nRussell, KS. I watched him on television and watched him recollect his \nhomecoming to Russell, KS, and the kindness that was expressed by the \npeople of Russell, KS, to him, and he could not go on.\n  Now, this is a man whose persona is, to say the least, a tough \npersona. This is a man, as the Senator from Arizona has just said, who \nnever complains about his injury. At least he has not complained to me, \nhe has not complained in my presence, and he has not complained in the \npresence of anybody that I know. This is a man who does not talk about \nhis injuries and does not talk about his injuries easily when he does.\n  For the cartoonist to portray Mr. Dole as sort of playing upon his \nwar wound is a lie on its face. It does not happen. Quite the contrary, \nMr. President. Senator Dole, as I indicated, feels great warmth and is \nmoved by people who saved his life. I have heard Senator Dole talk \nabout the people who restored his life and put his life back together.\n  On a second occasion when I was moved--I must say I find it odd that \nSenator Dole, who is supposed to be one of the meanest guys in politics \ntoday--that is his reputation anyway--has on two occasions moved me so \ndeeply.\n  The second one was I believe the Larry King interview, or it might \nhave been--it was not Larry King. It was one of the other journalists \nwho was interviewing Senator Dole at length, and he began to talk about \nhis father coming to visit him while he was in the hospital.\n  On many occasions when asked how is it that I could admire Bob Dole, \nsince he is the Republican leader and I am a proud member of the \nDemocratic party, how is it that I could admire Bob Dole and like Bob \nDole, my answer almost always begins with a declaration that this man \nloves his country and is a patriot.\n  It guides him, in the end, to make decisions that sometimes are not \nin his best political interest. He did not serve in World War II as a \nconsequence of calculating what was going to be in his best interest. \nIt did not turn out to be in his best physical interest.\n  He started to describe this moment when his father came to see him \nand described the swollen ankles of his father. He, once again, could \nnot go on. He was moved, not by his own suffering, Mr. President, not \nby his wound.\n  He did not go before this journalist, he did not stand before an \naudience in Russell, KS, and say, ``Pity me for this wound.'' Quite the \ncontrary. What he did on both occasions was say, to a certain extent: \nPity the audience. My sympathy goes to them. My appreciation goes to \nthem. My respect and admiration go to them for what they did for me.\n  I have great personal respect for Senator Dole and admiration for his \npatriotism. And, above all of the things, his ability to put his life \nback together, his capacity to put his life back together, I admire \ndeeply.\n  He has never worn his war record or his injuries in front of the \npublic as if it was some sort of badge of honor. I have never heard him \ntalk about, never heard him express that. Quite the contrary.\n  So I, like the Senator from Arizona, am deeply offended by this \ncartoon. It says something about Americans who served that is \nreprehensible. And it says something about a great American patriot \nthat is particularly reprehensible.\n  Very often those of us who have been wounded are described that way. \n``Bob Kerrey, wounded in the war in Vietnam.'' I do not ask to be \ndescribed that way, but that is how it occurs. We are described that \nway.\n  And in today's modern journalism, the way things get beat around \nelectronically, very often that comes back and somebody says, ``Well, I \nsaw you \n[[Page S4529]] made a statement that says you were wounded in the \nwar.'' I did not make a statement. And Senator Dole does not talk about \nhis injuries, but he gets labeled with it.\n  Unfortunately, today, in modern politics, the tendency is to look for \nthe worst. And in Senator Dole, not only do we not have the worst, we \nhave the best impulses of human beings and of Americans--an American \nwho was willing to serve and willing to come back and not with \nbitterness say, ``You owe me,'' but an American who was willing to come \nback and say, ``The debt is still on my side. I feel compassion to \nthose in Russell, KS, who welcomed me home. I feel compassion and \nrespect for my father, who did the same. I feel compassion and respect \nfor all Americans who continue to try to struggle not just with their \nlives but to overcome adversity, as well.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with my friend from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I just want to thank my friend from \nNebraska for stepping forward.\n  We cannot do anything about someone like Mr. Trudeau, but we intend \nto try.\n  I do believe that when something as egregious and outrageous as this \nis--and, frankly, Senator Dole would not like to hear me say this--but \nit has to hurt when one's service and sacrifice to one's country is \ndemeaned and denigrated in this fashion.\n  I am grateful that someone like Senator Kerrey would step forward and \ncondemn it. I do not know if it stops this kind of thing. I do not know \nwhat beneficial effect it has. But I do know this: For Senator Kerrey \nand me to remain silent in the face of this outrage would be a \ndereliction of duty on our part, if I may use a phrase from our \nprevious incarnation.\n  So I want to thank Senator Kerrey for saying this.\n  I do not intend to belabor the point, and I know Senator Kerrey does \nnot, but I hope the American people know--and especially Bob Dole \nknows--that the cynicism and sarcasm of Mr. Trudeau is not shared by \nthe overwhelming majority of the American people.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, if I could add one additional thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the public should not view this as a \ncouple of old veterans wandering down here to the floor to defend \nanother old veteran that got beat up by a cartoonist.\n  Senator Dole has the capacity to make fun of himself, as I do and as \ndoes the Senator from Arizona. This is not saying our skin is so thin \nwe cannot take a cartoonist's deprecating comments about us. Lord \nknows, it happens all the time. It is hard to pick up an account of \nsomething you have said or done and not find something being said in a \ndeprecating fashion. I do not mind that at all. I do not object to any \ncartoonist or journalist that wants to take some foible of mine, a \nweakness of mine, and magnify it and have some fun with it.\n  But that is not what is occurring in this case. There is a deep \noffense given, as a consequence, to isolating something that, in fact, \ndoes not occur. Senator Dole does not wear his wound out in front of \nthe public. He does not try to use it to gain some kind of advantage. \nQuite the contrary is the case.\n  I am here this morning to say that I admire that. Indeed, beyond \nadmiring it, I believe that it is sort of something that Americans need \nto emulate--to emulate a man who says, ``I may be suffering, but my \nconcern is for my friends and neighbors who welcomed me home. My \nconcern is with my father who made a trip to Chicago to visit me. My \nconcern is still with others who are struggling in their lives.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see the managers are waiting. I would \nlike to make one additional comment on a different subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4527-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last night we passed in the Senate \nsomething that I have been working on for 10 years. I know that \neveryone is aware that it did not happen because of the efforts only of \nSenator Coats and myself.\n  We are very grateful for the help and efforts that Senator Dole \nengaged in in bringing together enough of us that it was an \noverwhelming victory. Senator Domenici and Senator Stevens were very \ninstrumental in that.\n  And, of course, we respected very much the participation of Senator \nByrd. I think years from now when people read the Congressional Record \nof the debate that was conducted, I think they will be illuminated by \nhis remarks.\n  Also, Senator Exon, the manager on the other side of the bill, and \nSenator Levin, whose amendment I think was extremely helpful.\n  Sheila Burke spent many, many hours in meetings in an effort to bring \nRepublicans together on this issue. Sharon Soderstrom, the able \nassistant of Senator Coats, and Megan Gilly did an outstanding job; \nDavid Crane, Bill Hoagland, Dave Hoppe, Eric Ueland, Joe Donoghue, and \nMark Buse.\n  So I would like to thank all of them for their enormous assistance, \nnot only in recent weeks but in recent years, in helping us achieve \nwhat I think is one of the most important changes in the way that this \ncountry does business since 1974, when the Budget and Impoundment Act \nwas passed.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4529-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         SANBORNTON MAN CROSSES REMAGEN BRIDGE IN WORLD WAR II\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Guy J. \nGiunta, Sr., a resident of Sanbornton, NH, who played a significant \nrole in the infamous capture by the Americans of the bridge at Remagen \nduring World War II. This offensive resulted in shortening the war and \nsaving thousands of lives.\n  Guy was a private first class in the 78th Infantry Division. He was \none of the American soldiers who crossed the bridge at Remagen over the \nRhine River, 50 years ago this month. This battle illustrated the \nAmerican military strength which caught the Germans by surprise. The \nevents of March 7, 1945, were known as the ``Miracle of Remagen.''\n  Guy left his native Italy for the United States in 1927 where he \nworked as a machinist making parts for turbines for the U.S. Navy when \nthe war broke out. Deferments as an essential worker kept him out of \nthe war until 1943, but after learning of friends dying overseas, he \nenlisted in a war that included his birthland.\n  When soldiers reached a plateau above Remagen on March 7, they saw \nGerman troops and civilians retreating across the Ludendorff Bridge. \nViolating instructions to proceed down the Rhine, Gen. William M. Hoge \nordered his men to take the bridge. After refusing, the men heard a \n``whoosh'' as 660 pounds of dynamite lifted the bridge from its stone \npiers.\n  There was still shooting as soldiers fought their way up the big \ncliff on the eastern end of the bridge. Twenty-four Americans died on \nor around the bridge. Guy Giunta was one the 600 brave men who were \ninvolved in taking the bridge, including 200 engineers who cut wires to \nthe unexploded dynamite. Guy's medals from the war include three major \nbattle stars: the Ardennse, the Rhineland, and Central Europe.\n  Guy Giunta is a retired Westinghouse machinist. His wife, Rina Passi, \nalso a native Italian, didn't meet her future husband until after the \nwar, but knew of him because she translated his mother's letters to him \nfrom Italian into English. They have lived in a white farmhouse in \nSanbornton since 1985.\n  I commend Guy for sharing his experiences at this important World War \nII battle with many in New Hampshire. His courage and patriotism are an \ninspiration to us all. It is an honor to represent Guy Giunta, Sr., and \nhis family in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4529-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4529-S4530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DICK REINERS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to \ncommemorate the long and distinguished life of my dear friend, Richard \nH. Reiners, an \n[[Page S4530]] outstanding American, who passed away earlier this year.\n  Dick Reiners was born September 24, 1907, on a small farm east of \nLennox, SD, and passed away on January 15, 1995, at his rural home \nnorth of Worthing, SD. Throughout his life he was dedicated to his \nfamily, his community, and the land in which he lived.\n  As a father and husband, Dick epitomized the term ``family values.'' \nHe was faithful, honest, and loyal and he passed those values on to his \nchildren and grandchildren. As a member of the community, Dick was \nconstantly active in improving the quality of people's lives. He served \non numerous boards, including his church, his children's school \ndistrict, the Farmers Home Administration, and the South Dakota Farmers \nUnion. He was also actively involved in politics and labored tirelessly \nfor the people he believed in.\n  As a farmer, Dick held a reverence for the land and its capacity for \nproduction. He was a hard worker and an eternal optimist.\n  Dick spoke his mind. He never gave up. He was always a kind and \nthoughtful man.\n  During my travels as a U.S. Senator, I am constantly humbled by the \npeople of my State--people like Dick Reiners--and the basic principles \nby which they live their lives: a love of family, an obligation to \ncommunity service, and a strong commitment to an honest day's work. \nThose who knew Dick Reiners learned much from him, and I am honored to \nsay that he was my friend. He will not be forgotten.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4529-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE 87TH ENGINEER BATTALION (HEAVY PONTOON)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Army organization in recognition of its distinguished \nservice to this Nation and extraordinary performance during World War \nII. The 87th Engineer Battalion was the first heavy pontoon battalion \nactivated at Fort Benning, GA, on August 1, 1940. Also trained at Fort \nBenning, this battalion went ashore at Utah Beach in the Normandy \nlanding to build the bridges needed to liberate France. Among the many \nrivers that had to be crossed were the Meuse, the Saar, and the \nMoselle. The 87th Engineers bridged them all.\n  This brought the 87th Engineer Battalion to the most awesome and \ndifficult of all European rivers, the Rhine. Fifty years ago today, on \nMarch 24, 1945, the 87th Engineer Battalion made history when they \nconstructed the longest pontoon bridge in the world across the Rhine \nRiver at Oppenheim. Despite shortages of personnel and equipment, the \n87th was ordered to move Patton's 3d Army across the Rhone. They built \na 1,237 foot span in 13 hours while under constant enemy attack. Their \nefforts resulted in the establishment of the second American bridgehead \nacross the Rhine and contributed directly to the overall success of \nAllied operations. When they were not building bridges, the soldiers of \nthe 87th Engineer Battalion assisted in hauling thousands of tons of \ncritical supplies from the beaches to the interior depots. Their \nsuccessful accomplishment of this critical mission helped to maintain \nthe Allied momentum throughout the war.\n  The soldiers of the 87th Engineer Battalion repeatedly distinguished \nthemselves as professional soldiers, technically competent engineers, \nand great Americans whose performance of duty was outstanding.\n  For their efforts and impressive successes, it is my privilege to \nwish the World War II veterans of the 87th Engineer Battalion the best \nin the years ahead and join the Nation in expressing our heartfelt \nthanks for their dedication and selfless devotion and service to the \nUnited States of America.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4530-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY 1995\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, tomorrow marks the 174th anniversary of \nthe opening of the struggle by the Greek people for independence from \nthe Ottoman Empire. I am honored to be a sponsor of the resolution \ndesignating tomorrow, March 25, 1995, as Greek Independence Day: A \nNational Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.\n  Greek Independence Day celebrates the independence the Greek people \nachieved after almost 400 years of foreign control. In all those years \nof domination and repression, the people of Greece retained their \npassion for democracy. This passion is alive and well today.\n  The United States and Greece have a long history of shared democratic \nideals and beliefs, when our Founding Fathers designed the American \nform of government, they took inspiration from the democratic \ntraditions of ancient Greece. Later, Greek patriots in the struggle \nagainst the Ottoman Sultan followed the example of the American \nRevolution in their fight for freedom and their efforts to design their \nnew government.\n  In this century, Greece has been an outstanding ally and leader in \nthe fight for democracy; 9 percent of all Greeks, gave their lives to \nhelp stop the tyranny of Hitler. Together Greece and the United States \nfought against communism throughout the cold war and together we must \nwork to solve the problems of the post-cold-war era.\n  On this special occasion, it is fitting to pay tribute to all the \ncontributions that the Greek people have made to American life, both as \nvaluable members of our own society and as members of a nation that was \nthe birthplace of democracy.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4530-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     GREEK INDEPENDENCE CELEBRATION\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise once again to join the Greek \nAmerican community as they celebrate the 174th anniversary of the \nbeginning of their revolution for independence from under the yoke of \nthe Ottoman Empire.\n  I and 47 of my colleagues in the Senate jointed together to \ncommemorate this historic event by cosponsoring Senate Resolution 79, a \nresolution commemorating March 25, 1994, as Greek Independence Day: A \nNational Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.\n  From their first settlement in the 18th century in St. Augustine, FL, \nto one of the largest Greek communities in America, Astoria, NY, the \nGreek people have been an influential segment of American society. \nTheir history, culture, language, religion, and of course native \nculinary artistry, have enriched all of America. Greece has contributed \ngreat things in the areas of arts, education, medicine, and philosophy, \nbut no contribution was more precious than that of democracy.\n  Born in Athens during the age of Pericles and nurtured in the United \nStates, the principles of democracy are now being practiced throughout \nthe world. This new wave of democracy, would never have come to \nfruition had it not been for Hellenistic political thought. We will \nalways be indebted to Greece for giving us this most precious gift.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4530-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4530-S4531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                AG WEEK\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President. This week is National Ag Week. It is the one \nweek of the year that we take time out to applaud America's farmers for \nwhat they give to us every week of the year. Undoubtedly, they are the \nmost progressive, most efficient, and most productive in the world.\n  American agriculture is an industry to be proud of. America exports \nmore than 43 billion dollar's worth of food products every year--that \nis a trade surplus of $17 billion. Agriculture also employs more that \n21 million Americans.\n  But those numbers don't tell the whole story. Every day, Americans \neat. So every day, we all depend on the American farmer. We expect the \nbest from our farmers--and they deliver. We have a cheap, wholesome, \nsafe, and dependable food supply. No doubt about it, we as consumers \nare getting a pretty good deal.\n  Agriculture has made exciting advances this last year. Most \nimportant, GATT and NAFTA have opened up new trade opportunities for \nAmerican agriculture. Finally, America's farmers will gain access to \nmillions of new customers around the world.\n  At home, Republicans are leading the charge to reduce the regulatory, \npaperwork, and tax burdens which depress the farmer's bottom line. As \nwe work to rein in the Federal Government, we will focus on preserving \nthe programs that advance American agriculture in the world market \nplace.\n  [[Page S4531]] Today, agriculture is on the verge of a new era. I \nbelieve that 100 years from now, historians will look back and \nrecognize this time as a turning point in the history of American \nagriculture. Both locally and globally, things are changing fast.\n  Agriculture is now a global industry--an industry where American \nfarmers will play an increasingly important role. The Census Bureau \nestimates that the world population will increase by 50 percent in the \nnext 20 years. Today, 1 American farmer can feed 129 people. Tomorrow \nthat farmer must feed more.\n  America's farmers have already started preparing to meet these \ndemands. Less than 100 years go, the first gasoline tractor was built. \nNow, farmers are using satellite technology to customize planting and \nfertilizer use. That increases yields, reduces costs, and benefits the \nenvironment. These are the types of innovative programs we should \nencourage in the 1995 farm bill.\n  Mr. President, there is a saying in Kansas: If you do not eat, then \ndo not worry about the farmer. So this week, National Ag Week, we \nrecognize that each of us has a vested interest in the vitality of \nAmerican agriculture. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nduring this pivotal year to ensure that American agriculture remains a \nworld leader in this new era.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4530-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, as America celebrates National \nAgriculture Week, I rise to pay tribute to our country's farmers and \nranchers.\n\n\n                           the growing season\n\n  This Tuesday was the first day of spring. The time of rebirth and \nrenewal. All over the country, farmers are preparing to till the soil \nand plant the seeds that they hope will lead to a bountiful harvest. \nRanchers see newborn calves and lambs. In Montana and across America, \nproducers are getting ready for the future with hope and confidence.\n  They know only too well that lack of rain, too much rain, or other \nuncontrollable natural events can destroy their crop. They know they \nare in a risky business. And yet they continue to brave the risks and \nwork long hours, because of the satisfaction that comes with working \nand living on your own land.\n  These are hard working folks. They are survivors who make up \nMontana's number one industry, creating nearly $2 billion a year for \nour economy. And their work gives Americans the best, cheapest and \nsafest food supply in the world.\n\n\n                        before the farm program\n\n  Today we take all that for granted. We think it is natural. But it is \nnot. It is the result of careful policy, and cooperation between \nproducers, consumers, and government.\n  As we begin to redraft our farm bill this year--and as some with \nshort memories call for eliminating farm programs completely--we should \nremember what happened before we had any farm programs.\n  In those days, producers lived through drastic cycles of boom and \nbust. A hard-working and prosperous family one year could be destitute \nthe next.\n  As Mike Malone recalls in his book ``Montana: A History of Two \nCenturies'':\n\n       During 1929-1930, a new ordeal of drought and depression \n     began in Montana . . .  By midsummer of that terrible year, \n     twenty-eight of Montana's fifty-six counties had filed for \n     aid from the Red Cross. Most of those counties lay in the arc \n     of dry-farming and stockgrowing lands that reached from the \n     High Line north of the Missouri River to the southeast along \n     the Dakota state line . . .\n       An amount of wheat worth $100 in 1920 brought only $19.23 \n     in 1932. Beef cattle sold for $9.10 per hundredweight in \n     1929; in 1934, the price was only $3.34. Sheep brought $8.14 \n     per hundredweight in 1929 but only $3.12 in 1934.\n       Daniels County, in the state's northeastern corner, \n     typified the crisis. During the good years of the late 1920s, \n     the country seat, Scobey, had advertised itself as the \n     world's largest wheat shipping point. By the spring of 1933, \n     3,500 of the county's 5,000 people needed relief assistance.\n\n\n                    success of american agriculture\n\n  This disaster was only the worst in a series. The heartland suffered \nequally traumatic disasters in 1893, 1907 and 1920. But this time, \nFranklin Roosevelt responded by creating the first Federal farm support \nprograms.\n  Since then, we have had good times and bad. But farm programs have \nprevented crises on that scale. And during this time, American farmers \nhave created a productive revolution unmatched in history.\n  They have revolutionized agricultural productivity. They have used \nhard work and state-of-the-art research, to develop new sustainable \nfarming techniques, thus protecting our natural resources. And they \ncontinue to be most productive agricultural producers in the world.\n  According to USDA's Economic Research Service, farm output per unit \nof input increased by 26 percent between 1982 and 1991.\n  As a result, Americans spend the lowest amount of their disposable \nincome on food of any nation in the world. Just 9.3 percent, less than \na dime in a dollar of income.\n\n\n                           the 1995 farm bill\n\n  Today, if the Congress goes too far in a thoughtless rush to \neliminate farm programs simply for the sake of cutting, we could return \nto those days of boom and bust.\n  Less severe consequences could include lower soil and water quality. \nLoss of wildlife habitat.\n  Lower farm incomes, and thus higher rates of outmigration from rural \nAmerica. From the consumer's point of view, if we are not careful, \nAmerica could wind up depending on imports of food to give our citizens \nenough to eat each day.\n  We must help our producers make American agriculture more competitive \nand more profitable in the international market place. We must continue \nto develop new sustainable farming techniques. We must make sure the \nchildren and grandchildren of today's rural families can still live and \nwork on their own land.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the job. The FFA, the national youth \norganization for the improvement of agriculture, begins their creed \nwith the statement, ``I believe in the future of farming.'' I believe \nin that future, too.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4531-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4531-S4532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in honor of Greek \nIndependence Day, a national day of celebration marking 174 years of \nfreedom for the modern Greek people. The achievements of ancient Greece \nin art, architecture, science, mathematics, philosophy, drama, \nliterature, and most importantly--democracy--have become legacies for \nsucceeding ages to emulate. Modern Greece, born of these same roots, \nalso has given much to the present day world and especially to the \nUnited States.\n  Many Americans can trace their heritage back to the glory of Athens. \nGreek-American Dr. George Kotzias developed medicine to combat the \nscourge of Parkinson's disease. Maria Callas, the Brooklyn-born opera \nsoprano, provided us a legacy of beautiful music. Young Pete Sampras \nreminds us of the important contribution the Greeks have made in the \nfield of athletics as he continues his outstanding command of the game \nof tennis. Greek-Americans have also contributed to the might of \nAmerica's business and industry showing true entrepreneurial spirit. In \nOperation Desert Storm, Lt. Gen. William ``Gus'' Pagonis, U.S. Army, \nretired, successfully commanded the most complex sea, land, and air \nmobilization executed by a military force since the Second World War. \nAnd, of course, in this body today are two of the most outstanding \nGreek-American citizens in this country, Senator Olympia Snowe and \nSenator Paul Sarbanes.\n  On Monday, I will be visiting with a number of other Greek-American \nleaders to commemorate Greek Independence Day. Foremost among them will \nbe his His Eminence Archbishop Iakovos, the spiritual leader of the \nGreek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America.\n  On this day, it is important to remember that American democracy \nwould not exist today had the Greeks not believed in the power of the \npeople to govern. As Pericles said some 2,000 years ago, ``our \nconstitution is called a democracy because power is in the hands not of \nthe minority, but of the \n[[Page S4532]] whole people * * * everyone equal before the law.''\n  So as we honor the modern Greeks and their sons and daughters in \nAmerica today, let me paraphrase Thomas Jefferson--we Americans are all \nindebted to the ancient Greeks for the light of democracy which led us \nout of the darkness of tyranny.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4531-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, today I want to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the conclusion of the World War II battle for Iwo Jima.\n  Exactly 50 years ago today, the U.S. Marines successfully finished a \nfierce battle for a small dot in the Pacific that had been turned into \none of the most heavily fortified islands in the world by a hard-as-\nnails Samurai warrior Japanese Lieutenant General Kurabayashi.\n  The battle for Iwo Jima had started on February 19, 1945. American \nmilitary planners half-a-world away came up with only one way to make \nIwo into the needed U.S. forward base: an attack right into the teeth \nof the Japanese defenses.\n  The ensuing 33-day battle was the basest form of struggle--individual \nagainst individual, inch by inch. Artillery, mortars, naval gunfire, \nand air--the traditional combined arms of the Marines--provided only \nmarginal help to the attackers. The most powerful weapon was the \nindividual marine who hadto drive the enemy from gun emplacements, \ncaves, tunnels, and spider holes.\n  There were 2,500 marines killed on that first day--February 19, 1945. \nThe death toll tripled by the time the first marine fire team fought to \nthe top of Mt. Suribachi 6 days later. Mt. Suribachi was the strategic \nhigh point from which the defenders were pinning the marines down on \nthe beaches and was the dominating feature of the entire island.\n  Three reserve marines, two regular marines, and one Navy corpsman \njoined together in a moment that captured the soul of a service. They \nraised Old Glory atop that 550-foot extinct volcano. Those on the beach \nbelow saw the red, white, and blue flutter in the breeze. Secretary of \nthe Navy James Forrestal, there with the Marine Commander Major General \n``Howling Mad'' Smith, turned and said: ``The raising of the flag on \nMt. Suribachi means a Marines Corps for the next five hundred years.''\n  I certainly hope so.\n  Though organized resistance continued until mid-March, the flag \nraising, which produced perhaps the most famous and inspiring combat \nphotograph of World War II, symbolized one of the hardest won victories \nof that war.\n  Military historian Allan Millett has written of Iwo Jima that, ``Of \nall the unpleasant islands the marines saw, Iwo Jima was the nastiest--\nprepared by nature and the Japanese armed forces as a death trap for \nany attacker.'' And so it was.\n  There were 70,000 marines locked in combat on this tiny island in the \nPacific; 5,931 died; 17,372 were wounded; Presidential and Navy Unit \nCitations were awarded and 22 marines earned the Medal of Honor.\n  The fighting was so brutal, and the determination and bravery of the \nmarines so stunning, that Adm. Chester Nimitz, Commander in Chief of \nthe Pacific Fleet, was moved to say that on Iwo Jima ``uncommon valor \nwas a common virtue.''\n  They fought and died so that others might live in freedom. The \npurpose of wresting Iwo Jima from the Japanese was to establish a \nforward air base on the island which served, among other things, as an \ninterim emergency landing base for United States bombers making the \nlong run between the Marianas to targets in Japan. More than 25,000 \nairmen in the Army Air Force subsequently used Iwo Jima for emergency \nlandings.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak for all in saying we honor both those \nwho fell on Iwo Jima and those who fought but managed to survive. I \nknow it must have been a very emotional ceremony last week on the black \nsands of Iwo Jima when thousands of the survivors joined Secretary of \nthe Navy John Dalton and current Marine Commandant Gen. Carl Mundy in \npaying tribute to their bravery and sacrifice and to commemorate those \nwho did not return.\n  I felt of that same emotion when I was fortunate to be on the Senate \nfloor March 2, 1995, when Senator John Glenn was making a very moving \ntribute about the marines who fought on Iwo Jima. This was part of a \nseries of speeches about that battle by Senators who have served as \nmarines. Each spoke about a different aspect of Iwo Jima.\n  We would all benefit from reading all these speeches and so I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of the \nSenators, the date of their speech, and the page in the Congressional \nRecord where their remarks can be found.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SPEECHES--IWO JIMA                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Senator                  Date            Vol.   No.     Page(s) \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Robb..........

There are 5 hours of debate, equally divided.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do believe the distinguished chairman \nof the committee wishes to speak first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, ``Amici attenti.'' These are the opening words in the \nplay ``Fiorello'' when Fiorello LaGuardia is first campaigning for \nCongress in 1916. The set--and I saw it first in New York--is a \nwonderful set. As he is campaigning, to give the sense of ethnic \ncampaigning, he has a little box and they put it on the left of the \nstage. He stands up, and as he is speaking to Italian immigrants, he \nsays, ``Amici attenti, Trieste must be free as we must be free.''\n  Trieste was then a port disputed between what is now Italy and what \nwe used to call Yugoslavia. It was then part of the Austro-Hungarian \nEmpire.\n  Italy, of course, was allied on our side during World War I, and the \nAustro-Hungarian Empire was against us. And one of the big issues in \nAmerican politics where there was ethnic campaigning--people of Italian \nancestry--was the issue of Trieste.\n  Many of us today would understand it in a different venue--Cyprus, \nthose of Greek and Turkish ancestry; Jerusalem, those of Jewish and \nMoslem faith. The issues may change, but not the methods.\n  It was interesting to watch ``Fiorello'' in New York because at the \nend of his little pitch to those of Italian ancestry, the box is simply \nmoved to the other side of the stage, and he stands up and he is \nspeaking to those of Jewish background in Yiddish, with whatever may \nhave been at the time in 1916 appropriate for an appeal to that group.\n  As I went to law school at New York University, that was all I \nneeded, or anybody familiar with New York needed, to give the \nimpression of ethnic campaigning.\n  I saw the play produced at an Oregon high school some years later, \nand it was interesting the way the scene was done. They did the ``amici \nattenti,'' moved the box on the other side, and spoke in Yiddish. Then \nthey moved it back, and there is the same type of interlude in Swedish. \nThey moved it back again on the other side, and it was in Scottish.\n  Afterward, I talked to the high school producer and asked him did he \nknow he had added this. He said, yes, he had seen ``Fiorello.''\n  I asked, ``Why did you add it?''\n  He said, ``Because the students here are familiar with the Johnsons \nand the Eriksons and the MacGivers, but not the Giadellis, Bergers, or \nCohens. And so, for this audience to give the impression of what ethnic \ncampaigning was like, it had to be put in a form understandable to that \naudience.\n  I thought to myself, we are all products of our environment and where \nwe grew up. And we may see things in a different light and often at a \ndifferent time.\n  You may remember the difficulty that Ed Muskie had in 1972 when he \nused, or was alleged to have used, the word ``Canuck,'' a term of \nderogation, a term not to be used, and it hurt him in the campaign.\n  Yet, you can go back not more than 60, 70 years to the musical \n``Naughty Marietta'' and the captain, Captain Dick. Captain Dick's \ninfantry was almost a free-booter in terms of this little private army, \nand in the Victor Herbert musical, ``Naughty Marietta,'' you recall the \nlines:\n\n     Tramp, tramp, tramp now clear the roadway.\n     Room, room, room the world is free.\n     We are Planters and Canucks.\n     Virginians and Kaintucks.\n     Captain Dick's own infantry.\n\n  There it was used as a term of geography, perhaps, but really used as \na term for rural Americans. It does not matter if we are Canucks of \nFrench Canadian background or planters or Kaintucks. The times had \nchanged and times do change.\n  I remember well January or February 1942. My father was a lobbyist \nfor the principal Oregon business group, now called Associated Oregon \nIndustries, and then called Columbia Empire Industries. He used to go \nto the legislature. He was a house counsel for them, not outside. He \nattempted to explain to me in 1942 an incident that I could not grasp \nat the time.\n  I grew up practically every day after school at the neighborhood \nYMCA--swimming, tumbling, basketball--and it was, indeed, a \nneighborhood youth center, and we had a number of boys, members of \nJapanese ancestry. One day they disappeared. Gone.\n  My father attempted to explain the relocation. He attempted to \nexplain these were American citizens--he was also a member of the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, even though he was a business \nlobbyist--and the unfairness in what he thought was clearly an \nunconstitutional act, and surely the Supreme Court would strike it \ndown.\n  I remember him calling to my attention that we were not going to \nimprison any Americans whose names were Shultz or Heindrich of German \nancestry, even though at the time German submarines were sinking ships \n5 and 10 miles off our coast.\n  It was a difference in the way we looked at ethnic backgrounds.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Or Giadelli.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Exactly. We did not imprison any Giadellis or any \nDeAngelos; only those of Japanese ancestry. So as we look at things, \nour whole growing up and our whole background influence us.\n  [[Page S4535]] I noticed the glass ceiling report the other day on \nwomen and employment. I can understand the report. It is hard for me to \ngrasp, in terms of my own employment practices. The women in my office \nare my chief of staff, my press secretary, my legislative director, my \nstaff director, and chief counsel on the Finance Committee. All of the \nprincipal positions of leadership in my offices are held by women. All \nof my campaigns have been managed by women for the last four campaigns.\n  On average, although we did this study 8 or 9 months ago, women made, \non average, $10,000 more a year than men in the office. I once had a \nman--I do not know if he was facetious or not--who talked to me about \naffirmative action and the feeling that somehow men were not treated \nquite as equally.\n  In my office, if I had to have a quota system, I would have to fire \ntwo or three women and probably lower the salaries of many others in \norder to reach some kind of equality.\n  So, again, we are all products of our background. We all see things \nas we saw them when we grew up, and often people who grow up in a \ndifferent era, or are treated differently, come at things in a \ndifferent way.\n  I think rather than being harsh with each other and judgmental, we \nare often better to be kind.\n  One of the nicest eulogies I think I ever read was by Winston \nChurchill when Neville Chamberlain died. He died in about 1942. \nChamberlain had been the Prime Minister of Great Britain. He had been \nreally the head of the pacifists and had negotiated with Hitler for \npeace for our time. He had been proven utterly wrong, and had to resign \nalmost in disgrace at the start of the war.\n  Churchill, all during the thirties and during the ascendancy of \nNeville Chamberlain, said, ``Watch out for that man. This Hitler is \nevil. We are going to go to war. The pacifists are wrong. We should be \narming, not disarming.'' Everything Chamberlain did, Churchill \ndisagreed with, and Churchill was right.\n  Churchill's wonderful eulogy is as follows:\n\n       At the lychgate, we may all pass our own conduct and our \n     own judgments under a searching review. It is not given to \n     human beings happily for them for otherwise life would be \n     intolerable, to foresee or to predict to any large extent the \n     unfolding course of events. In one phase, men seem to have \n     been right, in another, they seem to have been wrong. Then \n     again, a few years later, when the prospective of time has \n     lengthened, all stands in a different setting. There is a new \n     proportion. There is another scale of values. History with \n     its flickering lamp stumbles along the trail of the past, \n     trying to reconstruct its scenes, to revive its echoes, and \n     kindle with pale gleams the passion of former days.\n\n  He goes on for another three or four paragraphs in his book and he \nconcludes that, ``We do honor to one.'' Churchill would have had every \nright if he had wanted to say this man was wrong, but he did not.\n  Now, Mr. President, with that background, let me come to this bill. \nThe issue of this bill, de facto, is whether or not we are going to \nfund, for those who are self-employed, enough money so that they can \ndeduct 25 percent in the first year and 30 percent thereafter of the \ncost of their health insurance premiums. There is no debate about that \nsubject. There is barely any debate about the funding levels. We would \nall like it to be higher, but there is no debate about what we have \ndone. And in the discussion of this bill, I think relatively little \ncontroversy, if any, would be generated about the purpose of the bill.\n  But the bill became a flash point when it passed the House and part \nof the financing--we have continued it in the Senate--was the \nelimination of what are known as minority and women certificates at the \nFederal Communications Commission, whereby certificates of preference, \nin essence, are given to sellers or others of broadcast properties if \nthey will sell them to minorities or to women.\n  This brings us, really, to the issue--and it is interesting that in \nthe Washington Post this morning there is a long story and in USA Today \nis the longest story I have ever seen for USA Today--four pages--on the \nissue of affirmative action. I thought it ironic that on the day we \nstart this debate, those stories would be in two principal newspapers. \nIt is doubly ironic that we start this debate on a bill that comes from \nthe Finance Committee. We have jurisdiction of many things on this \ncommittee, but never in my wildest imagination would I have thought the \nfirst debate on one of the major issues to face this country would come \nout of this committee. But so be it. Like generals, you cannot choose \nwhere you want to fight. You fight where you have to.\n  Let me discuss what the issues involved are and what we face, because \nI think in this bill and in this issue, whether or not we want to have \npreferences is really oblique. But what will come after this may be set \nby the tenor of the debate today. Take a look at the history of civil \nrights enforcement, and it really falls into three categories: \nindividual discrimination, individual remedy, and then past \ndiscrimination, where the remedy was a group entitlement rather than \njust an individual remedy. The last is a situation is where you have no \ndiscrimination shown in the past at all, but you have group \nentitlements because you want to change the ratios of employment, or \nadmittance to colleges, or whatever, but no showing of past \ndiscrimination. Those three--the first is individual discrimination and \nindividual right; the second is past discrimination and group right, \neven though everybody in the group may not have been discriminated \nagainst. And the last is, where there is no evidence of discrimination.\n  Take the first, individual discrimination. Suzy Goldberg is Jewish, \nand Suzy wants to buy a house in a housing development. The developers \nhave a covenant that they cannot sell to Jews. Suzy sues and wins and \ngets the house, and Suzy gets damages. An individual wrong and an \nindividual remedy. And that was what we thought we meant, I think, by \ncivil rights and civil rights enforcement, that all people were to be \njudged on their individual merits and treated individually. Then we \nmoved to a second phase. I remember this era because I was here. To \ndigress for a moment, it is interesting, when we were debating the \nbudget the other day, I mentioned a 1972 bill in which we were voting \nwhether or not to give to President Nixon the power to cut the budget \nwhen it exceeded $250 billion. One of the younger staff members, one of \nour permanent staff members, came up and said to me, ``Senator, that \nwas very interesting, but if we had term limits, would anybody know \nabout that except some historian? I thought her point was well taken, \nperhaps because I am going to go back now in history. I am not sure, if \nwe had term limits, that anybody would know.\n  Anyway, we went through this first phase of individual remedies for \nindividual discrimination--and Hubert Humphrey's wonderful comment is \ncited over and over on the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He said:\n\n       I will start eating the pages, one after another, if there \n     is any language which provides that an employer will have to \n     hire on the basis of percentage or quota related to color.\n\n  He was thinking individual remedy for individual discrimination. But \nthe difficulty came when you started getting into a situation where you \nhad businesses that simply had a history of discrimination. Women would \nnot rise above a certain position. No blacks would be hired. And you \nhad this 30, 40, or 50 years of discrimination. What do you do? How \ndoes one individual remedy solve an almost aggregated problem?\n  So the Johnson administration--and my good friend, Senator Moynihan, \nthe ranking member of the Finance Committee, is well familiar with this \nera. He was in the Kennedy administration in the Department of Labor \nand certainly is familiar with everything that went on as we got to the \nOffice of Federal Contract Compliance and the effort to get employers \nand those who contract with the Government to do better at hiring \nminorities and women. But the administration, I think, correctly was \nafraid to actually set quotas. They did not want to use the word \n``quotas.'' Therefore, business, on the other hand, was not quite sure \nwhat goal they were to hit. Ironically, it fell to a Republican \nadministration to really address this--there had been a couple of court \ndecisions, but the first set out a remedy that went way beyond any \nremedy to rectify discrimination to an individual person. It was \ncalled \n[[Page S4536]] the Philadelphia plan. Here again, when I say I have \nbeen here long enough to remember this, I am not sure if we had term \nlimits, if anyone would know this.\n  The Under Secretary of Labor was Larry Silberman. He was the author \nof the Philadelphia plan. He is now on the court of appeals. I knew him \nwell. I was on the Labor and Public Welfare Committee and dealt with \nhim then. More importantly, I got to know his wife, and she was my \npress secretary for several years in the 1970's. So it is a \nlongstanding association. Larry Silberman, now Judge Silberman, was the \nauthor of the Philadelphia plan. In Philadelphia, in the building \ntrades, they had a history of discrimination. Initially, we thought \nagainst blacks, but I recall, 20 years ago, Larry saying it was not \nagainst blacks, it was against anybody not related to somebody already \nin the trades. You hired your cousin or your uncle's nephew, or \nsomebody like that. It was a closed show. But it was totally closed to \nblacks.\n  So the administration came up with the Philadelphia plan. Larry \nSilberman, Under Secretary of Labor, now Judge Silberman on the court \nof appeals, was simply decreeing that, henceforth, the building trades \nwould have to hire a certain number of minorities, and there had to be \na timetable and a goal to be reached. And the problem was--and Larry \nSilberman said, in retrospect, and he set this forth in a wonderful \nWall Street Journal article in 1977--he said that inevitably the goals \nand the timetables became quotas. How could you know if somebody was \nmeeting the goal without counting? And the counting became quotas. And, \nfinally, the employers, out of frustration and fear, started setting \nquotas. If there were 20 percent blacks in the area, you try to hire 20 \npercent blacks, if you can.\n  I might quote one paragraph from that Wall Street Journal article \nthat Larry Silberman wrote in 1977:\n\n       I now realize that the distinction we saw between goals and \n     timetables on the one hand, and unconstitutional quotas on \n     the other, was not valid. Our use of numerical standards in \n     pursuit of equal opportunity has led ineluctably to the very \n     quotas, guaranteeing equal results, that we initially wished \n     to avoid.\n\n  So now we have gone from an individual remedy, for an individual act \nof discrimination, to a group entitlement and having to hire a certain \npercentage of minorities, even though many in the minority may have \nnever suffered any individual discrimination in hiring. They never \napplied and had never been turned down. As Larry Silberman said, once \nthe Philadelphia plan was adopted, we began to apply it nationwide like \nJohnny Appleseed, scattering it every place, and even starting to apply \nit where there was no evidence of discrimination. Just assuming that \nafter 200 years there had been discrimination and therefore, Mr. or Ms. \nEmployer, if you want to contract with the Federal Government, you \nbetter have so many percentages of different minorities.\n  That brings us to the issue at hand. It is the issue of the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the issuance of tax certificates. We are \nprincipally talking about sellers of broadcast properties receiving a \ntax credit when they sell to a minority. And the sellers are the ones \nthat make, initially, the great profit. Here is an example: Let us say \nyou bought a radio station for $1 million 10 years ago and you want to \nsell it now. It is now worth maybe $5 million.\n  The FCC says if a person sells it to a minority, they need pay no \ntaxes on the profits if, within 2 years, they reinvest them in a \nsimilar property. No capital gains, no nothing.\n  So they have a $1 million station, they sell to a white person for $5 \nmillion, they have to pay taxes on $4 million. Sell to a minority, they \nhave $4 million profit, and roll it into a similar profit and they pay \nno taxes.\n  What brought this issue to a head was the so-called Viacom deal, and \nthis was a big deal. This was a sale of about $2.4 billion and a \ndeferral of taxes, $400 to $600 million of taxes. That is what caused \nthis issue to come to a head.\n  Here is the problem with the FCC tax certificate program. First, \nthere is no history of discrimination in the sale of broadcast \nproperties. If a person wants to sell their radio station, they will \nsell it to the highest bidder. One fellow said, ``I don't care if they \nhave blue skin and an eye in the center of their forehead. If they have \nthe most money, they get to buy the station.''\n  There is utterly no history of discrimination in the sale of \nproperties. Yet the FCC wanted to ensure that minorities could get \nproperties, and they had to hinge it on something, as they had no \nhistory of discrimination in the sale of these properties.\n  So they came up with the idea of diversity broadcasting. It is not a \nnew idea; it is a policy they have followed for years. But normally we \nwould have thought of it as economic concentration. A person was not \nallowed to own two radio stations in the same town. They came up with a \npolicy that said, ``You have to sell one.'' Involuntary conversion. You \nsold it, you got the tax certificate because the Government made you \nsell it.\n  Pretty soon they said a person could not have a newspaper and \ntelevision station in the same town, and they required the divesting of \nthe involuntary diversions, and the tax certificates were used because \nthey changed policy. It was almost as if they were thinking they did \nnot want William Randolph Hearst to own the television station, radio \nstation, and newspaper--almost an economic antitrust.\n  The argument is people wanted diversity. In 1978, the FCC, Federal \nCommunication Commission, started the policy of diversity; you sell to \nminorities and you want diverse voices owning television and radio so \nyou could get a different kind of editorial opinion and a different \nkind of news.\n  Here is where the interesting linchpin comes. It is a difference of \nopinion as to how one reads the studies. I have now read all the \nstudies. I think I mistakenly had not read enough when it went through \nthe Finance Committee. I thought initially that the studies proved that \nminority-owned radio stations and television stations programmed \ndifferently. I have now, I think, read all of the studies that were \nrelied upon, and I will cite a few.\n  One was done by Marilyn Fife in 1984, an associate professor at \nMichigan State University. It was a relatively modest study, of two \nlocal television stations in Detroit. One was owned by a minority and \none not, and her conclusions were as follows: There was no significant \ndifference between the stations as to news and coverage of \ninternational politics or issues. No significant difference existed \nregarding coverage of community events and human interest stories. No \nsignificant difference existed as to coverage of crime, accidents and \nfire. And there was no significant difference in the amount of time \ndevoted to racially significant stories. In sum, she could find in that \nstudy no evidence that minorities programmed to minorities.\n  She did another study in 1986. This time she studied four television \nstations, one in Corpus Christi which was owned by Hispanics; another \none in Detroit--the minority owned station she had studied previously; \none in Jackson, MS, that was black-owned; and a station in Bangor, ME, \nthat was 100 percent black-owned, principally by 35 black professionals \nwho were mostly from Chicago.\n  What she discovered was interesting. In Corpus Christi, which is 48 \npercent Hispanic, this station owned by Hispanics attempted to \nbroadcast marginally to Hispanics but they had difficulty getting \nadvertising revenue, and they did the best they could. But she also \ndiscovered that there were other stations in Corpus Christi. These are \nradio stations owned by whites that were broadcasting to Hispanics--48 \npercent of the market. We can understand why.\n  The Detroit study was no different than she had seen 2 years before. \nThe two stations--one black-owned, one not--still broadcast similarly.\n  In Jackson, MS, about 40 percent of the population is black. But the \nblack owned-station did not program any differently than the other \nstations programmed. All of the stations were aware that there was a 40 \npercent black audience; it did not matter if they were owned by \nminorities or not.\n  Then in Bangor, ME--the interesting one--Bangor has only about .2 \npercent black population. And although the station studied was totally \nowned by blacks, they said it was first and foremost a profit-oriented \nentity. The goal of the news management was to have \n[[Page S4537]] similar news coverage as the other two local stations. \nIt is understandable.\n  Then we have the Trotter study in Boston in 1987. This study compared \nthe types of news coverage by five newspapers and then three television \nstations and two radio stations, one white-owned and one black-owned.\n  They discovered among the newspapers, initially, a tremendous \ndiversity in the way the news was covered depending upon whether you \nwere black-owned or not. But then look at the papers that were being \nstudied. The Boston Globe and the Boston Herald were immense big \ndailies, not black-owned. The three black-owned papers were the Bay \nState Banner and the Boston Greater News, both published weekly; and \nthe Roxbury Community News, published monthly.\n  They, in essence, were ``narrow casting'' as can be done in the \nprint. We still find all kinds of foreign language newspapers in this \ncountry, printed in this country, for a narrow population. Those three \nblack-owned papers in Boston, two weeklies and a monthly, were \nprogrammed to some extent to a black audience. But we can do that in \nprint; a person can do that. Say, if I have 5, 10 percent or 15 percent \ninterest in this, I can make a little profit on it. But the two big \npapers, the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald that were in essence \nprinting broadly for everybody, printed for the broad audience.\n  Then regarding the radio stations studied in Boston--one white-owned \nand one black-owned--again what the Trotter study concluded was \ninteresting. We should think of it in the context of our use of the \nwords ``narrow'' and ``broad.'' What do we call the function of radio \nand television stations? We call it broadcasting. It is almost \nimpossible to limit your signal to a particular segment--to broadcast \nit to a particular segment of the population. A person might get a \nparticular segment to listen --broadcast country and western, or soul, \nor all news. Whoever likes that will listen. No way can a person shut \nout everybody else who might want to listen.\n  What the Trotter study discovered on the broadcast properties was \nthat they all broadcast ``broad'' whether they were owned by whites or \nowned by minorities. They all regarded themselves as part of the \noverall community. No significant difference.\n  Then we get to the CRS study, the Congressional Research Service \nstudy, which admitted in itself it had some shortcomings. It was done \nin 1986, but it was done by sending out a questionnaire. It had, \nbasically, sort of multiple choice and then check boxes as to what kind \nof programs are done, no personal interviews. All the stations did not \nrespond, but it was a broad study. There is a question as to whether it \nwas deep or not--it is hard to tell.\n  From this study came the principal reliance of the courts, or the \nprincipal criticism by the courts, of the FCC's policy, because it \nfinally came to the courts.\n And, in the Metro Broadcasting case, the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 \ndecision--although it is interesting that 4 of the 5 in the majority \nare now gone and have been replaced by the other 4 that have been \nappointed since 1990--it relied upon, basically, the CRS study and said \nthere is evidence that a minority-owned station programs more likely to \na minority audience than would a nonminority-owned station.\n\n  But in a blistering dissent when the same case was in a lower court, \nJudge Williams said as follows:\n\n       Hispanic targeting is obviously more likely to be \n     profitable in Miami than in Minneapolis. Thus, if specific \n     minorities are more likely to own stations in areas where \n     they are numerous (which seems likely), the difference in \n     ``targeting'' that the Report hesitantly attributes to the \n     owners' racial characteristics may be due simply to their \n     rational responses to demand.\n\n  This was the difficulty with the study. How do you tell if a \nstation--if it is in a city that has a 30- or 40- or 50-percent \nHispanic listening audience or a 25- or 35- or 40-percent black \naudience and is owned by a minority--programs a certain way because it \nis owned by a minority or programs that way because that is the \naudience there is to listen to it? And that is what the minority, both \nat the lower court and then 5 to 4, with Sandra Day O'Connor writing \nthe dissent in the Supreme Court--that was the difficulty they found. \nAnd she says, ``First,'' in the dissent, ``the market shapes the \nprogramming to a tremendous extent. Second, station owners have only \nlimited control over the content of programming. Third, the FCC had \nabsolutely no factual basis for the nexus when it adopted the policies \nand has since established none to support its existence.''\n  In essence, she said there is no evidence to conclude that because \nminorities own a station they broadcast to minorities.\n  Now, however you look at these two or three reports, where you could \nread them one way or the other, there are two glaring problems with \nthem. One, the CRS, the biggest study, did not include television in \nits analysis. So you have no evidence. They just did not cover any \ntelevision stations. And, while they included women, the report \nbasically concludes that women-owned stations do not program \nspecifically to women. So if your hope in giving a minority certificate \nto a seller who sells to women is to get whatever women's programming \nmight be--whatever that is--you do not get it. It is no different than \nany other station that is owned by a man.\n  So, in these multiple studies, you have this situation: Some arguable \nevidence--some--that a minority-owned station might program to \nminorities. But to me, the overwhelming evidence is that it depends \nupon the market that you are in, rather than the ownership. Second, as \nto women, there is no evidence that they program to women at all.\n  In fact, again, I started this speech talking earlier about my \nexperiences. In Oregon--I do not know if this is true in many other \nStates--our second biggest market is Eugene, OR. I know what its \npopulation is. I do not know what the thrust or radius of the \nbroadcasting market is, but I would guess 300,000; and Medford, OR, I \nguess would be our third biggest market, and I guess it would be \n200,000. Each of the towns have the three network affiliates. In each \nof the towns, two of the network affiliates are owned by women. \nIronically, in each of the towns, the affiliates are owned--I mean in \nMedford and Eugene--each of the affiliates are owned by the same woman. \nSo in Eugene, OR, you have Carolyn Chambers owning a television \nstation, going head to head with Patsy Smullin, who owns a television \nstation. And in Medford, OR, the same two women own two stations, going \nhead to head in competition. I defy you to go to Eugene, OR, and watch \nany of the stations and try to figure out from looking at what is on it \nwhether it is owned by a man or a woman. You cannot. I understand why. \nThese are two canny women. They are successful businesswomen. They \nunderstand their markets.\n  So now you ask yourself--and this is where we are coming, now, down \nto the third issue. Remember, I said there are three types of remedies \nin the history of civil rights litigation.\n  One is remedies for individual discrimination. Suzy Goldberg cannot \nbuy the house. She is discriminated against. She sues, she wins, she \ngets the house and damages. That is one.\n  Two, you have remedies based on a history of discrimination. Let us \nsay it is in employment. A business has not hired blacks, or trade \nunions have not let minorities in for years, and you sue and your \nremedy is a class entitlement in which you say: We are going to require \nthe business to hire so many women or promote so many women; or we are \ngoing to require the trade union to let in so many minorities until \nthey reach a certain quota and we are going to give this preferential \nhiring right to any number of people in the class that has been \ndiscriminated against even though they individually have not been \ndiscriminated against, but you have a history of discrimination.\n  And then the third type of remedy is in a situation where you have no \nhistory of discrimination. This is where the difficulty comes in \nFederal programs, and it is an interesting distinction that the Court \nmakes. When the Court is reviewing discrimination on the part of State \nor local governments, or businesses or trade unions, there must be \nevidence of past discrimination before there can be a remedy of any \nkind. But if the Federal Government is imposing some kind of hiring \npreference or admittance preference or whatever, the Court does not \nrequire any showing of discrimination. They \n[[Page S4538]] have made a distinction between Federal actions, whether \nthey are administrative or congressional fiat or findings; they do not \nrequire any finding of past discrimination.\n  That brings you to the situation where we are now with the Federal \nCommunications Commission, where you have no history of showing of past \ndiscrimination in the sale of broadcasting properties, and where at \nbest the only justification for the minority tax certificates is the \nargument that minorities or women program differently, and you get \ndiversity. As I say, the evidence on this is mixed. Is that a \nsufficient justification for setting aside part of the television and \nradio spectrum for women and minorities?\n  Without getting into the argument as to whether it is or it is not, \nthe question you ask yourself is: Do we want a Government policy that \nsays we are going to attempt to help minorities or to help women where \nthere is no evidence of discrimination? And in order to help them, we \nwill give them a preference and, of necessity, as there is a limited \namount of these properties, the preference will have to exclude \nsomebody else who could have otherwise bought the station or might have \notherwise bought the station.\n  I want to tell you what I think is the danger of this policy. It is \nnot so much a danger as to whether or not we want to have a policy of \ngiving preference where there is no discrimination. What bothers me is \nthat the Federal Government is first defining minority and deciding \nwhat voices it wants to hear in broadcasting.\n  I will tell you one group that is not included that I would think \nwould have a legitimate complaint. It is Americans of Arab ancestry. \nThey do not count as a minority. They are Caucasian, so they do not \ncount. I would wager that the average American watching television news \ntoday thinks of anybody of Arab ancestry as a terrorist--they are going \nto blow up the plane, blow up the World Trade Center, or assassinate \nour diplomats. It is totally unfair to the millions of Americans of \nArab ancestry who are hard-working, decent Americans, who send their \nkids to school--but they do not count as a minority. They cannot get \nany tax preference for the purchase of a radio station or television \nstation because the Federal Government has made its decision as to \nwhich voices will be allowed. And when any government has the right to \nmake that decision, that is a danger to be frightened of.\n  Most of us in the Senate can still remember the attacks that came \nbefore, during, and after Nazi Germany about the Jewish-owned press. \nThe New York Times was singled out by the Fascists as supported by the \nGovernment. They were not, but it was the allegation: supported by the \nGovernment. It was a front for Franklin Roosevelt. That is the kind of \nfear I have, a fear of the consequences when governments begin to \ndetermine who is going to have the right to be the voice of the people.\n  You think back in history. Again I come back to what in my mind \namounts to discrimination against Americans of Arab ancestry. It is \nparticularly ironic if you think back in history. When we were going \nthrough the Dark Ages and Western Christendom was going through the \nDark Ages, we progressed through holding on to repositories of learning \nin a few monasteries for practically 1,000 years. You had these great \nMoslem centers of learning, and Jewish centers of learning. Ironically, \nalmost all of them were in what is present-day Iraq. Here were the \ncandles of learning and education which we kept burning. Western \nChristendom was almost on the brink of intellectual extinction.\n  So times change. Were there periods in our history where we needed to \nhave group entitlements to remedy past discrimination? I emphasize that \nagain. Group entitlements to remedy evidence of past discrimination? \nMaybe. Maybe not. That was the Philadelphia plan. The Philadelphia \nplan, for all of its good intentions, when it set goals and timetables \ncould not avoid quotas because there was no way to get there without \ncounting.\n  But I really want to ask a broader question--we do not need to answer \nit really today in this bill--as to whether or not we want group \nentitlements where there is no evidence of past discrimination. Not an \niota. And we allow the group entitlements at the expense of others in \ndifferent groups because of the Government decision that we want to \nprefer some people over others where there is no evidence of \ndiscrimination.\n  So as we start this debate--I do not mean today--as we start it in \nthis Congress and in this country, and it is coming in the years, I \nhope we begin this debate with understanding and not malice. I hope we \ncan conduct this debate with gentleness rather than rancor. I hope we \nconclude this debate with love, charity, and the hope that all \nindividuals of any race or ethnic background can finally achieve their \nrightful day in the Sun where they do not have to live in the shadow of \nthe suspicion that they got there because of a preference.\n  I wish that we had not had to come to this today or any other day. \nBut we are here.\n  So let us continue, as I hope, in spirit of fairness and let us make \nthe decision as to whether or not this country wants to go down the \npath of group entitlements without any evidence of discrimination.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I begin by--once again, not the \nfirst time and not for the last--expressing my great admiration for the \nclarity, openness, and wisdom with which the Senator from Oregon, the \ndistinguished chairman of our committee, has spoken. I have nothing of \nthe depth or breadth of his observations to offer myself today.\n  But I would make just a very few comments, some of which might \nresonate with the chairman. He mentions that I was in the Kennedy \nadministration. I was, in fact, Assistant Secretary of Labor for policy \nplanning in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. I was present at \nthe creation, if you could say, when Vice President Johnson went down \nPennsylvania Avenue, and left this Chamber. He had two principal \nactivities in the Federal Government, not many, after rather enormous \nenergy was given to assignments: The space committee, which was mostly \ninterested in whether--the great issue at the time--that would we build \nthe supersonic transport. All the major transport planes in this \ncountry had been begun as military models. They had gotten bigger and \nfaster and so forth.\n  Finally, they came along with the supersonic. It could get you \nanywhere in no time at all but with only a platoon of marines. And was \nit really worth it? The Defense Department said we will turn it over to \ncivilian manufacture, if they want to. In the end, as you know, we \ndecided not to and the Europeans decided to do so.\n  Vice President Johnson would concentrate on that, and have meetings \nall Saturday and Sunday. But mostly he was concerned with a Department \nof Labor subject of the employment of minorities in units. He threw \nhimself into that effort.\n  I can remember walking into Secretary of Labor, Arthur Goldberg's \noffice one morning and there on Steve Schulman's desk were three pink \nslips saying ``Call Camel.'' He was in Afghanistan, the Vice President \nat that point, in that celebrated effort in which he took a camel \ndriver, and gave him a truck and ruined the man's life. They did not \nhave any spare parts for the trucks but with camels you could go. But \nhe was thinking of this mission and all.\n  When he became President and was dealing, he was confronting, and you \nwere very sensitive. If I can say to the Senator that Judge Silverman, \ncommenting on the Philadelphia plan, pointed out that they discovered \nthat the absence of other groups in those building trade unions was not \na matter of discrimination against as discrimination for. There has \nbeen a great deal of literature, apocalyptic, grandiose, about the \nnature of the labor movement and what it would do for the world, \ntransformation, and so forth.\n  But still the most demanding text was written out of the University \nof Wisconsin in the 1920's by Selig Perlman, called the ``A Theory of \nthe Labor Movement,'' in which he broke the hearts of a whole \ngeneration of progressives by saying the labor movement arises from the \nperception of the \n[[Page S4539]] scarcity of economic opportunity. There are not many \njobs. There are only some jobs for plumbers in this town, and it would \nbe very careful who gets to do the plumbing, trying to restrict it to \nyour circle because the economic opportunity was scarce. That was \npublished, ``A Theory of the Labor Movement,'' in 1928.\n  But it also became clear as we began these efforts that we were \ndealing with issues of caste in American life, then very real, but also \nclass. Particularly in the Labor Department they had been able to \nunderstand the class issues; that these merged in many circumstances.\n  There is in the current issue of The New Republic an article by \nRichard Kahlenberg called ``Class, Not Race.'' It proposes a \ndistinction which is real. But I do not think an exclusive \nconsideration of either one gets you into a lot of difficulty. But he \npoints out. He said:\n\n       In Lyndon Johnson's June 1965 address to Howard University \n     in which the concept of affirmative action was first unveiled \n     did not ignore class. In a speech drafted by Moynihan, \n     Johnson spoke of the aftermath of caste discrimination which \n     had the effect of class disadvantage. That was the first \n     assertion of affirmative action as a Presidential policy.\n  The speech was given in June 1965, and on September 24, Executive \nOrder 11246, part one, nondiscrimination in Government employment. This \nwas directed to discrimination and nondiscrimination in employment by \nGovernment contractors and subcontractors, addressing yourself to the \nold refrain ``no Irish need apply'' phenomenon.\n  We provided that the Federal contractor had to agree to take \naffirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that \nemployees are treated during employment without regard to their race, \ncreed, color or national origin. That is the first use of affirmative \naction.\n  In 1967, I had departed then but all work was done in the Labor \nDepartment--very important, the Labor Department--in 1967, the \nExecutive Order 11246 was amended to apply to gender discrimination as \nwell, by President Johnson. And then again in 1969--and peripatetically \nI am back, I am in the White House--President Nixon went further in \nExecutive Order 11478 to speak basically to quantitative measures:\n\n       The head of each executive department and agency in the \n     United States Government shall establish and maintain an \n     affirmative action program of equal employment opportunity \n     within his jurisdiction, in accordance with the policy set \n     forth in section 1, to assure that recruitment activities \n     reach all sources of job candidates.\n\n  At this point, not to sound too theoretical, we are getting behavior \nof organizations. Two phenomena took place. One is that Federal \nexecutives seeking to bolster the legitimacy and widen the support for \nthese affirmative action programs included successively new groups \nidentified in one form or another, thinking that this would widen \nsupport--Native Americans, an obvious example.\n  But I remember, in the 1970's, running into a list that had been \ncompiled in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare which on \none line in a list of categories had the category Maylays and Aleuts. \nIt is a little hard to be clear what exactly the relationship between \nMaylays and Aleuts was, but somebody had it in their head. We will deal \nmore effectively, with the kind of openness of mind and heart that the \nSenator has spoken of, if we are aware that we are not alone in this \nmatter. Ethnic divisions are the primary source of division in the \nworld today, class division having turned out to be much less \npowerful--not absent but much less powerful. The problem is, as the \nSenator has referred, once you list 10 groups, you have excluded 110 \ngroups. So then you go to 11 and then you will go to 12. But you never \nreach a point where there is nobody that has not been excluded, and \nindeed our affirmative action programs today on behalf of minorities \ncover about 75 percent of the population.\n  The second point to make, if I may--and I am sure the distinguished \nPresiding Officer would recognize this--it is invariably, inexorably \nthe pattern of bureaucratic behavior--I know it is a bad word but it is \na reality--to seek to quantify. They will say count up and then we will \nknow. It is Weberian uniformity. I have got to be able to say I have \nthe same standards you have and let us measure by these same standards \nwhich will turn out to be quantitative. Let us see who has done the \nbetter job.\n  I think if we demystify a lot of this, we will do a better job in \nhandling it, with the openness that the Senator talks about, because \nlet us not have any illusion about the problems of equality in the \nUnited States. There are very real problems of equality. The Senator \nfrom Oregon nodded agreement at this point. They are enduring problems \nand a democracy inevitably and properly addresses them, and does so in \nsettings of great emotion because the one basic fact is that we are a \nNation defined by credo rather than by territory and blood, and the \ncredo of equality is very powerful in the United States. In the end, \nyou have to be very sensitive to perceptions that it is not being \nequally applied, and that is one of the things we are going to deal \nwith here.\n  If my friend would permit, however, I would like to address the more \npedestrian but yet more urgent matter before us which is the \nrestatement of the 25-percent tax deduction for the health insurance \nexpenses of the self-employed, which is the measure before us today.\n  Authority for this tax deduction expired at the end of 1993. The \nhealth care reform legislation reported by the Finance Committee last \nyear would have reinstated it on a timely basis, but obviously we did \nnot get that legislation passed. Thus, we have a situation where the \nfiling deadline for the 1994 tax year is fast approaching and the self-\nemployed are left with no health insurance deduction. It is imperative \nthat we act promptly on this legislation so that more than 3 million \nself-employed individuals across this country can file their 1994 tax \nreturn by the April 17 filing deadline. We must act quickly, and I am \nconfident we will.\n  Of course, reinstating the deduction costs revenue. In order to avoid \nincreasing the deficit, we must offset its cost with other provisions. \nAnd I was concerned, with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, that \nwe have decided to pay for the health insurance deduction with a \nprovision that has a long history and is controversial, as the chairman \nobserved.\n  I refer to section 1071 of the Internal Revenue Code which authorizes \nthe Federal Communications Commission to provide tax deferral to \nsellers of broadcast properties when such sales effectuate FCC \npolicies, including sales to minority purchasers to foster program \ndiversity. This bill would retroactively repeal section 1071 so that \neven those transactions which had been negotiated in reliance on \nsection 1071 could not go forward. One thing is clear as we consider \nthis bill--there were other ways to pay for the reinstatement of the \ndeduction.\n  Mr. President, many assertions have been made about the FCC tax \ncertificate program, some justified, some not. I, and many of my \ncolleagues, recognize that valid questions have been raised about the \nway that section 1071 is currently being administered. But, before we \nact on this bill, we should be clear that other options were available, \nshort of outright repeal on a retroactive basis. I proposed an \namendment in the Finance Committee that would have paid for the health \ninsurance deduction at an increased level of 30 percent, avoid the \nissue of retroactivity, and provided a moratorium of up to 2 years on \nthe FCC's issuance of tax certificates. During the moratorium period, \nno FCC tax certificates would be issued and applications for tax \ncertificates would not be processed by the FCC. The Administration is \nundertaking a comprehensive review of all Federal affirmative action \nprograms. The moratorium would have provided adequate time for the \nCongress to take a careful look at section 1071, consider any \nrecommendations from the administration, and make changes in an orderly \nway. Section 1071 was enacted more than 50 years ago, in 1943, and its \napplication to sales of broadcast properties to minority purchasers has \nbeen in place for 17 years, since 1978. It is only reasonable to expend \nmore than a few weeks when making significant changes to the provision. \nUnfortunately, the necessity of acting quickly on the extension of the \nself-employed \n[[Page S4540]] health insurance deduction has precluded that kind of \ndeliberation.\n  The amendment that I offered in the Finance Committee to this \nlegislation would have eliminated the retroactive aspect of the repeal \nof section 1071. Our colleagues in the other body, and more recently \nthe Senate Finance Committee, have voted to repeal section 1071 on a \nretroactive basis--that is, retroactive to January 17 of this year, the \ndate on which the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee issued a \npress release raising concerns about the provision. The best \ninformation we have is that there are at least 19 transactions that \nwere negotiated in reliance on the existence of section 1071 and had \nFCC tax certificate applications pending on January 17. In many of \nthese cases, the parties had signed definitive purchase agreements, \nsubject only to issuance of an FCC tax certificate, filed applications \nfor FCC tax certificates, and expended hundreds of thousands--in some \ncases, millions--of dollars in negotiation costs. All done in reliance \non an FCC policy that had been in place for 17 years and had been \nexpressly reaffirmed by Congress in each annual appropriations bill for \nthe FCC since 1987, most recently in appropriations legislation passed \nin August 1994.\n  Businesses cannot plan, cannot negotiate, and cannot compete on a \nfair basis under the threat of this kind of retroactive reversal of the \nlaw. The critical issues are adequate notice and justified reliance. \nMany of us believe that the affected parties justifiably relied on the \nlaw in effect when they entered into their transactions, and that the \nnotice they received was not adequate. This kind of retroactive \nlegislating should not be done. I regret that it is in this bill, but \nthe time has now run out for alternatives if we are to get the self-\nemployed health insurance deduction reinstated within a reasonable \nperiod before tax returns for 1994 must be filed.\n  Mr. President, we could have addressed the need to extend the self-\nemployed health insurance deduction in a timely manner without \nretroactively repealing the Minority Broadcast Tax Preference Program. \nWe must act promptly to reinstate the 25 percent tax deduction for the \nhealth insurance expenses of the self-employed. And, we will. I regret, \nhowever, that my colleagues did not accept the amendment I offered in \nthe Finance Committee which would have allowed us to review this \nprovision more carefully, correct what must be fixed and retain what \nhas clearly worked for so many years.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Maine has been on the floor. I \nthink he wishes to address this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. THOMAS). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, first let me say that we have heard \npresentations here this morning by, I believe, two of the most \nintellectually gifted, eloquent Members of the U.S. Senate, both of \nwhom have a long record in the field of civil rights and affirmative \naction programs that attempt to rectify policies of discrimination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let me interrupt the Senator.\n  Who is yielding time?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield as much time as the Senator may \nneed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I would like to discuss the broader issue involved here. Since this \nparticular bill is said to be the first wave of an oncoming assault on \nall affirmative action programs, I would like to discuss the subject in \na broader context.\n  First, commenting on the statement of the Senator from New York, we \nare trying to provide very much needed relief to the self-employed, a \ntax benefit that had expired last year for self-employed individuals \nwho need to purchase health insurance. That deduction expired last \nyear. It needs to be restored.\n  In my own opinion, we need to expand it as we try to reform our \nhealth care system. Many of us would like to see the self-employed put \non the very same footing as the employers who now claim a 100-percent \ndeduction. Obviously, that will involve a revenue loss and we will have \nto find ways to pay for it. That, of course, is the second component of \nwhat we are talking about here today, finding ways to pay for the \nrestoration of a tax benefit that we would like to see not only \nrestored but increased.\n  I think what is remarkable from my perspective, in reading today's \nWashington Post front page story about the mood that is sweeping the \ncountry, one that the polls tell us is overwhelming, that is the \nrejection of the whole notion of affirmative action.\n  Many people assert today that we are living in a color-blind society. \nI feel that is a flagrant falsehood. I do not for one moment believe \nthat we live in a color-blind society. I think, quite to the contrary, \nperhaps we are more color conscious than ever by virtue of the social \ndevelopments that have taken place in the past 10, 20, 30 years.\n  There is also a notion that not one of us should ever be held \nresponsible for past discrimination. In other words, you could have \nwhat you call 2 centuries or 4 centuries of absolutely reprehensible \nconduct and its impact on the minority groups, and there should be no \ncurative or restorative responsibility borne by today's generation. \nThat is a sentiment which apparently is very widely held.\n  Another widely held view is that unqualified blacks and minorities \nare taking jobs away from more qualified white males, and some would \neven argue genetically intellectually superior individuals. They refer \nto ``The Bell Curve.''\n  It has also been stated that reverse discrimination--which, I think, \nis a misnomer, reverse discrimination, because discrimination really \nmeans you have the power to discriminate, to hold someone down or back. \nFor most people who fall into the category of minority, they do not \nhave power. But, nonetheless, assuming you accept the phrase ``reverse \ndiscrimination,'' some have said it is an evil equal to slavery. I find \nthat to be more than a mild exaggeration, given the history of what has \ntaken place in this country.\n  And, of course, most people believe, and all of us here share in that \nbelief, that we are fundamentally opposed to discrimination.\n  On one hand, we are fundamentally opposed to discrimination; namely, \nbasing our decisions and judgments of people on the color of their skin \nor the texture of their hair, their gender. We are all opposed to that, \nbut we also reject any affirmative programs to rectify discrimination \nwhere, in fact, it exists.\n  I would like to say, respectfully, to my colleagues that we have yet \nto fully and honestly confront the fact that racism is an evil that is \nnot simply a stained chapter in our history books. It still flourishes \nin many overt and, I would suggest, even more subtle ways.\n  We tell ourselves that we practice our religious teachings in terms \nof loving our fellow man, until a controversy arrives or a conflict in \nour emotions or our loyalties, and then the darker angels of our nature \nsurface and they lash out and they blame or condemn those whose race or \ngender is different from our own.\n  I recall during the Iran-Contra hearings--those were chaired by our \ndistinguished colleague from Hawaii--by virtue of the fact that we had \na very popular lieutenant colonel testifying before that committee, the \nhate mail started to pour in, hate mail directed at Senator Inouye--a \nfloodtide of nasty, negative epithets directed toward a man who had \ngiven his limb, offered his life in defense of this country. And yet, \nbecause he had the audacity to question a Marine, a popular Marine, \nsuddenly the hate surfaced and was directed at him.\n  I thank our colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Rudman, who spoke \nout vocally and strongly against that, condemning the indulgence of \nracial hatred. Because, suddenly, the poisonous emotions started to \nbubble up, and the hate-mongerers said, ``Ah-ha, there is a minority. \nHow dare he challenge one of us.''\n  And so, this has been our past and I think it will continue to be our \nfuture unless there are major changes that will take place, hopefully \nduring our lifetime, but I doubt that.\n  So we have to go back and ask what was the basis for affirmative \naction.\n  The Senator from Oregon, gave a very perceptive analysis of its \nbirth. \n[[Page S4541]] But I think it is partly guilt, partly guilt on our \npart. And with reference to the Philadelphia story, so to speak, the \nPhiladelphia plan, some saw it as partly political expediency.\n  The guilt came about because we had recognized that we had \nperpetrated a monstrous evil, that we had enslaved a people, that we \nhad called them only three-fifths human, that we had destroyed their \nfamilies, their dignity, their pride, and that we had deprived them of \nopportunity. We had prohibited them from learning to read or write or \nvote. And then we insisted that they should be willing to fight and die \nfor America, but they could not sleep in the same barracks, they could \nnot eat in the same dining halls, they could not drink from the same \nfountains.\n  I do not know whether the Senator from Oregon saw the article that \nappeared in the Washington Post about a week or two ago about the \nTuskegee airmen. It was a poignant story. It was a reunion of the \nTuskegee airmen, a group of black pilots who flew back in World War II. \nIt was a very emotional reunion for them. There were tears welling up \nin their eyes as they were telling their stories.\n  They had to fight two wars. They had to fight a war against Hitler \nand they had to fight one against an inner rage that was burning inside \nthem toward a society that said they could be equal only on the fields \nof slaughter.\n  We recall not too long ago in our history that we were turning German \nshepherd dogs on blacks who were marching or sitting in, hoping to \nenjoy the equal rights and privileges that we have under the \nConstitution. We blasted them with fire hoses.\n  It was in the wake of the marches and the sit-ins and, I might \nsuggest, the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., that we, as a \nsociety, finally recognized and admitted that we had not measured up to \nour professed ideals, either as individuals or as a nation.\n  That gave birth to the affirmative action programs to break down the \nbarriers in the worlds of construction and housing and corporate \nfinance and banking and, yes, even eventually in the communications \nworld.\n  The purpose, as the Senator from Oregon has suggested, was not to \ngive unqualified people special preferential rights, but rather to give \npeople who were, in fact, qualified and eager and ambitious the \nopportunity to enter into fields that had been denied them solely by \nvirtue of the color of their skin or their gender. That was the purpose \nof the affirmative action program.\n  The Senator from Oregon said it was inevitable--quoting those who \nwere the formulators of the program--inevitable that the affirmative \naction programs would lead to quotas--inescapable. All of us are \nopposed to quotas, because it is just the reverse of what we are trying \nto do; namely, not give any group preferential treatment by virtue of \nthe color of their skin or the nature of their gender who are \nunqualified, but rather to use some affirmative action to allow those \nwho are, in fact, gifted and willing and able to break through barriers \nthat may be made of glass or concrete.\n  I mentioned expedience, by the way. The Senator from Oregon pointed \nto the Philadelphia plan. It has been written that Richard Nixon seized \nupon the plan back in the seventies, to get at the Democrats, to break \nthrough the trade and contruction unions who had at that point, and to \nthis day, I suspect, still basically support the Democratic Party. That \nthis was a way to really drive a wedge into the Democratic Party by \nopening up that particular marketplace, so to speak, to blacks who had \nbeen denied that opportunity.\n  So the question is, have we been successful? I suggest only partly. \nThe Senator from Oregon rightly talks about stereotypes. What happens \nto Arab-Americans in this country? We immediately see the stereotype of \na terrorist. How unfair, as he has pointed out.\n  The same thing is true for African-Americans in this country. We see \nthem, do we not, as athletes? We are witnessing the return of Michael \nJordan and a tremendous outpouring of pride and near hysteria at his \nreturning. We see them as entertainers. But do we see them as \nentrepreneurs, as such? Not really.\n  As a matter of fact, there have been stories about the problem out in \nL.A. right now. All of us--not all of us, but many millions of people \nin this country--are mesmerized by the trial going on in Los Angeles \nright now. Why is it, as the trial attorney Jerry Spence suggests, that \nAfrican-Americans look through a different lens than we do because they \nhave had a different experience than we have had. That experience has \nnot been a pleasant one, apparently, in Los Angeles.\n  Story after story starts to emerge about prominent actors or athletes \nwho have been followed right to their homes, to their doorsteps because \nthey happen to be driving a Mercedes or another expensive car, and \nimmediately, of course, what do the police suspect? ``Must be a stolen \ncar.'' Either that or, ``He is a drug dealer. Let's arrest him or stop \nhim. Let's see the identification and make him prove ownership.'' So \nthere are still stereotypes which exist to this very day.\n  Talking about affirmative action programs, I think the Senator from \nOregon pointed out the CRS study was at least deficient in one respect. \nIt had not analyzed television. I was going to ask the Senator from \nOregon or the Senator from New York as to whether or not there is any \nrelationship between minority ownership in programming, whether he has \never watched Black Entertainment Television? That is minority owned. \nThere is a great story involved in that particular television station.\n  The owner, Robert Johnson, when he was applying to college, \nPrinceton, was initially denied admission, except that he was then \nallowed to enter through a minority admissions program. He ended up \nfinishing sixth in his class.\n  What he gained from that entry into Princeton was access to other \nPrincetonians, access to capital, access to influence. And had he not \nhad that opportunity to break through that barrier that initially had \nbeen denied him, he would not be in the position that he is today.\n  So he started Black Entertainment Television about 20 years ago with \na personal investement of--I do not know-- $25,000, $30,000, $40,000, \nwhatever it was. Today, that station is probably worth $300 or $400 \nmillion.\n  I challenge anyone to watch the program. Is it different than CBS \nprogramming or NBC or CNN? I suggest to you the programming is quite \ndifferent. It is quite different. And I suggest that that relationship \nbetween the ownership and his status has a great deal to do with that \nprogramming.\n  The Senator from Oregon asked the question: Do we want to grant \npreferential treatment to groups where there is no evidence of past \ndiscrimination? But there is another question I think we can also ask: \nHow do those who have been victims of past or present discrimination \never acquire that access to the capital that is necessary for them to \nbe in a position to acquire radio stations or television stations?\n  In other words, if you take the position that you have historically \ndenied education to a group, let us say African-Americans, equal to \nthat of another group, namely, white Americans, and then you, as an \nemployer, say, ``I can't find any qualified blacks,'' that is the \ncircular argument that those who are struggling to break through the \nbarriers find themselves confronting.\n  I come back to the issue of stereotypes. All of us recall the \nClarence Thomas hearings and the Anita Hill testimony. What was really \nremarkable to me is the reaction of the people to those hearings. They \nsaid, ``Isn't it amazing there were so many articulate blacks \ntestifying during the course of that hearing?'' Now, why should that be \nso stunning? The word associated with those blacks being \n``articulate,'' as if we expected them to be inarticulate. Again, \nanother stereotype that they have to confront. We expect them to not be \nas educated or articulate as those in the white community.\n  Mr. President, I ask the question: Should we discontinue preferential \ntreatment to veterans in this country? I see the Senator from New York \nis rising quickly on his feet, having been a noble sailor in his youth. \nBut we grant preferential treatment to veterans. Why? Because of the \nsacrifice they have made in serving their country as a group.\n  Not every one of them served in the Persian Gulf or in Korea on Pork \nChop \n[[Page S4542]] Hill or in Vietnam or at Iwo Jima--wherever it might be. \nSome stayed right here in the United States. Some sat behind a desk, \nnever facing the threat of a bullet or a bayonet or a bomb. But we as a \nsociety say, nonetheless in hiring practices, we give preferences to \nour veterans, and we decide that.\n  When the Senator from Oregon says it is dangerous whenever a \nGovernment decides to determine who is in and who is out, well, we are \nthe Government. We are the elected officials. We decide. We are held \naccountable by our constituents, and we have decided that there is \nmerit in that particular case.\n  So I think this is just the beginning of a debate that needs to be \napproached, as the Senator from Oregon has said, with great \nsensitivity, with a recognition that this is a very powerful issue in \nthis country; that it has the potential to become not only a wedge \nissue but a very damaging, polarizing issue in our society.\n We have to look to see whether or not everything should be scrapped in \ndealing with affirmative action. Let us say, for example, we have \nabuses in the Food Stamp Program, do we not? We have abuses in the \nwelfare program, do we not? We have abuses in the Federal procurement \nprograms, do we not? We have abuses in the workman's compensation \nprograms and in the disability insurance programs. Has our answer been \nto terminate them, just kill the programs, they do not work. Or to stop \nfeeding people and let them fend for themselves? We say, wait a minute, \nlet us see if we cannot modify them.\n\n  Maybe the States have a better idea. Maybe there are ingenious \nGovernors, creative individuals at the State and local level, that can \ndo a better job than we have done. But the answer has not been, let us \njust terminate it, it is not working.\n  That is my fear, as we begin this debate, not on this issue \nspecifically, but on the broader discussion of affirmative action, \nbecause if we simply go by what the polls say, there is no contest. But \nI think we have a higher duty than to simply read the polls and to \nreally examine what is at stake here.\n  The stereotypes continue, as I have said. I recall reading an article \nby columnist Michael Wilbon, a Washington Post sports writer. He \ndescribed an incident where he and five friends, an investment banker, \na venture capitalist, a manufacturing executive, a lawyer, and an \ninternational marketing director for a large company, went down to the \nSuper Bowl. They were dining in a restaurant and the waitress kept \ncoming over to the table saying, ``Who do you play for?'' Well, he is a \nnoted sports writer, and he was in the company of a reputable lawyer \nand, as I recall, an accountant, and an investment banker. But the \nwaitress would not take that for an answer. ``No, no, no, who do you \nplay for?''\n  So we have to deal with the issue of the stereotypes and what that \nmeans and what they continue to mean for individuals who try to break \nout of the stereotypes, who are trying to get into occupations and \npositions and to start a on a level playing field, which has not \nexisted to date.\n  Whatever failures have been in affirmative action programs, let us \nlook at them carefully and let us try to see if we cannot change them. \nIf there is no evidence of past discrimination in the field of \ncommunications, that is one thing. If this is indeed a system which has \nbeen exploited and abused by white corporate owners and not really \nserving the minority community, then it is time for a change and indeed \nmaybe in this case even a termination.\n  But I hope, Mr. President, as we begin this debate on affirmative \naction, that we approach it in the concluding words and with the \nconcluding sentiments expressed by my friend from Oregon--with a sense \nof responsibility, not with a sense of hate or malice, or \nvindictiveness, or a simple urge to purge our laws as such of their \npreferential treatment to groups that historically have been \ndiscriminated against and continue to be discriminated against every \nday--every day of their lives.\n  So I commend my colleague from Oregon and also my friend from New \nYork. I hope that we can begin this process of fixing those programs \nthat have been misused or abused. But I hope we will refrain from \nplaying the wedge issue, which I know the Senator from Oregon, the \nSenator from New York would never do, because those wedge issues can \nbecome polarizing, divisive issues that will not serve this country \nwell.\n  I wanted to take the floor to express those sentiments. I know that \nis not the fashion in which you have proceeded. I commend the Senator \nfor his comments as he expressed them.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I want to respond to my good friend from \nMaine. He and I have probably been on the same side of more issues than \nany other person in this Chamber. He mentioned Bob Johnson, the founder \nof Black Entertainment Television. Well, I met him. Despite the fact \nthat he was a Princeton man and as qualified as anybody, his problem \nwas access to capital. I do not know what I would have done as a banker \n20 years ago if somebody came to me and said, listen, I have this idea \nfor an all black entertainment channel. I do not know. It is \ninteresting how he got the money. He could not get it from the banks. \nHe went to John Malone of TCI. I think Malone is maybe one of the \nfinest entrepreneurs in this country. Bob Johnson explained what he \nwanted to do. John Malone said, ``How much do you need?'' Bob said, \n``$500,000.'' Malone said--and I thought this is where Bob Johnson was \nso humorous. He said, ``All right, I will put up $125,000, but I want \n20 percent of your stock. I will loan you $375,000.'' Malone did not \nknow that Johnson would have given him 80 percent of the stock. He got \nthe $500,000 and he said to John Malone, ``I have not really been in a \nbusiness. Do you have any advice? Malone said, ``Keep your expenses \nbelow your income.'' From that grew Black Entertainment Television.\n  There is an interesting difference. Cable is more like the ethnic \nnewspapers. Cable is narrowcasting. This is where a smart entrepreneur \ncan say, I can make money on 5 or 6 percent of the audience, not 60 \npercent. As you skim through the channels now, whether it is education, \ndiscovery, or history, I doubt if any of them have 50 percent of the \naudience, but they have 5, 10, 20 percent. There is money to be made.\n  The Senator put his finger, I think, on the most interesting issue \nhere. No question, in my judgment, there is no discrimination in the \nsale of the broadcast property. If you have a radio station and you \nwant to retire, you are going to sell to the highest bidder. One owner \nsaid, ``Even if you have blue skin and an eye in the center of your \nforehead, you will get it.'' The potential is limited to those who have \nthe money to buy. Minorities, and maybe women to a lesser extent, did \nnot have access.\n  So now the question becomes this, and I do not know the answer. \nBecause minorities have been discriminated against for centuries, and \nbecause women could never rise above--you remember the settlement with \nAT 15 years ago. There was a glass ceiling. You could be a Ph.D and \nbe first in your class in all the schools, and there is a level beyond \nwhich you were not going to go. Because of the past discrimination and \nbecause of the past access to capital--the lack of it--we set up a \npreference program in an area where there has been proven \ndiscrimination, simply to say we want 5 percent women or 10 percent \nwomen to own, and we want 10 percent Asians and 5 percent this and 5 \npercent that. You just do it. I am not sure I know the answer. But \nclearly, that is the discussion we are going to have.\n  Mr. COHEN. Here is another example of the problems confronting \nminorities in this city. Many years ago--almost more than 20 now--I had \na problem with a car. I purchased a used car. I had a problem with it \nand took it over to a dealer, which will remain unnamed. The dealer \ntold me the cost for fixing that particular automobile would be $1,800. \nI said, ``$1,800? That is more than I paid for the car.'' I then came \nback to Capitol Hill and inquired, ``Does anybody know a good \nmechanic?'' which is hard to find in any city. They gave me the name of \nClarence Davis. I went to see Clarence and I said, ``Can you fix this \ncar?'' He said, ``Well, let me look around.'' He kind of tapped it here \nand there. He said, ``I can fix it.'' I said, ``How much?'' He said, \n``Do not worry about the money.'' I said, ``No, no, how much?'' He \nsaid, ``I am telling you do not worry about the money.'' So I, with my \ntrusting soul, \n[[Page S4543]] handed him the keys to the car and said, ``OK, fix the \ncar.'' Do you know what the bill was? It was $68. I will repeat that. \nIt was $68. Behold, I had found a man, an honest mechanic. And sooner \nwill a camel pass through the eye of a needle than you will find a \nmechanic that will charge you $68 for something somebody else wanted \n$1,800 for.\n  I have maintained a relationship with this individual. He ended up \nworking for another station on the hill, owned by a Korean family. He \nwas their real source of income, because everybody wanted to go to \nClarence in order to have their automobiles fixed. He is really a \ngenius in fixing automobiles. Then it occurred to him that he is \nworking for somebody else, and would he like to go into business for \nhimself? The answer was: Of course he would. He had a clientele of \nmostly Senators and Congressmen. But guess what? He could not get a \nloan. No matter that he had his eye an a piece of property that was \nprime territory; it was a great bargain and it was an old Exxon \nstation; it was closed down. He had a list of clients at least 75 long \nof Members of Congress and executive branch, who testified to his \ncompetence, and he showed a stream of income that would have more than \npaid for the mortgage. He could not get a loan. I sent him to every \nbank in Washington. He could not get a loan. So then I contacted a \nwealthy, white friend of mine, whom I had never asked a favor from in \nmy life. I said, ``Here is a person who is talented, brilliant, and he \ncannot get a loan in this city.'' And the individual made the loan, and \nthe business is there and is flourishing today.\n It shows the barriers that people are up against.\n\n  Now here we are, in a predominantly black city, with a predominantly \nblack clientele. Suppose now that individual, with a great record, \nhistory, clientele could not get a loan.\n  That is what I am talking about when I say ``access to capital.'' \nGive a person the access to capital and they can perform and prevail as \nanyone else. But that has been the history of denial in this country.\n  I say to my friend that I do not have the answer to it. I think the \naffirmative action programs were designed to achieve that. If they have \ngone astray, we ought to try to modify them as best we can. If it \nbecomes the collective judgment of the people in this country, this \nCongress, that they no longer serve a socially useful goal, then \nobviously they will be terminated.\n  I must say that we have not yet reached our ideal of a colorblind \nsociety. There are still many, many, racial stereotypes that exist \ntoday. They will not be easily eliminated. So we still have an \nobligation, I think, to help those who have the talent and the ambition \nand the desire to share fully in the real benefits and bounty of this \ncountry, who have been denied that opportunity.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nDelaware may need.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. President, what we are doing today is a most important step, one \nI have worked for for quite some time. I would like to thank the \nmajority leader and the Finance Committee chairman for moving so \nquickly to pass this legislation--legislation that is extremely \nimportant for our hard-working farmers, as well as our job-creating \nsmall business men and women.\n  Few people understand how very difficult it is to get a tax bill \npassed through both Houses of Congress within about 2 months' time. I \nbelieve we have been successful not only because of the efforts of \nSenators Dole, Grassley, Pryor, and me, but because our esteemed \ncolleagues understand how important, how fair, this measure is.\n  It has been my objective, along with Senators Dole, Pryor, Grassley, \nand others, to get the self-employed health insurance deduction passed \nretroactively for 1994; to have it passed before the filing deadline \nnext month.\n  Personally, I will continue to do everything I can to get this bill \npassed and out of conference with the House before April 17, the \ndeadline this year for filing our taxes.\n  This is so important to me that at the conclusion of the Senate \nsession last year, I held up a vital Securities and Exchange Commission \nfunding bill as long as I could because it was the last tax bill \nleaving the Congress. Since it was our last chance, as well, to get the \n25-percent deduction extended, I wanted to attach this legislation to \nthat bill so that there would not be this administrative nightmare \nfacing small businesses and farmers, because they might have to file \namended tax returns.\n  The Finance Committee chairman at that time, Senator Moynihan, joined \nin a colloquy agreeing we would take up the legislation early this year \nif I would let the SEC bill go forward. I reluctantly agreed. The new \nFinance Committee chairman, Senator Packwood, has kept that promise to \nmove quickly, and we have. In fact, to pay for this bill, we have used \nsome of the ways I suggested last year. In particular, I am pleased \nthat we have enacted some of the changes I have been recommending on \nthe earned-income tax credit.\n  Earlier this year, in an effort to encourage the House to pass the \n25-percent health insurance deduction, I circulated a letter with my \ngood friend and colleague, Senator Pryor, which was signed by 75 \nSenators.\n  That letter, sent to both leaders, stated that in order to move \nquickly, we would all agree not to support or offer any amendments to \nthe legislation to extend the 25-percent deduction for health insurance \nfor the self-employed when it reached the floor of the Senate. I \nbelieve this letter was instrumental in helping get this bill passed \nquickly.\n  Finally, I want to mention that we are not done with the deduction \nfor self-employed, even though this bill will enact the legislation on \na permanent basis for the first time. I believe it must still go \nforward. I believe we need to increase the 30-percent deduction to a \nfull 100 percent, just like major corporations get for that health \ninsurance. In fact, it was my amendment in the Finance Committee that \nincreased the 25-percent deduction to 30-percent beginning in 1995 and \nforever after that.\n  Although my amendment made progress, we have to go a lot further. I \nwill continue to do everything I can to increase the deduction to 100 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I ask that the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to take just 2 minutes in \nsupport of the pending bill. Then I would ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield such time as \nindicated to my distinguished friend from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York. I did \nnot know we were under a time agreement.\n  First, let me say that I believe the matter of providing \nretroactively the 25-percent tax deduction for sole proprietorships and \nself-employed--including farmers--is very, very important.\n  We should not have let that expired. It did. But now to make it \nretroactive, so that it is a seamless 25 percent, makes a lot of sense. \nI believe we ultimately ought to make sure that sole proprietorships \nare able to deduct 100 percent of their health care costs, just as \ncorporations are.\n My State is a lot like old England. It is a State of shopkeepers, \nsmall business people, many of whom are sole proprietors and \nunincorporated, including family farmers. Across the street may be \nsomeone who is incorporated. They can, under current law, deduct all of \ntheir health care costs as a business expense. On the other side of the \nstreet someone in business, but unincorporated, is now \n[[Page S4544]] able to deduct zero. With the passage of this piece of \nlegislation, he will be able to deduct only 25 percent; 25 percent is a \nstep forward. That is good. We certainly need to restore that. But I \nhave introduced legislation and supported legislation and fought for \nlegislation for years to make sure that we treat all businesses alike--\nunincorporated and incorporated.\n  Health care costs ought to be fully, 100 percent deductible as a \nbusiness expense for farmers and sole proprietorships just as it now is \nfor corporations.\n  So I commend the Senator from New York and the Senator from Oregon \nfor bringing this legislation to the floor. I fully support it. I think \nthe work the two Senators have done to correct this is admirable work \nand I hope we all can work together for a full 100-percent deduction \nfor all sole proprietorships in the years ahead.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield as much time to the Senator from \nRhode Island as he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first I thank the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee and the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, the former chairman, for giving me this time.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that this bill has come to the floor \ntoday and will be considered in an expeditious manner. I believe \nCongress needs to pass this legislation promptly so that hundreds of \nthousands of self-employed taxpayers can complete the filing of their \n1994 income tax returns.\n  The bill reported by the Finance Committee includes sufficient \nrevenues to pay for the extension of the health insurance deduction. \nThat is covered. We also came up with additional money which will \nreduce the deficit by about $1.4 billion over the next 5 years. In \nterms of the entire Federal budget this is a modest amount--$1.5 \nbillion over 5 years. But it represents a step in the right direction.\n  What concerns me about this bill, Mr. President, is that it provided \na modest test--not a gigantic test but a modest test--of our desire to \nreduce the deficit; and I am afraid that we are in danger of failing \nthat test.\n  Let me review the bidding. The immediate need which prompted the \nquick consideration of this legislation was a desire to extend the 25-\npercent deduction for the health insurance of self-employed individuals \nfor 1994. Absent this action, they would not have been able to take \nthat 25 percent deduction because it expired at the end of 1993. And we \nwanted to get this done before the filing date of April 17 for the \nincome tax returns. That is the way it started out--take care of this \nyear.\n  In the Ways and Means Committee the members chose to permanently \nextend the deduction. In other words, the 25 percent deduction for \nhealth care costs paid by the self-employed was to remain permanently \non the books. The Finance Committee went a step further by not only \nmaking it permanent but also increasing the deduction from 25 to 30 \npercent for the year 1995 and thereafter.\n  So what started off as a bill that would have cost $500 million, a \nhalf a billion dollars, to address an immediate need, turned into a \nbill that costs $3.5 billion over the next 5 years.\n  I strongly support the 25 percent health insurance deduction for the \nself-employed. Always have. The mainstream coalition health care \nlegislation that we presented last year included it. Indeed, we phased \nit up to a 100 percent over a period of years. And so, therefore, I can \nunderstand and sympathize with the effort to not only give the self-\nemployed the 25-percent deduction but to bring it up to 30 percent next \nyear and the years thereafter. All that is understandable.\n  I would make the point; however, that those who are working for a \nbusiness where their insurance is not paid for by the employer and the \nindividual must obtain his or her own insurance, cannot deduct a nickel \nof his or her payments for health insurance. The self-employed can, but \nif you are working for somebody else, you are employed by a corporation \nor a self-employed person, you cannot deduct the cost of your health \ninsurance. You cannot deduct anything.\n  So, yes, it is nice that we have gotten it up to 30 percent for the \nself-employed. But we have not done anything for those who work for \ncorporations.\n  But here is my concern, Mr. President. Sixty-six Senators in this \nbody voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to provide a balanced \nbudget amendment by the year 2002. Achieving that goal is going to take \nincredible effort. We are going to have to reduce Federal spending from \nwhat it otherwise would have been over these 7 years by $1.2 trillion.\n  Now, even for somebody from Washington, DC, $1.2 trillion is a lot of \nmoney. That is a monumental challenge. Yet, here we have a bill that \ngave us some money to start down this deficit reduction path, to use \ntoward the $1.2 trillion, and what is the action we take? We increase \nthe deduction and make it permanent.\n  I am going to support this bill as it was reported by the Finance \nCommittee because we did exercise some discipline by providing for a \nmodest amount of deficit reduction.\n  But I greatly fear that, in the conference, the House conferees will \nsay, ``Well, the Senate increased the deduction from 25 percent to 30 \npercent. There is additional money in the bill that is directed toward \ndeficit reduction. But let us not use it for deficit reduction. Let us \nuse it to increase the deduction from 30 percent to 35 percent or 40 \npercent,'' whatever the traffic will bear. And that, Mr. President, \nwould be a very great mistake, a very great mistake.\n  So I just want to go on record here to say that, should the conferees \ncome back using up the money we set aside for deficit reduction for \nanother purpose, I will not support that conference report. I believe \nit would be a great mistake. We in this body are determined to do \nsomething about these deficits. And to do something about it means we \nhave got to make tough choices. It means we have to forgo attractive \nproposals, such as increasing the self-employed health insurance \ndeduction.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the managers for giving me this time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield as much time to the Senator from \nMissouri as he may want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on occasion after occasion, you and I \nhave heard it said that under the dark of night, in the late hours of \nevening or the early hours of the morning, this body does things that \nare a discredit to a democratic society--pay raises, pork-barrel \nprojects, and profligate spending. The kind of things that we would not \nwant to have brought to the light of day.\n  But late last night, something very befiting of this body took place. \nAnd, Mr. President, it did so at your hand and at the hand of your \ncolleague, Senator McCain of Arizona. Because under your leadership, \nlate last night, the U.S. Senate passed the line-item veto. And in so \ndoing, we placed a tool in the hands of Presidents which will allow us \nto move toward the aspiration of a balanced budget. In the cover of \ndarkness, we uncovered the darkest parts of our behavior, and said no \nmore. We put the national interest ahead of the special interests. We \nsaid that in the future, if you want to put projects in an \nappropriations bill, you will have to contend with the possibility of a \nveto by the President of the United States.\n  So I rise today, Mr. President, to draw attention to the importance \nof the action taken late last night to change the culture and structure \nof spending here in Washington.\n  Forty-three of the 50 States have some variant of the line-item veto. \nDuring the debate, however, we heard people talk hypothetically about \npotential abuses. It is important to note that, of the 43 States, there \nhas not \n[[Page S4545]] been a single effort by any of the legislatures to \nrepeal the line-item veto authority. In fact, it works so well that \nthere is a consensus in the States that it should be left in place so \nthat they might continue to provide a foundation for the financial \nintegrity of the Nation.\n  Someone came to me recently and said, ``John, there is a State that \nhas changed their line-item veto. In 1990, the State of Wisconsin \namended their provision.'' Well, it was interesting when I looked at \nwhat the amendment really said. It reads, and I quote: ``in approving \nan appropriations bill in part, the Governor may not create a new word \nby rejecting individual letters in a word of the enrolled bill.''\n  Mr. President, what the legislature said was that the Governor could \nnot change the word ``cannot'' into ``can'' by striking out the last \nthree letters of the word. That is not a real change in the philosophy \nbehind the veto authority. It is simply a housekeeping detail about \nmaking the measure what it ought to be, namely, the capacity of the \nexecutive to knock those things out of spending bills which are not in \nthe best interest of the State. So, it is important as we go to \nconference to understand the success that the line-item veto has \nenjoyed in the States.\n  In the end, I was encouraged by the vote last night. Sixty-nine votes \nin favor of the line-item veto reflected a strong understanding that we \nmust adopt measures to restrain spending, and reduce the deficit. So we \nhave made a significant step forward. For if the people sent us here \nfor any purpose at all, it was to enact changes, such as this, that \nwill fundamentally alter the way we do business.\n  I look forward to the time when the conference report comes back and \nwe again have an opportunity to address this issue. It is critically \nimportant. The vote last night was encouraging. However, while the \nbattle has been won, the war is not over. And as we work out the \ndifferences between the two bills, I hope that the end product gives us \nas great a promise for financial integrity as the measure we passed \nlast night.\n  Mr. President, as the Senator from Indiana, you are to be commended \nfor your role, along with Senator McCain. It was your hard work that \nensured we arrived at a product which could be subscribed to by such a \nbroad majority of the Senate. I hope that this body acts on the \nconference report as it did last night. It was nighttime behavior, \nmaybe somewhat reminiscent of times when we have done the wrong thing \nunder the cover of darkness. Last night's behavior, however, was \ncommendable in that it was in the national interest. We should seek to \nreplicate it in the future.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend his request.

Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from New York and my neighbor. And like the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, I, too, hope that we will some day \nactually have baseball played. I share his sense of patriotism in all \nthings. I admire his sense of history. But I suspect he, like I, is at \nmany, many events this time of year when our national anthem is played. \nWe are all very proud to hear it, but we sometimes, as spring arrives, \nwait for the words, ``Play ball,'' right after it is played.\n  So the Major League Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995 is being \nintroduced, Mr. President. It is being introduced by Senators Hatch, \nThurmond, and myself. I want the Senate to know why I back this.\n  Senator Thurmond and I introduced on February 14 an earlier version \nof this legislation to remove the antitrust law exemption that major \nleague baseball has enjoyed for over 70 years. Major league baseball, \nunlike practically any other business in this country, has an exemption \nfrom the antitrust laws, and Senator Thurmond, Senator Hatch, and I, \nand others, feel that should be removed.\n  Actually, we are just saying that nobody should be above the law. We \ndid this for Congress. We passed the Congressional Accountability Act, \nsomething I backed for years, which applies the same laws to Congress \nas apply to everybody else. We are just saying baseball should live by \nthe same laws as everybody else.\n  I regret very much that the owners of major league baseball teams and \nmajor league baseball players have been unable to get through their \nimpasse. Mediation has not been successful. Presidential entreaties \ncould not do it. Congressional pleas for a voluntary settlement have \ngone for nought.\n  What we have always thought of as our national pastime may become a \nthing of the past. I am afraid that what we saw as children when we \nwould follow games, when we would go to our Little League games and \nidentify with various major leaguers at that time is gone. Seniors who \nlook forward to the joys of spring training and following their \nfavorite teams on radio, youngsters who identify with heroes in the \nworld of baseball, this will be gone.\n  And let us not forget so many who make monthly mortgage payments by \nbeing vendors of everything from T-shirts to hot dogs, who park the \ncars, who take the tickets.\n These people are also out of a job.\n\n  There is a public interest in the resumption of major league \nbaseball. I am concerned that the owners show no intent of really \ngetting a strong commissioner who might look out for the best interest \nof baseball. That is what the commissioner is supposed to do--not the \nprivate interest of those who make the money from baseball, whether \nowners or players, but rather for the best interests of baseball \nitself.\n  Our antitrust laws are designed to protect consumers, but for over 70 \nyears consumers have not seen these applied to baseball, on the \nassumption that there would be a strong commissioner and the major \nleague would operate in the best interest of baseball. But that is not \nwhat is going on.\n  In Vermont, where I grew up, virtually everybody was a Red Sox fan. \nNow there is divided loyalty between the Red Sox and the Montreal \nExpos, and there is also the minor league team, the Vermont Expos.\n  We also have jobs in the State of Vermont that rely on baseball. \nThere is a company called Moot Wood Turnings in Northfield Falls, VT. \n``Turnings'' is wood turnings. They make the souvenir, replica baseball \nbats, the little bats that have been passed out for 40 years on bat day \nat baseball games. They had to drop a third of their 24-person work \nforce because of the strike last summer. That is just one small \ncompany. These are not people who make a great deal of money. They make \n$5 and $6 an hour, and they were out of work because a small group of \npeople cannot figure out how to divide up $2 billion. It makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  We had a chance last year to right this situation when we were \nconsidering a bill to repeal baseball's antitrust exemption, but we \ndecided to hold off in the Senate, thinking that maybe everybody would \nwork it out. Right after that, negotiations between the major league \nbaseball owners and players disintegrated. We saw a preemptive strike, \nthe unilateral imposition of a salary cap, failed efforts at mediation, \nthe loss of one season and likely obliteration of a second, and pleas \nfrom all corners to get it going again.\n  I think if we had repealed this out-of-date, judicially proclaimed \nimmunity from the antitrust laws, this matter would not still be \nfestering. No other business, professional or amateur sport, has this \nexemption from law that major league baseball has enjoyed and, Mr. \nPresident, has abused.\n  In fact, one of the players who testified at the Judiciary Committee \nhearing this year asked a very perceptive question. He said, let us \nsuppose that baseball did not have an antitrust exemption and let us \nsuppose they were in the sorry state they are in today and then let us \nsuppose baseball came to Congress and said, ``Oh, by the way, we cannot \nclean up this mess we have, but would you kindly give us an antitrust \n[[Page S4546]] exemption? Would you pass a special law to exempt us \nfrom the antitrust laws''--something nobody else has. Mr. President, \nthey would get laughed off Capitol Hill. There would be no antitrust \nexemption passed for them.\n  So the question is, if we would not enact it today, why do we allow \nthem to have it? Why do we not just end it? It is something that should \nbe done.\n  I am concerned about the interest of the public. I am concerned \nparticularly about the interest of baseball fans. I am not here to \nspeak on behalf of the baseball owners or the players. Former \ncommissioner Fay Vincent said:\n\n       Baseball is more than ownership of an ordinary business. \n     Owners have a duty to take into consideration that they own a \n     part of America's national pastime--in trust. This trust \n     sometimes requires putting self-interest second.\n\n  I am also concerned about some of the answers I got from some of \nmajor league baseball's representatives. In fact, I should note here on \nthe floor that the answers that they sent, their written answers, are \nin severe variance with their hearing testimony on several points. In \nother words, they said one thing at the hearing and they said something \nelse after, in their answers. I think the public should look at what \nthey did, because either they are grossly mistaken on one point or they \nare not telling the truth on another.\n  For example, I asked the acting commissioner whether fans who reject \nreplacement players and replacement games would retain season tickets \nwhen the strike ended and major league players return? He testified \nunequivocally and without hesitation, ``Yes, sir.'' But in his written \nresponse to the same question, he did not confirm his testimony. \nInstead, he responded that policies with regard to season tickets and \npriority seating are handled by the clubs individually.\n  Well, he has given two answers. One has to be honest, and one \ncontradicts the other. At the hearing, I asked whether major league \nbaseball owners, who benefit from a special antitrust exemption in \norder to be able to join together with regard to sports broadcasting, \nwould make an unqualified commitment that major league baseball playoff \nand World Series games would continue to be broadcast over free \ntelevision through the year 2010.\n  The acting commissioner responded in the affirmative. But when he got \naway from the TV lights and cameras and the hearing, he answers that \n``it is not possible to make an unqualified commitment that far into \nthe future.''\n  I think the public is being shortchanged by the policies and \npractices of major league baseball and by such disregard for the \ninterests of the fans as evidenced from the hearing record.\n  They ought to have a little bit of competition. If we withdraw the \nantitrust exemption, they will have it. There is no joy here in \nWashington as we continue these proceedings--just a sense of loss, lost \nopportunities, lost innocence, and lost stature for a game that once \nsymbolized America like no other.\n  I commend our chairmen, Senators Hatch and Thurmond, for taking up \nthis challenge. We will move forward on it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in the spirit of bipartisan harmony I \nwould like to yield 5 minutes, or such time as he requires, to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to express my sincere appreciation to \nmy good friend, the senior Senator from New York. We have worked \ntogether on many important projects.\n  This is a measure before the Senate today that is very important to \nsmall business people all across this country. Today, the person who \noperates a small business has many problems. There is nothing so \nglaring as the failure of the code, as it now stands, to give any \ndeduction for the payment of health insurance for the business owner or \nthat owner's family.\n  This 25-percent deduction level, as we all know, expired December 31, \n1993. According to the Treasury Department, approximately 3.2 million \nself-employed taxpayers cannot currently deduct any of their health \ninsurance premiums, unless this is corrected. The 3.2 million taxpayers \nrepresent approximately 30 percent of the unincorporated business \nowners in America today.\n  We had hoped last year, and we talked a great deal in health reform, \nabout the need to put the small business owner on the same footing as \nthe employee of a large corporation who can receive, essentially, 100 \npercent deductions for the cost of health care premiums.\n  Large corporations already are able to exclude these costs, and their \nemployees do not have to report them on their tax returns. We are \nputting entrepreneurs at a very, very serious disadvantage. This \nproblem afflicts small business owners who are farmers, who are \nranchers, who are truck drivers. These people deserve fair tax credit \ntreatment.\n  One of the biggest concerns that we have today is that without this \ndeduction many families are left without health insurance because of \nits already high cost. We think this is a terrible impact on the \nfamilies. It is very hard to imagine a more difficult problem for them \nto face. Nearly one-quarter or 23 percent of the self-employed are \nuninsured today. About 4 million of those who do not carry health \ninsurance are in families headed by a self-employed worker.\n  This deduction makes insurance more affordable and helps to get the \nfamilies the health insurance that they need and deserve to get. \nWhether these are small businesses in the town or the city, or farmers, \nor truck drivers, as I said, or ranchers, these people deserve to have \nthe same kind of tax treatment.\n  The bill provides for a permanent extension of the deduction, which I \nthink is long overdue, and would provide retroactive deduction for the \n1994 returns. These returns are due April 17.\n  We must act swiftly so that those people who have paid the health \ninsurance claims last year will be able to deduct them. Unfortunately, \nwe were not able to act in time for farmers' returns, which were due on \nMarch 1.\n  If we delay this bill further and are not able to get it to the \nPresident on time, even more people who are eligible for the deduction \nwill have to file amended returns.\n  This is going to burden the IRS with paperwork, not to mention what \nis even more important, the burdens on the people who have to refile. \nMr. President, it is tough enough to have to file an income tax return \none time. It is certainly no pleasure to have to file one again.\n  I think it is also very, very important--and I commend the managers \nof the bill and the sponsors of the legislation--that we are making \nthis measure permanent. For years the self-employed have been subjected \nto the uncertainty of not knowing whether the extension would be \ngranted for the deduction. I think it has made it very difficult for \nthose people to plan. This should take that problem away.\n  I am concerned about the fiscal pressures and the need for deficit \nreduction, but this is not an area where we ought to economize. Small \nbusiness, farmers, ranchers, truck drivers--they and their families \nneed to have the health care that this will encourage them to have.\n  I would like to go further. If we have an opportunity, if the money \nits available, count me in on seeing if we cannot get the deduction to \na par with those people who work for large corporations. But I am very \npleased we are moving on this. I commend the managers of the bill, the \nchairman and ranking member of the committee as well as the sponsors. \nThis will have important impacts on the health of many, many people, \nmany of those who are in small businesses and their families.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from New York for yielding the time \nand I urge my colleagues to support this very important measure.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I know I speak for the distinguished \n[[Page S4547]] chairman when I thank the senior Senator from Missouri \nfor his incisive remarks.\n  I am pleased to see on the floor our colleague from the Committee on \nFinance, the distinguished Senator from Illinois. I yield her 10 \nminutes, as she evidently desires, but in fact as much time as she \nrequires for her statement, which I look forward to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York, \nand the chairman of our committee. I stand to speak with regard to H.R. \n831.\n  I am a strong supporter of the provision that is at the heart of H.R. \n831, the permanent extension and increase of the deduction of health \ninsurance costs for the self-employed. There is no question that the \nhealth insurance expenses of millions of self-employed individuals \naround this country should be treated more like taxpayers who work for \nlarger businesses.\n  Corporations that provide health insurance coverage for their \nemployees get 100-percent deductibility for the portion of the health \ninsurance costs of their employees that they pay. The employees of \nthose companies use after-tax dollars only for that portion of health \ninsurance costs not paid for by their employers.\n  Most businesses in this country provide health insurance coverage for \ntheir employees, as does the Federal Government, and State and local \ngovernment. Employer-provided health insurance is at the heart of this \ncountry's system of health insurance coverage, and the tax \ndeductibility of employer-financed health insurance costs encourages \nemployers to provide that insurance.\n  However, millions of Americans do not work for large corporations and \ndo not have access to the kind of group health insurance plans that \nlarge corporations often provide. Because they are self-employed, these \nAmericans usually have to pay more for their health insurance. Because \nthey are self-employed, there is no 100-percent tax deduction for the \nemployer-provided portion of health insurance costs.\n  Congress has attempted to at least partially remedy this serious \ninequity by providing a 25-percent deduction of the health insurance \ncosts of the self-employed. This provision of the Tax Code, however, \nwas only temporary, and expired at the end of 1993. What that means is \nthat, unless this Congress acts--now--all of the self-employed \nAmericans across this country will face a serious tax increase when \nthey file their 1994 tax returns next month.\n  That is clearly a totally unacceptable result. It is unfair, it is \ninequitable. It is simply wrong. That is why I strongly support the \nprovisions in the pending substitute for H.R. 831 that restores the 25-\npercent deduction for health insurance expenses retroactively, so that \nit covers the 1994 tax year, the provisions that increase that \ndeduction to 30 percent, beginning in 1995, and the provisions that \nmake that deduction permanent, eliminating any possible future \nrepetition of the kind of situation we find ourselves in right now.\n  Restoring the deduction, increasing it, and making it permanent is \nthe right thing to do. It eliminates the kind of anxiety and \nuncertainty\n that self-employed Americans are facing right now, and assures them \nthat Congress is committed to addressing the disparity in the tax \ntreatment of health insurance costs incurred by self-employed \nAmericans, and Americans who work for larger businesses, for the \nnonprofit sector, or for government.\n\n  Self-employed Americans are hard-working and make an enormous \ncontribution to our economy. We should not, we must not, make it more \ndifficult for them to make that contribution by handicapping their \nability to access health care.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Finance Committee has chosen to end \nthis unacceptable, inequitable, and unfair situation by creating \nanother one. The price for a public policy of moving towards greater \nequity in the Tax Code treatment of the health insurance expenses of \nthe self-employed, is the creation of a totally unacceptable, \ninequitable, and unfair policy in the tax treatment of the purchase of \nbroadcast or certain other communications businesses by minority \nAmericans, and, in some circumstances, women. I am, of court, speaking \nof the provisions in the committee substitute repealing the provisions \nknown as section 1071.\n  I strongly oppose the repeal of section 1071 for both procedural and \nsubstantive reasons. It is a statement that Congress does not care \nabout diversity of voice in major portions our Nation's communications \nindustry which, after all, are using the public airwaves, or franchises \ngranted by the public. And it is a statement that Congress does not \ncare about Americans who have proceeded in good faith to spend \nliterally millions of dollars based on the existence of section 1071. \nThey are being taught a very bitter, expensive lesson, never to rely on \nthe government's word, or to take actions based on the law, because the \nGovernment may decide, in a matter of just a few weeks to repeal that \nlaw--retroactively.\n  Most Americans, I am sure, have never heard of section 1071, and it \nis fair to say that, until 2 months ago, most Members of Congress knew \nlittle or nothing about it. And there was no particular reason for \nCongress to focus on the section. After all, it was enacted in 1943 as \npart of the revenue act of that year to help implement a new policy \nthat prohibited the owners of radio stations from owning more than one \nradio station in a given market.\n  What section 1071 action does is to provide the Federal \nCommunications Commission with the authority to defer capital gains \ntaxes arising from transactions involving communications properties. \nEssentially, it permits those gains to be rolled over as a nontaxable \nevent. It does not eliminate even one dollar of tax liability; it \nsimply postpones the date when that tax liability must be paid.\n  As initially reported by the Senate Finance Committee in 1943, the \nprovision would have allowed a rollover if the sale or exchange of the \nproperty was required by the FCC as a condition of the granting of the \napplication. However, the provision was broadened during the conference \nwith the House of Representatives. The conference report stated that, \nbecause:\n\n       . . . the Commission does not order or require any \n     particular sale or exchange, it has been deemed more \n     appropriate to provide that the election, subject to other \n     conditions imposed, shall be available upon certification by \n     the commission that the sale or exchange is necessary or \n     appropriate--I want to emphasize this part--to effectuate the \n     policies of the commission with respect to ownership or \n     control of radio broadcasting stations.\n\n  In 1954, the FCC's authority to defer capital gains taxes in \ntransactions involving the sale of radio stations was broadened to \ninclude television stations. In 1973, the FCC's authority in this area \nwas broadened yet again, to encompass cable systems.\n  Until 1978, this authority was used virtually exclusively by the kind \nof people who then owned radio, television, and cable systems, and that \ncertainly, at the time, did not include minorities or women.\n  It was not until 1956 that even one radio station in this entire \ncountry was owned by a minority, and it was not until 1973 that there \nwas even one television station in the Nation owned by a minority. It \nwas not until 1974 that the FCC first awarded a new radio station \nlicense to a minority-owned company the same way it had awarded tens of \nbillions of dollars' worth of broadcast spectrum to nonminorities--for \nfree--by an FCC comparative hearing.\n  The truth is, Mr. President, that the FCC initially handed out \nvirtually all of the broadcast spectrum to nonminorities free of \ncharge, and then used section 1071 over and over and over again to \nallow them to roll over the huge capital gains they made in tax-free \ntransactions that allowed them to defer their tax liability. The FCC, \nas it handed out the spectrum owned by all Americans relied heavily on \nthe question of the previous broadcast experience of competing \napplicants in awarding new licenses. Yet for several decades, even \nbroadcast training was denied to minorities in this country and in some \nparts of this country as a matter of law.\n  State universities were legally barred from admitting minorities at \nthe time these stations were originally given out. State-owned public \nbroadcasting authorities refused to hire or train them. State \nlegislatures denied black \n[[Page S4548]] State colleges the funds to start broadcasting programs \nor to apply for broadcasting licenses. For example, the FCC routinely \ngranted broadcast licenses to colleges and universities that were \nsegregated by law, such as WBKY-FM, serving the University of Kentucky, \nwhich was licensed in 1941, WUNC-FM, serving the University of North \nCarolina, which was licensed in 1952, and KUT-FM, serving the \nUniversity\n of Texas, among many others.\n\n  These segregated policies helped ensure that a generation of \nminorities would be denied the skills and the access necessary to enter \nthe broadcast industry--with the FCC's full endorsement and \nratification.\n  The extent of the FCC's complicity is illustrated by the case of \nBroward County Broadcasting versus FCC. This 1963 case involved a radio \nstation, WIXX, located in a community with a large African-American \npopulation, a population that received no black-oriented programming \nfrom any station serving that market. WIXX decided to devote its \nprogram schedule to black-oriented news, public affairs, and music. The \ncity government complained to the FCC that WIXX was offering a format \nwhich the city did not need and did not want. The FCC, in turn, threw \nthe station into a public revocation proceeding, which placed its \nbroadcast license in jeopardy. Faced with the loss of the ability to do \nbusiness, the station dropped its black programming, and the FCC \nquietly dropped the charges of ``character violation.''\n  These policies kept minorities from participating in the free \nbroadcast spectrum ``gold rush'' that was going on in America. And by \nthe time these policies were ended, the gold rush was over, and there \nwas no more spectrum to allocate for free.\n  In 1978, the FCC finally recognized its role in denying minorities \nany opportunity to participate in the gold rush and to enter the \nbroadcast or cable industries. That year, the FCC announced a policy of \npromoting ownership of broadcast facilities by offering an FCC tax \ncertificate to those who voluntarily sell such facilities to minority \nindividuals or minority-controlled entities. The FCC's policy was based \non the view that minority ownership of broadcast properties would \nprovide a significant means of fostering the inclusion of the views of \nminority Americans in programming, thereby better serving the needs and \ninterests of the minority community and enriching the range of material \navailable to the nonminority audience. The FCC subsequently expanded \nits policy to cover the sale of cable systems, as well.\n  In 1982, during the Reagan administration, the FCC further expanded \nits tax certificate program. At that time, the FCC decided that, in \naddition to those who sell properties to minorities, investors who \ncontribute to the stabilization of the capital base of a minority \nenterprise would be able to receive a tax certificate on the subsequent \nsale of their interest in the minority entity.\n  This became an incentive for investors to help with preserving and \nexpanding diversity of voice.\n  The FCC program is not a set-aside or a quota. It functions in the \nsame voluntary manner as the FCC's other uses of tax certificates. The \nFCC does not require a percentage of licenses to be controlled by \nminorities, it does not require media properties to be sold to \nminority-controlled businesses, it does not require a set percentage, \nnor does it require a nonminority seller of media property to a \nminority-controlled business to even request a tax certificate.\n  So there is nothing compulsory. There are no quota aspects of the tax \ncertificate policy at all. The direct beneficiaries of the tax \ncertificate may or may not be the minority member. In many instances it \nmay be the nonminority seller and/or the investors who participate in \nthe acquisition with the minority purchaser. The benefit to potential \nminority purchasers is the incentive it creates for sellers, and the \nenhanced access to capital it provides.\n  The FCC certificate program then operates as a key to unlock the door \nof opportunity for minorities who have a role in the broadcast industry \nin our Nation.\n  There can be no question that minority entrepreneurs have a tougher \ntime accessing the capital markets of this country. The FCC recognized \nthis fact, and the minority ownership program has expanded that access \nto capital.\n  In 1987, Congress explicitly endorsed the FCC's actions in expanding \nthe tax certificate program to encourage expanded minority ownership of \nbroadcast and cable systems. That year's Commerce, State, Justice, \nappropriations bill contained language locking in the tax certificate \nprogram, they thought. The committee report on the bill stated \n``Diversity of ownership results in diversity of programming and \nimproved service to minority and women audiences.'' Similar language \nhas been included in every annual appropriations bill since that time, \nuntil now.\n  Between 1978 and 1994, the FCC issued 317 tax certificates under its \nminority ownership program. Radio stations represented about 83 percent \nof the certificates issued, television stations 8 percent, and cable \nsystems, about 9 percent. These certificates helped minorities enter a \nbusiness which, as I have outlined, was virtually completely closed to \nthem. And it did so not by taking away a license from anyone, or \nthrough any form of direct financial assistance to the minority buyers, \nbut, as I have already stated, through tax deferrals for potential \nsellers of radio and TV stations, and cable systems, and potential \ninvestors who were willing to enter partnerships with minority buyers \nto purchase these properties.\n  The program has begun to make a difference, but it is worth keeping \nin mind that, out of the 1,342 television stations operating in the \nUnited States, only 26, or about 1.9 percent are owned by women. \nAfrican-Americans owned less than that, only 21 stations, Hispanics \nowned 9, and Asians owned 1.\n  In radio, the situation is a little better. Out of the 10,244 radio \nstations operating in the United States, 394, or about 3.8 percent are \nowned by women, another 172 are owned by African-Americans, 111 by \nHispanics, 4 by Asians, and 5 by native Americans.\n  These are the public airwaves we are talking about, Mr. President, \nand cable systems that require public approvals in order to function. \nEvery American ought to have the right to participate in this industry, \nand there should be enough diversity of voice to ensure that our \nbroadcast and cable systems meet the needs of all of our people.\n  And research confirms a link, or the nexus, between expanding \nminority ownership and diversity of voice.\n  By diversity of voice we mean the notion that the airwaves that we \ncommunicate on as Americans will include the views of everybody and not \njust one segment of the population or community, but of all segments of \nthe population and the community. And in that diversity comes the kind \nof vitality that will keep our Nation vital and keep our democracy \nalive.\n  You will recall George Orwell talked in ``1984'' about the wave of \ncommunication happening, and big brother sent one message to the people \nat all times. There were no alternative messages, alternative points of \nview, alternative perspectives to encourage people to think for \nthemselves. The whole idea of diversity of voice is that the entire \ncommunity benefits when it has the point of view and the perspective of \nall our people, when the perspective and the information that is \ncommunicated through the public airwaves represents the whole panoply \nof Americans in this country and that we can all participate and draw \nfrom our diversity as a source of our strength.\n  The Supreme Court made this clear, in a case of Metro Broadcasting, \nInc. versus FCC. In that case, the Supreme Court held that benign, \nrace-conscious measures mandated by Congress are constitutionally \npermissible, based on a record of empirical evidence demonstrating a \nnexus between minority ownership and diversity in programming.\n  There were five studies of this connection cited in the Metro case, \nincluding a study by the Congressional Research Service, ``Minority \nBroadcast Station Ownership and Programming: Is There a Nexus?'' \n(1988).\n  That is to say, does minority ownership encourage diversity of views?\n  This study, which looked at radio data collected by the FCC from over \n9,000 radio and TV stations, showed a strong correlation between \nminority ownership and programming targeted \n[[Page S4549]] to minority ownerships and expansion of diversity of \nvoice for everyone. The other studies all had similar findings, showing \ndifferences in programming, including news programming, and differences \nin the willingness to hire women and minorities as employees.\n  Mr. President, what the Finance Committee and the House of \nRepresentatives are now proposing with this legislation, however, is to \nterminate this progress toward diversity, to terminate the 1071 tax \ncertificate program and to do so retroactively and with virtually no \nnotice at all.\n  The committee report sets out three reasons for terminating the \nprogram. It says that the tax certificate program has evolved far \nbeyond what Congress originally intended. The report makes this \nargument even though it was Congress that gave the FCC broad discretion \nto set the terms of the tax certificate program.\n  Second, the committee report argues that the FCC standards for \nissuing the certificates are vague and therefore subject to significant \nabuse. It asserts that the FCC's determination of control does not \nguarantee that a minority purchaser will continue to manage the \nbroadcast or cable property after the tax certificate has been issued.\n  Third, the report argues that the tax certificate program is not \nsupervised and reviewed by the Internal Revenue Service, and that the \nFCC does not request information regarding the size of the tax benefit \nor otherwise act to ensure that the nonminority seller does not get the \nentire benefit of the certificate.\n  Mr. President, these arguments, it seems to me, are sufficient to \nwarrant a reasoned, deliberate and careful review of this program and \nnot the total elimination retroactively of it. As a general matter, I \nbelieve that all Federal programs should be periodically reviewed. We \nshould take a look at everything to make sure it works as it was \nintended to work by this Congress, to make sure that it is more \nefficient. However, that commonsense principle, I believe, should not \nbe exploited as a blanket license to just carelessly throw out \nlongstanding Federal laws without any review before the fact, without \nany chance to take a look at it. And yet that is exactly what we are \nsaying here.\n  No study of the effectiveness of section 1071 was undertaken by the \nHouse of Representatives before it rushed to repeal this legislation. \nNor has the Senate undertaken the opportunity to fully study the merits \nof section 1071. The majority leader of this body stood in the Chamber \njust last week talking about the fact that there are over 160 Federal \nprograms he would like to see reviewed as part of a comprehensive \nreview of Federal affirmative action policies. And the majority leader \nasked two Senate committees to hold hearings as part of that review. \nThe majority leader also commended this administration for its ongoing \nreview of affirmative action policies and programs.\n  All of these suggestions that there be a review indicate to me that \nthe Finance Committee should have at least awaited the results of the \nadministration's efforts and should have considered whether or not \nsection 1071 was working, whether it had problems, whether its \nobjectives were important ones, and whether or not reform rather than \nretroactive elimination would have been more appropriate.\n  That is not what is happening with this bill, Mr. President. Instead, \nwe see a rush to judgment. Instead, what we see is an unwillingness to \nconfront the fact that minorities and women have been excluded from the \nbroadcast and cable industries and that minorities and women continue \nto have access-to-capital problems that are significantly greater and \ndifferent than other potential acquirers.\n  Indeed, what we see is a total disregard of the policy considerations \nhaving to do with diversity of voice that led to the creation of this \ntax certificate program in the first place.\n  This hasty repeal would not just eliminate a genuinely worthy \nminority ownership program; it would also repeal all of the other uses \nof the FCC tax certificates. For example, a broadcast or cable licensee \nis eligible for a tax certificate when it divests a media property in \norder to comply with the FCC's cable/broadcast cross-ownership policy \nand the newspaper/TV cross-ownership policy. Repeal of section 1071, \ntherefore, eliminates a reasonable incentive for FCC licensees to \ncomply with FCC policies.\n  Repealing section 1071, moreover, does not mean ending capital gains \nrollovers in the future. There will still be many, many ways to \nstructure transactions in ways that will avoid capital gains taxes. And \nin fact the experience is that the most recent sales in the cable \nindustry have all been tax-free transactions that did not involve the \ntax certificate program which was calculated to give minorities and \nwomen a chance.\n  Some recent examples illustrate this point. Time/Warner announced in \nJanuary of 1995 that it will acquire KBL Communication from Houston \nIndustries in a tax-free stock transaction with an estimated purchase \nprice of $2.2 billion. Time/Warner has also announced a tax-free \nacquisition of Summit Communications for $350 million via a stock \nexchange. Again, no tax rollover questions there. Cox Cable acquired \nTimes Mirror Cable in a tax-free merger with an estimated price of $2.3 \nbillion. Minority entrepreneurs, however, because they frequently lack \nthe access to capital of long-established companies, cannot rely on \nsection 328 of the Tax Code which authorizes those tax-free \ntransactions. Instead, they have had to rely and have relied on section \n1071.\n  That is why it is particularly troubling that the proposal before the \nSenate is to retroactively repeal section 1071 simply because a \nparticular African-American businessman is involved in a large \ntransaction that is eligible for a tax certificate and the resulting \ncapital gains tax deferral. The rush to undo this transaction ignores, \nin my opinion, some important facts. The first is that the transaction \nthat precipitated the House Committee's action, the so-called Viacom \ntransaction, is not the only pending transaction at the FCC. There are \nat least 19 others.\n  Second, all of these acquirers have justifiably relied on the \nexistence of section 1071, which has now been in place for over 17 \nyears and which has been explicitly endorsed by Congress over and over \nagain through the appropriations process.\n  In the Viacom transaction, the purchasing group has incurred \nliterally millions of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses for costs such \nas legal fees, commitment fees, and travel. The prospective minority \npurchaser has made it clear that he was entering into the transaction \nin order to run the company, not to purchase it for a quick resale or \nturnover. Enormous amounts of time and energy and faith in our \nGovernment have been placed in putting this transaction together. Major \nbanks have committed to participate. And the transaction was not \nhastily entered into in the last 30 days in order to get in under the \nwire before the repeal of this section. But the House of \nRepresentatives and the Finance Committee seemed to ignore all the time \nand money and energy that have been expended, all the faith and \nconfidence in laws that have been around for 17 years and seemingly \nwent out of its way to repeal this section with a retroactive effective \ndate to get at this transaction which because of its size had made the \nnewspapers.\n  Mr. President, I believe what we see here is a good example of why \npeople are so cynical about Government. What we see here is an effort \nto ignore the facts, to ignore the good-faith reliance on section 1071 \nexhibited by the prospective purchaser in all transactions now pending \nbefore the FCC. What we see here is a total disregard of the equities \nand due process in an effort to rush to judgment.\n  Mr. President, retroactive effective dates are very unusual in the \nSenate. In fact, this body has a long and consistent history of using \none of three dates as the effective date of a tax change that reduces \nor eliminates tax redemptions, exclusions or similar provisions. The \nusual choice for those effective dates are the date of enactment, the \nfirst December 31st of the year of enactment, or the first taxable year \nbeginning after one of the first two dates.\n  Putting aside tax rate changes, Mr. President, the Senate has \ndeparted from the usual effective dates only in rare circumstances \nwhere there has been a legitimate concern about the ability of \ntaxpayers to rush the market \n[[Page S4550]] and therefore avoid changes. Even in those rare cases \nwhere Congress was closing loopholes in the tax law because taxpayers \nwere abusing the system, Congress adhered to the standards of fairness \nto ensure that taxpayers would have sufficient notice and could plan \ntheir private transactions, so that the business community could plan, \nthe taxpayers could plan, so they could order their affairs in reliance \non our activity.\n  That is not what has happened here, Mr. President. The provisions \nrepealing section 1071 therefore represent a dramatic departure from \nthe general procedure for drafting effective dates. After reviewing the \nfacts and precedents, I remain convinced there is no policy reason to \njustify singling out this particular section of the Internal Revenue \nCode for an unprecedented formulation of an effective date.\n  It is worthwhile to compare the effective date for the repeal of \nsection 1071 in this bill to the precedents. First, there is the \nJanuary 17, 1995, effective date. What is the significance of this \ndate? Well, Mr. President, it is the date on which the chairman of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee issued a press release indicating the \ncommittee would review this section and that they might consider \nrepealing the section, in which case he intended to use a January 17 \neffective date.\n  When has this body ever allowed a single Member of the House of \nRepresentatives to unilaterally dictate the effective date of a tax \nchange?\n When the chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation was asked \nthis question during the Ways and Means markup, I understand that he \ncited the tax-exempt leasing bill that was introduced by former \nCongressman Jake Pickle. Well, in that case, the majority leader, \nSenator Dole, introduced a companion bill in the Senate. And in that \ncase, the retroactive effective date was made all but moot by three \nvery generously, broadly applicable transition rules and a host of \ntargeted rules.\n\n  The most recent and more relevant example of an effective date that \nwas sent by press release occurred in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. \nHowever, in that case, taxpayers were put on notice in 1984--2 years \nbefore the press release--when Treasury published a tax reform \nproposal. In that case, a press release was issued to revolve the \ndifference between a retroactive January 1, 1986, effective date in a \nHouse provision dealing with tax-exempt bonds, and a Senate provision \nwith a January 1, 1987 prospective date. What is important to note is \nthat this was a joint press release; it was signed not only by both \nchairman of the House and Senate tax-writing committees, but also by \nthe two ranking members and the Secretary of the Treasury. It is also \ninteresting that the parties involved chose a date well after the \nretroactive January 1, 1986, House bill; they agree instead on \nSeptember 1, 1986.\n  It is interesting, in that situation also there was consensus, an \nagreement between both bodies with regard to the setting of an \neffective date. Again, that is not what happened here. Here, because of \na press release of one Chamber by one individual, the Senate has rushed \nto judgment to adopt that and thereby undo the work that all these \nactors in the private sector have undertaken in reliance on section \n1071.\n  This is the precedent that this body will overrule if we approve the \neffective date in H.R. 831 for the repeal of section 1071.\n  I mentioned earlier that Congress has departed from the general rule \nwhere there was a perceived abuse of the tax law. The general practice \nin those situations has been to use the date of the committee action as \nthe effective date, and even then to provide fair and reasonable \ntransition rules. For example, in the 1990 revenue reconciliation bill, \nCongress shut down a loophole through an amendment to section 355 of \nthe Internal Revenue Code. The 1990 act was passed on October 27, 1990, \nand signed into law on November 5, of that year. In that case, the \ngeneral effective date applied to securities purchased after October 9, \n1990--the\n day before the Ways and Means Committee reported out the bill, but \nCongress also provided a transition rule where the material terms of a \ntransaction were described in a written public announcement before \nOctober 10, 1990, and SEC filing was made before that date. The same \nrule was provided in another section of the 1990 act dealing with debt \nexchanges.\n\n  Another example is provided by the 1989 Revenue Reconciliation Act. \nAgain, there were perceived abuses by businesses making debt-financed \nstock sales to ESOP's; there, the general effective date for an \namendment that modified the partial interest exclusion for ESOP loans \nwas for loans made after July 10, 1989, the day before that provision \nwas presented in a chairman's mark to the Ways and Means Committee.\n  In the Revenue Act of 1987, which was signed into law on December 22, \n1987, Congress closed a loophole that allowed ``C'' corporations to \navoid LIFO recapture by converting to ``S'' corporation status. There \nthe effective date was December 16, 1987--the date of the conference \ncommittee action. Moreover, a transition rule was provided where there \nwas a board of directors resolution before the December 16 date.\n  Why are taxpayers with applications pending before the FCC not \ndeserving of transition relief? The only concrete answer that I have \nreceived to this question is that the size of the one of those \ntransactions, the Viacom transaction, is just too great--the \nimplication is that we would somehow save tax revenues if we refuse to \nprovide a reasonable and appropriate transition rule--and so the \ncommittee substitute before the Senate has no reasonable and \nappropriate transition rule.\n  Just yesterday, Mr. President, this Senate, by a very strong vote of \n69 to 29, approved a form of line-item veto authority for the President \nof the United States. Senator after Senator stood up to explain how \nunfair it was that the Congress was, in effect, blackmailing the \nPresident, by linking pork-barrel items with must items in a single \nbill. Yet that is what we see here today. Those who want the Senate to \nconsider the option of reforming section 1071 have no choice but to be \nlinked up, in effect, be blackmailed by the fact that we also want to \nsee the reform with the self-employed health insurance deduction issue. \nWe want to see the health insurance passed, but now we are being forced \nby the committee action to accept this ill-considered rush-to-judgment, \nunfair, retroactive repeal of section 1071.\n  As I stated at the outset, I am a strong supporter of that provision; \nand I agree that it needs expedited consideration. However, there is no \nreason that the section 1071 issue had to be linked to that provision. \nThe committee substitute now before us has offsets sufficient to ensure \nbudget neutrality even without the provision repealing section 1071.\n  However, the provision repealing section\n   1071 is in the bill. And it is clear that the need for action in the \nnext 2 weeks to complete action on the health insurance provisions \neffectively precludes this Senator, or any member of the Senate, from \nacting to try to slow down this train, and to ensure that the \nobjectives of the minority ownership tax certificate program get the \nattention they deserve.\n\n  Let me conclude by reminding my colleagues that diversity of voice in \nour electronic media remains critically important, and that we have a \nresponsibility to every American to see that entry is open enough to \npermit that business to meet the needs of all of our citizens. It is \nalso critically important that Government act responsibly, and that \nGovernment keep it word. By repealing section 1071 retroactively, we \nare failing to meet our obligation to those who have in good faith \nrelied on the law of the land, and our obligation to the American \npeople generally to legislate responsibly.\n  By repealing this section retroactively, we have also, I believe, \ntaken a rush to judgment and put at great peril an important policy \nconsideration having to do with diversity of voice.\n  Mr. President, I intend to continue working on the issue raised by \nsection 1071 and I intend to continue working to try to convince my \ncolleagues in this body that the objectives of diversity of voice are \nimportant ones that must be preserved. I intend to continue speaking \nout on the issue of the importance of inclusion of women and minorities \nin every industry in this Nation, but certainly in communications, \nwhich has such a broad-range effect on the way that people see our \ncountry, the way that people see the world, the \n[[Page S4551]] kind of information to which they are given access.\n  It is access to information that is at the heart of the section 1071 \nprogram. And the notion that access to that information ought to come \nfrom as many places as we can manage, to the extent that section 1071 \nhas had a positive effect in encouraging diversity of voice, \nencouraging diversity of ownership, allowing women and minorities a \nchance to participate in an industry in which they were historically \ndeliberately excluded, it had a salutary effect and meaning and reason, \nand it is something that we should protect and preserve in this body, \nand not otherwise.\n  I think it is unfortunate that this retroactive repeal has been \nassociated with this important health care initiative. I think it is \nsomething that I intend to continue to fight. And I hope, that as we \nmove down the road in consideration of this tax legislation, we will \nnot lose the one opportunity we had to unlock the door, to provide \nopportunity as a way of responding to concerns that may be misplaced, \nto concerns that need to be articulated and talked about, but concerns \nthat we really have not looked closely enough at to see the benefit for \nall Americans.\n  And so I hope that the health care deduction passes. I want to \nsupport that. I want to help that. But on section 1071, the fight is \nnot over. The fight continues.\n  I hope that what has happened here with regard to this retroactive \nrepeal is a wake-up call to women, to minorities, to people in this \ncountry who care about diversity, who think that it is important, that \nwe cannot sit back. And, as complex as this issue may seem, \nfundamentally it is a very simple one. It is an issue of whether or not \nthe airwaves of this country are for all Americans or for some \nAmericans. I believe that inclusion and diversity is the strength of \nour country and not otherwise, and I will fight to maintain access to \nthe airwaves for all Americans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I most emphatically wish to state the \ndebt in which we all find ourselves to the Senator from Illinois for \nher powerful and persuasive statement; her first on this particular \nsubject, but not, I dare think and hope, her last.\n  We will continue now with this debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, as well, the \nsenior Senator from New York.\n  Mr. President, in Montana, we have a saying--``it's not what you say, \nit's what you do.''\n  For too long, Members of Congress said they only wish they could \npermanently extend the health insurance premium for the self-employed \nbut that they didn't have the money to get the job done.\n  For too long, Members said they wanted to increase the deduction \nbeyond 25 percent--but they did not have the money.\n  Today, we will vote on legislation that, at long last, permanently \nextends the health insurance premium deduction for the self-employed, \nand increases it from 25 to 30 percent for 1995 and afterward.\n  What does this mean back home? Well, this is real. This means farmers \nand small business people get relief.\n  I heard from Randy Koutnik in Helena who was planning to go into his \nown business. He needed the deduction so he could continue to afford \nhealth insurance coverage. I think this legislation is needed. It will \nhelp Randy, and many other hardworking, gutsy entrepreneurs like him \nstart out on their own.\n  Polly Burke of Missoula called me up to say how angry she was that \nself-employed individuals were losing their 25-percent health insurance \npremium deduction while corporations kept their 100-percent deduction. \nAnd I think Polly is right to be angry.\n  Today we will take a first step to help Polly, Randy, and all self-\nemployed across America.\n  My only complaint is that we should have acted earlier. For the cash-\nbasis farmers who had to pay their taxes by March 1, Congress is 3 \nweeks late.\n  It is true that those farmers can amend their returns and collect a \nrefund. But amending the return will take time and, unless their \naccountants work for free, will cost these farmers money. Probably 30 \nto 50 bucks apiece.\n  But with today's action, Congress will at least do the right thing.\n  We will permanently extend the health insurance premium deduction so \nMontana farmers, small business people, and all of America's self-\nemployed have at least one less thing to worry about in the years \nahead.\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote for this legislation and I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to vote for it. And I will push hard to make \nsure it gets to the President's desk fast, so the deduction is \navailable to all the self-employed filing their tax returns before \nApril 17.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Packwood] for deferring to me briefly so that I might make \na brief statement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4545-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4551-S4559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              BLACK HUMOR\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, a cartoon by Mr. Garry Trudeau appeared in \nthe Washington Post last Sunday, March 19, 1995, and I assume in many \nother newspapers, in which he is syndicated, a cartoon which is an \nunfortunate example of tasteless, offensive, black humor. It belittles \nthe war record, bravery, and selfless sacrifice of the distinguished \nmajority leader, Mr. Dole, by ridiculing the wounds he suffered and \nstill carries, and always will, from the Italian campaign of World War \nII. The war record of all elected officials is usually a matter of some \nattention during political campaigns, and Mr. Dole is no exception. But \nwhy anyone would take an excursion into cynical dark cartoon humor over \nthis is incomprehensible and inexcusable.\n  Our political system and culture must be based on civility, mutual \nrespect and honor. The discourse and debate in Presidential campaigns, \nindeed any campaign, should properly focus on the positions of the \ncandidates on the major issues of the day, and what solutions are being \noffered. We have had too much of personal attacks, negative \ncampaigning, and the politics of cynicism in America in recent years. I \nthink it would be beneficial if we all tried a little more to elevate \nthe political discourse in America, and that we focus on where we \nshould, constructively, lead the Nation. Our attitude should certainly \nbe positive and, while we differ on many issues, strive for unfailing \ncourtesy and respect.\n  Mr. Dole carries with him the symbol and the physical result of his \nvalor in combat, defending our country, defending the very ability of \ncartoonists to exercise their trade in freedom, and our very ability to \nconduct an honorable, civil, enlightened debate in a democracy. Mr. \nDole has dedicated his entire life to the service of the Nation. Mr. \nTrudeau, I believe, owes Mr. Dole an apology for this entirely \ninappropriate attack and innuendo.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n             SELF-EMPLOYED HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS DEDUCTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n    material terms under the binding contract exception in H.R. 831\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise to request a clarification \nto a provision in H.R. 831 relating to the binding contract exception \nto the repeal of section 1071.\n  Binding contract exceptions to changes to the tax laws are commonly \nincluded in tax legislation to protect taxpayers who, in reliance on \nthe laws, entered into legally binding agreements prior to the \neffective date of the statutory change but where the transaction itself \nwill not be completed until after that effective date. H.R. 831 \nincludes such a binding contract exception to the repeal of section \n1071. The intent of this exception is to honor taxpayers' good faith \nreliance on the law.\n  The binding contract exception in this bill, however, would not apply \nif \n[[Page S4552]] the contract, or the material terms of the contract, are \ncontingent on issuance of an FCC tax certificate. It is not clear what \nwould constitute a material term being contingent on the issuance of an \nFCC tax certificate for purposes of this legislation.\n  It is important that we provide the FCC and the Internal Revenue \nService with appropriate guidance in determining whether a contract for \nthe sale of a broadcasting station qualifies for the binding contract \nexception to the repeal of section 1071 and therefore eligible for an \nFCC tax certificate. If a transaction contemplates a third-party \naction, such as the FCC issuing a tax certificate, but the contract \nrequires that the transaction go forward even if the third-party action \ndoes not occur, it is only reasonable that the parties to the agreement \nprovide in that agreement for a relatively minor adjustment to offset \nthe effects of the failure of the third-party to act. Such a contract \nclearly is still binding--the transaction must go forward with the \ncontract-required adjustment. It is my understanding that the \n``material terms'' of a contract are not to be considered contingent on \nthe issuance of an FCC tax certificate simply because the parties \nprovided for a relatively minor adjustment of less than 10 percent of \nthe selling price if the FCC certificate is not issued. Is this \nconsistent with your understanding of what is intended by the clause \n``or the material terms of such contract''?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Yes, the clause ``or the material terms of such \ncontract'' is not intended to exclude binding contracts from the \nbenefits of the legislation's binding contract rule simply because the \nparties included a relatively minor price adjustment of less than 10 \npercent in the original binding contract to compensate for the failure \nof the FCC to issue a tax certificate.\n  Mr. President, we are waiting for Senator Dole to come, and then we \nwill be ready to close up on this bill, I believe. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am here to support this proposal and to \npraise the Finance Committee and those in the House of Representatives \nwho thought of a way in which to do justice on both sides of the \nequation of a tax proposal and to provide an extension and ultimately \nan increase in an overwhelmingly just--but still inadequate--deduction \nfor the health care expenses of the self-employed.\n  For many years, the Tax Code has permitted a modest deduction of 25 \npercent of the health care insurance costs of the self-employed--\nmodest, of course, in comparison with the very, very large number of \nAmericans who have health care insurance premiums paid for by their \nemployers, fully deductible to those employers. Yet, even this 25-\npercent deduction for the self-employed, for hard-working Americans in \nsmall towns and large cities and on farms across this country, is \nthreatened. It has for years been a deduction with a terminal point. In \nevery previous year in which that terminal point was reached, the \nCongress has extended the deduction for a few more years.\n  In 1994, it did not do so and technically there is no such provision \ntoday. There will be, however, if this bill passes. A deduction will be \neffective for the current year and will move up modestly from 25 to 30 \npercent next year. I believe that almost every Member of this body \nhopes that the time will come that, with a more sound and all-\nencompassing set of health care reforms, we will be able to allow the \ndeduction of 100 percent of such health care insurance costs. In the \nmeantime, however, to extend the present deduction and modestly to \nincrease the present deduction is clearly overwhelmingly in the public \ninterest.\n  Standing alone, that would not be a difficult task, except for its \neffect on the budget deficit. It is here that the thoughtfulness and \nthe genius of the sponsors of this bill are in particular evidence. \nThis bill is going to be paid for by four changes in the Internal \nRevenue Code, three of which are of considerable significance with \nrespect to the amount of money that they produce.\n  The first is a denial of the earned-income tax credit to those who \nhave substantial unearned income; that is to say, investment income. \nThe earned-income tax credit, of course, is designed to see to it that \nthe working poor--those who are trying to move out of poverty, who are \nbelow the level at which they would normally pay an income tax--\nliterally get some money back from the Government as a reward for that \nwork. To allow it, however, to those who have low levels of earned \nincome but significant levels of unearned income is, of course, a \nperversion of the whole design of the earned-income tax credit itself. \nSo this narrowing, this focus of the earned-income tax credit on those \nwho are truly the working poor is a matter of tax justice and fiscal \nequity without regard for its use for this health care insurance \ndeduction.\n  Second, we are for the first time actually going to penalize those \nAmericans, those I think perverse Americans, who renounce their \ncitizenship in order to save on taxes. They will be hit when they \nrenounce that citizenship with what amounts to a capital gains tax on \nthe assets they take with them out of the United States. The Finance \nCommittee, I should note, has said that this provision is not designed \nto be a direct offset against the health care insurance premium \ndeduction for the self-employed, but literally to be a modest \ncontribution to our budget deficit.\n  The most significant of the tax changes, of course, is the \ncancellation of section 1071 of the Internal Revenue Code, which \nstarted out as a recognition of forced sales some 50 or more years ago, \nwhen we first developed rules that did not allow more than one radio \nstation, in that case, to be owned by the same people in the same \ncommunity; but since, that has become a rather famous and notorious \nform of affirmative action.\n  This provision, of course, was triggered by a huge sale involving \nViacom and one member of a minority group, the cost of which to the \nFederal Treasury would be over half a billion dollars. It may very well \nhave been one of the triggering causes of the attention being paid \ntoday to the whole subject of affirmative action. Yet, I think it is \nsafe to say that this provision should be repealed without regard to \nthe varying views of Members of this body and of the public as a whole \non affirmative action overall. The kind of affirmative action that \nbenefits one quite successful and fairly wealthy member of a minority \ngroup at the cost of half a billion dollars to the State treasury is a \nperversion of any kind of theory of equity, affirmative action or \notherwise.\n  We will have in this body more than enough time to debate the whole \nsubject of affirmative action, whether or not it has been a success, \nwhether or not it deserves continuation in whole or in part in the \nfuture. In the meantime, however, we need to pass this bill in order to \nprevent this perverse use of affirmative action and in order to provide \njustice for literally hundreds of thousands of self-employed Americans. \nHere, a handful of people who do not deserve tax benefits will be \npenalized. Hundreds of thousands of hard-working self-employed \nAmericans will at least retain, and ultimately have a slight increase, \nin a tax deduction for a highly worthy social and economic purpose.\n  This bill, in other words, does justice to the self-employed, ends a \nterrible loophole in the field of affirmative action, ends a loophole \nin the earned-income tax credit, and ends up helping us in some slight \nmanner to reduce our deficit.\n  We very rarely get bills through this House in which every single \nelement is a plus for our society, and it deserves the support of all \nMembers of the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, April 15, is only 22 days away and \nunless the President signs a bill restoring the 25-percent health \ninsurance deduction for the self-insured more than 4 million small \nbusiness persons will experience yet another tax increase.\n  If a person is doing business as a corporation, health insurance is \n100 percent deductible. Under the tax law in effect without this \nlegislation, zero \n[[Page S4553]] percent, zip, none of their health insurance costs is \ndeductible for the self-employed. There is no tax policy justification \nfor treating corporations one way and the self-employed another. The \nmajority of all businesses in this country are self-employed. These are \noften firms with very little cash, a good idea and talent struggling to \nmake a success. Once they do succeed, they are the ones that create \nnearly two out of every three net new jobs. These small firms have \nsustained this job-creating record for more than 20 years. Clearly, the \nTax Code should not treat them so shabbily.\n  The need for the deduction is indisputable. Unincorporated business \nowners experience the worst of all possible worlds in the health \ninsurance marketplace. Usually they can only buy an insufficient health \ninsurance policy for a very high price and they are denied the same \nincentives and tax treatment enjoyed by incorporated, bigger \nbusinesses.\n  If this legislation becomes law, the self-employed will be able to \ntake 25-percent deduction for their health insurance costs on their \n1994 taxes and receive a 30-percent deduction for tax years 1995 and \nbeyond. I am pleased that Congress is taking this step to address the \nhealth insurance deductibility gap and to make it permanent.\n  We really should be working to achieve 100-percent parity and equity \nwith corporations so that all businesses, regardless of form, would be \ntreated the same. Total deductibility has been a top priority of the \nvarious State small business conferences which have been held prior to \nthe 1995 White House Conference on Small business. In the mid-1980's, I \nsponsored legislation that was enacted calling for a White House \nConference on Small Business once every Presidential term. These are \nvaluable conferences because they help identify legislative priorities. \nIn the past, a vast majority of the Small Business Conference \nrecommendations have been enacted into law. I hope we will be able to \nmake good on that record when it comes to the deduction of health \ninsurance for the self-employed.\n  In addition to tax policy fairness and job creation, restoring the \ndeduction for the self-employed is important because the self-employed \nare one of the largest groups of uninsured citizens in America. There \nare 3 million self-employed Americans without health insurance. The 30-\npercent deduction is a small, but meaningful incentive for \nunincorporated business owners to purchase health insurance for \nthemselves and their families.\n  In New Mexico, there are 75,000 self-employed individuals about one-\nthird of them take advantage of the deduction. This number does not \ninclude farmers and ranchers who are another group that will benefit \nfrom the tax law change we are making today.\n  I sincerely hope the Congress can complete it work on this \nlegislation in time for the April 15 filing deadline. Making the \ndeduction permanent will stop the uncertainty that has historically \naccompanied this section of the Tax Code. It will help millions of \nsmall business entrepreneurs, farmers, and ranchers provide health \ninsurance for their families.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to lend my strong support for \nH.R. 831 to make the self-employed deduction permanent and to raise it \nto 30 percent.\n  There had been a number of threats to hold this legislation up by \nfilibustering or offering numerous contentious amendments. I'm very \nglad that these threats disappeared, because holding up this bill would \nhave only hurt the millions of taxpayers that are waiting for this \nrelief.\n  Mr. President, most of the major health care bills introduced in the \nlast Congress called for an increased extension of the 25 percent \nhealth insurance deduction for the self-employed. There's a broad \nconsensus that an increased health insurance deduction would contribute \nto tax fairness and would also lead to a significant reduction in the \nnumber of uninsured Americans.\n  Unfortunately, as we all know, the self-employed health insurance \ndeduction expired on December 31, 1993, with the understanding that an \nextension, and possible expansion, would be part of health care reform \nin 1994. However, we all know what happened to President Clinton's \ndisastrous health care reform effort. And, unfortunately, the self-\nemployed deduction went down with it.\n  Mr. President, if the 25-percent deduction is not retroactively \nreinstated, the self-employed will be hit with a sizable tax increase. \nMoreover, it would be a tax increase on predominantly middle-income \npersons since about 73 percent of those persons who pay self-employment \ntax earn under $50,000 in adjusted gross income.\n  Mr. President, I have introduced a separate bill that would reinstate \nthe 25-percent deduction for the 1994 tax year, and then increase the \ndeduction to 50 percent this year, 75 percent next year, and 100 \npercent the year after.\n  Organizations as diverse as the Farm Bureau, the National Federation \nof Independent Businesses, the Association for the Self-Employed, and \nthe National Restaurant Association support this legislation.\n  I look forward to the Congress finally dealing with this problem by \ntaking care of the 1994 tax year, making it permanent and increasing it \nto 30 percent. Hopefully, we will be able to expand the deduction up to \n100 percent at a later date.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I strongly support legislation to \npermanently extend and expand the health insurance tax deduction for \nself-employed individuals. In addition to allowing these individuals \nand their dependents to deduct 25 percent of the cost of their health \ninsurance for 1994, it will allow them to deduct 30 percent of these \ncosts for all future years. This bill, which addresses one of the most \nunfair provisions in the Tax Code, is fully paid for without adding a \npenny to the budget deficit by eliminating an outdated and inequitable \ncorporate tax break.\n  This issue has justifiably been a major concern to the small business \ncommunity for a long time. The 25 percent deduction for the self-\nemployed was first contained in the tax Reform Act of 1986. Due to \ncongressional inaction, it expired at the end of 1993. Consequently, if \nwe didn't pass an extension before April 15, self-employed individuals \nwould not have been able to deduct any of their health insurance \nexpenses this year. This would have been incredibly unfair. Employees \nof corporations continue to be able to deduct almost all of their \nhealth insurance costs.\n  Since 1989, we have been keeping small business in limbo each year \nwhile Congress decides whether to reextend this tax deduction. Small \nbusinesses are extremely important to our country. In Arizona, they are \nthe fastest growing component of our economy and, in aggregate, our \nlargest source of employment. They rely upon the modest insurance tax \nbenefit that they are entitled to receive. By passing this bill today, \nand by making it retroactive so that the deduction can be taken this \nyear, we make a major step forward in providing equity and certainly to \nsmall business people throughout our Nation.\n  Throughout the health reform debate last year, I argued that the \ndeduction for self-employed individuals should be expanded to be \ncomparable to the full deduction that other employees receive. I \nfurther contended that the result of allowing the deduction to expire \nwould have been to substantially increase the number of uninsured \nAmericans. It would have imposed a large burden on individuals who we \nshould be helping, those who have taken the initiative and risk \nassociated with small business and self-employment. Today, we vote to \nstart to remedy their problems.\n  Passing this extension and expansion of the self-employed insurance \ntax deduction today is a major step in the right direction. I urge \nPresident Clinton to sign this bill into law as soon as possible. It is \noutrageous that self-employed individuals are not permitted to deduct \nthe same percentage of their health insurance costs as do employees of \nlarge corporations. It is even more outrageous that we almost took away \nthe small amount that they can currently deduct, and may still do so if \nPresident Clinton does not act quickly.\n  I remain committed to ensuring that all Americans receive the same \ntax advantages in deducting their health insurance, and to creating a \nmore equitable and efficient health care system.\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with passage of H.R. 831, the Senate \nbegins the effort to pick up this year where we left off last year on \nthe very important issue of health care reform.\n  To some extent, this legislation simply extends a tax break for \nhealth insurance for small business that expired last year because it \nwas closely related to other health reforms that also failed to pass.\n  Many of us had hoped to use this legislation as an opportunity to \nrevise this tax deduction and make it fairer to all those involved in \nsmall businesses--employees as well as owners.\n  But because the tax deadline is so near, there is no real opportunity \nto have such a debate at this time. Small businesses deserve to have \nthe expired provision extended as soon as possible, so that the \napplicable law will be clear as they file their tax returns for 1994. \nMany of them purchased their health insurance in expectation that the \ntax deduction would be continued, and it would be unfair to them to let \nit lapse now. So I join with many other Senators in expediting action \non this bill.\n  But it is appropriate to point out the key issues involved in this \ntax incentive, and I am confident we will have an opportunity to \naddress them on other tax bills and as part of our effort in the coming \nmonths to enact health reform in this Congress.\n  In the wake of our failure to enact health reform last year, the \nhealth care crisis facing American families has continued to grow \nworse. Last year, the number of uninsured increased by more than 1 \nmillion, to over 40 million of our fellow citizens. If current trends \ncontinue, the number of uninsured will exceed 50 million in the year \n2000--1 in every 5 nonelderly Americans. But for the expansion of \npublic health insurance coverage to more than 10 million people in the \npast decade, the current situation would be even worse.\n  Even those who have insurance are not secure. No family can be \nconfident that the insurance which protects them today will be there \nfor them tomorrow if serious illness strikes.\n  The decline in health insurance coverage on the job is especially \nserious. As recently as 1988, two-thirds of all nonelderly Americans \nreceived coverage through their employer. Today, that number has fallen \nto 61 percent. By the year 2000, only about half of all nonelderly \nAmericans will be able to depend on private, job-based coverage for the \nhealth protection they need for their families and themselves.\n  Few, if any, people are more seriously victimized by the health care \ncrisis than small business owners and their employees. If they try to \nbuy coverage, they routinely face insurance company markups as much as \neight times greater than large businesses. Despite reforms enacted by \nmany States in recent years, small businesses in many areas of the \ncountry still face exorbitant prices or are denied coverage altogether \nif someone in the business is in poor health, or is elderly, or lives \nin the wrong part of town, or works in the wrong occupation.\n  The legislation before us provides some tax assistance for the self-\nemployed, including the owners of small businesses, but I am \ndisappointed that the imminent tax filing deadline prevents us from \ntaking this opportunity to deal with the problems in a more balanced \nand more effective way.\n  The legislation offers a tax subsidy of $800 million a year--$8 \nbillion over the next 10 years--to help the self-employed purchase the \ncoverage they need. Many, many citizens in our society need help in \npurchasing health insurance. For $800 million a year, we could do a \ngreat deal to insure children, or give greater health security to \nworkers who lose their jobs, or more assistance to senior citizens \nstruggling desperately to pay the high cost of long-term care or \nprescription drugs.\n  But the entire $8 billion in this bill goes to the owners of small \nbusinesses. No one else benefits--not even the employees of those \nbusinesses. In fact, more than $3 billion of these funds goes to people \nmaking more than $50,000 a year. More than $2 billion goes to people \nmaking $75,000 or more--and that isn't fair. The wealthier they are, \nthe bigger their tax benefit. Changing the tax deduction to a tax \ncredit would be fairer, and making the tax credit refundable would be \neven fairer.\n  But if we're going to make the current system fairer to small\n   business owners, we should at least make it fairer to their \nemployees too. Small business owners and their families deserve help--\nbut so do their employees and their families.\n\n  Under current tax law, any business, large or small, that provides \nhealth insurance to its employees can deduct the cost of that insurance \nas a business expense, just as it can deduct the wages paid to its \nemployees.\n  The employees who receive the insurance get a significant tax break \ntoo, because the value of the insurance is a fringe benefit that is not \ncounted as income to the employees for tax purposes.\n  This favorable tax treatment was one of the principal engines driving \nthe expansion of private, job-based health insurance coverage in the \npast generation. It has also been a major factor in helping to make the \nloss of coverage in recent years less serious than it would otherwise \nhave been.\n  This tax exclusion for fringe benefits is also one of the most \nexpensive tax subsidies in the entire Internal Revenue Code. It will \ncost the Treasury $60 billion this year, and that revenue loss will \nrise to $94 billion in the year 2000.\n  Under a quirk in the tax laws, however, owners of small businesses \nthat are not incorporated were not eligible for this tax break. In \nfact, they were at a serious disadvantage. No matter what contribution \nthey made to health insurance coverage for their workers--and some \nsmall businesses do make such a contribution--the owners still could \nnot deduct the cost of their own insurance.\n  So in 1986, Congress reduced this disparity by granting a separate \ntax deduction for small business owners, equal to 25 percent of the \ncost of the insurance they bought for themselves. Many people feel that \nthe deduction should be 100 percent, in order to achieve full parity \nwith managers of large corporations, and there is a good deal of merit \nin that view, at least in cases where the owners provide coverage for \ntheir employees.\n  The 1986 deduction was enacted on a temporary basis. It was extended \nby Congress on several occasions, but it expired at the end of 1993. A \nfurther extension was considered in 1994 as part of comprehensive \nhealth reform, but it died when the overall health reform effort \nfailed.\n  The question now is whether, in this time of limited resources, it is \nfair to restore the subsidy--and make it permanent--and even sweeten it \nfrom a 25 percent deduction to a 30 percent deduction--for small \nbusiness owners at a cost of $800 million a year, but do nothing for \nthe employees of those small businesses.\n  Even large corporations don't do this well. The managers of large, \nself-insured corporations are not eligible for a tax break that is \ngreater than the tax break given to their workers. Yet under the \ncommittee bill, owners of small businesses are eligible for the tax \nbreak even if they make no contribution at all to the cost of their \nworkers' coverage.\n  Yet employees of small businesses have even more difficulty than \ntheir employers in obtaining good coverage. It is bad enough that 18 \npercent of all workers are uninsured. It is worse that 25 percent of \nthe self-employed are uninsured. But it is even worse that 33 percent \nor workers in firms with fewer than 10 workers are uninsured.\n  The smaller the business, the more serious the problem. More than 90 \npercent of firms with over 250 employees offer coverage to their \nworkers. But only a third of firms with fewer than 10 workers offer \ncoverage to their employees.\n  This legislation does the right thing by helping the self-employed. \nBut it should have gone farther. It should have helped both the owners \nand their employees.\n  Under this bill, mom and pop, the owners of the small mom and pop \nstore, get a tax break, but the cashier or the worker in the stock room \ndoes not.\n  The partners in the law firms get the tax break, but the secretaries \nand the filing clerks and the paralegals do not.\n  The doctors in the group practice get the tax break, but the nurses \nand technicians and lab assistants and receptionists do not. And that \nisn't fair.\n  [[Page S4555]] A fairer bill could have maintained the 30 percent \ndeduction for the small business owners, as provided in the committee \nbill. But it should have required them to make group health insurance \navailable to their workers as a condition of taking the deduction for \nthemselves.\n  The owners would not have had to make any contribution to the cost of \nthe coverage for their employees. They would only have to make the \ncoverage available for the employers to purchase themselves. But \nemployees exercising this choice should also be eligible for the same \n30 percent tax break available to the owner.\n  This proposal is not an employer mandate. It does not require \nemployers to contribute to the cost of coverage. It does not even \nrequire employers to offer coverage to their employees. All it says is \nthat if they want to take advantage of a tax break to purchase health \ninsurance for themselves, they will have the minimal obligation of \narranging the availability of group coverage for their employees.\n  This proposal is a modest one. It does not even go as far as the \nRepublican health reform bills offered by Senator Dole and Congressman \nMichel last year. The Michel bill required all employers to make \ncoverage available to their workers, regardless of whether the \nemployers took a tax deduction for their own coverage. The Dole bill \nrequired all employers to administer a payroll deduction program for \ntheir employees, even if the employers took no tax deduction for \nthemselves.\n  This proposal is not an expensive one--just a fair one. Final cost \nestimates are not yet available from the Joint Tax Committee. But it is \nlikely that the program could be financed by using some of the excess \nrevenue generated by the bill before us, or by retaining the level of \nthe deduction at 25 percent instead of raising it to 30 percent.\n  Small business owners on the whole are not a wealthy group, and they \noften have trouble obtaining affordable insurance. They need the help \nthat we are providing in this bill. But their employees have even lower \nincomes and are even less likely to be insured. Surely, they are at \nleast as deserving a tax subsidy as the owners of the business.\n  This proposal has other benefits for workers, in addition to the tax \nsubsidy it provides. Group coverage is less expensive than individual \ncoverage. A majority of States have adopted limits on preexisting \nconditions and limits on premiums. They guarantee the issue of policies \nand the renewal of policies for such group coverage.\n  But only a handful of States have enacted comparable rules for \nindividual coverage. By assuring the availability of group coverage to \na broader number of people, the benefits of the insurance reforms \nalready enacted by some States can be extended to many more citizens \nwho need them.\n  Finally, a fair bill should provide tax parity for small business \nowners who do contribute to the cost of insurance coverage for their \nemployees. They should be able to deduct 100 percent of the cost of \ntheir own coverage, if they pay the full coverage of their workers as \nwell, as some small businesses already do.\n  Under the reform I favor, whatever share they provide to their \nworkers would also be deductible for them. If they pay 70 percent of \nthe premium for their workers, they could deduct 70 percent of their \nown premiums. They would have full parity with the manager of a large \nbusiness.\n  In summary, the committee bill provides a tax subsidy for health \ninsurance for the owners of small business. I regret that it does not \nprovide a similar tax subsidy for the employees of small business too.\n  During the course of this Congress, there will be opportunities to \nconsider measures to expand health care for the employees of small \nbusinesses, for other members of working families, for children, and \nfor senior citizens. When these reforms come to a vote, I hope that the \nMembers of the Senate will remember that these Americans need health \ncare, too.\n  I also intend to do all I can, in these times of deep budget cuts and \nlimited Federal resources, to see that the large tax subsidies now \navailable through the Internal Revenue Code meet the same strict \nscrutiny that Congress is giving to other forms of Federal spending. We \nmade bipartisan progress yesterday by extending the line-item veto to \ntax subsidies, and we need to do more to rein in this rapidly growing \npart of the Federal budget.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for H.R. \n831 and the protections it will provide to America's self-employed \nbusiness owners--the men and women who create the jobs on Main Street.\n  Today, the Senate is finally ready to deliver the tax relief that \nshould have been provided a long time ago.\n  And today, more than 3 million small business men and women--\nincluding as many as 146,000 in my home State of Minnesota--are \nbreathing a sigh of relief.\n  Up until last year, the self-employed were allowed to deduct 25 \npercent of their health insurance premiums.\n  It was a powerful incentive: Small business owners were much more \nlikely to buy insurance for their employees when they were offered an \nincentive to purchase health insurance for themselves.\n  That deduction, however, was allowed to lapse in December 1993 when \nit appeared that Congress would address health care reform in 1994.\n  But health care reform never materialized--and Congress never \nrestored the deduction.\n  The self-employed have seen their 25-percent deduction expire five \ntimes over the past 8 years, leaving them in the precarious position of \ntrying to second guess Congress each time as to whether the deduction \nwould be extended.\n  H.R. 831 will restore the 25-percent deductibility for 1994--increase \nit to 30 percent this year--and make it permanent.\n  That is good news for the 3.2 million unincorporated, self-employed \nAmericans the U.S. Treasury Department estimates would claim the \ndeduction on their 1994 returns.\n  H.R. 831 moves us in the right direction, and I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues in acting swiftly today to approve this desperately needed \ntax relief.\n  Yet, Mr. President, we should not look at 30 percent deductibility as \nour final goal.\n  We should use this opportunity during the 104th Congress to give \nsmall businesses the same benefit enjoyed by big business and their \nemployees--by increasing the health insurance deduction to 100 percent \nfor 1995 and beyond.\n  That is why I have also committed my support to S. 262, the Grassley-\nRoth-Pryor-Dole 100 percent deductibility bill.\n  Self-employers face the worst of all possible worlds in the health \ninsurance marketplace.\n  Far too often, there aren't enough options--the price is too high--\nand the self-employed are denied the very incentives and tax treatment \nbig business has come to expect.\n  And too often, the self-employed lack access to cost-saving managed \ncare arrangements because insurers are reluctant to create and market \nthem in the small towns and rural areas where most self-employers are \nlocated.\n  Even when they do buy insurance, self-employed business owners often \npay approximately 30 percent more than larger companies for similar \nbenefits.\n  That is because of costly State mandates for specific types of \ninsurance coverage, which prevent self-employed business owners from \nshopping for only the basic care that they and their employees might \nneed.\n  Larger firms that self-insure, on the other hand, are not subject to \nthese costly mandates. The health insurance deduction helps small \nbusiness owners defray at least some of the high cost of insurance.\n  The businesses that would benefit most from deductibility legislation \nrepresent almost 10 percent of the working population, and cover a \ntremendous variety of employers--from farmers and florists--grocers and \nbankers--to smalltown clothing stores, hardware stores, and \nphotographers.\n  Mr. President, a tax deduction for the cost of insurance premiums \nwould go a long way to help these self-employed business owners and \ntheir employees--especially in high-risk fields such as agriculture, \nwhere the hazards of the job often result in relatively high health \ninsurance costs.\n  [[Page S4556]] The health deduction is simply good business--a simple \nway for the Federal Government to help the people who create the jobs \nand deliver the paychecks on Main Street.\n  Small business needs encouragement, along with some incentives, to \nsurvive and continue creating jobs--providing for their employees. It \nis in our best interest to see that they do.\n  Since the 1970's small business has created two of every three new \njobs in this country, and a substantial majority of those jobs were \ncreated in firms with fewer than five employees.\n  Congress should not neglect these entrepreneurs, Mr. President.\n  Self-employed business owners are the very people whose firms will \nhave to thrive in order to create the jobs of the future.\n  These are often people with very little cash, but a lot of good ideas \nand talent, struggling to make their ideas work.\n  For them, the health insurance deduction could mean the difference \nbetween an ``Open for Business'' sign on the door and one reading \n``Going Out of Business.''\n  It is time, Mr. President, for Washington to treat America's job \nproviders equally.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for coming together in a bipartisan \nmanner to ensure that 3.2 million more Americans will have access to \nmore affordable care.\n  In fact, this is our first step toward serious and sensible health \ncare reform.\n  It is legislation like H.R. 831 which I believe helps restore the \npeople's faith in this great institution.\n  Mr. President, our ultimate aim should be to give the self-employed \nthe same 100 percent health insurance deduction we've granted to \nincorporated businesses.\n  But today, passage of H.R. 831 moves us closer toward a goal we all \nshare: Insuring more people, under policies that cost less, that allow \nthem greater access to the health care services and providers they \nchoose.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased we will pass legislation \ntoday that, if enacted, will finally make permanent the health \ninsurance deduction for the self-employed. This certainly will be a \nvictory for small business in America.\n  During my entire tenure in the Senate, I have supported and \ncosponsored legislation to make the deduction permanent. It is very \ngratifying, therefore, to see that an overwhelming number of my \ncolleagues share this goal.\n  Extension of the deduction is a bipartisan issue--one on which there \nis a very broad consensus. A letter signed by 75 Members of this body, \nearlier this year, bears testimony to that fact.\n  For too long, small businesses, including farmers, have been treated \nunfairly compared to corporations. Corporations may deduct 100 percent \nof the cost of qualified health insurance they purchase. But the self-\nemployed do not receive equal treatment. In the past they have been \nable to deduct only 25 percent of the cost of purchasing health \ninsurance for themselves and their families.\n  What is more, small businesses have not been able to rely on the \navailability of this deduction from year to year, preventing them from \nbudgeting for their health insurance costs. For many, the existence of \nthe deduction means the difference between having health insurance or \nnot having it at all.\n  Frankly, it is not clear why this deduction was subject to sunset in \nthe first place, often forcing an annual extensions of the measure. \nThis is not a case of a controversial provision needing further review. \nVirtually all Members agree that, as a matter of fairness, the self-\nemployed should be able to deduct at least some portion of these costs, \nif not the full amount.\n  I am also pleased that the deduction will be increased to 30 percent. \nIt is my hope that at some point in the future we can increase the \namount of the deduction; though it is of paramount importance that any \nfurther extension be offset appropriately.\n  I regret that we were unable to pass this measure earlier this year. \nMost farmers who are self-employed faced a March 1 filing deadline for \ntheir 1994 tax returns. Assuming the measure we are considering today \nis passed, they will have to go to the expense of filing amended \nreturns for 1994. This situation could have been avoided if not for \nunnecessary delay in the House of Representatives unrelated to the \nself-employed deduction.\n  I am concerned that funding for this measure relies on the repeal of \nsection 1071 benefits used to promote minority ownership of broadcast \nfacilities. I would prefer that section 1071 benefits be reviewed in \nthe context of a comprehensive analysis of affirmative action programs, \nas the administration has suggested. I ask unanimous consent that the \nadministration's ``Statement of Administration Policy'' on H.R. 831 be \nprinted in the Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am pleased that the Senate was able to move this bill \nso quickly. In light of this, I am optimistic that the extension of the \ndeduction will be enacted in time for the remaining self-employed to \ntake advantage of it before they file their returns on April 15.\n  With the passage of the permanent extension of the self-employed \nhealth insurance deduction today, we can all claim victory for bringing \ngreater fairness in the Tax Code to small businesses and for helping \nensure that more Americans are covered by health insurance.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\nH.R. 831--Permanently Extend the Tax Deductibility for Health Insurance \n  Costs for Self-Employed Individuals (Archer (R) TX and 3 cosponsors)\n\n       The Administration supports the primary purpose of H.R. \n     831, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee--to \n     reinstate for 1994 the 25 percent tax deduction for health \n     insurance premiums for self-employed individuals and increase \n     the deduction to 30 percent on a permanent basis thereafter.\n       The Administration, however, opposes one of the bill's \n     offsets--i.e., the outright repeal of the current tax \n     treatment for the sale of radio and television broadcast \n     facilities and cable television systems to minority-owned \n     businesses (so-called ``section 1071 benefits''). The \n     Administration is undertaking a comprehensive review of \n     affirmative action programs, including certain aspects of \n     section 1071 benefits. As part of the section 1071 review, \n     the Administration will consider possible modifications to \n     the ownership and holding period requirements as well as caps \n     on the amount of gain eligible for deferral.\n       While the Administration, in the FY 1996 Budget, proposed \n     limiting earned income tax credit (EITC) eligibility based on \n     certain kinds of investment income, the Administration \n     strongly believes that the cap on such income--as set forth \n     in this bill--should be indexed for inflation.\n       The Administration supports the provision in H.R. 831 that \n     would tax expatriating citizens on untaxed gains--a provision \n     which is very similar to one included in the President's FY \n     1996 Budget.\n\n\n                 Scoring for Purposes of Pay-As-You-Go\n\n       H.R. 831 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to \n     the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990.\n       The Administration's preliminary scoring estimates of this \n     bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this \n     legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 831 \n     were\n      enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published \n     within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA.\n\n                                             PAY-AS-YOU-GO ESTIMATES                                            \n                                             [Receipts in millions]                                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                          1999- \n                                              1995      1996      1997      1998      1999      2000      2000  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSE Health.................................      -513      -525      -571      -621      -678      -740     -3648\nFCC.......................................       399       449       213       220       226       233      1740\nEITC......................................  ........        23       464       507       543       576      2113\nCitizen...................................        60       200       300       410       530       650      2150\nOther.....................................         8        23        32        40        44        48       195\n\n\n                                                                                                                \n[[Page S4557]]\n                                       PAY-AS-YOU-GO ESTIMATES--Continued                                       \n                                             [Receipts in millions]                                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                         1999-  \n                                             1995      1996      1997      1998      1999      2000       2000  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Totals.................................       -46       170       438       556       665       767      2550 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--                                                                                                         \nSE Health -- 30 percent tax deduction for self-employed persons (includes 25 percent tax deduction retroactive  \n  to 1994).                                                                                                     \nFCC -- Repeal of current tax treatment on sale of broadcast facilities to minority-owned businesses.            \nEITC -- Modification of the Earned Income Tax Credit.                                                           \nCitizen -- Bar citizens from renouncing their citizenship to avoid tax obligations incurred before they         \n  renounced.                                                                                                    \nOther -- Change in Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code.                                                   \n\n\nMs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise this morning to express my strong \nsupport for passage of H.R. 831, legislation which restores the 25-\npercent tax deduction for the health insurance costs of the self-\nemployed.\n  At a time when America's small businesses are under virtual attack \nfrom Federal regulations and mandates, we must take a leadership role \nin Congress to bring them the relief they deserve.\n  In order to create jobs in Maine and across America, we need to \nassist small businesses in any way we can; they are the engine that \nkeeps our Nation's economy running. Businesses with fewer than 10 \nemployees make up more than 85 percent of Maine's jobs, and, \nnationally, small businesses employ 54 percent of the private work \nforce. In 1993, small businesses created an estimated 71 percent of the \n1.9 million new jobs. When we call small businesses the engine of our \neconomy, we mean it--and America's small are jump-starting our economy \nin all 50 States.\n  From investors to startup businesses, self-employed workers make up \nan important and vibrant part of the small business sector--and too \noften they are forgotten in providing benefits and assistance. Indeed, \nthe 11 percent of uninsured workers in America are self-employed. By \nextending tax credits for health insurance to these small businesses--\nwhich is what H.R. 831 does--we will help provide health care coverage \nto millions of Americans.\n  There is an old saying that is particularly appropriate this time of \nyear: ``Nothing is certain but death and taxes.'' The 3 million self-\nemployed in this country are particularly aware of the tax part this \nyear, as they have sat and watched and worried about whether we would \nrestore the 25-percent deduction before they had to pay Uncle Sam on \nApril 17.\n  Earlier this year, I joined 74 of my colleagues in asking the \nmajority leader and the minority leader to expedite the passage of this \nlegislation because of its importance to the self-employed.\n  In doing so, I promised that I would not offer any amendments and \nthat I would vote against any amendments offered, again, in order to \nexpedite its passage. At this late date, we cannot keep the self-\nemployed taxpayer hostage any longer. As it is, we have forced them to \nwait until the very end of the tax period to file.\n  I would like to thank the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Packwood], \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for getting this bill to the floor \nand for getting agreement to make this deduction a permanent part of \nthe tax code. That way, neither the self-employed, nor Congress, will \nhave to go through this exercise again. I know that the 74,000 self-\nemployed in my home State of Maine will breath a sigh of relief once we \ncomplete action on this bill.\n  After all, it is not as if there is disagreement on the need to \nassist the self-employed in this manner. In fact, amid all the \ndisagreement on health care reform over the last 2 years, this is one \nof the areas where we all agreed. Why? Because the self-employed--the \nhard-working, tax-paying, job-creating small business men and women of \nAmerica--cannot afford their own health care insurance. I am \nparticularly, pleased that the bill before us expands the deduction to \n30 percent for the 1995 tax year. This is an important step in the \nright direction, as I believe we should expand it further, and grant \nthe same tax treatment to the self-employed that we provide for \ncorporations. In fact, I have introduced a bill to assist small \nbusinesses which includes phasing in a 100-percent deduction.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 831 and in \nsupport of the 3 million self-employed Americans who need our help \ntoday.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, let me begin by emphasizing the \nfundamental reason why we are here today--to extend the 25 percent tax \ndeduction for health insurance costs of self-employed Americans. This \nis one of the most important items Congress will consider this year.\n  We must put the needs of self-employed Americans--small business men \nand women, farmers and ranchers--at the forefront of our agenda. \nPassing the 25 percent deduction on a permanent basis is a step in that \ndirection. By doing so, these hard-working individuals can make their \nbusiness plans knowing they can depend on this reasonable deduction. \nWithout the deduction, self-employed individuals will see their taxes \nincrease and their ability to afford health insurance decrease. That is \nunfair, and must not happen.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, the legislation we are considering today is a \nmodest deduction, particularly when compared to the corporate deduction \nof 100 percent, but it is nonetheless critical. It is critical to the \n48,000 small business men and women, farmers and ranchers in South \nDakota, as well as the millions of other self-employed people across \nthis country.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee I supported the legislation \nbefore the Senate today. It retroactively reinstates the 25 percent \ndeduction for last year. More importantly, it permanently increases the \ndeduction to 30 percent for 1995 and thereafter. This legislation is a \nfirst step toward bringing self-employed individuals onto equal footing \nwith corporations, which are allowed to deduct 100 percent of their \nhealth insurance costs.\n  We have already done a great disservice to our family farmers by not \npassing this legislation prior to the March 1 filing deadline for their \nFederal tax returns. It is my hope that we will not do the same for all \nthe other self-employed individuals by missing the April 17 deadline, \nthereby creating a paperwork avalanche of amended returns.\n  Approximately 67,200 South Dakotans are either self-employed or are \nemployed by the self-employed. These men and women represent almost 20 \npercent of South Dakota's total workforce--many of them are farmers and \nranchers. This tax deduction makes insurance more affordable for them \nand their families. Immediate passage of this bill should be a top \npriority for the Senate.\n  I know that most of my colleagues agree that this is a bill of \ncritical importance. However, as we all know, controversy surrounds the \noffset. This is unfortunate because it threatens the timely passage of \nthe 25 percent provision.\n  I support the offset so that we can get this legislation permanently \nplaced in law and also expand it to 30 percent. The FCC tax \ncertificates program--the program we terminate to pay for this \nlegislation--is no longer justifiable.\n  When the choice is between giving multibillion dollar corporations a \ntax break or giving small businesses, farmers and ranchers relief for \nhealth insurance coverage, the choice is clear: I side with the hard-\nworking small business people, and farmers and ranchers--not large \ncorporations.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize the core issue here today and \nto vote to retroactively reinstate the 25 percent deduction for 1994 \nand to permanently extend the deduction at the 30 percent level \nthereafter. We must do this for the sake of our farmers, ranchers, \nsmall business people, and the families and employees who rely upon \nthem.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 831 as approved by the Finance \nCommittee, and urge our colleagues in the House to approve it as well.\n                      [[Page S4558]] section 1071\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, section 1071 of the Internal Revenue Code \nauthorizes the FCC to permit sellers of broadcast properties to defer \ncapital gains taxes on a sale or exchange if the sale or exchange is \ndeemed by the agency to be necessary or appropriate to effectuate a \nchange in a policy of, or adoption of a new policy by, the Commission \nwith respect to the ownership and control of radio broadcasting \nstations. As such, the Commission has used tax deferral certificates \nfor, among other things, the promotion of minority ownership of \nbroadcasting stations and cable television systems.\n  From a tax perspective, I believe that the FCC's tax deferral program \nis not appropriate tax policy. Over the past 16 years, and as the \nauthor of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, I have consistently advocated \nthat we spend just as easily through the Tax Code as we do through \nappropriated and mandatory spending. I have consistently opposed these \nspecial interest loopholes. Indeed, in this bill, I offered an \namendment that eliminated the granddaddy of all tax loopholes--one that \nbenefits those who renounce their U.S. citizenship. By closing this \nexpatriate loophole, we raise $1.3 billion that incredibly benefitted \nonly 12 taxpayers.\n  Tax loopholes raise taxes on those in society who do not use them and \ndistort rational economic decisionmaking. Thus, as a member of the \nFinance Committee, I voted to place a moratorium on section 1071 \neffective as of January 17, 1995, thereby overturning commercial \ntransactions that would have sheltered approximately $500 million in \ncapital gains taxes.\n  I am profoundly disturbed, however, that the issue of affirmative \naction has been interjected into the underlying issue of how to finance \nthe 25 percent health insurance deduction for self-employed \nindividuals. I support the concept of affirmative action, which is a \nremedial measure designed to identify qualified women and minorities \nand afford them the opportunity to enter the mainstream of American \nlife and contribute their skills and talents to make America more \ncompetitive on the world stage. Further, I thought it best to consider \naffirmative action in full, not simply one small provision. As such, I \nvoted in committee to place a 2-year moratorium on the application of \nsection 1071 so that Congress could study the program and alternative \nways to increase broadcast diversity.\n  As the affirmative action debate rages, I will attempt to broaden the \ndiscussion to deal with the underlying issues of race in American \nsociety. In addition, I will be offering my views and suggestions about \nhow to assure that individuals who are truly discriminated against on \nthe basis of race and gender have a means of obtaining a remedy, not \nsimply lip service. I challenge my colleagues to join me in this \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will take but a few moments here so we can \nfinish this bill. First, I want to congratulate the managers of the \nbill, Senator Packwood and Senator Moynihan.\n  Mr. President, we start debate today on an issue that is important to \nmany Americans across the country. H.R. 831 seeks to make permanent the \ndeductibility of health care insurance costs for self-employed \nindividuals.\n  Since 1986, Congress has allowed the self-employed a 25-percent \ndeduction for their health care insurance costs. Almost every year, we \nhave had to extend the deduction, but we failed to extend it last year \nwhen it expired on December 31, 1993. We were told that we would \naddress this matter in the health care reform debate. And we did \naddress it. In some bills, including mine and Senator Packwood's, we \nsought to allow up to 100 percent dedication phased in over a period of \ntime. But, in the end, we did nothing. None of the health care reform \nbills had enough support to pass last year, and so, here we are today \nagain looking at this issue.\n  H.R. 831 seeks to make this deduction permanent. We don't want to \nleave the 3.2 million tax filers in 1994, hanging on the edge of a \ncliff every year. And we do not want to tell them that although \ncorporations can deduct 100 percent of their health care insurance \ncosts, small businesses cannot. We decided 9 years ago that in order to \nmake the playing field more equitable, we should allow small businesses \nto deduct their health care insurance costs. But we did not give them \n100 percent, we gave them only 25 percent--one quarter of what \ncorporations are allowed to deduct. Today, we seek to increase that \namount permanently to 30 percent. And we must continue to fight for \nparity.\n  In fact, many small businesses strongly believe that increasing the \ndeductibility begins to solve the disparity between self-employed and \nincorporated businesses and will give even more individuals access to \naffordable health insurance. I agree when them. I have received many \nletters from various small business and agricultural associations \nsupporting my efforts to increase the deduction even more than the 30 \npercent in the committee bill. Letters from: The National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National \nRestaurant Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the \nNational Corn Growers Association, the American Soybean Association, \nthe Small Business Legislative Council, the National Small Business \nUnified, the National Association of Home Builders, the Healthcare \nEquity Action League [HEAL], Communicating for Health Consumers, U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the National Association of Private Enterprise, \nand the Society of American Florists.\n  I know that many in this Chamber share their belief--so much, in \nfact, that the minority leader and I have sent a letter to both the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the chairman of the House \nWays and\n Means Committee to strongly consider raising the deductible percentage \nhigher than 30 percent, but within the confines of the offsetting \nrevenues.\n\n\n                           employee deduction\n\n  I also share the concerns of many of my colleagues over the many \nemployees who pay their own health insurance, but do not get to deduct \nany amount. There is no doubt, that these people deserve fair and equal \ntreatment as well. I am hopeful that when we return to health care \nreform we will address this issue.\n  Many believe that the health care reform issue is dead, but it is \nnot. We still have people without insurance. We still have people who \nare denied insurance because of existing illness. We still have people \nwho cannot change their jobs in fear of losing health insurance. To me, \nand many of my colleagues, health care reform is still very much alive, \nand the issue of taxation of employees who pay for their own health \ninsurance, will be addressed.\n\n\n                          offsetting revenues\n\n  In the Senate Finance Committee last week, under Chairman Packwood's \nleadership, we passed a bill that not only extended the deduction \npermanently, we raised the deductibility percentage to 30 percent. And \nwe did so by repealing a Federal Communications Commission [FCC] \nprogram that I believe is not only ineffective, but costs the Federal \nGovernment billions of dollars. This program has gained notoriety in \nthe newspapers in the recent months because one particular transaction \ncould cost the Government in excess of $500 million. One company, 500 \nmillion dollars.\n  The FCC, the agency that administers this program, does not know how \nmuch the entire program has cost the Government. And neither does the \nTreasury Department. The program has been in existence for 17 years, \nand yet we have no idea how much this has cost the Government. One of \nmy distinguished colleagues on the Finance Committee said it right, \n``If you are looking for the enemy, the enemy is us.'' And so, members \nof the Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly repealed this program.\n\n\n                   the fcc's tax certificate program\n\n  Congress, in 1943, gave the FCC authority to grant tax deferrals to \nowners of broadcast facilities who were forced to sell their properties \nto break up monopolies during World War II. Congress' intent was to, \nand I quote, ``Alleviate the burden of taxpayers who had been forced to \nsell their radio stations under difficult wartime circumstances.''\n  The FCC, in 1978, expanded the provision to give a tax preference to \nradio, television, and later cable broadcasters \n[[Page S4559]] who sold their properties to minority-owned firms. For \nthis policy, the FCC defines minorities as including ``Blacks, \nHispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians and Pacific \nIslanders.''\n  The greatest flaw in this program is that the economic benefit does \nnot go to the minority buyer, the economic benefit goes to the seller. \nIt is like a kickback. If you sell to me and not the other guy, I will \ngive you a little extra something. And I will not be paying for it, the \nAmerican taxpayer will. I do not understand it, and I do not understand \nwhy people would think this is benefiting\n minorities when the monetary gain is going to the seller.\n\n  These are also million-dollar deals. These are tax breaks to \nmillionaires. The average sales price for transactions in which tax \ncertificates were granted is $3.5 million for radio, and $38 million \nfor television. Although there is no data currently available for the \ncable industry, one of the transactions in the cable industry seeking \nto utilize the tax certificate, is $2.3 billion.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n  Some have tried to say that this bill's effective date is \nretroactive. And that this bill is crafted to target one particular \ntransaction--the Viacom transaction. I disagree.\n  Chairman Archer of the House Ways and Means Committee issued a press \nrelease on January 17 of this year entitled, ``Archer Announces Review \nof FCC Tax Provision,'' putting all FCC tax certificate transactions on \nnotice. It reads, and I quote:\n\n       The Committee on Ways and Means will undertake this review \n     immediately to explore possible legislative changes to \n     section 1071, including the possibility of repeal. Any \n     changes to section 1072 may apply to transactions completed, \n     or certificates issued by the FCC, on or after today, January \n     17, 1995.\n\n  Two days later, on January 19, representatives from Viacom, House \nWays and Means Committee, and the Joint Tax Committee met. And Viacom \nwas fully apprised of the situation and the possible consequences on \ntheir transaction.\n  Nevertheless, the parties in the Viacom transaction signed an asset \npurchase agreement the following day. and even then I do not believe it \nwas not a binding contract. The purchase agreement is contingent upon \nthe FCC granting a tax certificate. They filed a tax certificate \napplication with the FCC on February 3, with full knowledge that \nCongress would be acting to repeal the program. On February 6, 1995, \nH.R. 831 was introduced, and reported by the Ways and Means Committee \non February 8. The bill passed the House on February 21.\n  This transaction is not a small one. This a $2.3 billion transaction. \nthe parties involved are sophisticated players in the mergers and \nacquisitions world. A world where players are accustomed to reacting \nquickly. It is clear to me that the parties of this transaction were \ngiven reasonable expectation that the FCC tax certificate program would \nbe repealed. And it is clear to met that they decided to sign their \nagreement regardless. And, remember, they did not file for an FCC tax \ncertificate until February 3. Their agreement continues to be \ncontingent upon a tax certificate being granted.\n\n\nturning tax breaks and loopholes for millionaires into health care for \n                          the ordinary citizen\n\n  Let me be clear, if we do not pass this legislation today, then what \nwe are doing is raising taxes for 3.2 million Americans. Make no \nmistake about it. If we do nothing today, then they will pay more in \ntaxes this year than they did last year.\n  What we are trying to do here today; what we will accomplish here \ntoday is taking a million dollar, unjustifiable tax break for \nmillionaires, not minorities, and turn them into health care for \nordinary Americans. Americans who really need it.\n  Let me also remind everyone here that this bill passed the House of \nRepresentatives with an overhwelming majority vote of 388 to 44. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote for this bill.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4551-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           AFFIRMATIVE ACTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. As the Washington Post reported today, the overwhelming \nmajority of the American people believe that the race-counting game has \ngone too far.\n  I am proud of my own civil rights record. I have supported \naffirmative action in the past. That's no secret.\n  But my past record did not disqualify me last December from asking \nthe Congressional Research Service to compile a list of all Federal \npreference laws and Regulations.\n  And my record does not disqualify me today from raising legitimate \nquestions about the continuing fairness and effectiveness of \naffirmative action, particularly when the affirmative-action label is \nused to describe quotas, set-asides, and other group preferences.\n  Equal treatment, not preferential treatment, should be the standard. \nEqual opportunity, not equal results, must be the goal.\n  Earlier today, my distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Cohen, \ngave a very eloquent speech on the Senate floor where he pointed out \nthat America is not a color-blind society, and he is right. \nDiscrimination continues to exist. The color-blind ideal is just that--\nan ideal that has yet to be achieved in the America of 1995.\n  But, Mr. President, do you become a color-blind society by dividing \npeople by race? Do you achieve the color-blind ideal by granting \npreferences to people simply because they happen to belong to certain \ngroups? Do you continue programs that have outlived their usefulness or \noriginal purpose? The answer to these questions is, of course, a \nresounding ``no.''\n  I look forward to the completion of the President's review of all \nFederal affirmative action policies, but if the President is seeking a \nmagical ``third way,'' I suspect he is going to run into a dead end: \nWhen it comes to the issue of group preferences, you are either for \nthem or against them. There can be no splitting the difference, no \n``third way.''\n  With that said let us hope that reason prevails as we continue down \nthis road. If we keep our voices low and our intentions good, the \ndebate over affirmative action can, in fact, be an opportunity to unite \nthe American people, and not divide us.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I believe we are prepared to yield back \nour time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield back our remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further amendment to be \nproposed, the question is on agreeing to the committee amendment in the \nnature of a substitute.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \ncommittee amendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, shall the bill pass?\n  So the bill (H.R. 831), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its \namendment to H.R. 831, request a conference with the House, and that \nthe chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The motion was agreed to, and the Presiding Officer appointed Mr. \nPackwood, Mr. Dole, Mr. Roth, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Moynihan, \nMr. Baucus, Mr. Bradley, and Ms. Moseley-Braun conferees on the part of \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4559-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about my deep \nconcern over the House proposal on the child nutrition program and \nstand before you today to speak about the questions that I have asked \nand the answers I have looked to to find out whether this is the right \nroad for this body to go down.\n  [[Page S4560]] I want to relate some of that to you today. The \nNational School Lunch Program, as we all know, began in 1946 in \nresponse to concerns that our national security was jeopardized because \nmany of our incoming military personnel suffered from nutrition-related \nillness.\n  The Federal Government made a decision that it is in the national \nsecurity interest of this country to feed and nourish our youth to \nensure a strong population and a strong nation.\n  If we take the time to review this program's record, we will clearly \nfind that it has been successful in boosting health and achievement \namong our children.\n  This program touches every family in America. Its elimination will \nshake the very foundation of the family: health, nutrition, education, \nand opportunity.\n  Here is why: Every single school day, more than 25 million children \nin 93,000 schools across America eat a lunch provided through the \nNational School Lunch Program. More than half of these children receive \nthe meal free or at a reduced price.\n  I doubt my colleagues know what it is like to sit in a classroom as a \nsmall child and try to concentrate on learning when you have not had a \nmeal for several hours.\n  I doubt that many know what it is like to teach these children.\n  As a mother and a pre-school teacher, I can assure you that for \nhungry children, learning is not a priority. It cannot be. Often, the \nmeals they get at school are their only meals for the day.\n  Often, these lunches are the only nutritious meal they get. I can \ntell you from first-hand experience that food makes a child--any \nchild--happy and healthy and willing to learn.\n  Teachers are overburdened as it is. The last thing we need to do is \nto put more hungry children in our classrooms and then ask our teachers \nto teach them.\n  The Women, Infants, and Children Program [WIC], another nutrition \nprogram targeted for block granting, is one of the most successful \nforms of health care cost containment that we\n have today. It has an outstanding record of reducing the incidence of \nlow-birth-weight babies born to poor women, and saving lives.\n\n  This program serves nearly 7 million mothers and children each month \nat a cost of less than $1.50 a day for each participating child. The \nMedicaid savings this program produces outweigh the costs by a 3 to 1 \nratio.\n  It is a model program which should not be lost in the welfare reform \ndebate but rather one we can and should learn from.\n  I think it is important to point out that these programs have \nrightfully enjoyed bipartisan support in this body. The Senate has \naffirmed the issue of nutrition as one of health for our children.\n  It is one of economics too. This Nation will pay so much more later \nif growing children do not get the nutrition they need now and if women \ndo not get the parental care they need now.\n  Let me touch on a few other aspects of this legislation. One of the \nreasons these nutrition programs have been so successful is because of \nnational nutrition standards. Where do you think the campaign for the \nfive basic food groups came from?\n  The House proposal would eliminate these and ask each State to set \ntheir own. So, instead of one proven, workable national program, we \nwill have 50 individual bureaucracies experimenting on our children.\n  But that is not all. If we look further into the legislation, we \nrealize that despite what the House would have us believe, their \nproposal will cut nutrition funds to many States.\n  The claim that the school lunch program will see a 4.5-percent \nincrease cannot be found in this legislation. What you can say is that \nthe school nutrition block grant would provide 2.5-percent more funding \nin fiscal year 1996 than schools will receive in fiscal year 1995. \nHowever, this does not take into account food price inflation or \nincreases in participation.\n  Under current law, these programs would see a 5-percent increase in \norder to keep pace with food costs and participation. Because block \ngrants do not take these into account, the bill will actually provide \n$170 million less in fiscal year 1996 than would be provided under \ncurrent law.\n  By fiscal year 2000, the block grant would provide $760 million less \nthan the levels needed to keep pace with inflation and participation. \nOver a 5-year period, the block grant would provide $2.3 billion less \nthan current law.\n These are not block grants; they are block cuts.\n\n  The House proposal shifts these funds to discretionary spending. Once \nthis happens, 1996 is the only year funds can be guaranteed. Afterward, \nState nutrition programs would be subject to arbitrary spending caps, \nacross-the-board cuts, and other money savings gimmicks without regard \nto the impact on children.\n  The House proposal does not take into account the possibility of a \nrecession. Nor does it compensate for any increases in population or \npoverty.\n  It puts our States in a position of setting nutrition standards they \nmay not be able to afford. It caps administrative costs which will \nlimit each State's ability to establish the new State regulations.\n  What does this mean? When States run out of funds--and believe me, \nthey will--The children will not eat. The end result will be \ndevastating to our children, our schools, our families, our \ncommunities, and our economies.\n  I have talked with many people since the introduction of this \nproposal. I know that my State of Washington will lose under the \ncurrent block grant formula.\n  I know that hard working parents who need WIC or school lunches are \nafraid of what the future holds for their children. I know that \nchildren are worried about their families.\n  I understand and share their fears and I urge all of my colleagues to \nget out and talk with those people who participate in these programs.\n  Talk to parents, to teachers, and to children so that when the Senate \ntakes up this issue you have a clear and deep understanding of just \nwhat you will be doing if you support this effort.\n  Mr. President, one last issue I want to touch on in regard to this \nwhole block grant effort is the issue of welfare and how it has become \nassociated with abuse and irresponsibility.\n  I share the view that the programs I just discussed are investments \nin our future.\n  The overwhelming majority of those people involved are using these \nprograms as a last resort and not because they choose to. They are \nnecessary for survival.\n  Mr. President, I have several letters from families in the Washington \nWIC programs which I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am very grealfut for the WIC Program, and to the nurses I \n     have meet. I have learned alot about nutristion.\n       If I was not recieving WIC, Moniqua my two year old would \n     not have enough milk.\n       I have felt very support by the ladies that wort there.\n       There are a lot of ladies that come to the WIC office to \n     learn how to take good care of their new babies. Without the \n     WIC a lot of babies would go hungrey. They givee formula, \n     baby food and sopport you if the mother would like to Breast \n     feed their Baby. These nurses help to keep a lot of Babies \n     healthy.\n       In school my older girl would not beable eat, because not \n     all the time, I have enough food to send with her for lunch, \n     she able to eat and worry about how hungrey she is. she can \n     concentrate on her school work.\n       I know what it is like to go to school and be hungrey and \n     not beable to think very clear.\n     Katheran Northrop.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       The WIC program has really helped supply my family with the \n     nutritious foods we need.

Baby milk is really expensive and when you are on a \n     fixed income and only recieve a certain amount of Food stamps \n     it becomes a problem with finance. The WIC program helps us \n     women and children afford milk for their children and even \n     help us afford some things we need but if there wasn't the \n     program we would have alot of under nurished babies. So you \n     see Sen. Murry we really need the WIC program. * * *\n                                                      Julie Allen.\n       [[Page S4561]] Dear Senator Murry: I just want to say that \n     the WIC program has helped me so much and many others that I \n     know.

I was five \n     months pregnant at the time and worrying about the stress \n     involved in caring for my family.\n       The WIC Program was a life saver. Not only was I able to \n     take care of myself during my pregnancy but it helped to \n     provide for my other children.

Me and my family used WIC for \n     approximately one year and if it hadn't been for the program \n     we wouldn't have made it. WIC enabled me and my family to get \n     on our feet, thus giving us the ability to give back.

My daughter age 4 \n     and son age 2 have been on WIC since before they were born. \n     Having WIC has ment they would always have formula or milk. \n     They probably would not have had milk everyday if it wasn't \n     for WIC. I am a working mom and make just a little too much \n     to stay on foodstamps.

Mothers will do almost \n     anything to protect & provide for their babies including \n     theft & illegal ways of making money. With WIC, these women \n     do not have to submit themselves to the ugly ways of life, \n     but instead feel that they have a whole building of friends \n     they can always come to. Nobody wants to rely on anyone else, \n     but in these days & ages, life is so vastly unfair, that \n     sometimes your low days do outnumber your high days.

So until then, when everyone in \n     this world is totally self-sufficient, programs like WIC are \n     needed and worth every penny the government puts towards it.\n\n  Another letter writer talks about how important WIC has been to her \nchildren and ends by saying that:\n\n       Having WIC has meant my children would always have formula \n     or milk. They probably wouldn't have had milk everyday if it \n     weren't for WIC. I am a working mom and make just a little \n     too much to stay on food stamps so WIC has bridged a big gap \n     in our food budget. Please don't take it away from the \n     children. They need it.\n\n  Another letter:\n\n       We are a struggling family of 7 with a small business. We \n     hope to not need help soon but there are a lot of people \n     still out there who wouldn't survive without this program.\n       I think you will find that these are caring, responsible, \n     hard-working individuals who have benefited tremendously from \n     this program. It has been the safety net they need.\n\n  Finally, I want to share a few quotes from some letters children \nwrote:\n\n       ``If we don't get our lunch we would starve. Don't do this \n     to us. You are breaking our hearts.''\n       [[Page S4562]] ``Instead of taking something that we do not \n     need you are taking something that we do need. I am one of \n     those children that needs those programs.''\n       ``We need school lunches because we do not have lunch at \n     home. I do not like you for taking this away.''\n\n  I could go on and on but will not as time will not allow it.\n  I will, however, submit these for the record so that others can read \nthem. I wanted to make the point that these are caring, responsible, \nhard-working individuals who have benefited tremendously from these \nprograms.\n  These are children who know the only full meal they or many of their \nfriends get is at school. It has been the safety net they need. These \nletters make that point so much better than I can.\n  In closing, I want to say that I do not argue that our welfare system \nis in need of some change. What I do not like is the assumption that \nevery person utilizing these programs is out to take the Government and \nthe taxpayers.\n  Like so many other issues, the House has gone too far on child \nnutrition.\n  Welfare reform merits in-depth, serious consideration and I am \nanxious to begin that process. I think a little common sense will go a \nlong way on this issue.\n  However, in the case of child nutrition programs, I am appalled that \nsuch little time or consideration was taken before this bill was \nreported out of committee. We cannot afford to follow the House lead \nand expect responsible, effective legislation to result.\n  This legislation affects a group of Americans who are completely \nunable to come to Congress and speak out. I strongly urge my colleagues \nto oppose the wholesale slashing of child nutrition when the issue \ncomes to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4559-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4562-S4564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT DEBATE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there was a column in the Washington Post \nthis morning entitled, ``More `Trust Fund' Whoppers'' by a columnist \nnamed Charles Krauthammer. I felt it necessary to come over and respond \nto this column. Mr. Krauthammer was upset about a response that Senator \nConrad and I had written to the Washington Post in response to his \nfirst column about us that was titled ``Social Security `Trust Fund' \nWhopper.''\n  His first column was so devoid of facts and reasonable conclusions \nthat we wrote a column back and said, in our part of the country we \nexpect people to tell the whole truth. We did not like what he had done \nin his first column in which he called our arguments with respect to \nthe constitutional amendment to balance the budget and looting of the \ntrust funds in Social Security to do so as ``fraudulent.'' Now he is \nupset at the column we wrote back and so he wrote a second long column, \na long-winded column this morning.\n  As I read that, I was thinking, I come from ranching country in \nsouthwestern North Dakota. And occasionally you refer to people as \n``all hat and no cattle.'' I thought about that when I finished reading \nhis column this morning. It was hard for me to understand how, with \nfacts so evident, he can reach a conclusion so flawed.\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Wyoming, also comes from \nranching country, and I brought along a piece of cowboy poetry that I \nthought might describe the difference in perspectives, and the \ndifference, sometimes, is simply that some do not have the capability \nof understanding the clear perspective. It is sort of described as the \ndifference between tongue and egg in this poem.\n  A cowboy poet, whose name I do not have, wrote a piece and I thought \nabout this piece as it might apply to the disconnect of logic in Mr. \nKrauthammer's column. Let me read the piece to you, the poem called \n``The Disputed Epicure.'' It is about a cowboy who is queried by a \nhigh-born lady.\n\n     ``What's your favorite cut of beef?''\n     The high-born lady queried.\n     Of an old cowboy who long ago\n     Had grown, both wise and wearied,\n     Of direct infernal questions\n     On the ways of cowpoke lore.\n     So he considered on this question\n     That he'd not been asked before.\n\n     With rapt anticipation,\n     On his pause, the lady hung.\n     Until, at last the cowboy said,\n     ``I'd have to say it's tongue.\n     Tongue's got flavor, `n texture,\n     And nary a bit of bond.\n     A cinch to cook. I'd put her up\n     On top there, all alone.''\n\n     Recoiling, the lady said aghast,\n     ``Surely air, you jest.''\n     The idea is disgusting.\n     Your grossness I protest.\n     Eat something from out a cow's mouth?\n     Your suggestion's crude, I beg.''\n     The cowboy then said softly,\n     ``Don't s'pose you've ate no egg.''\n\n  Sometimes cowboy poets are able to say simply and clearly what we in \npolitics fumble around to try to express.\n  I guess this difference between us and Charles Krauthammer is really \nkind of the tongue and egg difference here. Mr. Krauthammer, in his \ncolumn today, first is upset that I responded to his first column on \nthe balanced budget amendment and the misuse of the Social Security \ntrust fund by saying on the floor of the Senate that, based on his \ncolumn, I thought he might qualify as a candidate for O.J.'s defense \nteam. He seems almost unmoved by facts and evidence.\n  He was upset by that, and, maybe I overreached. It may be I \noverreached because the column Mr. Krauthammer writes today \ndemonstrates his talent is not in law, his talent truly is in fiction. \nLet me go through, if I might, the fiction that I see in Mr. \nKrauthammer's column, and perhaps just briefly review the dispute.\n  The dispute is that, briefly, in 1983 we had to solve some problems \nin the Social Security System. We did that by deciding to save for the \nlong term. We, in fact, forced a national pool of savings so that each \nyear we would raise more money in Social Security than we spent. This \nyear we will raise $69 billion more than we spend. That surplus in the \nSocial Security System is not an accident. Mr. Krauthammer, in his last \ncolumn, said this is a pay-as-you-go system. But that is not true. This \nis not an accident. This is a deliberate strategy to force a national \npool of savings in the Social Security trust funds to meet the time \nwhen the baby boomers retire after the turn of the century.\n  Since the surplus began to accumulate it has been used as an offset \nto show a lower Federal deficit. I do not think there is much dispute \nabout that. And it is also true, and demonstrably true that, since 1983 \nwhen I offered the first amendment on the Ways and Means Committee, and \ntime after time after time on the floor of the House and on the floor \nof the Senate, I have raised the question, offered the amendments, and \nobjected to the looting the Social Security trust fund or using those \nmoneys to offset against a lower budget deficit because I think it is \ndishonest budgeting.\n  Then we had a constitutional amendment brought to the floor of the \nSenate and the constitutional amendment was written very precisely. It \nprescribed that by the year 2002, the U.S. budget shall be in balance \nand it shall be in balance when you use all expenditures and all \nreceipts counting towards that balance. Under that constitutional \namendment to balance the budget it would enshrine forever the practice, \nthat I have objected to in recent years, of looting the Social Security \ntrust funds to balance the budget. In fact, the way the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget was written, it was clear that is the \ncase. Senator Reid offered an amendment to provide that would not \nhappen. That amendment was defeated. So it was clear that is exactly \nwhat would happen and we were told, my colleague Senator Conrad and I, \nthat those who offer this amendment had no intention of using the \nSocial Security trust funds to balance the budget.\n  But back in that room behind this Chamber we were told by the same \npeople, ``Look fellows, let's all be honest. We cannot balance the \nFederal budget without using the Federal trust funds.'' Those are \ndirect quotes. Then they gave us handwritten pieces of paper that said \nwe will stop using the trust funds in the year 2012; and then the \nsecond piece of paper said we will stop using the trust funds--that \nthey were saying we will not do any time--by the year 2008; in other \nwords, we will stop doing something we claim we are not doing 13 years \nfrom now. What twisted sense of logic that is.\n  [[Page S4563]] Senator Conrad and I refused to budge. We said we will \nsupport the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, but you \nmust guarantee we are not going to enshrine in the Constitution the use \nof the Social Security trust funds to get there. They refused to do \nthat. We refused to budge.\n  I happen to think that the Social Security System is important in \nthis country. I happen to think the principles that I was involved with \nin 1983 when I helped write the Social Security Reform Act were \nimportant. I just refused to change the Constitution in a way that \nwould have guaranteed in the next 13 years what I consider the misuse \nof $1.3 trillion of Social Security trust funds.\n  So the Krauthammer column was calling our argument fraudulent. We \nresponded and said Mr. Krauthammer was clearly misinformed. He was \noffering a misinformed defense of an indefensible practice, some neat \ntrick for a pundit.\n  Now, there is a new column from Mr. Krauthammer. And I would like to \ngo through just a couple of points in this new column. Mr. Krauthammer, \nif I can review this column, says a number of things. First, he says \nthat he had checked with our offices because he says he wonders about \nthe sincerity of our charge about looting the Social Security trust \nfunds. He says if we were sincere about that, could we provide evidence \nthat we had complained about that before? Well, yes. He did call our \noffice. My first thought was to respond by telling his assistant: ``Do \nyour own research. You make lots of money.'' But then I thought better \nof that.\n  So we sent many examples of what I said on the floor of the Senate \nand on the floor of the House--yes, during President Clinton's \nPresidency and during previous Presidencies--saying this practice is \nwrong; this practice is dishonest budgeting. So he had the examples. He \napparently chose to ignore them or misrepresent them by saying we had \nnot been sincere because we had not complained about that before. \nSpeaking for myself, he knows better than that, and he has an \nobligation to put that in his column.\n  Second, he says that Senators Conrad and Dorgan then accused him of \nseeking to enshrine a procedure in the Constitution of counting Social \nSecurity in calculating the deficit in the Constitution. He said this \nis pure invention. This balanced budget amendment is entirely silent on \nthe issue. ``It is up to Congress to decide whether to count Social \nSecurity surpluses in calculating the budget,'' he says. Oh, really? I \nam trying to figure out what Mr. Krauthammer is reading. Has he read \nthe proposal before the Congress, the proposal that says in the \nConstitution, ``all revenues and all expenditures'' would be counted? \nIs there some new law school that you can apply to on the back of a \nmatchbook that teaches a different kind of law, one that allows you to \nmisread these proposals?\n  Well, you know. Some of us believe, especially out in western \nranching country, that things mean what they say they mean. If you \nwrite it, that is what you mean. If you say it, that is what you mean.\n  Mr. Krauthammer says no, that is pure invention. Apparently a \nWashington thought, not one that I subscribe to. The constitutional \namendment means what the words in the amendment say it means, and until \nMr. Krauthammer wrote this column, I did not think there was any \nserious dispute about that.\n  Mr. Krauthammer says, third, until 1969, it was not our practice to \nuse surpluses in calculating the deficit. Only since 1983 have we begun \ndeveloping a consistent, deliberate strategy of very large surpluses to \nsave for the future. So what counts is after 1983, Mr. Krauthammer \nwould probably know.\n  In any event, he misses the point on the 1983 amendment. He \napparently just missed the whole body of law in which we decided that \nwe would enforce a national pool of savings. Mr. Krauthammer said, you \nknow, the Social Security system is a pay-as-you-go system, and the \nreason we have all this money is because we have these baby boomers \nworking. False! Wrong! As with a lot of the rest of his column. He \nknows it. We told him he was wrong, of course. He did not point out in \nhis column that, yes, he had made an error. Had he read the 1983 \namendments, he would have known it is not a pay-as-you-go system. It is \na system designed now with a tax base to create a deliberate national \npool of savings with which to meet our future obligations.\n  Mr. Krauthammer says the amendment that Conrad and Dorgan killed \nwould have required a balanced budget by law--it would not be by law, \nof course. It would have to be by Constitution, unlike other such laws \nthat could not be changed by a movement of truth, by a cowardly \nCongress. ``It would have forced people like Conrad and Dorgan to stop \nscaring the electorate and buckle down to the real deficit reduction \nproblem.''\n  I wonder what Mr. Krauthammer would write with respect to buckling \ndown in 1993? We buckled down. In 1993, we passed the deficit reduction \npackage through this Chamber that raised some taxes that were \nunpopular. I understand that. It cut some spending that was unpopular. \nI understand that. It was an act to reduce the deficit of over $500 \nbillion, and the actual experience is over $600 billion in deficit \nreduction in 5 years.\n  Do you know something? We did not even get one accidental vote from \nthe other side of the aisle, Mr. Krauthammer's friends. You would \nexpect somebody to vote wrong by accident now and then. It took every \nsingle vote we could muster to win on that issue because it was \nunpopular, and we knew it. We had the courage to do what was necessary \nto reduce the deficit. We did not get one single vote from Mr. \nKrauthammer's friends.\n  So I say, when Mr. Krauthammer uses words like ``cowardice,'' and so \non, he might want to rethink who has exhibited courage in recent years, \nwho has decided that they are willing to do what is unpopular if it is \nright, in order to help their country.\n  Well, we will, of course, send another response to try to correct \nsome of the whoppers in Mr. Krauthammer's column. Again, I keep \nthinking that Mr. Krauthammer must believe that double-entry \nbookkeeping means you can use the same money twice. Of course, the \nfirst accounting course you take tells you that is not what double \nentry means. You cannot use the same money twice. There are some \nbookkeepers in America that have done that. They are now doing 4 years \nof hard tennis in minimum security prisons. You cannot use the same \nmoney twice. You cannot do it in businesses, and you cannot do it in \nthe Federal budget.\n  When I finished reading his column this morning, it reminded me of \nsomething Clement Freud's grandson said. Clement Freud's grandson said \nthis: ``When you hit someone over the head with a book and get a hollow \nsound, it does not mean the book was empty.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask my friend from North Dakota how \nmuch time he would like?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 10 minutes off the \nbill to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for his \ncourtesy, and I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his discussion \nof the latest Krauthammer column.\n  Let me just say that it is very apparent to me why Mr. Krauthammer is \na columnist and not an accountant, because he clearly does not get it. \nHe just does not understand why it is wrong to take Social Security \ntrust fund moneys to balance the Federal operating budget. He does not \nunderstand why it is wrong to take a dedicated trust fund and use it to \npay the other operating expenses of Government. But most people \nunderstand why that is wrong. Most people understand that you do not \ntake a trust fund and loot it in order to pay other expenses and then \nsay you have balanced the budget.\n  Mr. Krauthammer, in his latest work, indicates that the balanced \nbudget amendment is ``entirely silent on the issue.'' The issue he is \ntalking \n[[Page S4564]] about is taking trust funds and using them for the other \noperating expenses of Government. It makes me wonder if Mr. Krauthammer \nhas ever read the amendment that was before this body.\n  I brought along just one section of the balanced budget amendment \nthat was before this Chamber. It says very clearly. ``Total receipts \nshall include all receipts of the United States Government * * * total \noutlays shall include all outlays of the United States Government.''\n  By definition, this amendment was including the Social Security funds \nbecause they are receipts of the U.S. Government. And, of course, \nSocial Security is not contributing to the deficit. Social Security is \nin surplus.\n  So, by definition, Social Security surplus moneys would have been \nused, and used to balance the operating budget of the Federal \nGovernment. And those surpluses would have been used to pay other \nexpenses. That is precisely the point.\n  Mr. President, to say you are balancing the budget when you are using \ntrust fund moneys is a fraud. It reminds me of the Reverend Jim Bakker. \nDo you remember Rev. Jim Bakker, Jim and Tammy, that used to have the \nshow ``PTL'' on television? He was an evangelist, a television \nevangelist. Does anyone know where he has been for the last several \nyears?\n He has been in a Federal facility in Minnesota. He has been in a \nFederal jail. He has been there because he raised money for one purpose \nand used it for another, and that is called fraud.\n\n  That is precisely what is happening with the Social Security trust \nfunds. We are taking money from people's paychecks. We are telling them \nthat is going to be used to secure their retirement. We are taking that \nmoney and the part that is in surplus is being used to pay for other \noperating expenses of Government. The trust fund? There is no money in \nthe trust fund. IOU's are in the trust fund, but there is no money \nthere because we have spent it.\n  We are as guilty of fraud as Rev. Jim Bakker. And at some point the \nchickens are going to come home to roost in this country. To have put \nthat kind of flawed policy in the Constitution of the United States \nwould have been a profound mistake because then we would have had very \nlittle chance to change it.\n  Let me give an example of what is wrong with the Krauthammer \nthinking. Let us take a company that is earning $1 million a year, has \n$1 million of income but is spending $1.5 million a year. That company \nis experiencing losses of $500,000.\n  Now, of course, it could borrow from the retirement funds of its \nemployees and say that it is balancing the budget. That is the kind of \napproach that apparently Mr. Krauthammer would endorse. I do not think \nmany people in this country would think, if you were earning $1 million \na year as a company and were spending $1.5 million, and you were making \nup the difference by looting the trust fund of your employees, you \nwould balance the budget. But that is the policy that he endorses. That \nis the policy Mr. Krauthammer thinks makes sense. I think most people \nwould recognize you may have balanced cash against cash, but you have \nrun up a $500,000 liability. You owe it, and you are going to have to \npay it back or you are going to renege on your obligation.\n  Mr. President, that is what is wrong with the approach we are taking. \nThat is what is wrong with what we would have done if we would have put \nthat principle into the Constitution of the United States.\n  Mr. Krauthammer apparently belongs to the school of thought which \nbelieves that in order to save Social Security we must loot the Social \nSecurity trust funds. I do not belong to that school of thought. I \nthink that is a profound mistake.\n  Mr. Krauthammer has one thing right. One of the threats to Social \nSecurity is the debt that we are accumulating in this country. When we \nspend more than we take in, we are mortgaging the long-term future of \nthis country--no question about it. That is a threat to Social Security \njust as it is a threat to the economic security of the United States.\n  There is a second threat. The second threat to Social Security is the \nraiding of the Social Security trust funds. The reason we are running a \nsurplus now, and the reason we are going to be running surpluses for \nthe next 10 or 15 years is to prepare for the day the baby boom \ngeneration retires. That generation, which is twice as large in terms \nof people who are eligible to receive Social Security as the current \ngeneration, is going to put enormous pressure on the system. When we \nchanged the Social Security methodology in 1983, we changed it in order \nto prepare for the day when the baby boom generation retires. That is \nwhy we are running surpluses. That is why those surpluses ought to be \npreserved.\n  The notion that the only way to save Social Security is to loot its \ntrust funds is mere nonsense. That is the position Mr. Krauthammer \nendorses. I think he is entirely wrong in that proposition. I think the \npeople of this country have the common sense to reject that theory. I \nthink by all of the reaction we have received from the balanced budget \namendment debate the people of this country recognize we are on a \ncourse that cannot be sustained. It ought to be changed. Mr. \nKrauthammer might want to be a guardian at the gate of the gridlock of \nthe past, the policies of the past. Senator Dorgan and I do not choose \nto join him in that endeavor. We do not think defending the policies of \nthe past is defensible. There ought to be a change. To have enshrined \nthose failed policies in the Constitution of the United States would \nhave been an insult to the Framers of that document who put together, \nafter all, a method of operating for this Government that has made us \nthe envy of the world. That document has made this Nation the greatest \ncountry in human history. We should not tamper with it lightly. We \ncertainly should not enshrine in it a flawed policy, one that says you \nhave balanced the budget when you have looted trust funds in order to \ndo so. That is not a policy that belongs in the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4562-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4564-S4565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  COMMEMORATING GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Greek \nIndependence Day--a national day of celebration of Greek and American \ndemocracy. Tomorrow, on March 25, 1995, all people of Greek descent \nwill celebrate the 174th anniversary of the beginning of the revolution \nwhich freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire.\n  A historic bond exists between Greece and America, forged by our \nshared democratic heritage. America is truly indebted to the ancient \nGreeks for giving the world the first example of direct democracy. As \nthe solid stone of this neoclassically designed building provides a \nprotected place for our own democratic government to flourish, the \nphilosophical and democratic influences of the ancient Greeks provides \nthe inspiration. It is therefore fitting that Members of this Chamber \njoin in paying tribute to the long struggle for freedom that Greece \nendured.\n  On March 25, 1821, when Germanos, the archbishop of Patros, \nproclaimed Greek independence, another link between Greece and the \nUnited States was forged. The American revolution served as a model for \nthe Greek struggle for freedom and when the Declaration of \nIndependence, translated into Greek, served as the declaration of the \nend of the Greek struggle, a circle was completed.\n  The interconnection between Greek and American democracies lies not \nonly in the philosophical underpinnings of our Government, but in many \nareas of American life. Percy Bysshe Shelley once said, ``We are all \nGreeks! Our laws, our literature, our religion, our art, have their \nroots in Greece.'' The tremendous influence that Greece has had on \nAmerican life continues today through the activities of the vibrant \nGreek community in America. In every field--politics, entertainment, \nbusiness, and education--Greek-Americans continue to contribute to \nAmerican life.\n  In particular, I wish to pay a tribute to the Greek-American \ncommunity in New Jersey. Groups that are leaders in the New Jersey \nGreek community include: the Greek American Chamber of Commerce of New \nJersey, the Greek American Voters League of New Jersey, the Hellenic \nAmerican Bar Association of New Jersey, the Pan Gregorian Enterprises & \nFoundation, \n[[Page S4565]] P.G.E.I. of America Charitables Foundation, Inc., the \nCouncil Generals of Greek Cypriot, the Order of AHEPA and the Joint \nPublic Policy Committee of Hellenic American Women. On behalf of these \norganizations, the Greek community in New Jersey and all Americans of \nGreek descent, I am honored to pay tribute, on behalf of the Nation, to \nthe Greek community on the anniversary of their independence day.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use some of my leadership time to \nspeak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FOSTER TO BE SURGEON GENERAL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to state \nmy concern about the direction and tenor of the debate on the \nnomination of Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General.\n  I spoke on the floor a month ago about this nomination. At that time, \nI expressed hope that this debate could be restored to its proper \nperspective--an honest assessment of whether Dr. Henry Foster's skills \nfit the Nation's needs for the position of Surgeon General.\n  So far, Mr. President, that has not occurred.\n  First of all, there has not been much substantive discussion about \nthis nomination. At a time when many of the public health problems \nhistorically addressed by the Surgeon General are reaching crisis \nproportions, it seems that there should be more discussion about the \ncontributions Dr. Foster can make in this capacity and the urgency of \napproving his nomination.\n  Unfortunately, what little debate there has been has not centered on \nDr. Foster's qualifications, skills, and contributions to society. \nInstead, it has revolved around Dr. Foster's performance of a legal \nmedical procedure, and how many times he has performed it.\n  Little attention has been paid to the thousands of lives Dr. Foster \nhas brought into the world over his 35-year career, or the hundreds of \nlives he has saved.\n  Little attention has been paid to the evidence that supports \nPresident Clinton's evaluation that Dr. Henry Foster has much to \ncontribute as Surgeon General of the United States.\n  Do not be fooled into believing the evidence is lacking. Nothing can \nbe further from the truth.\n  Before being nominated to the post of Surgeon General, Dr. Foster was \nperhaps best known for his efforts in establishing the I Have A Future \nProgram. This teen pregnancy prevention program, which stresses \nabstinence and attempts to help teens understand the positive reasons \nfor delaying pregnancy, was selected by President Bush as one of his \nThousand Points of Light.\n  Listen to the words of Dr. Louis Sullivan, President Bush's Health \nand Human Services Secretary.\n\n       [The] I Have a Future [program] turns young people's lives \n     around . . . [it is] the kind of program that the country \n     needs.\n\n  Dr. Foster has pledged to focus on teen pregnancy prevention as \nSurgeon General. That cause certainly should be a national priority, \nand Dr. Foster would bring great experience and credibility to it.\n  Little attention has been paid to the stories of Dr. Foster's \ncommitment and heroism. Like the time he saved the life of the mayor's \nson when his wife developed complications with her pregnancy.\n  Or the time a pregnant patient of Dr. Foster's called him up in the \nmiddle of the night because she was bleeding, and Dr. Foster met her at \nthe hospital in his bedroom slippers.\n  Or the time Dr. Foster talked a young, pregnant and unmarried woman \nout of having an abortion. Her child later went on to become high \nschool valedictorian.\n  These are the elements that are missing in the debate over the \nSurgeon General nomination. These are the reasons Dr. Foster deserves \nevery consideration for this post.\n  It is my sincere hope that Dr. Foster will receive a fair hearing. It \nis unfair to judge a candidate before having heard all the facts. I \nhope that those who have reservations about the nomination will keep an \nopen mind until committee hearings are held.\n  I also hope that these hearings will be held sooner rather than \nlater. The Nation needs a Surgeon General.\n  Every day approximately 2,781 teenagers become pregnant.\n  Mr. President, this many teenagers become pregnant while we wait to \nconfirm a Surgeon General who plans to make teen pregnancy prevention \nthe centerpiece of his tenure in that post.\n  We should not delay action on this nomination. I urge the Chair of \nthe Labor Committee to schedule hearings on this issue as soon as \npossible and do everything within her power to ensure that Dr. Foster \nis given a full and fair hearing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, is there a time limit for morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been 10 minutes per Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4565-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4565-S4567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FARM POLICY REFORM\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, every year the President of the United \nStates is required by law to send an economic report not just to the \nCongress but to the people of the country. It is a very, very important \nreport. It provides us with the administration's assessment of where \nthe economy is and what needs to be done both to sustain economic \nrecovery and to adjust in certain areas.\n  There is a section in the President's economic report described as \nfarm policy reform. I would like to comment upon that here this \nafternoon in the time that I am allowed.\n  Mr. President, one of the first statements that this document says \nis:\n\n       Efficiency requires that farmers be given greater \n     opportunity to respond to marketing incentives, and the cost-\n     effective public policies used to correct market failures in \n     agriculture. Revising agriculture to meet better these \n     objectives will help unleash more of the innovative energy \n     that has long characterized American agriculture.\n\n  Mr. President, there is very little barrier between the farmer and \nthe marketplace today, notwithstanding a lot of the political rhetoric \nthat seems to imply that somehow agriculture is heavily subsidized. If \nagriculture was heavily subsidized, Mr. President, one would expect an \neconomic analysis to reveal very low rates of productivity. That is \ntypically what one sees.\n  If I subsidize somebody a great deal--we hear this in the welfare \ndebate--subsidize somebody a great deal, it is apt to encourage not \nincreased productivity, it encourages just the opposite.\n  If agriculture was heavily subsidized, one would expect to see very \nlow rates of productivity and would expect to see economic analysis, \nparticularly analysis that showed how the agriculture sector compared \nto other sectors of the U.S. economy and our international competitors, \nit would show that we are relatively unproductive. Just the opposite, \nMr. President.\n  Compared to our OECD competitors, agriculture is more productive than \ncomputers, more productive than automobiles, more productive than \nsteel, more productive than pharmaceuticals, more productive than \nchemicals, more productive than all other sectors of our economy.\n  This report, Mr. President, implies that the Government of the United \nStates of America somehow is standing in between farmers out there who \nwould like to be competitive and the market, and it just is not true.\n  The report, in my judgment, distorts what is actually in plain view \nout there in the countryside. The report says that ``The farm sector no \nlonger looms large in the macroeconomy.''\n  Now, that is based on a GAO analysis that showed that only 2 percent \nof the U.S. population is now in agriculture production. But 18 percent \nof all the jobs, according to this report, are either directly or \nindirectly related to agriculture production. So if farmers are not \nmaking money, if the profit shifts someplace else, Mr. President, these \nbusinesses are going to have a tough time making ends meet and, \n[[Page S4566]] thus, production in agriculture is still vital not just \nin the micro-sense but in the macro-sense of the entire U.S. economy.\n  Now, let me provide what I would have hoped this kind of report would \nhave provided. Instead of beginning with, I think, an incorrect \nidentification of what is going on in agriculture, let me provide those \nin America who are wondering what this farm program is all about with \nsome basic facts.\n  First, there are only 500,000 full-time farmers left in this country. \nThis report has a statement in here, a commonly applied statement, that \nagriculture production is increasingly concentrated. Well, you would \nthink--increasingly concentrated --does that mean that it is like \nautomobiles, where we have three? Is that like pharmaceuticals, where \nwe have 9 or 10? Is that like computers, where we have half a dozen? Is \nthat what we are talking about? No.\n  There are 500,000 fully competitive, relatively small businesses--\neven a big farm is relatively small, Mr. President. A farm that an \neconomist might describe as a large farm might not have as much revenue \nas an average McDonald's restaurant, for gosh sakes. So these are very \ncompetitive businesses.\n  Indeed, if you ask a Nebraska farmer, ``Honestly, what is your idea \nof an enlightened policy?'', they will say, ``We pray for bad weather \nin Iowa.'' Well, you know, we do not honestly do that.\n  But the truth is, it is very competitive. We are competing out there \nnot just with each other, but we are competing throughout the world. We \nwould not be this productive were we not faced with the blessing of \nhaving this large number, still relatively large number, of full-time, \nhighly competitive small businesses, family-operated businesses, \nmostly, that are manufacturing food products.\n  Now, one of the common things that I very often hear, not just in \nWashington, but I hear in Grand Island or Hastings and other \ncommunities in Nebraska, they will say, ``Well, why do we have to have \nany kind of a Government program?''\n  Well, there are a couple of reasons that we do this. This report \nhere, by the way, traces it all the way back to the 1920's and 1930's. \nIt says in this report, ``Today's agriculture commodity support \nprograms are rooted in landmark New Deal legislation that followed the \nagricultural depression of the 1920's and 1930's.'' Again, feeding a \nmisperception that this is a 60-year old program, started by Franklin \nRoosevelt, no longer needed; modern times no longer needs this sort of \nthing.\n  Well, Mr. President, one thing today is true that was true in 1930. \nAnd Americans who wonder why we have a program need to take this into \nconsideration. Unlike other manufacturing businesses that I have \nreferenced--automobiles, textiles, computers--we manufacture food out \nof doors. You might think that is kind of a silly and simple \nobservation, but as long as we manufacture food out of doors we are \nalways going to be dependent upon God to give us good weather. If we do \nnot have good weather, if we have drought, we do not produce food. It \nis as simple as that, Mr. President.\n  You think, well, that is not a big deal.\n  Well, in 1987, I remember just after I left the office of Governor \nand went back into business, in 1987, swirling in the country was this \nbig debate: What are we going to do with these enormous reserves that \nbuilt up after the 1985 farm program was enacted? It is too costly--\n$125 billion a year, I believe it was. What are we going to do with \nthese large reserves?\n  We had a drought in 1987. Then in 1988, we had another drought. I was \ncampaigning at the time for the U.S. Senate. I almost remember the day \nwhen the American people stopped talking about these excess reserves \nand they started to say to themselves, ``Oh, my gosh. Maybe we do not \nhave enough inventory.'' Suddenly, the reserves became an inventory.\n  Now, I say that to Americans who are saying, ``Is this worth it?\"\n  We have an $8 billion program, the Commodity Credit Corporation \nprogram. There are $450 billion worth of food purchases in the United \nStates. So you really pay $458 billion, $8 billion through farm price \ndeficiency payments and $450 billion at the supermarket.\n  The reason that this reserve issue is important, I say to consumers, \nis because--I will tell you, as somebody who represents about 55,000 of \nthose full-time farmers in the State of Nebraska, if we cut this \nprogram back too much and listen to the rhetoric, both Republican and \nDemocrat, around here, it leads me to believe that may happen. You may \nfind this Senator on the floor saying to the American consumer, no \nlonger are we going to maintain a reserve, because that reserve serves \nthe American consumer, Mr. President. It does not serve the producer.\n  In spite of what this report says, that reserve is there because the \nAmerican consumer is concerned about what happens if we find ourselves \nshort of food. You say, ``Well, that's an exaggeration.'' It is not.\n  In 1993--and again, this report would lead you to believe that farm \npolicy does not have any impact at all on macroeconomic policies--in \n1993, the Secretary of Agriculture, at that time Secretary Espy, was \nhaving to make a decision: What should our reserve program be? Should \nwe set a 5-percent reserve, a 10-percent reserve, a 0-percent reserve? \nWhat should our reserve be?\n  The farmers in Nebraska, the farmers in Iowa, but particularly in \nNebraska where we are polled a lot, said, ``Set it at 10 percent \nacreage reduction program.''\n  Secretary Espy said out loud and in public, ``I am going to set a 0-\npercent acreage reduction program.'' Go back and look at what Secretary \nEspy said. He said:\n\n       I'm afraid if I set a 10-percent ARP that my food prices \n     are going to be higher, and if food prices get higher, \n     inflation comes back in the economy, high interest rates \n     could come back in the economy and this entire recovery could \n     get shut down.\n\n  That was the economic analysis done by the administration. You say, \n``Well, OK, so he did that, what is the impact?'' It is a big impact. \nFarmers were asking for a 10-percent acreage reduction program. They \ngot a 0-percent acreage reduction program, and here is the effect:\n  In 1993, the corn payments under CCC in the State of Nebraska were \n$600 million. In 1994, they dropped to $160 million. This year they are \nprobably in the $700 million range again. You say, ``My gosh, why are \nthey going back and forth? Why is it 600, 160, 700?'' The answer is, \nthe price is impacted by the decision that the Secretary makes to set \nthe reserve. When the Secretary set the reserve at 0 percent, farmers \nwanted 10 percent. When he set the reserve at 10 percent, we produced a \nbumper crop in 1994, along with tremendous weather that we had in 1994, \nwe have lower prices and higher deficiencies in 1995.\n  So the higher budget exposure in 1995, which would probably be $700 \nmillion in my State, is not something I asked for. I asked for a 10 \npercent reserve which probably would have cost the taxpayers $160 \nmillion again. But USDA says, ``No, we're going to go with the 0-\npercent reserve.'' The cost to the taxpayers ends up being four times \ngreater, and guess who gets blamed? The farmer. The farmers in Nebraska \nare accused of wanting more welfare. The farmers in Nebraska are \naccused of wanting more money from the Government. Mr. President, \nAmerican taxpayers should understand that the farmers were asking for a \nhigher reserve which would have resulted in lower payments by the \nFederal Government.\n  Now it may be, I must say, that this kind of language, and others \nthat I have heard, will result this year in deficiency payments being \ncut back. Perhaps the permission granted to this program is going to be \npulled out if we change it radically. Mr. President, if we change it \nradically, consumers need to understand that this representative for \nAmerican farmers is going to come to the floor and say we ought to get \nout of the reserve business altogether. No more reserve for the \nAmerican consumer, no more holding food back on behalf of the American \nconsumer, and we will just let the market set the prices. There will be \ntimes, as a consequence of that, when the price ends up being much \nhigher.\n  This is not the only area where increasingly we come down and hear \nthis mantra: Well, 60 years of failure, 40 years of failure. You hear \nit a lot about welfare today. You hear it a lot about other programs. I \nheard the chairman of I guess it is called the Health and \n[[Page S4567]] Economic Opportunity Committee. They renamed it over on \nthe House side. The committee chairman, Representative Goodling, stood \non the floor of the House of Representatives the other evening--I \nwatched on C-SPAN--and he said, ``Just name me one thing this Federal \nGovernment of ours does well. Just name me one.''\n  I wish that he was a Senator in some way so in unlimited debate we \nhad an opportunity to challenge that. I would have said, ``Senator \nGoodling, how about you, are you one good thing? Are you efficient and \neffective? Because, if you are not, get out of here, resign and let \nsomebody else take your job. If the answer is yes, then at least we \nfound one.''\n  Then I would pursue it.\n  How about your staff, buddy? They work about 16 hours a day. Are they \nefficient and effective? Are the taxpayers getting their money's worth \nout of your staff? How about those folks over at NIH trying to find a \ncure for AIDS or cancer? Are you getting your money's worth? How about \nthose folks up in the Endeavor a week ago exploring space? Are you \ngetting your money's worth there?\n  I must say, Mr. President, I think as we come and debate, \nparticularly as we are trying to find ways to balance the Federal \nbudget and trying to find ways to restore America's confidence in \nGovernment, we ought to take care not to throw out those things and, in \nfact, to work it and take care not to throw out those things that, in \nfact, are lifting a little bit of hope in the country.\n  I find, as well, a tendency to blame the wrong people, blaming \nfarmers for the farm program, while farmers are arguing for something \nthat would cost taxpayers less; blaming the poor, for gosh sakes, for \ntheir own behavior. We know that the nonpoor behavior is having some \ndifficulty as well.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor because I did not like the \nlanguage in the President's economic report to the Nation. I hope, \nthough I am not overly optimistic given what I have seen thus far, I \nhope that we are, in 1995, able to write not just a farm program but a \nhealth program, a children's program, an education program, a welfare \nprogram that takes into account what is going on in the countryside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Nebraska leaves the \nSenate floor, I would like to respond through the Chair to my friend \nthe Congressman from the State of Pennsylvania that I do believe \nwithout any question that we do have in this body a person who is \nefficient and effective, and I believe the State of Nebraska is \ncertainly getting its money's worth from the junior Senator from the \nState of Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4565-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4567-S4568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NEVADA PARTNERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we come to this floor often, and most of the \nthings we talk about are in a negative sense, whether it is the farm \nprogram, taxes, delinquency, schools, students, teachers, health care, \nfloods, earthquakes, deficits, lost species, endangered species, all \ntypes of crimes--murders, rapes, robberies, battering of women--\nunemployment.\n  Mr. President, I am here today to talk about something on a positive \nnote, something that has taken place in the State of Nevada that is now \nto the point where we can talk about it as being effective and having \nworked.\n  We all know that work is the cornerstone upon which we can do \nsomething about welfare reform. I have long been a supporter of a \nwelfare-to-work program. I, with a couple of my colleagues in this \nbody, sponsored legislation that would have modern-day American welfare \nprograms handled like they were handled during and after the \nDepression, programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works \nProgress Administration, where people who needed Government help would \nwork in exchange for that help.\n  That legislation--five pilot programs--passed the House and the \nSenate and was sent to the President. Because this very important \nlegislation was part of an overall tax bill that President Bush did not \nlike, he vetoed the legislation. I am sorry that our bill was part of \nthe tax bill because, on its face, I am sure he would not have vetoed \nit. But those are the kinds of programs that we need to recognize have \nworked in the past and will work again if we allow them to come into \nbeing.\n  As we continue to debate these welfare-to-work proposals, Mr. \nPresident, I think it is important that we, as an example, look to the \nprivate sector, programs there that we know are already successful, and \nare placing people into the work force. A program in Nevada like that \nis called Nevada Partners.\n  Nevada Partners came into being after the Rodney King riots that took \nplace in southern California and in Las Vegas, NV. We had significant \ncivil unrest in Las Vegas, and the community joined together to find \nout what could be done so that this would not take place in the future. \nThis effort was led by Gov. Robert Miller, who was then Governor and is \nstill Governor of the State of Nevada. This was in 1992. He was the \nguiding light, along with the mayor of Las Vegas, Jan Laverty Jones, a \nnumber of State legislators, and others, to set up a program that has \nworked very well.\n  Nevada Partners works with business, industry, and government, to \nprovide job readiness, training, and placement to the at-risk and \ndisadvantaged and unemployed in southern Nevada. Too often, we have \npeople who we train, but they are trained for jobs that do not exist or \njobs that they cannot find. Well, this program includes all them all.\n  I want to take a minute here to talk about the reason this program \ncame into being. It was as a result of the generosity of one man by the \nname of Kirk Kerkorian. He is a man who came from, to say the least, \nhumble beginnings, a person who has made it on his own, and who is now, \nit is no secret, one of the richest men in America. Kirk Kerkorian has \nbeen a very successful businessman all over the United States, but \nespecially in Nevada. It was as a result of his generous contribution \nof a million dollars that this program was able to get started. The \nprogram received its funding from an organization that he established \ncalled the LINCY Foundation. Nevada Partners now is wholly funded by \nthe private sector. It receives no Government funding, not a single \npenny.\n  Since its inception, Nevada Partners has placed more than 2,200 \napplicants into the work force. This is not a statistic used to make a \nreport to some Government agency just to look good. These are 2,200 \npeople who are actually working now and who were not working \npreviously. As part of their job readiness training, participants with \nNevada Partners must take a 2-week class focusing on personal success, \npre-employment and post-employment issues such as stress management, \nhygiene, dressing for success, interviewing techniques, resume writing, \nfilling out an application, and what to expect from an employer.\n  Remember, Mr. President, many of these people are people who have \nnever worked and if, in fact, they have worked, it has been \nunsuccessful, or they would not be out of work now, most of the time. \nIn addition, Nevada Partners, in collaboration with the Training \nStation, which is a private sector computer training school, offers a \n3-week computer fundamentals course designed to equip the trainee with \nthe skills necessary to obtain positions requiring some computer \nliteracy.\n  What is unique about Nevada Partners is that this program not only \nassists those on public assistance, but--and this is important--it \nhelps many avoid the welfare rolls. It has been successful in that we \nhave taken people who are on welfare and put them into the work force. \nBut it has also taken people who are on the verge of going on welfare \nand put them to work.\n  This program deals especially with young people. It recognizes the \nimportance of reaching out to our young people to break the cycle of \ndependency. That is why, Mr. President, we must be concerned about the \nsummer jobs programs that have taken such a hit in the other body. I \nwas happy to see in the original markups over here that the committees \nof jurisdiction within the Appropriations Committee have not treated \nthem accordingly. I think that is good.\n  We must reach out to youth. Mr. President, the Youth Employment for \nthe Summer Program that is part of \n[[Page S4568]] this Nevada Partners Program targets youths ages 16 to \n21. This program, which is known as the YES Program, is a summer jobs \nprogram offering a series of workshops designed to help applicants to \ngain an understanding of the tools and skills necessary to obtain \nemployment. Working with local employers who have committed to \nproviding summer opportunities, Nevada Partners offers these young \npeople critical exposure to professional environments, as well as the \nopportunity to become acquainted with community role models.\n  Mr. President, I had the good fortune many years ago, when I \npracticed law, to be one of the attorneys in my law firm representing \nthe interests of Kirk Kerkorian and his family. He has done a lot of \nthings of which he is very proud. He created thousands and thousands of \njobs in America. But there is nothing that he is any more proud of than \nwhat has happened here with Nevada Partners. As a result of his \ninvestment, we now have over 2,200 people working. And from the time \nthese remarks were outlined for me, we have a lot more. The number is \nunknown.\n  One of Nevada Partners' most compelling programs--perhaps a model for \nwelfare reform--is the Women in Transition Program. Women in Transition \nprovides 6 weeks of in-depth transition training in addition to task-\noriented counseling provided by the University of Nevada-Las Vegas \nmasters of social work interns. Focusing on empowerment issues such as \ndomestic violence, evaluating and selecting child care, and women in \nthe work force, this pilot project is providing an alternative to \npublic assistance by successfully placing women in the work force.\n  The key ingredient to the success of Nevada Partners is the \ncommitment and participation of the private sector. Private sector \ninvolvement allows Nevada Partners and its participants to respond more \nquickly to changes in the business climate than many Government \nprograms allow. Moreover, the private sector can easily and readily \nassist in identifying real job opportunities and has a vested interest \nin ensuring new employees become trained team members as quickly as \npossible. Here is one of the good things that comes from programs like \nthis. More than 80 businesses, including hotels, casinos, banks, and \nutilities are consistently providing employment opportunities for \nNevada Partners' applicants.\n  Programs such as Nevada Partners provide an invaluable service to \nsouthern Nevada and all of its communities. Providing individuals with \nwork greatly enhances their self-esteem, their sense of responsibility \nand citizenship. Employment is a key factor, as we know, in reducing \ndrug use, crime, teen pregnancy, and other social ills that affect all \nof America. This program saves untold amounts of money in our criminal \njustice system, our welfare system, and our educational system.\n  Mr. President, I believe that people want to lead productive lives, \nnot collect handouts. I think it is programs like this that we, the \nGovernment, can use as a model to develop successful welfare-to-work \nprograms. I look forward to the debate that is coming soon dealing with \nwelfare and to talking with my colleagues about the program that has \nworked in Nevada, a program that we can use to help formulate what we \nneed to do to reform welfare on the Federal level.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nensuing months to formulate welfare-to-work proposals that include and \nincorporate programs that are working--programs like Nevada Partners.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Committee on Armed Services has \n     conducted a brief review of the military implications of the \n     Convention on Conventional Weapons (Treaty Document 103-25). \n     We understand that the Administration has requested the \n     Senate to provide its advice and consent to ratification at \n     the earliest possible time, so that the United States may \n     participate in the Review Conference scheduled to begin \n     September 25, 1995.\n       The Committee's understanding is that for humanitarian \n     purposes the Convention is intended to restrict the use of \n     specific types of conventional weapons in armed conflicts, \n     specifically, landmines and booby-traps.\n       Like the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \n     Armed Services has concerns about the Treaty, which include:\n       (1) The effectiveness of the Convention having been \n     ratified by only 42 States Parties;\n       (2) Future amendments to the Convention, that are meant to \n     improve its effectiveness; and,\n       (3) The impact of Protocol III on NATO operations.\n\n\n                      effectiveness of convention\n       We understand that the Convention is part of a broader \n     program of humanitarian conventions to restrict the \n     production, use, and export of landmines, which the \n     Administration would like to have other countries join, to \n     reduce civilian casualties.\n       The United States military services have identified \n     landmines as a significant threat to future force projections \n     and military operations other than war, including \n     peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance. The use of \n     landmines in internal conflicts in undeveloped countries is \n     particularly acute in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. \n     Training and education assistance for humanitarian landmine \n     clearing activities, as well\n      as development of technology for mine detection, \n     classification, mapping and neutralization, is being \n     provided to these regions by the Department of Defense and \n     the military services.\n       The Committee strongly urges the Administration to \n     encourage the countries in the regions in which the United \n     States is providing assistance in humanitarian landmine \n     activities, to ratify, and adhere to the Convention. \n     Additionally, the Committee urges the Administration to seek \n     assistance from the other parties to the Convention, during \n     the Review Conference, and in bilateral discussions with non-\n     parties, to encourage the undeveloped nations of Africa, Asia \n     and Latin America to ratify the Convention.\n\n\n                  Future Amendments to the Convention\n\n       The Committee understands that the Administration intends \n     to offer amendments to the Convention during the September \n     1995 Review Conference with regard to establishing a \n     verification and compliance commission, to tighten \n     restrictions on the use of landmines, and to ensure exclusion \n     of command-detonated Claymore mines from such restrictions.\n       The Committee enjoins the Administration to consult closely \n     with the relevant congressional committees prior to the \n     tabling and negotiation of amendments to the Convention.\n\n\n                    NATO Operations and protocol III\n\n       The United States is concerned about restrictions on the \n     use of air-delivered incendiaries in Protocol III, from both \n     a military and humanitarian perspective, and as such, the \n     Administration did not submit it to the Senate for its advice \n     and consent to ratification.\n       During a briefing on the Convention with the Administration \n     interagency team, it was brought to the Committee's attention \n     that with the exception of France, all other countries \n     ratifying the Convention accepted Protocol III.\n       The Committee is concerned about the impact on NATO \n     operations resulting from ratification of Protocol III by a \n     number of our alliance partners.\n\n\n                        Committee Recommendation\n\n       The Committee has reviewed the Convention on Conventional \n     Weapons Convention Resolution of Ratification approved by the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations on March 22, 1995. With the \n     following concerns noted, the Committee agrees with the \n     Foreign Relations Committee's actions on this Treaty.\n       The Committee is concerned about the Administration's plans \n     for amendments to the Convention, particularly the \n     establishment of a Commission. The Committee believes it is \n     important to ensure that a large, expensive bureaucracy is \n     not established and that the precedent-setting nature of an \n     enforcement commission must be carefully considered.\n       Second, the Committee believes that command-detonated \n     Claymore-type mines must be excluded from the coverage of any \n     future amendments intended to tighten restrictions on the use \n     of landmines.\n       We have consulted with all Members of the Committee on the \n     views, recommendations, and understandings contained in this \n     report.\n       We are pleased to advise you of the Committee's advice and \n     consent to ratification of this Convention.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sam Nunn,\n       Ranking Member.\n     Strom Thurmond,\n       Chairman.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4568-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4569-S4570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

A bill to authorize extension of time limitation for a FERC-\nissued hydroelectric license; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n            ferc-issued license authorization extension act\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which \nwould allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend a \nlicense already granted to the Mount Hope pumped storage project. It is \nmy understanding that the FERC has no objection to this extension and \nthat the agency itself would grant the extension, if it were not \nstatutorily prohibited from doing so.\n  I am very pleased to have Senator Lautenberg as a cosponsor on this \nlegislation.\n  The Mt. Hope project is an advanced pumped-storage hydroelectric \nplant. It will be constructed on an existing industrial site that has \nbeen active for almost 300 years. It will be largely underground, once \nit is established, and should have a very limited environmental impact.\n  This project will cost $1.8 billion to construct and will be financed \nentirely by the private sector. It is estimated that this single \nproject will create up to 1,300 jobs during construction and provide \nabout $20 million annually in property taxes.\n  Mr. President, the project's existing license will expire in August, \n1996. When the license was originally requested and granted in the \nearly 1990's, the sponsors presumed that the financing would be \ncomplete and construction underway by 1996, as required. Unfortunately, \nthe extended economic recession intervened. Because of the general \neconomic climate and the difficulty of financing any project of this \nmagnitude, the start-up date has slipped.\n  Normally, I am very hesitant to intervene in any way in a regulatory \nprocess. However, since I understand that the FERC has no objections \nand will support this extension, I am willing to move ahead. I also \nunderstand that the Congressman representing this district, Rodney \nFrelinghuysen, is preparing companion legislation.\n  When the FERC granted the original license, they required public \nhearings and an extensive environmental analysis. While I understand \nthat there is substantial local support for this project, this \nlegislation will now be the subject of additional hearings. Before \nagreeing to move the legislation in the Senate, I will weigh carefully \nany new comments or concerns about the project and I will be contacting \nlocal community members to gauge the level of their enthusiasm and \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the bill \nprinted following these remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding the time limitation of section 13 of the \n     Federal Power Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \n     upon the request of the licensee for FERC Project No. 9401 is \n     authorized, in accordance with the good faith, due diligence, \n     and public interest requirements of section 13 and the \n     Commission's procedures under such section, to extend until \n     August 3, 1999, the time required for the licensee to \n     commence the construction of such project. This section shall \n     take effect for the project upon the expiration of the \n     extension (issued by the Commission under section 13) of the \n     period required for commencement of construction of such \n     project.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Graham, and Mr. \n        Murkowski):\n  S. 612. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \na hospice care pilot program for the Department of Veterans Affairs; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                  veterans' hospice care services act\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in the spirit of strengthening \nour commitment to provide a comprehensive package of health care \nbenefits to veterans eligible for care in the VA health care system, I \nam today introducing a bill that would require VA to conduct a hospice \ncare pilot program to determine how best to provide hospice care \nservices to terminally ill veterans. I am proud that Senators Daschle, \nGraham, and Murkowski have joined with me as original cosponsors. As \nthe number of veterans who are elderly or have terminal illnesses \ncontinues to grow, the need and demand for VA hospice care is likely to \nincrease. We must stay ahead of the surge and explore the various ways \nto provide such care, so our veterans and their families will have the \nbest choices available to them.\n  Our legislation is derived from S. 1141, which I sponsored and which \nwas incorporated into the committee bill, S. 1030, of the 103d \nCongress. Though S. 1030 passed the Senate, it did not pass the House. \nThe bill also builds upon S. 1358 of the 102d Congress which Senator \nGraham introduced on June 24, 1991, and the Senate passed on October \n16, 1991.\n  Although VA has expanded and improved hospice care services over the \npast 4 years, it continues to fall short of the goals we envisioned. \nThus we feel compelled to introduce the Veterans' Hospice Care Services \nAct of 1995.\n\n\n                         summary of provisions\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation would expand comprehensive VA hospice \ncare programs and promote VA research on hospice care. The bill would \namend chapter 17 of title 38 to establish a new subchapter VII, the \nprovisions of which would:\n  First, require VA, during the period beginning on October 1, 1995, \nand ending on December 31, 2000, to conduct a pilot program in order to \nassess the desirability of furnishing hospice care services to \nterminally ill veterans, and determine the most effective and efficient \nmeans of furnishing such services.\n  Second, require VA to furnish hospice care services under the pilot \nprogram to any veteran who has a life expectancy of 1 year or less, as \ncertified by a VA physician and who is entitled to VA hospital care, \neligible for and receiving VA hospital or nursing home care, eligible \nfor and receiving care in a community nursing home under a VA contract, \nor eligible for and receiving care in a State veterans home for which \nVA is making per diem payments to offset the costs of that care.\n  Third, specify that the hospice care services that VA must provide to \nveterans under the pilot program are: The services to which Medicare \nbeneficiaries are entitled under the Medicare's hospice care benefit, \nand personal care services, including care or services relating to \nactivities of daily living, such as dressing, personal hygiene, \nfeeding, and housekeeping.\n  [[Page S4575]] Fourth, require the Secretary to establish hospice \ncare demonstration projects that would provide these services at not \nfewer than 15 but mote than 30 VA medical centers [VAMC's] by one of \nthese means: A hospice operated by a VAMC, a non VA hospice under \ncontract with a VAMC and pursuant to which the VA facility furnishes \nany necessary inpatient services, or a non-VA facility furnishes any \nnecessary inpatient services.\n  Fifth, require that each of the three means for furnishing hospice \ncare services be used at not fewer than five VAMC's.\n  Sixth, require the Secretary to ensure, to the maximum extent \nfeasible, that VAMC's selected to conduct demonstration projects under \nthe pilot program include facilities that: Are located in urban areas \nand rural areas, encompass the full range of affiliations between \nVAMC's and medical schools, operate and maintain various numbers of \nbeds, and meet any additional criteria or standards that the Secretary \nmay deem relevant or necessary.\n  Seventh, provide that the amount paid by VA or a non-VA hospice under \na hospice care services contract generally may not exceed the amount \nthat would be paid to that hospice under the Medicare hospice benefit, \nand authorize the Secretary to pay an amount in excess of the Medicare \nreimbursement rate, if the Secretary determines, on a case-by-case \nbasis, that the Medicare rate would not adequate compensate the hospice \nfor the costs associated with furnishing necessary care to a terminally \nill veteran.\n  Eighth, require the Secretary to designate not fewer than 10 VAMC's \nthat would function as a control group and furnish a less comprehensive \nrange of hospice care services to terminally ill veterans that the \nrange that VAMC's participating in the pilot program must provide, by \nVA personal providing one or more hospice care services to veterans at \na VAMC, or VA personal monitoring the furnishing by non-VA provider of \none or more hospice care services to veterans.\n  Ninth, require the Secretary to ensure, to the maximum extent \npracticable, that terminally ill veterans receive information regarding \ntheir eligibility, if any, for Medicare's hospice care benefit.\n  Tenth, require the Secretary, not later than September 30, 1996, and \non an annual basis thereafter, until October 1, 2001, to submit \nperiodic written reports to the House and Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs about the pilot program.\n  Eleventh, require the Under Secretary for Health, not later than \nAugust 1, 1999, to submit to the House and Senate Committees on \nVeterans' Affairs a detailed final report on the pilot program, \nincluding an assessment of the desirability of furnishing hospice care \nservices to terminally ill veterans, an assessment of the optimal means \nof furnishing hospice care services to terminally ill veterans, and his \nrecommendations, if any, for additional legislation regarding such \ncare.\n  Twelth, clarify that the pilot program would not preclude VA from \nfurnishing hospice care services at VAMC's not participating in the \npilot program or the control group.\n\n\n                               background\n\n  Clearly, terminally ill veterans need an alternative to customary, \ncurative care, and the Department of Veterans Affairs has made steady \nprogress in meeting the demand.\n  However, VA headquarters officials have given only general guidance \nto VAMC's regarding the types of hospice care services they must \nprovide and the manner in which they must provide them. Not \nsurprisingly, significant variations exist in the manner in which \nVAMC's provide these services. Only 39 of 171 VAMC's operate their own \nhospice units. These units are freestanding buildings or separate units \nwhere a homelike atmosphere is created. Other VAMC's provide hospice in \nunits that are converted patient rooms where cure-oriented care is \nadministered adjacent to the hospice rooms. Still other VAMC's only \nprovide some hospice services such as caregiver counseling and pain \nmanagement. Many offer only an assessment of a terminally ill veterans' \nneeds and referral to a non-VA hospice.\n  Neither uniformity nor marked variation in the provision of VA \nhospice care may be the answer. Each local area may need to tailor its \nprograms and services to the unique needs of the veterans they serve, \nas well as the delivery modalities in their areas.\n  Yet I continue to believe that there are important questions that \nneed to be asked and answered about the ways to provide such care. For \nexample, some claim that we can best meet terminally ill veterans' \nneeds by integrating hospice concepts into mainstream care for \nterminally ill persons. Others believe that because most VAMC's are \naffiliated with medical schools that emphasize technology-intensive, \ncurative interventions, veterans would be better served if VA \ncontracted with community hospice providers. There may not be only one \ncorrect approach, and that is fine. But I do know that we must address \nthese difficult questions if we truly care about meeting terminally ill \nveterans' needs.\n  The pilot program this legislation envisions could be of great help \nin assessing these concerns. The bill calls for VA to establish hospice \ndemonstration projects at 15 to 30 VAMC's that will provide a \ncomprehensive range of hospice care services. Ten other VAMC's will \nconstitute a control group and offer a less comprehensive range of \nhospice services. In essence, an experiment will be set up, whereby \nconsistent data can be generated and valuable information extrapolated. \nThis study will help health care providers identify veterans most \nlikely to benefit from that program and tailor the program's services \nto meet their needs.\n  This year's bill, like S. 1030 of the 103d Congress, contains a \nprovision that explicitly states that VA can continue to provide \nhospice care services at any VAMC, which would guarantee that no \nveteran will lose access to hospice care as a result of the pilot \nprogram. We certainly do not want VA to eliminate its existing hospice \nprograms. Rather, we seek to ensure that VA studies and learns from \nthem.\n                               conclusion\n  Mr. President, many terminally ill veterans do not want to spend \ntheir last days in a hospital environment receiving high technology, \ncurative care. These veterans, who have served our country with honor \nand dignity, choose a different type of environment, one where pain \nmanagement and emotional support are the focus. They are veterans like \nTom, a West Virginian whose plight the committee learned of in 1991. \nThe executive director of the Hospice of Huntington, WV, Charlene \nFarrell, told the committee that while Tom was in the hospital, \nsuffering from cancer, this depressed veteran asked that the drapes be \nclosed so he could sit in darkness. Eventually, his daughters decided \nto use their modest resources to purchase hospice care from a non-VA \nprovider, because their father longed for the type of care and support \nthat a hospital simply cannot offer. We owe veterans like Tom nothing \nless than the best hospice care our Nation can provide. The Veterans \nHospice Care Services Act of 1995 will help us meet our obligation to \nthese brave men and women.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 612\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nconduct pilot programs in order to evaluate the feasibility of \nparticipation of the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system \nin the health care systems of States that have enacted health care \nreform; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n             va state health care reform pilot program act\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, although the efforts of the \nlast Congress to provide national health care reform failed, many \nStates have already enacted reform legislation. These States have taken \nthe first, important steps on the road to universal coverage. I applaud \nthe efforts of these courageous legislators. They are giving their \ncitizens health care security. These State plans provide Congress with \nthe perfect opportunity to learn from their successes and to study the \neffects of reform on existing Federal medical programs, including the \nVA medical system.\n  The VA medical system--the Nation's largest health care system--\ncannot participate fully in health care reform efforts in specific \nStates because current Federal law makes it impossible for VA \nfacilities to do so. This deprives VA of the kinds of experiences and \ninformation it needs to thrive under national health care reform. If \nthis situation continues, we will miss a valuable opportunity to study \nthe effects of reform.\n  At a February 9, 1994, Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs' hearing \non VA participation in State health care reform, then-Acting Deputy \nUnder Secretary of Health, Elwood Headley, M.D., stated that as a \npublic health care system, VA lacks experience in participating in a \ncompetitive environment.\n  Mr. President, I believe VA will do well in a national plan under \nwhich costs are controlled and coverage is expanded for all Americans, \nbecause VA already operates within a fixed budget. VA must, however, \nhave the opportunity to learn what kinds of changes are needed in the \nVA medical system as a whole.\n  It is in the spirit of improving VA medical services for veterans \nthat I am today introducing a bill that would require VA to conduct a \npilot health care reform program. This VA State Health Care Reform \nPilot Program would enable VA to participate in the health care reform \nprograms of several States. I am delighted to be joined in sponsoring \nthis bill by Committee members Bob Graham, Dan Akaka, Byron Dorgan, \nFrank Murkowski, and Jim Jeffords, and by Senators Tom Daschle, Patrick \nLeahy, Patty Murray, and Paul Wellstone.\n  At the committee's February 9, 1994, hearing, John Bollinger, deputy \nexecutive director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, testified that \n``the pilot programs will give VA in those states the opportunity to \nbecome a full participant in the health care system. It will also \nprovide valuable experience to draw upon when the full VA system faces \nthe same challenges in the context of national health care reform.'' I \nagree wholeheartedly.\n\n\n                         summary of provisions\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation would enable VA to evaluate the most \nappropriate means of participating in reformed State health care \nsystems, providing invaluable information to help them prepare for \nnational health care reform.\n  This bill would give VA the authority to select up to five States \nwith comprehensive health benefit plans in place, or where such plans \nare imminent, to participate in the pilot program for a period of 2 \nyears. The bill would authorize VA facilities in the selected States to \noffer free comprehensive care to all compensable service-connected \nveterans and to all veterans with incomes below the current levels that \napply to inpatient care.\n  The legislation would grant the Secretary authority to waive certain \nlaws and regulations that could interfere with the ability of VA \nfacilities to participate in State health care reform activities.\n  This legislation would give VA medical center directors flexibility \nin allocating their resources, except with respect to regional \nprograms, such as spinal cord injury services, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, blind rehabilitation, and substance abuse programs, which are \nfunded from central office.\n  The bill would give the head of the VA in selected States--the VA \nhealth system director--the authority to contract out for medical \nservices without prior review from VA central office. \n[[Page S4578]] For other services, VA facilities within the State would \nhave the authority to enter into contracts below $250,000 without prior \nreview by central office. Contracts above $250,000 would be reviewed by \ncentral office, but would automatically be approved if central office \ndid not make a decision within 30 days. This would give local VA \nfacilities the autonomy they need to increase their number of providers \nin a timely manner.\n  This bill would also give local VA facilities more flexibility in the \nhiring process, by extending authority that is currently available for \nhiring certain title 38 personnel to the hiring of all staff. This is \nintended to help VA facilities hire the best possible employees in a \ntimely manner.\n  The bill would exempt VA facilities in the pilot program from FTE \ncuts. Arbitrary FTE cuts could make it impossible for VA facilities to \ncompete under health care reform.\n  The legislation would give the participating VA facilities the \nauthority to carry over leftover funding from one year to the next. \nAgain, this would help VA facilities make better use of limited funds.\n  Finally, this legislation would give VA the authority to collect \nemployer contributions and other third-party payments for noncore \nveterans who choose VA health care. These payments would enable VA \nfacilities to provide care for all veterans who choose VA health care, \nnot just core veterans.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, VA needs legislative relief from restrictions in \ncurrent law which, although enacted for good and appropriate reasons, \ncould prevent VA facilities from competing as providers in certain \nStates. The major obstacle which must be overcome is that VA facilities \ncannot qualify as providers under some state plans because of current \neligibility requirements. Under various State proposals, all citizens \nwould be eligible to choose a provider, and all providers must offer \nthe same basic package of services. In most States, VA could not be \nconsidered a provider for several reasons, including the restrictions \nwhich limit preventive and primary care.\n  Mr. President, the ``VA State Health Care Reform Pilot Program'' \nwould provide VA with invaluable experience regarding how it needs to \nchange in order to survive and thrive under health care reform. the \n``VA State Health Care Reform Pilot Program'' will help us meet our \nobligation to the brave men and women who served in every branch of the \nArmed Forces, by improving the VA medical system that serves them.\n  Mr. President, one final note before closing. On Friday, March 17, \n1995, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown submitted to our \ncommittee notice of a plan to realign the field management of the \nVeterans Health Administration. Pursuant to section 510(b) of title 38, \nUnited States Code, this realignment cannot go into effect for 90 days \nof continuous session of Congress.\n  Should there be no action of the Congress to modify the Secretary's \nproposed plan--and I know of no such proposed action at this point--VA \nwill undertake a very significant realignment of the field management \nstructure of VHA. I mention this possibility in the context of my \nintroduction of this measure today, because it is likely that the \nproposed pilot authority would have to be modified in light of the \nrealignment. Such changes in the legislation can be discussed later in \nthe committee's consideration of the issue, at which time we will have \na better sense of the outcome of the Secretary's proposed field \nrealignment.\n  Mr. President, I am looking forward to working with Senator Simpson \nand all the members of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, as \nwell as with the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nBob Stump, and chairman of the House Subcommittee on Hospitals and \nHealth Care, Tim Hutchinson. This legislation was passed by the Senate \nin the last Congress, and I hope that we can move forward with it in \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 613\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``VA State Health Care Reform \n     Pilot Program Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE OF PILOT PROGRAMS.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to authorize the participation \n     of the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system in \n     the health care systems of States that have enacted health \n     care reform in order to evaluate the most appropriate means \n     of enabling the Department health care system to participate \n     in such systems and in the National health care system \n     contemplated under any plans for National health care reform.\n\n     SEC. 3. HEALTH CARE PILOT PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary may carry out pilot programs \n     on the participation of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     health care system in the health care systems of States that \n     have adopted comprehensive health benefit plans. The \n     Secretary shall carry out any pilot program under this Act in \n     accordance with the provisions of this Act.\n       (b) States Eligible for Designation.--(1) The Secretary \n     shall designate each of not more than five States as a \n     location for a pilot program under this Act. The Secretary \n     shall complete the designation of States as locations for \n     pilot programs not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (2) The Secretary may designate a State as a location for a \n     pilot program under this Act if the Secretary determines \n     that--\n       (A) the State has enacted, or will soon enact, a statute \n     establishing or providing for a comprehensive health benefit \n     plan; and\n       (B) the participation of the health care system of the \n     Department under the plan is feasible and appropriate in \n     light of the purpose of this Act.\n       (c) Department Participation in State Health Benefit \n     Plans--(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary \n     shall provide eligible persons under each pilot program under \n     this Act with the comprehensive package of basic health care \n     benefits that would otherwise be available to such persons \n     under the comprehensive health benefit plan of the State in \n     which the pilot program is carried out. The Secretary shall \n     provide such benefits through the health care system of the \n     Department in such State as if such system were a provider of \n     such benefits under such plan.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State may \n     not prohibit the participation of the Department under the \n     comprehensive health benefit plan of the State under a pilot \n     program unless the chief executive officer of the State \n     certifies to the Secretary that--\n       (A) the benefits to be provided by the Department under the \n     pilot program do not meet requirements for quality of \n     benefits established by or provided under the plan; or\n       (B) the location of Department facilities (including \n     facilities providing services by contract or agreement with \n     the Secretary) in the State is such that the proximity of \n     eligible persons to such facilities does not meet \n     requirements so established for such proximity.\n       (3) Not later than 30 days after the designation of a State \n     as a location for a pilot program under this Act, and at such \n     other times as the Secretary may determine, the Secretary and \n     the health system director for that State shall jointly \n     determine the regulations under the authority of the \n     Secretary the waiver or modification of which is necessary in \n     order to facilitate the carrying out of the pilot program. \n     Upon such determination, the Secretary shall waive or modify \n     the application of such regulations to the pilot program.\n       (4) The Secretary shall furnish any eligible person living \n     in a State in which a pilot program is carried out (including \n     any eligible person electing to receive benefits under the \n     pilot program and any eligible person not electing to receive \n     benefits under the pilot program) with the health care \n     benefits for which such person is eligible under chapter 17 \n     of title 38, United States Code, notwithstanding that the \n     comprehensive package of basic health care benefits provided \n     under the comprehensive health benefit plan of the State does \n     not otherwise include such health care benefits.

A bill to confer jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims with respect to land claims of Pueblo of Isleta Indian Tribe, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    pueblo of isleta land claims act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Domenici, to reintroduce a bill on \nbehalf of our constituents, the people of the Pueblo of Isleta in New \nMexico. The Senate approved and passed an identical version of this \nmeasure in the previous Congress. Unfortunately, the House adjourned \nbefore its Members were able to take action on our bill, but a similar \nmeasure was approved by the House in the 102d Congress.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will provide authority for \nNew Mexico's Pueblo of Isleta to file an aboriginal land claim in the \nUnited States Court of Federal Claims under the Indian Claims Act. The \nbill does not pass judgment on the claim or give the Pueblo priority on \nthe court's docket. If, however, the Pueblo of Isleta proves to the \ncourt that it does indeed have a valid claim of aboriginal land use and \noccupancy, then appropriate monetary compensation would be determined \nby the court.\n  In April 1992, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Law \nand Governmental Relations held a hearing on an early version of our \nbill. During that hearing, testimony made clear that the Pueblo of \nIsleta--like all the Pueblo Tribes in New Mexico--had standing to \npursue land claims under the Indian Claims Act of 1946. Under the act, \nclaims could be based either on title to the land or aboriginal use, \nbut all claims must have been filed by 1951.\n  Unfortunately, due to incomplete or improper advice from counsel, the \nPueblo of Isleta filed only a limited claim based on a Spanish land \ngrant, to which there was a written record, before the 1951 deadline. \nAccording to tribal leaders, their fore-fathers were not informed by \ncounsel that they could file a claim based on aboriginal land use. \nSignificantly, the Pueblo's counsel was a Bureau of Indian Affairs \nofficial who was later found by the court to have given erroneous \nadvice on a similar matter to the Pueblo of Zuni. Like many other \ntribes, the Pueblos of Zuni and Isleta were completely dependent on the \nBureau of Indian Affairs for advice and assistance regarding land \nclaims during the 1940's and 1950's.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would simply allow the Pueblo of \nIsleta to pursue a claim today, much like legislation Congress approved \nsome years ago for the Pueblo of Zuni. Again, the bill does not give \nthe Pueblo priority on the court's docket, and it does not pass \njudgement on the claim itself.\n  The people of the Pueblo of Isleta are entitled to their day in \ncourt. This bill assures them of that right. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its swift passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 614\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     [[Page S4581]] SECTION 1. JURISDICTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding sections 2401 and 2501 of \n     title 28, United States Code, and section 12 of the Act of \n     August 13, 1946 (60 Stat. 1052, chapter 959), or any other \n     law that would interpose or support a defense of \n     untimeliness, jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the \n     United States Court of Federal Claims to hear, determine, and \n     render judgment on any claim by the Pueblo of Isleta Indian \n     Tribe of New Mexico against the United States with respect to \n     any lands or interests therein in the State of New Mexico or \n     any adjoining State that were held by aboriginal title or \n     otherwise and that were acquired from the tribe without \n     payment of adequate compensation by the United States.\n       (b) Interest.--As a matter of adequate compensation, the \n     United States Court of Federal Claims may award interest at a \n     rate of 5 percent per year to accrue from the date on which \n     such lands or interests therein were acquired from the tribe \n     by the United States.\n       (c) Limitations.--Such jurisdiction is conferred only with \n     respect to claims accruing on or before August 13, 1946.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish outpatient medical services \nfor any disability of a former prisoner of war; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                  veterans outpatient health care act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould ensure that all former prisoners of war [POW's] receive \noutpatient care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA]. \nUnder current law, POW's with service-connected disabilities are \nentitled to outpatient medical services. However, POW's with less than \n30 percent disability may be provided outpatient services at the \ndiscretion of VA. This distinction is unfair to many POW's and fails to \nrecognize the trauma and brutality of imprisonment endured by all \nformer POW's. I am pleased to have Senators Craig, Rockefeller, and \nCampbell join me as original cosponsors of this measure.\n  Mr. President, the need for this legislation is clear. All of \nAmerica's POW's deserve to be treated equally. Americans would agree \nthat those who served in defense of our Nation and were imprisoned by \nthe enemy deserve special consideration.\n  Some may feel this legislation is unnecessary because VA has been \nproviding outpatient services to POW's. But, when times get tough and \nfunding becomes tight, POW's without service-connected disabilities, or \nwith a lower disability rating, may be denied outpatient care. This is \nexactly what happened in 1990. Due to budgetary reasons, two midwestern \nVA medical centers began denying outpatient services to former POW's. \nFortunately, through congressional intervention, this policy was \nreversed and POW's continued to receive ambulatory care. Although we \nare facing a lean fiscal climate, accountants should not determine \nwhether our POW's receive outpatient care.\n  This bill only seeks to ensure that VA will continue to provide \noutpatient services at all times to POW's. As of January 1, 1995, there \nwere only 62,676 former U.S. POW's, 94 percent of whom served in World \nWar II. As we observe the 50th anniversary of the conclusion of World \nWar II, this bill provides a fitting tribute to the sacrifices made by \nPOW's on behalf of our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 615\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIGIBILITY OF FORMER PRISONERS OF WAR TO RECEIVE \n                   OUTPATIENT MEDICAL SERVICES FROM THE DEPARTMENT \n                   OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\n\n       Section 1712(a)(1) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking out ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (C);\n       (2) by striking out the period at the end of subparagraph \n     (D) and inserting in lieu thereof ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(E) to any former prisoner of war for any disability.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     American Ex-Prisoners of War,\n\n\n                                      National Capital Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of our 33,000 members, I want \n     to thank you very warmly for introducing the bill to \n     guarantee outpatient care for ex-POWs.\n       This bill, which was passed in 1992 by the Senate, means a \n     great deal to our members. Several years ago two VA Medical \n     Centers discontinued outpatient care to ex-POWs to save \n     money. Although outpatient care was restored to those \n     Centers, we never know when this may occur again.\n       Senator Akaka, we consider you a good friend of the former \n     prisoners of war, and we are looking forward to working with \n     your colleagues to assure enactment by Congress.\n       Again our sincere gratitude to you for introducing this \n     bill for us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles S. Prigmore,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my \ncolleague from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, in introducing legislation that \nwill clarify veterans health services for ex-prisoners of war [ex-POW].\n  This bill will amend title 38 of the United States Code, ensuring \naccess to outpatient medical services for any disability of a former \nprisoner of war. Mr. President, these services are currently being \nprovided in accordance with a directive from the Secretary of the \nVeterans Administration. This bill is necessary in order to secure, by \nlaw, access to these services by our veterans who have suffered as \nprisoners of war.\n  The law currently covers inpatient medical services for ex-POWs. \nHowever, as medical care continues to convert into more outpatient \ncare, we need to ensure that those who are in need of care can obtain \nit in the most cost-effective manner. In the long-term this should \nensure that we continue to provide care in the most cost effective \nmanner as more ailments are treated on an outpatient basis. In short, \nwe will be better able to control costs and provide better delivery of \ncare to those veterans who suffered at the hands of our enemies as \nprisoners of war.\n  Mr. President, I would like to point out that bills similar to this \none have previously passed the Senate. However, they have never \ncompleted the process leading to enactment. I hope that my colleagues \nwill see the merit in this legislation and support it so that we can \nsee it signed into law during this Congress.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 616. A bill to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide parity \nbetween the United States and certain free-trade agreement countries \nwith respect to the exemption for personal and household effects \npurchased abroad by returning residents, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                           border tariffs act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to correct \nan inequity that has developed along our border with Mexico with \nrespect to tariffs on goods crossing the border.\n  The United States currently permits duty-free entry of $400 of retail \ngoods for personal consumption each month. There is a 10-percent duty \non the next 1,000 dollars' worth of purchases brought into the United \nStates. Mexico, by contrast, limits the amount of goods that can be \nimported for personal consumption to $50 per day. Goods above that \namount have a duty of approximately 33 percent.\n  Mr. President, this difference in policy obviously hampers trade \nalong our borders. It is yet another burden on our border businesses, \nwhich are also currently struggling with the adverse effects of the \npeso crisis on the ability of Mexican citizens to purchase goods in the \nUnited States.\n  Before introducing this legislation in the 103d Congress, I had hoped \nthat this problem could be corrected administratively. I wrote to the \nSecretary of \n[[Page S4582]] State about this issue. With my fellow border Senators, \nI also contacted the Commissioner of Customs in our country and \nPresident Salinas in Mexico. All, ultimately, to no avail.\n  I still believe that there are two tracks we can take to persuade the \nGovernment of Mexico to increase its duty-free limit, and I believe \nthat we should pursue both of them. The first is to get our Government \nto negotiate with the Government of Mexico to equalize the duties. My \ngood friend and colleague from Arizona, Senator DeConcini, who retired \nat the end of the 103d Congress, inserted language in the fiscal year \n1995 Commerce, State, Justice appropriations report that would direct \nthe U.S. Trade Representative to make doing so a priority. It is my \nunderstanding that USTR officials have raised the issue in trade talks, \nbut that the issue has yet to be resolved. Until it is resolved, I \nbelieve that we should pursue a second track, that of changing the \nexemption provided for in our tariff laws to match that of Mexico's. \nTogether, these two actions can help ensure that retail businesses on \nboth sides of the border are on the same footing.\n  So, today, I rise to again offer legislation that would equalize the \namount of personal retail goods that can cross the border duty-free in \neither direction. This legislation simply says that our duty will not \nbe lower than Mexico's.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COATS (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 618. A bill to provide a low-income school choice demonstration \nprogram; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                    school choice demonstration act\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague from \nConnecticut, to introduce the School Choice Demonstration Act. This \nbill will establish 10 to 20 demonstration projects to study the \neffects of providing low-income parents and their children with \nfinancial assistance to enable them to select the public or private \nschool of their choice.\n  This is a very simple and straightforward bill--we want to enable \nlow-income parents to choose the school their children attend. They can \nselect a public or a private school, but the point is that they will be \nable to make a choice. Up until now, only those families who can afford \nto send their children to private schools have had that option. Senator \nLieberman and I believe that all families should have the opportunity \nto choose where their children will be educated. For too long, we have \nasked everyone to pay for a particular type of education without \nensuring that people have a say in what they receive for their money.\n  American education has reached a critical point. Time has taught us \nthat we cannot simply throw more and more money at the public schools, \nand rely on that to improve education. As many of you know, annual per \npupil spending has tripled in the last 30 years, while student \nachievement has dropped dramatically, evidenced by a decrease in \naverage SAT scores of almost 90 points. Clearly, more money is not the \nsolution.\n  We have to do something soon. In inner cities across America, almost \nhalf of all high school students fail to graduate. This is a chilling \nstatistic. We should take it as a wake up call. Obviously, something is \nseriously wrong with our educational system. This bill proposes an \noption for some students who are not succeeding in the public education \nsystem.\n  Our bill is simple. It says, let us allot a small amount of funds, so \nthat 10 to 20 demonstration grants can be awarded to local districts \naround the country who are interested in offering increased educational \nopportunities to their students. The funds granted by this bill will \nprovide assistance to children from the lowest-income homes. The \nchildren eligible under this program are those children who qualify for \nreduced or free school lunches. These funds will only go to low-income \nfamilies. And they are to be used to pay for education costs at public \nor private schools. The parents choose which school their child will \nattend.\n  We have incorporated a very strict civil rights and desegregation \nprotection clause to make sure that participating schools can in no way \ndiscriminate on the basis of race. We also stipulate that demonstration \nprojects cannot continue if they interfere with these desegregation \nplans.\n  The cost of this program will be $30 million and there will be no \nmore than 20 projects. School districts would voluntarily apply for the \ngrants through the secretary of education, and we have established some \ncriteria for the secretary to make the determination as to which \ndistricts would be included.\n  This bill also requires that a nationwide evaluation of the \ndemonstration program be conducted. Up until now, discussion concerning \nthe actual effects of school choice policies has been limited by a lack \nof conclusive data. This bill addresses that need for objective data. \nAn evaluation will give us a baseline\n from which to conduct our discussion at the Federal level.\n\n  Many localities are already experimenting with some type of school \nchoice. My home State of Indiana, for example, has several existing \nchoice initiatives under way. One program, originated by Golden Rule \nInsurance, helps low-income children in Indianapolis attend the private \nschool of their choice by awarding them scholarships to cover up to \nhalf of the tuition costs. There are currently 1,100 students being \nsponsored, and 650 kids are on the waiting list. Our public schools are \nalso experimenting with choice. Indianapolis public schools, for \nexample, has initiated the select schools program, by which parents can \nchoose which IPS school their child will attend. Eighty-six percent of \nIPS parents participated in this program this year.\n  I have spoken with educators in a district in Indiana who have \nalready expressed an interest in the program. Some public school \neducators have met with private and parochial school educators and \nthere is a real interest in testing the concept to see how it works, to \nwork out the bugs, and to see if it would actually make a difference.\n  None of you should have any reason to oppose this bill. It is not a \nmandate. It is a purely voluntary program for those local education \nassociations who are interested in broadening the educational \nopportunities offered in their community. This bill provides a basis by \nwhich we in Congress can evaluate the validity of this particular \nconcept. If it results in substantially new opportunities for low-\nincome children, then shouldn't such data be offered to school \ndistricts and education agencies across this country? Why would we not \nwant to have this information available so we can make intelligent \nchoices? After all, we are not here to protect a particular system. Our \nbottom line is to provide the best education opportunities to American \nchildren. For far too long, we have denied low-income families the \neducational choice that many others have.\n  It is important to understand what this bill does not do. It does not \nforce choice on anyone. This bill presents a purely voluntary program. \nIt will not upset the American public education system. Ten to twenty \nvoluntary choice programs throughout the country will not upset public \neducation.\n  Furthermore, Federal resources will not be drained from any public \nschool or education system. The Secretary cannot reduce or deny funds \nthat a public school would otherwise be eligible for, even though \nstudents in that school or school system opted out or numbers \ndecreased. This bill does not violate civil rights protections. It does \nnot destroy public education. In fact, I think it enhances public \neducation.\n  My home is Fort Wayne, IN. For decades our education system has \nthrived on competition. We have a vigorous Catholic school education \nsystem in Fort Wayne, IN. We have a Lutheran school system because of \nour heavy concentration of people of Lutheran belief. They have \nestablished their own system.\n  These two systems exist, along with other private education \nopportunities, side by side with the public education system in Fort \nWayne and they are all thriving. They are thriving because the parents \nand students of Fort Wayne have a choice. The competition between those \nthree systems has caused each system to better their education program \nto compete with each other for the students, and they work hand in \nhand. Parents in Fort Wayne have opportunities which parents in many \nStates and areas do not have.\n  This bill says that it is time for low-income families to have the \nsame \n[[Page S4583]] choice concerning their child's school that those who \ncan afford to send their kids to private schools already have. Let's \ntry this limited demonstration project and see if it improves the \neducation of some of America's neediest children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 618\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senator Coats \ntoday to introduce the Low-Income School Choice Demonstration Act. I \nknow Senator Coats shares my deep commitment to improving education. \nAll of our children deserve and need the best possible academic \ninstruction. Increasing school choice will help give more children the \nopportunity they deserve.\n  Our bill authorizes up to 20 demonstration projects to determine the \neffects on students and schools of providing education vouchers to low-\nincome parents for their children. Parents would use the vouchers to \nchoose the public or private school their child would attend. The \ndemonstration programs will give participating children new \nopportunities, and will provide those participating children new \nopportunities, and will provide those of us seeking to strengthen \neducation with a fair evaluation of private school choice programs.\n  Education in America is in need of change. We are failing too many of \nour children. The performance of our kids lags behind that of children \nliving in those countries we compete with in the global marketplace. \nWhile we have many fine schools, we have too many that do not give our \nchildren what they need to succeed.\n  I have visited many excellent public schools in Connecticut, and have \nmet countless dedicated and effective teachers and administrators. I \ncommand them for their work and am committed to supporting their \nefforts. At the same time, it is clear that the public schools are not \nworking for all students, particularly in our poorest communities. We \nhave a responsibility to seek more effective ways to address the needs \nof these children.\n  School choice programs expand opportunity for low-income children. \nThey provide low-income children with the same options other kids have. \nFor some that may mean another public school, for others a private or \nparochial school.\n  Private school choice opens doors for children in our poorest \nneighborhoods, where religious schools--particularly Catholic schools--\noften have had better results than public schools. I have long believed \nwhat some research has shown--that the success of parochial schools is \nin part due to their students' and teachers' shared beliefs and strong \nmoral values. Lower-income parents who want their kids to learn in a \nreligious environment should have that chance, just as wealthier \nparents do.\n  Some fear that school choice programs will hurt our public schools, \nbut I think choice will help revitalize public education. A national \npanel of experts, the Panel on the Economics of Educational Reform, \nrecently concluded that public schools have few incentives for \ninnovation. Good, effective teachers are often not\n rewarded by greater pay. Programs are rarely evaluated systematically \nto see if they are working.\n\n  Choice programs and charter school programs hold schools accountable \nfor results. Voucher programs let parents and students reward good \nschools--public or private schools--with their business. That increased \ncompetition may help those students who stay put as well as those who \nchoose to attend a new school.\n  As a U.S. Senator I have worked to promote public and private school \nchoice. Last year Congress passed legislation, which I had co-authored, \nto promote the establishment of charter schools--public schools that \nare freed from burdensome regulatory requirements and are instead held \naccountable for improving the performance of their students. I am \npleased that Congress made a commitment to public school choice, and \nwill work to ensure the new program the rapidly growing interest in \ncharter schools.\n  This year Senator Coats and I are introducing legislation that \nestablishes demonstration programs that provide parents with the \nability to choose private or public schools, including public charter \nschools and private parochial schools. The demonstrations will allow \nlow-income children to attend the public or private school of their \nchoice. The bill will also fund evaluations so that we can learn more \nabout how voucher programs affect public and private schools, and how \nthey affect our children's ability to learn.\n  Improving public education is and must be our country's top priority. \nWhat we are trying to do is find new ways to accomplish that goal. \nSchool choice programs should be tested. They create competition for \nfailing bureaucracies and failing schools. They reward public and \nprivate schools that work. And, most important, they give our poorest \nstudents the chance for a better education and a better life.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Coats for his leadership on this bill, \nand I look forward to continuing to work with him to ensure our \nchildren have the education and opportunity they deserve.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Simon, Mr. Mack, Mr. Bond, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Warner and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 619.

SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Mercury-\nContaining and Rechargeable Battery Management Act. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators Lautenberg, Faircloth, McConnell, Lieberman, Simon, \nMack, Bond, Graham, Warner and Reid. This legislation is urgently \nneeded to remove Federal barriers detrimental to much-needed State and \nlocal recycling programs for batteries commonly found in cordless \nproducts such as portable telephones, laptop computers, tools, and \ntoys.\n  Since 1992, Federal battery legislation has been approved in various \ncongressional forums, including passage by the Senate in 1994, but it \ndid not become law because the legislation to which it was attached did \nnot move forward. Our bill, which is virtually identical to the Senate \npassed provisions last year, would--\n  First, facilitate the efficient and cost effective collection and \nrecycling or proper disposal of used nickel cadmium [Ni-Cd] and certain \nother batteries by: establishing a coherent national system of labeling \nfor batteries and products; streamlining the regulatory requirements \nfor battery collection programs for regulated batteries; and \nencouraging voluntary industry programs by eliminating barriers to \nfunding the collection and recycling or proper disposal of used \nrechargeable batteries; and\n  Second, phase out the use of mercury in batteries.\n  Without this legislation, States and industry face Federal barriers \nto implementing State battery recycling programs across the country. \nThirteen States, including New Hampshire, have enacted legislation \nrequiring that Ni-Cd and small sealed lead-acid batteries be labeled \nand are easily removable from consumer products. Of these 13 States, 9 \nhave enacted legislation calling for the collection of Ni-Cd and small-\nsealed lead-acid batteries.\n  [[Page S4586]] Mr. President, although industry has developed a \nnational collection program to comply with these laws, without \nenactment of a Federal bill, EPA's current regulatory requirements \npreclude industry from fully implementing this program and from \ncomplying with the State collection requirements. Regulatory changes \ncurrently under consideration, even if promulgated, will not provide \nthe necessary solution. Additional lengthy rulemaking procedures would \nalso be necessary to make the regulation operational on a national \nbasis. Further, we would still lack a coherent national system of \nlabeling, which is necessary to facilitate nationwide marketing of \nbatteries and products while advancing a national battery collection \nprogram. Federal legislation is the only real solution to removing the \nbarriers to complying with State battery recycling laws, and to \nachieving a comprehensive recycling program.\n  The prompt passage of this legislation will achieve a number of \nimportant goals. First, by establishing uniform national standards to \npromote the recycling and reuse of rechargeable batteries, this \nlegislation provides a cost effective means to promote the reuse of our \nNation's resources. Second, our bill will further strengthen efforts to \nremove these potentially toxic heavy metals from our Nation's landfills \nand incinerators. Not only will this lower the threat of groundwater \ncontamination and toxic air emissions, but it will also significantly \nreduce the threat that these materials pose to the environment. Third, \nthis legislation represents an environmentally friendly policy choice \nthat was developed as the result of a strong cooperative effort between \nthe States, environmental groups and the affected industries. Our bill \nis strongly supported by the Electronic Industries Association [EIA], \nthe Portable Rechargeable Battery Association [PRBA], and the National \nElectrical Manufacturers Association [NEMA]. For all of the reasons \ncited above, I believe that this legislation provides a substantial \nwin-win from both an environmental as well as an economic standpoint.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important \nlegislation, and ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill, a \nsection-by-section outline of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey, \nupon request, certain property in Federal reclamation projects to \nbeneficiaries of the projects and to set forth a distribution scheme \nfor revenues from reclamation project lands; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  RECLAMATION FACILITIES TRANSFER ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation that \nwould direct the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the Federal \ninterest in certain Bureau of Reclamation projects to the project \nbeneficiaries. This legislation has already been introduced in the \nother body by Congressman Skeen.\n  I am introducing the identical legislative language in order to frame \nwhat I believe will be an interesting debate. \n[[Page S4589]] The reclamation program was intended to assist in the \nsettlement of the West, and it has been extraordinarily successful in \nthat endeavour. There are many instances, throughout the West, where \nthe objectives of individual projects have been fully accomplished. The \nproject works have been constructed and the allocable repayment \nobligations have been satisfied. Operation and maintenance of the \nprojects have been turned over to the project beneficiaries and the \nFederal Government simply holds bare legal title with little or no \ninvolvement with the project.\n  Those seem to me to be classic examples of the type of projects that \nshould be fully turned over to the beneficiaries. The Federal \nGovernment incurs annual costs and is exposed to out-year liabilities \nfor no other reason than it holds title to certain works. Given the \ndownsizing of the Bureau of Reclamation, it seems all the more sensible \nthat the Bureau conserve its personnel and resources. Just to have one \nperson available for a project on which the Federal Government does \nnothing probably costs over $100,000. Given the needs elsewhere within \nthe Department, each of those personnel could be better used.\n  I do not want anyone to think that this legislation is a final \nproduct, but it does serve to frame the debate. Many of our reclamation \nprojects are multiple purpose, and we will need to be careful to ensure \nthat we do not lose sight of those other objectives. Many projects \nprovide important flood control and navigation benefits that are of \nnational interest. That does not argue against a transfer of title, but \nit is a concern that we should be aware of. A very important \nconsideration, at least to this Senator, will be the issue of the \ntransfer of the water rights associated with the project. Luckily, we \ndo not have to face the issue of Federal reserved water rights since \nunder reclamation law, the Bureau has obtained water rights from the \nStates in conformity with State water law for all its projects. We \nwill, however, need to be careful to make certain that title to those \nrights is transferred to the appropriate entities or individuals and \nthat the transfer is in conformity with State water law.\n  There are many other considerations as well, and I do not intend to \nbe exhaustive in this statement but one item deserves mention. We dealt \nwith some of those issues when we considered the transfer of the Solano \nproject several years ago, and our inability to fully resolve all those \nissues, including the recreational responsibilities of the Bureau at \nLake Berryessa, was the reason why we were unable to enact legislation. \nAs drafted, this legislation only applies to fully paid-out projects. \nIn particular instances, I think a case could be made to permit \nprepayment of the outstanding indebtedness much as we have done for \nother reclamation loans. That is another issue we will have to closely \nexamine.\n  I want to congratulate Congressman Skeen and his cosponsors for \nraising this issue. All of us in the West, and some from outside the \nWest, have questioned from time to time, the future of the Bureau of \nReclamation. Congressman Skeen has proposed one answer for many \nprojects. I fully expect that we may even find agreement within the \nDepartment of the Interior that on some projects there simply is no \nfurther role for the Federal Government. I do not expect that we will \nhave a complete transfer of all projects, but that should not stop us \nfrom looking at the question. A fully paid out single purpose project \nlocated solely within one State will be the easy transfer. I hope we do \nnot limit our vision that narrowly.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Stevens and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 621. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Great Western Trail for potential addition to the National Trails \nSystem, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                     GREAT WESTERN TRAIL STUDY ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which would \ndirect the U.S. Forest Service, in consultation with the Department of \nthe Interior, to study the Great Western Trail to determine if it \nshould be included in the National Scenic Trails System.\n  The Great Western Trail takes in some of the greatest outdoor and \nnatural opportunities the West has to offer. The trail will be a \ncontinuous, multiple-use route that reaches from Mexico to Canada. It \nencompasses a series of existing trails, mostly on public lands, \nrunning through a corridor which extends through five States. The trail \nitself extends from the panhandle of Idaho to the southern tip of \nArizona. Along the 2,400 mile length of the trail are numerous \nrecreational opportunities for all interests, from cross-country skiers \nto backpackers, hikers, and off-road enthusiasts. The trail passes \nthrough areas rich in western heritage as well as some of the most \nspectacular scenery in the world.\n  Prior to designating the Great Western Trail as part of the National \nTrails System, a study must be conducted to determine its feasibility. \nThis bill take the first step by instructing the Secretary of \nAgriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Interior, to conduct \na study of the current land ownership and use along the designated \ntrail route. The study would include cost estimates of any necessary \nland acquisition as well as reporting on the appropriateness of \nincluding motorized activity along the trail route. Since the proposed \ntrail route follows roads and trails already in existence, very little \nright-of-way acquisition would be required and minimal construction \nwould be necessary.\n  This study will play an important role by determining land and \nresource capability, public safety needs, and the administrative \nrequirements necessary to designate the trail as part of the National \nTrails System. It is also important to note that the trail takes \nadvantage of and will rely heavily upon volunteer construction, \nmaintenance, and management of the trail system.\n  Communities throughout the West will benefit tremendously from the \nGreat Western Trail. The recreational opportunities and rural economic \ndevelopment that travel and tourism will bring to the region will not \nonly provide an economic boost to the local economies, but will help \nthose who travel the Great Western Trail to gain a greater appreciation \nfor our Nation's heritage. The Great Western Trail will provide a \npositive experience for those who use it. It will become a significant \nand vital addition to America's system of national trails.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Abraham):\n  S. 622. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to provide that a State \ncontaining an ozone nonattainment area that does not significantly \ncontribute to ozone nonattainment in its own area or any other area \nshall be treated as satisfying certain requirements if the State makes \ncertain submissions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n         clean air act ozone transport provisions amendment act\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill that Senator Abraham and I are \nintroducing today is intended to help correct a significant flaw in the \nClean Air Act. This flaw plagues communities in west Michigan, and \naffects many other areas of the country that are downwind from \nsignificant sources of ozone-causing emissions.\n  As it is written, the act is unfair. It does not equitably distribute \nthe burden of reducing ozone emissions. Some areas, like west Michigan, \ncould be required to undertake vehicle inspection and maintenance \ntesting programs, although these programs will not be effective in \nreducing the local concentrations of ozone because their ozone is being \ntransported by wind and weather from other States and parts of the \ncountry.\n  Let me explain the west Michigan situation, the outlook for which has \nchanged significantly in recent weeks. Three west Michigan counties are \ncurrently designated as two separate moderate ozone nonattainment areas \nby the EPA pursuant to the Clean Air Act; Kent and Ottawa Counties are \none, and Muskegon County is the other. Because of their classification \nas moderate ozone nonattainment areas, the State of Michigan was \nrequired by law to pass legislation imposing mandatory vehicle \ninspection and maintenance testing in these two areas starting in \n[[Page S4590]] January 1995. This requirement would have made sense \nwere these three counties the cause of either their own nonattainment \nor the nonattainment of other areas. But they aren't. Governor Engler \nrecognized this inequity and halted the I/M program in late December \n1994.\n  EPA has acknowledged that the three counties ``are essentially \noverwhelmed by emissions coming from Chicago and northern Indiana.'' In \na June 20, 1994, letter to the Michigan department of natural \nresources, EPA Administrator Carol Browner said, ``. . . the USEPA \nrecognizes that ozone transport may make it very difficult, if not \nimpossible, for Muskegon and Grand Rapids, themselves, to achieve the \nNAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) for ozone by deadlines \nprescribed by the CAA (Clean Air Act).''\n  In a hearing held on Monday, July 25, 1994, before my Subcommittee on \nOversight of Government Management, EPA acknowledged ``that Muskegon \nCounty would be in attainment but for ozone transport.'' EPA also \nconfirmed that Muskegon and Grand Rapids ``are not the cause of Chicago \nand northern Indiana being in nonattainment . . .'' In fact, EPA has \nnot shown that any area is in nonattainment due to west Michigan's \nemissions. The Lake Michigan ozone study director states, ``. . . that \nno matter what reductions are made in Michigan, the air quality will \nnot be affected.''\n  In short, these three counties are not the cause of their own or any \nother area's ozone problem and no matter what these counties do for \nthemselves, it is unlikely that they will be able to achieve and stay \nin attainment. Because of ozone blown their way and their resultant \nclassification as moderate nonattainment areas, they could be forced to \nimplement a burdensome vehicle inspection program that would not make a \nsignificant difference. As stated succinctly in the Senate Environment \nCommittee's report to accompany S. 1630, the Clean Air Act Amendments \nof 1989, ``Because ozone is not a local phenomenon but is formed and \ntransported over hundreds of miles and several days, localized control \nstrategies will not be effective in reducing ozone levels.'' \nUnfortunately, this sentiment did not translate into the act's \nrequirements and implementation. The inflexibility and inequity of the \nlocalized mandate undermines public support for the Clean Air Act and \nenvironmental laws--in an area of the country that is generally \nsupportive of both.\n  Fortunately, the last 3 years of ozone monitoring data in the west \nMichigan area show no violations of the Federal ozone standard for the \narea, according to an expedited review that I requested of EPA. This \nmeans that Michigan can apply for redesignation to attainment, and \nAdministrator Browner has indicated that that process is very \n``doable.'' But, once attainment has been achieved, it is possible that \nonly one violation could force west Michigan to return to the I/M \nrequirements. Though EPA has stated that the Agency would seek to avoid \nthis outcome and would carefully examine the violation to determine \nwhether it was caused by local or transported ozone before returning to \nthose requirements, I believe that it would be best to correct the law \nbefore such circumstances arise. This bill is a step toward fixing it.\n  At the hearing mentioned previously, I asked Mary Nichols, Assistant \nAdministrator for Air, if these three counties were treated in the same \nway rural areas are treated, would they qualify for an exemption from \nthe Clean Air Act requirements. Ms. Nichols replied, ``I believe that \nis correct.'' She is right. That is at the heart of the unfairness of \nthe Clean Air Act. The legislation we are offering specifically \naddresses that unfairness. Whether such an area is rural or nonrural \nshould not make any difference, if the area is not a significant cause \nof its own or any other area's nonattainment. It is the emissions from \nan area and not the number of people that live in an area that should \nmatter.\n  This bill applies that principle and eliminates the illogical \ndisparate treatment between rural and nonrural areas. EPA would be \nrequired to treat any ozone nonattainment area as a marginal ozone \nnonattainment area, if the State demonstrates to EPA that sources of \nozone-causing emissions in that area do not make a significant \ncontribution to ozone nonattainment measured in the area or in other \nareas. So, rather than arbitrarily\n denying the regulatory relief to a metropolitan statistical area, or \nan adjacent area, which is currently available to a rural transport \narea, the act's standards would apply equally to rural and non-rural \nareas. As a result, the burden would be placed more squarely on the \nshoulders of the ``significant contributors,'' rather than the victims \nof transport. This is only fair.\n\n  Clearly, we may need to refine this legislation further or make the \nlegislative history clear so that the definition of ``significant \ncontribution'' is not subject to excessively narrow interpretation by \nan EPA Administrator and so that we can ensure protection for the west \nMichigan area from the unfair burdens associated with transported \npollution. But, we also want to make sure that other areas who need to \nbe reducing their emissions because they are transporting pollution \nelsewhere don't get off the hook. I know that the State of Michigan has \nthe data to prove that west Michigan deserves relief under this bill, \nbut we will work with the State, EPA, and the relevant congressional \ncommittees to insure that this legislative effort does not have \nunintended consequences.\n  After repeated urgings by myself and others, the EPA has issued a new \nozone transport policy. Under the previous policy the west Michigan \nnonattainment areas would have been required by 1996 to meet clean air \nstandards which they could not meet because of pollution carried by the \nwinds from outside areas such as Chicago, areas with severe air \npollution problems. The old policy was particularly unfair, since, \nunder the law, these other more polluted areas do not need to meet the \nrequirements themselves until the year 2007.\n  The EPA has informed me that the states will be permitted to present \nan analysis demonstrating the problem and that EPA will consider \ngranting an extension of the 1996 deadline, possibly until 2007. This \nnew policy should avoid further unfairness, as additional requirements \ncould have been placed, in 1996, on the west Michigan area, triggered \nby pollution which is not generated in the local area.\n  While I appreciate EPA's efforts in providing this extension, the new \npolicy was, according to Administrator Browner, to have held ``areas \nresponsible only for that portion of the ozone problem which they \ncause.'' However, this new policy only corrects one inequity in the \nact, to wit, the fact that downwind areas suffering from significant \nozone and other pollution transported from more severely polluted areas \nhave less time to achieve attainment. The change in attainment \ndeadlines does not address the problem of areas inappropriately \ndesignated in the first place.\n  Mr. President, there appear to be a number of other States that \ncontain victim of transport areas in situations similar to west \nMichigan. I am sure that my colleagues in New England, for instance, \nhave been noticing a significant increase in public attention to the \nvehicle testing requirements. It will be argued that we should not \nreopen the Clean Air Act. But, we cannot permit an unfair regulatory \nburden to fall upon our constituents to correct a problem which they \ndid not cause and which the regulatory requirements cannot cure. We \nshould right that wrong.\n  Mr. President, I support the goals of the Clean Air Act. But, it \nneeds to be applied with common sense, if it is to retain the support \nof the American people. Without that support, it cannot succeed.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 623. A bill to reform habeas corpus procedures, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  THE FEDERAL HABEAS CORPUS REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the American people want government to do \nsomething about violent crime. Unfortunately, the crime bill that \npassed last year in the 103d Congress did nothing about one of the most \nserious aspects of the crime problem: the interminable appeals process \nthat has made the death penalty more a hollow threat than an effective \ndeterrent.\n  [[Page S4591]] The crime bill abandoned key provisions which would \nhave limited appeals in the Federal courts by State death row inmates. \nThese appeals currently average more than 9 years and last as long as \n17 years. Of all people sentenced to death since 1976, 266 have been \nexecuted, while over 2,900 sit in death row cells. Is it any wonder \nthat in 1963, when the imposition of the death penalty was a real \npossibility that criminals had to worry about, there were 8,500 \nhomicides in America, a rate of 4.5 homicides per 100,000 people; while \nin 1993 there were 23,760 homicides, and a more than doubled homicide \nrate of 9.3 per 100,000. The legal system has turned the death penalty \ninto a toothless saw.\n  National polls continue to show fear of crime to be the No. 1 concern \nof most Americans. One survey conducted right after President Clinton's \nState of the Union Address last year found 71 percent thought more \nmurders should be punishable by the death penalty. My own 12 years of \nexperience in the Philadelphia District Attorney's office, first as an \nassistant district attorney and chief of the appeals division and later \nas district attorney, convinces me they are right.\n  The great writ of habeas corpus has been the procedure used to \nguarantee defendants in State criminal trials their rights under the \nU.S. Constitution. It is an indispensable safeguard because of the \ndocumented history of State criminal-court abuses such as the \nScottsboro case. Unfortunately, it has been applied in a crazy-quilt \nmanner with virtually endless appeals that deny justice to victims and \ndefendants alike, making a mockery of the judicial system.\n  The best way to stop this mockery is to impose strict time limits on \nappeals. The bill I am introducing today, along with my distinguished \ncolleague and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, \nwill do just that.\n  Criminal justice experts agree that for any penalty to be effective \nas a deterrent, the penalty must be swift and certain. When years pass \nbetween the time a crime is committed and a sentence is carried out, \nthe vital link between crime and punishment is stretched so thin that \nthe deterrent message is lost.\n  Delays leave inmates, as well as victims, in a difficult state of \nsuspended animation. In a 1989 case, the British Government declined to \nextradite a defendant to Virginia on murder charges until the local \nprosecutor promised not to seek the death penalty because the European \nCourt of Human Rights had ruled that confinement in a Virginia prison \nfor 6 to 8 years awaiting execution would violate the European \nConvention on Human Rights.\n  Similarly, for survivors of murder victims, there is an inability to \nreach a sense of resolution about their loved one's death until the \ncriminal case has been resolved. The families do not understand the \ncomplexities of the legal process and suffer feelings of isolation, \nanger, and loss of control over the lengthy court proceedings. The \nunconscionable delays deny justice to all--society, victims, and \ndefendants.\n  Since upholding the constitutionality of the death penalty in 1976, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court has required more clearly defined death penalty \nlaws. Thirty-eight States have responded to voters' expressions of \npublic outrage by enacting capital punishment statutes that meet the \nrequirements of the Constitution.\n  My 12 years experience in the Philadelphia District Attorney's office \nconvinced me that the death penalty deters crime. I saw many cases \nwhere professional burglars and robbers refused to carry weapons for \nfear that a killing would occur and they would be charged with first-\ndegree murder, carrying the death penalty.\n  One such case involved three hoodlums who planned to rob a \nPhiladelphia pharmacist. Cater, 19, and Rivers, 18, saw that their \npartner Williams, 20, was carrying a revolver. The two younger men said \nthey would not participate if Williams took the revolver along, so \nWilliams placed the gun in a drawer and slammed it shut.\n  Right as the three men were leaving the room, Williams sneaked the \nrevolver back into his pocket. In the course of the robbery, Williams \nshot and killed pharmacist Jacob Viner. The details of the crime \nemerged from the confessions of the three defendants and corroborating \nevidence. All three men were sentenced to death because, under the law, \nCater and Rivers were equally responsible for Williams's act of murder.\n  Ultimately, Williams was executed and the death sentences for Cater \nand Rivers were changed to life imprisonment because of extenuating \ncircumstances, because they did not know their co-conspirator was \ncarrying a weapon. There are many similar cases where robbers and \nburglars avoid carrying weapons for fear a gun or knife will be used in \na murder, subjecting them to the death penalty.\n  The use of the death penalty has gradually been limited by the courts \nand legislatures to apply only to the most outrageous cases. In 1925, \nthe Pennsylvania Legislature repealed the mandatory death penalty for \nfirst-degree murder, leaving it to the discretion of the jury or trial \ncourt. More recently, in 1972, the Supreme Court struck down all State \nand Federal death penalty laws and prohibited capital punishment for \nall inmates on death row, or future executions, unless thereafter they \ncontained detailed procedures for considering aggravating and \nmitigating circumstances.\n  Prosecutors customarily refrain from asking for the death penalty for \nall but the most heinous crimes. I did that when I was a district \nattorney, personally reviewing the cases where capital punishment was \nrequested.\n  While the changes required by the Supreme Court help insure justice \nto defendants, there is a sense that capital punishment can be retained \nonly if applied to outrageous cases. I agree with advocates who insist \non the greatest degree of care in the use of capital punishment. I have \nvoted for limitations to exclude the death penalty for the mentally \nimpaired and the very young. However, I oppose those who search for \nevery possible excuse to avoid the death penalty because they oppose it \non the grounds of conscientious scruples.\n  While I understand and respect that moral opposition, our system of \ngovernment says the people of the 38 States that have capital \npunishment are entitled to have those sentences carried out where they \nhave been constitutionally imposed. In those jurisdictions, the debate \nis over until the statutes are repealed or the Constitution \nreinterpreted.\n  Many Federal habeas corpus appeals degenerate into virtually endless \ndelays, where judges bounce capital cases like tennis balls from one \ncourt to another, exacerbated by repetitive petitions. Here is an \nexample, Mr. President: After being convicted in California for a \ndouble murder in 1980, Robert Alton Harris filed 10 petitions for \nhabeas corpus review in the State courts, 5 similar petitions in the \nFederal courts, and 11 applications to the U.S. Supreme Court. Many of \nthose applications to invalidate the death penalty overlapped.\n  Habeas corpus reform is not a new issue in the Senate. In 1984, the \nSenate first passed a habeas corpus reform measure, but the House \nfailed to consider it. In 1990, during the 101st Congress, I offered my \nfirst legislation to speed up and simplify Federal habeas corpus \nprocedures in capital cases. That year, the Senate adopted the \namendment that Senator Thurmond and I wrote to the omnibus anticrime \nbill that would have reformed habeas corpus procedures in death penalty \ncases. Unfortunately, at the insistence of the House conferees, our \nprovision was dropped from the conference report.\n  Habeas corpus reform was revisited in the 102d Congress. Portions of \nmy proposal, S. 19, were incorporated into the Republican habeas corpus \nreform package, which again became part of the Senate's omnibus \nanticrime legislation. This time, the conference committee on the \nSenate and House anticrime bills kept a habeas corpus reform provision \nin the conference report, but it was the House version. As reported by \nthe conference committee, that version would have exacerbated the \ndelay, not eased it. Despite late efforts at a compromise, habeas \nreform died with that crime bill.\n  Again in the 103d Congress, I introduced habeas corpus reform \nlegislation. In 1993, when the new omnibus anticrime bill was being \ndebated in the \n[[Page S4592]] Senate, all habeas corpus reform provisions were \nstripped from the bill. I was dismayed. Even as the Senate was voting \nto establish a broad Federal death penalty, it was refusing to address \nthe compelling need to expedite review of the death sentences once \nimposed.\n  When I demanded that the issue of habeas corpus reform be addressed \nby the Senate, I was given the opportunity to bring my bill to the \nfloor for debate. Unfortunately, the legislation I introduced to \neliminate the delays in carrying out death sentences was tabled by a \nvote of 65 to 34.\n  Which brings us to today, Mr. President. My new proposal, the Federal \nHabeas Corpus Reform Act of 1995, sets strict time limits on the filing \nof habeas corpus petitions and severely restricts the filing of any \nsuccessive petition. It requires that the appropriate Federal court of \nappeals approve the filing of any successive petition. It ensures \nadequate counsel in habeas corpus proceedings. It imposes time limits \non Federal judges to decide habeas corpus petitions in capital cases. \nAnd it does this so that imposition of the death penalty in State cases \nwill become more certain and swift, making the death penalty again a \nmeaningful sanction and deterrent.\n  This bill builds on some innovative strategies that I first proposed \nin 1990. Already, much of that approach has become widely accepted as \nthe basic building blocks of habeas corpus reform, namely establishing \ntime limits on filing habeas corpus petitions and on Federal court \nconsideration of capital habeas corpus petitions, and requiring that \nthe filing of any successive petition be approved by the appropriate \ncourt of appeals under stringent standards.\n  Under this bill, a single Federal court review will resolve most \ndeath penalty cases in under 2 years. First, a Federal habeas corpus \npetition in a capital case must be filed within 6 months from the final \naction in State court proceedings. A final decision must be made by the \nFederal district court within 180 days from the filing of the habeas \ncorpus petition. And a final decision must be made by the Federal court \nof appeals within 120 days from the filing of the final brief. No \nsuccessive Federal court habeas corpus petition could be considered \nunless specific leave was granted by the appropriate court of appeals, \nand then only for very limited reasons.\n  In addition, the proposed expedited treatment of habeas corpus \npetitions in capital cases would apply only to States which agree to \nprovide free, competent legal counsel for defendants during their State \ncourt appeals. The bill provides that the Federal government will \nprovide free legal counsel during their Federal habeas corpus \nproceedings.\n  The compressed time frame is both just and practical. It would \neliminate the lengthy delays and establish habeas corpus proceedings in \ndeath penalty cases as the highest priority in the Federal judicial \nsystem.\n  Unless there are unusually complicating factors, which must be \ndetailed in the district court's opinion, I know that such cases can be \nheard within a few weeks, with no more than a week or two being \nrequired to write an opinion. Some district courts have sat on such \ncases for as long as 12 years. Even in States with the most prisoners \non death row, such as Florida, Texas, and California, each district \ncourt judge would have such a case only every 1 to 3 years. Judges \nwould not be overburdened.\n  Decisions on appeal to the court of appeals should be made within 120 \ndays of briefing. That is manageable with priority attention to these \nrelatively few capital cases. The authority of Congress to establish \nsuch time limits was exercised in the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, which \ncalls for criminal trials to begin within 70 days unless delayed by \nspecified causes. The key factor in this timetable is the requirement \nthat competent, free counsel be provided to defendants in capital cases \nduring their State and Federal habeas corpus proceedings.\n  I must stress, however, that the abbreviated timetable does not take \neffect until State court review of a sentence of death is completed. No \ntime limit is placed by this legislation on the length of trial or on \nperiods for consideration of post-trial motions and the State court \nappeals. During that period, most, if not all, of the complex factual \nand legal issues will be organized, analyzed and resolved by the State \ncourts, so that these issues will not be novel when the case goes to \nFederal court.\n  Requiring prisoners on death row to file petitions within 6 months of \nfinal State court action is not only reasonable, but is necessary to \nend the abuse in which petitioners and their attorneys now engage. A \nperfect example of the abuse can be seen in a recent case from my own \nState of Pennsylvania.\n  Steven Duffey was convicted of a 1984 murder. His conviction and \nsentence were unanimously upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in \n1988. From then on, he did nothing until after his death warrant had \nbeen signed in September 1994. Then, on the eve of his execution, \nDuffey's attorneys filed a habeas corpus petition and sought a stay of \nexecution.\n  The Federal district judge thought himself bound to enter the stay so \nthat the petition could be entertained. But the judge castigated the \ngame-playing of Duffey and his lawyer. In his opinion, Judge Thomas \nVanaskie of the Middle District of Pennsylvania hit on a central \nproblem with the current system when he noted that ``[t]here is an \noverwhelming incentive on the part of a death row inmate to ignore \nuntil the eleventh hour collateral challenges to his or her \nconviction.'' He then quoted the 1994 decision of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit in Steffen versus Tate, which had \nlikewise found that ``it is almost always in the interest of a death \nsentenced prisoner to delay filing a [habeas corpus] petition as long \nas possible.''\n  Mr. President, this bill goes a long way toward restoring the death \npenalty as an effective deterrent. But to get the rest of the way there \nwe need to address the endless delays caused by requiring defendants to \nexhaust all of their claims in State court before they are allowed to \nfile Federal habeas corpus petitions.\n  The absurdity of this exhaustion requirement is illustrated by the \nseries of decisions involving a Philadelphia criminal, Michael Peoples. \nPeoples was convicted in the State trial court in 1981 of setting his \nvictim on fire during a robbery. Following this legal trail is not \neasy, but it illustrates the farcical procedures. After the \nPennsylvania intermediate appellate court affirmed Peoples' conviction \nin 1983, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied review in a decision \nthat was unclear as to whether it was based on the merits or on the \nCourt's procedural discretion that there was no special reason to \nconsider the substantive issues.\n  Peoples then filed a petition in 1986 for habeas corpus in the U.S. \ndistrict court. That petition was denied for failure to exhaust State \nremedies, meaning the State court did not consider all his claims. The \ncase was then appealed to the next higher court level, the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the district court on the \nground that the exhaustion rule was satisfied when the State Supreme \nCourt had the opportunity to correct alleged violations of the \nprisoner's constitutional rights. Next, Peoples asked the U.S. Supreme \nCourt to review his case.\n  Even though the Supreme Court was too busy to hear 4,550 cases in \n1988, the Peoples case was one of 147 petitions it granted. After the \nnine justices reviewed the briefs, heard oral argument and deliberated, \nJustice Scalia wrote an opinion reversing the Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit.\n  The Third Circuit then undertook the extensive process of briefs and \nargument before three judges. It issued a complicated opinion \nconcluding that the original petition for a writ of habeas corpus \ncontained both exhausted and unexhausted claims. That ruling sent the \ncase back to the district court for reconsideration.\n  Had the Ddstrict court simply considered Peoples' constitutional \nclaims on the substantive merits in the first instance, all those \nbriefs, arguments and opinions would have been avoided. These \ncomplications arise from a Federal statute that requires a defendant to \nexhaust his or her remedies in the State court before coming to the \nfederal court. The original purpose of giving the State a chance to \ncorrect any error and to limit the work of the Federal courts was \nsound. In practice, \n[[Page S4593]] however, that rule has created a hopeless maze, \nillustrated by thousands of cases like those of Peoples and Harris.\n  The elimination of the statutory exhaustion requirement would mean \nthat Congress, which has authority to establish Federal court \njurisdiction, would direct U.S. district courts to decide petitions for \nwrits of habeas corpus after direct appeals to the Supreme Court had \nupheld the death penalty. From my own experience, I have seen State \ntrial court judges sit on such habeas corpus cases for months or years \nand then dismiss them in the most perfunctory way because the issues \nhad already been decided by the State Supreme Court in its earlier \ndecision.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, Federal habeas corpus is a complex and \narcane subject. Its difficult and restrictive rules simply delay \nimposition of the death penalty and render it useless as a deterrent. \nThe purposes of tough law enforcement are best served by full and \nprompt hearings instead of a procedural morass that defeats the \nsubstantive benefits of capital punishment.\n  In 1990, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the current system \nfor handling death penalty habeas corpus cases in the Federal courts \n``verges on the chaotic.'' He was charitable. If justice delayed is \njustice denied, there's little justice left in the Federal judicial \ntreatment of death sentences.\n  My proposal for habeas corpus reform will bring practical \nreinstatement of the death penalty, so that meaningless procedures do \nnot remain the enemy of substantive justice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, my \ndistinguished colleague on the Judiciary Committee, for his kind words. \nSenator Specter, a former prosecutor, is one of the most knowledgeable \npersons on the Judiciary Committee with respect to habeas corpus \nlitigation. He has long been an advocate for habeas reform. Together, \nwe have worked hard to craft a consensus bill that will enact \nmeaningful reform of the Federal habeas corpus process. Today, we are \nintroducing as legislation the product of those labors.\n  I am pleased to join with Senator Specter in introducing legislation \nto reform Federal habeas corpus procedures. This marks an important \nstep in the process of ensuring that convicted criminals receive the \npunishment they justly deserve. A criminal justice system incapable of \nenforcing legally imposed sentences cannot be called just and must be \nreformed.\n  The statutory writ of habeas corpus is an important means of \nguaranteeing that innocent persons will not be illegally imprisoned. \nIndeed, the Constitution guarantees the writ against suspension. \nUnfortunately, this bulwark of liberty has been perverted by those who \nwould seek to frustrate the demands of justice.\n  As of January 1, 1995, there were some 2,976 inmates on death row. \nYet, only 38 prisoners were executed last year, and the States have \nexecuted only 263 criminals since 1973. In 1989, a committee chaired by \nthen-retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell found, among other \nthings, extraordinary delays in the discharge of sentences and an abuse \nof the litigation process. The committee reported that Federal habeas \ncorpus made up approximately 40 percent of the total delay from \nsentence to execution in a random sampling of cases. At that time, the \nshortest of these proceedings lasted for 2.5 years and the longest \nnearly 15 years.\n  The Powell committee concluded that the Federal collateral review \nprocess, with the long separation between sentence and effectuation of \nthat sentence, ``hamper[ed] justice without improving the quality of \nadjudication.'' [Powell Committee Report at 4.] This abuse of habeas \ncorpus litigation, particularly in those cases involving lawfully \nimposed death sentences, has taken a dreadful toll on victims' \nfamilies, seriously eroded the public's confidence in our criminal \njustice system, and drained State criminal justice resources. This was \nnot the system envisioned by the Framers of our Constitution.\n  In my home State of Utah, for example, convicted murderer William \nAndrews delayed the imposition of a constitutionally imposed death \nsentence for over 18 years. The State had to put up millions of dollars \nin precious criminal justice resources to litigate his meritless \nclaims. His guilt was never in question. He was not an innocent person \nseeking freedom from an illegal punishment. Rather, he simply wanted to \nfrustrate the imposition of punishment his heinous crimes warranted.\n  Senator Specter and I have worked to draft a consensus habeas corpus \nreform measure that will respect the traditional roles of State and \nFederal courts, secure the legitimate constitutional rights of the \ndefendant, and restore balance to the criminal justice system.\n  Habeas corpus reform must not discourage legitimate petitions that \nare clearly meritorious and deserve close scrutiny. Meaningful reform \nmust, however, stop repeated assaults upon fair and valid State \nconvictions through spurious petitions filed in Federal court.\n  As a consequence, the reform proposal Senator Specter and I have \nintroduced sets time limits to eliminate unnecessary delay and to \ndiscourage those who would use the system to prevent the imposition of \na just sentence. Manufactured delays breed contempt for the law and \nhave a profound effect on the victims of violent crime.\n  Our proposed legislation limits second or successive Federal \npetitions to claims of factual innocence or in those instances in which \nthe Supreme Court has created a new rule of constitutional law and \napplied that rule retroactively. Our bill also ensures that proper \ndeference is given to the judgments of State courts, who have the \nprimary obligation of trying criminal cases. After all, finality is a \nhallmark of a just system, and must be maintained in order to preserve \nthe legitimacy of the criminal process.\n  Critics of meaningful habeas reform complain that the reformers are \nseeking to destroy the Constitution's guarantees of individual liberty. \nThis specious argument is simply incorrect. It misstates the original \nunderstanding of the habeas process. The legislation Senator Specter \nand I have introduced will uphold the constitutional guarantees of \nfreedom from illegal punishment, while at the same time ensuring that \nlawfully convicted criminals will not be able to twist the criminal \njustice system to their own advantage.\n  I believe that the bill we have introduced today will give the \nAmerican people the crime control legislation they demand and deserve. \nI urge the support of my colleagues for this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD:\n  S. 624. A bill to establish a Science and Mathematics Early Start \nGrant Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n             science and math early start grant program act\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I regard the eight National Education \nGoals we codified in the Goals 2000 legislation as very important \nchallenges; challenges we must make every effort to meet in order to \nensure the future of the Nation. All of these goals are interconnected. \nWe cannot afford to lag behind in any and expect to attain the rest. At \nthis time, it appears that U.S. students continue to lag dangerously \nbehind in mathematics and science achievement.\n  With the passage of Goals 2000 and the ESEA reauthorization, we hope \nto reduce that gap. Yet, there are still glaring holes in our math and \nscience educational programs. The bill I am introducing today is \ndesigned to fill one of those holes. It is that, unfortunately, many \ncurrently funded Federal programs for children, especially preschool \nyoungsters, such as Head Start do not usually include any special \nemphasis on math or science education. Even when math and science are \nincluded as part of the curriculum, they are often the weakest areas of \nemphasis.\n  Ask any parent to list the character traits of preschoolers and high \non the list will be curiosity and a desire to learn ``why.'' These \nchildren are naturally curious and eager to understand the world around \nthem. I believe that we, as a nation of educators, are missing a \ntremendous opportunity when we \n[[Page S4597]] fail to build on this natural curiosity by failing to \nprovide these rich experiences.\n  Federal programs intended to provide additional support for low \nincome children such as Head Start and chapter I should include \nactivities rich in early math and science investigations. It is the \nvery nature of science to answer the question ``why.'' Early exposure \nto age-appropriate, inquiry-based science and mathematics experiences \nwill provide the foundation on which later understanding rests.\n  Why, with rare exception, are educational programs rich in math and \nscience missing from preschool curriculum? I believe that the major \nreason is that most preschool teachers have little experience with \nsimple science and mathematics activities, feel uncomfortable with \nteaching science and mathematics, and are not prepared to teach age-\nappropriate and inquiry-based science and mathematics. This is an area \nof greatest need. While I do not underestimate the importance of \nlanguage development and social experiences that are a large part of \npreschool programs, I feel that we can no longer minimize the \nimportance of early science and math investigations. This is \nparticularly true of the target\n group of Head Start as preschoolers from low-income families often \nhave very limited opportunities to be exposed to science activities.\n\n  It is possible to provide these experiences to preschoolers? The \nanswer is provided by a program conducted at Marylhurst College in \nPortland, OR. This wonderful program, now in its third year, is \ntraining Head Start teachers to use exciting, age-appropriate math and \nscience activities in their classes. Picture the effect these \nactivities have on disadvantaged and minority youth. In all likelihood, \nthis is the first chance these children have to relate math and science \nto their lives. The teacher training program has been conducted for the \npast three years, and the results have been phenomenal.\n  Consider what two teachers, Sherry Wright and Debi Coffey, from the \nAlbina Head Start program in Oregon had to say. ``After two years of \nusing the knowledge we gained from the Marylhurst College instructors, \nwe truly feel confident in using science everyday. Our children have \nlearned how to predict and discover the possible results to a problem. \nOur children will take the science experience that they learned in Head \nStart with them throughout the rest of their lives.''\n  Andrey Sylvia, who had no science classes at all prior to the \nMarylhurst College Head Start Summer Institute, expressed the result \nexcitedly and succinctly. ``Now I am a science whiz!''\n  My legislation provides for a competitive grant program to establish \ndemonstration sites to acquaint preschool teachers with the stimulating \nprocesses involved in the inquiry approach. The teachers themselves \nmust experience the excitement of hands-on activities in order to \ncommunicate that excitement to children. No more than 25 percent of the \nfunds can be used for the purchase of supplies necessary to carry out \nthe activities.\n  A second part of the legislation provides funds to enable Head Start \nteachers to participate in professional development programs in science \nand mathematics teaching methods.\n  We simply cannot afford to miss the opportunity to replicate this \nconcept throughout the preschool and Head Start programs nationwide. \nThese programs are a positive investment in the lives of these \ndisadvantaged children and will create a lifelong interest in math and \nscience. That interest is critical to the future of the children and \nequally critical to the future of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters from the \npresident of Marylhurst College and Sarah Greene, chief executive \nofficer of National Head Start Association, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                           Marylhurst College,\n\n                                   Marylhurst, OR, March 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: As President of Marylhurst College, \n     an accredited, private, liberal arts college dedicated to \n     making innovative post-secondary education accessible to \n     self-directed students of all ages, I am delighted to offer \n     this letter of support for the Science and Math Early Start \n     Grant Program Act.\n       Despite national concern and reform efforts, science and \n     mathematics education for preschool children remains limited, \n     and ample studies demonstrate an even greater lack of science \n     and math skills among low income students. A longitudinal \n     study of disadvantaged children at the Perry Preschool in \n     Ypsilanti, Michigan, found that for every dollar invested, \n     seven dollars were returned to society in terms of higher \n     income and fewer costs related to welfare and crime. Widely \n     recognized as a successful intervention, Head Start provides \n     low income children with basic education, but it has been \n     criticized for not providing discipline-based instruction--\n     especially in science--due to the teachers' lack of \n     educational preparation. In fact, the final Report of the \n     Advisory Committee on Head Start Quality and Expansion (12/\n     93) recommends strengthening staff training and building \n     partnerships with the private sector.\n       Marylhurst designed its Summer Science Institute to address \n     this problem by training Head Start teachers to teach science \n     and encourage their students to develop an interest in \n     science. The pilot Institute--an intensive, experiential, \n     four-week, college credit course covering basic scientific \n     principles--has been offered to 53 Albina Head Start and \n     Portland Public School teachers since 1992. Seventy-five \n     percent reported that the experience completely changed their \n     attitudes about science and their abilities to learn and \n     teach science.\n       According to an independent evaluation by Northwest \n     Regional Educational Laboratory, the Institute made a major \n     contribution to science teaching in the Albina program. NWREL \n     concluded that it also had ``a positive systemic influence on \n     the level of teacher and student self-esteem, which in turn \n     has increased the effectiveness of student learning across \n     their curriculum.'' The Portland Public School evaluation is \n     currently in process. Marylhurst plans to replicate the \n     successful model through Head Start college partnerships.\n       Through the Science and Math Early Start Program Act of \n     1995, Congress can provide seed money to encourage efficient \n     replication of similar programs, which can be maintained \n     without ongoing government support with funding provided by \n     foundations and corporations. This legislation not only \n     ensures that low income children are included in national \n     science and math education reform efforts, but also improves \n     Head Start teacher preparation so that they can better \n     prepare their students for a more technologically and \n     scientifically complex future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Nancy Wilgenbusch,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                              National Head Start Association,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, January 9, 1995.\n     Hon.

Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: The National Head Start Association \n     supports efforts to expand the Summer Science Institute and \n     make it an integral part of the education program for \n     preschoolers. Dr. Nancy Wilgenbush, President, Marylhurst \n     College, presented an overview of the Summer Science \n     Institute to over 5,000 Head Start teachers, administrators, \n     and parents during our annual conference in April 1993. She \n     also conducted a workshop during the conference, it was \n     packed. The presentation resulted in an overwhelming request \n     for more information on project implementation. Our office, \n     as well as Dr. Wilgenbush's, continue receiving such \n     inquiries.\n       After receiving the absolutely positive results of the \n     project conducted in Portland with Albina Head Start \n     teachers, I am convinced of the need to implement the Summer \n     Science Institute nationwide.\n       This early infusion of science for young low income \n     children is essential if we are preparing them for the 21st \n     Century.\n       Thank you for introducing a bill providing funds to \n     implement this project.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Sarah M.

Mr. President, it was with the greatest of \nenthusiasm that I chose to support the line-item veto legislation.\n  In just a few weeks, all of us will be asked to cast our votes to \nraise the debt ceiling for this country to more than $5 trillion. It is \ndifficult to comprehend the enormity of this figure. If you took those \n5 trillion individual dollars and laid them end to end, they would span \nthe vast icy distance between the Earth and Moon almost 2,000 times.\n  The line-item veto represents a small but most significant first step \ntoward processes to ensure greater fiscal responsibility. I believe the \nmeasure that we recently passed is the best workable compromise between \nvarious approaches and will make this legislation very effective. I am \nparticularly pleased by the inclusion of a ``lockbox'' provision to \nensure that any spending that is ``zeroed out'' is earmarked for \ndeficit reduction.\n  Our past experience with spending patterns here in Congress \ndemonstrates why it was crucial to include this provision. I have seen \na number of programs terminated on the Senate floor, after hours of \nspirited debate centered around the question--``can we afford it''? \nAfter concluding that we could not afford the program in question, we \nterminated the program, then failed to adjust the spending caps \ndownward, meaning that we simply spent the money on something else. \nSuch a ``loophole'' in this legislation would be a costly and \ndestructive provision that would make a mockery of this measure. \nWithout the lockbox provision the President could terminate a program \nwith an eye toward seeing those funds reprogrammed in another \ndirection. Or, Congress could simply retitle or reallocate the funding \nitems which failed to pass muster. That would subvert the clear \nintention of this sharpened tool, which is to enable the President to \nassist in slowing down and reducing Government spending.\n  What pleases me the most about this legislation is that its modified \nform will permit the President to confront the problem of rising \nentitlement spending. This is, as we well know, the fastest growing \ncategory of Federal spending, and the single greatest cause of runaway \ndebt. In the past, one overused tactic used to evade the discipline of \ndiscretionary spending caps has been to promote new programs in the \nform of mandatory entitlements. This designation has shielded them from \nannual scrutiny through the appropriations process and creates an ever \nexpanding ``black hole'' into which our Federal dollars disappear. \nGiving the President a chance to ward off future trespasses in area \nwill make this legislation much more effective in controlling spending.\n  Opponents of this measure have criticized the line-item veto on the \nbasis of or experience with it at the State level. Sometimes they say \nthat such authority is not easily applied at the Federal level, or \nworse yet, that it does not even work in the States. The latter \ncontention is simply flat-out wrong. The line-item veto does work \neffectively at the State level. We heard testimony to that effect in \nthe Judiciary Committee, where we learned of countless instances in \nwhich governors have used the power to eliminate wasteful spending from \nappropriations bills. It is one reason why no State has a fiscal crisis \non the order of compare to our Federal deficit.\n  I fully understand the sincerity of opponents of this measure when \nthey voice fears that the line-item veto would give to much power to \nthe President. The allegation has been made that the President could \nuse this power to punish individual legislators, indeed to carry out a \npersonal vendetta against a particular Congressman or Senator. I simply \nbelieve that due reflection on this matter will show that there is \nlittle to fear from such a situation occurring. First of all, these \nvetoes will not be made in secret. The press will eagerly report on the \nitems \n[[Page S4599]] rescinded, and they will be\n evaluated in their own right, quite apart from any personal issues \nsurrounding them. Regardless of the President's personal feelings about \nany legislator, the final test of the issue will be whether or not the \nspending is appropriate. Both the President and the Congress will have \nto make the appropriate case as to whether or not the spending should \noccur.\n\n  I was extremely pleased when Bill Clinton, as a candidate for the \nPresidency, indicated his support for a line-item veto. We on our side \nof the aisle, have delivered such an option to him. It is a good time \nto do it--with a Republican Congress and Democratic President. It is a \nclear indication that this should not be a partisan issue. It should be \nan issue around which fiscally responsible legislators on both sides \ncan rally.\n  Many of my colleagues are already very familiar with a process that I \nhave seen too often in my 16 years of Senate service. We send a popular \nbill down to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue only after we have \nloaded it up with a pile of pet pork projects, knowing full well that \nthe President has to swallow everything in order to get the provisions \nthat are so desired by him. There might be clearly wasteful spending in \nthat package, but the President must nonetheless feel compelled to sign \nthe bill simply because it is the only way to preserve ``essential'' \nspending or other legislative language.\n  This problem is compounded when the President is sent the \nappropriations bills at the 11th hour of the congressional session. The \nPresident must sign those, or else risk a temporary shutdown of vial \nGovernment functions.\n  The veto in its current form is a terribly crude blunt instrument, \nand it does not enable the President to deal effectively with these \nsituations. Passage of the line-item veto will finely make it a more \nprecise and agile tool, one which can be surgically wielded effectively \non behalf of the U.S. taxpayer.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4598-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CUBA: TIME TO CHANGE DIRECTION\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, my colleagues in the Senate know \nthat I think that the policy of the United States toward Cuba does not \nmake any sense at all.\n  I have introduced a bill which would permit Americans to travel to \nCuba. To deny travel to any place, other than for security reasons, is \nan infringement of basic free speech.\n  We have to be able to learn as much as we can everywhere. To restrict \ntravel is to restrict the thought and learning process.\n  The New York Times recently had an editorial titled ``Cuba: Time to \nChange Direction.''\n  It points out the ridiculousness of our present Cuban policy.\n  I ask that the New York Times editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 19, 1995]\n\n                     Cuba: Time to Change Direction\n\n       The sight of Fidel Castro in a business suit being escorted \n     about Paris this week as an honored guest deserves some \n     consideration in Washington. With the Soviet Union gone and \n     the cold war over, the only threat that the Cuban Communist \n     poses to the United States lies in the imagination of \n     ideological warriors like Senator Jesse Helms. While the time \n     has not yet come to welcome Mr. Castro to Washington, a re-\n     examination of Cuba policy is long overdue. The embargo of \n     Cuba, begun when John Kennedy occupied the White House and \n     Nikita Khrushchev was Soviet leader, has outlived its \n     usefulness.\n       Conservatives still cling to the notion that isolating Cuba \n     and creating misery for its people will eventually cause an \n     uprising and sweep Mr. Castro from power. Now that he is \n     without Soviet support and his economy is in tatters, they \n     reason, sanctions should be tightened.\n       This scenario is unwise and inhumane. Cuba will survive \n     because other nations are investing there and are not \n     participating in the embargo. Last year when a resolution \n     against the embargo came up at the U.N., it passed by 101 \n     votes to 2. The kind of outright rebellion envisioned by \n     Senator Helms and some Cuban-Americans, if it did occur, \n     would bring bloodshed and more misery for many Cubans. At a \n     time when Washington is trying hard to encourage peaceful \n     transitions elsewhere in the region and world, it makes \n     little sense to encourage bloodshed in Cuba.\n       An increasing number of younger, more moderate Cuban-\n     Americans are fed up with the revenge fantasies of their \n     elders, and would like to see more dialogue and commerce with \n     Mr. Castro's regime. They feel that his repressive policies \n     could not continue for long if the barriers were lifted and \n     ordinary Cubans could have a taste of material success and a \n     whiff of personal freedom from the north. Washington's \n     anachronistic policy may even help Mr. Castro, by giving him \n     a convenient scapegoat for all his failure at home.\n       Without the embargo, the excuses would be gone. Open \n     communication with the United States, freedom for Cuban-\n     Americans to invest in businesses back home, and access to \n     North American goods could be first steps. More favorable \n     trade conditions could be held out as incentives to further \n     reforms. Mr. Castro's Paris visit illustrated the power of \n     the friendly gesture. After his warm reception by President \n     Mitterrand, Mr. Castro agreed to allow a French human rights \n     group to visit.\n       There should be gradations in American policy toward \n     repressive governments. When American national security is \n     potentially threatened, as with Iran and its efforts to \n     develop nuclear weapons, Washington is justified in banning \n     commerce. In cases like China and Cuba, where internal \n     policies are anathema to Americans but American security is \n     not at risk, commerce can be encouraged but trade privileges \n     should be withheld.\n       Scuttling the embargo would take some political courage. \n     All the White House had to do last week to inspire Mr. \n     Helms's wrath was to hint that it might consider lifting some \n     additional sanctions imposed last year during the immigration \n     crisis. But the political clout of the Cuban exile community \n     has diminished in recent years as more Cuban-Americans have \n     abandoned the traditional confrontational stance.\n       Long gone are the days when Soviet troops and bases in Cuba \n     represented a real threat to the United States and Mr. Castro \n     was exporting arms and revolution in the hemisphere. Cuba, \n     absent the ghosts of the cold war, is an impoverished \n     neighbor of the United States led by a dictator overtaken by \n     history. American policy should reflect that reality rather \n     than a world that no longer exists.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4599-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4599-S4601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   NICKLES-REID SUBSTITUTE TO S. 219\n\n Mr. NICKLES.

and\n       (ii) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under \n     subsection (a)(1) on such date.\n       (B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect \n     the requirement under subsection (a)(1) that a report must be \n     submitted to Congress before a final rule can take effect.\n       (3) Actual effective date not affected.--A rule described \n     under paragraph (1) shall take effect as a final rule as \n     otherwise provided by law (including other subsections of \n     this section).\n       (e) Treatment of Rules Issued Before This Act.--\n       (1) Opportunity for congressional review.--The provisions \n     of section 4 shall apply to any significant rule that is \n     published in the Federal Register (as a rule that shall take \n     effect as a final rule) during the period beginning on \n     November 20, 1994, through the date on which this Act takes \n     effect.\n       (2) Treatment under section 4.--In applying section 4 for \n     purposes of Congressional review, a rule described under \n     paragraph (1) shall be treated as though--\n       (A) such rule were published in the Federal Register (as a \n     rule that shall take effect as a final rule) on the date of \n     the enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under \n     subsection (a)(1) on such date.\n       (3) Actual effective date not affected.--The effectiveness \n     of a rule described under paragraph (1) shall be as otherwise \n     provided by law, unless the rule is made of no force or \n     effect under section 4.\n       (f) Nullification of Rules Disapproved by Congress.--Any \n     rule that takes effect and later is made of no force or \n     effect by the enactment of a joint resolution under section 4 \n     shall be treated as though such rule had never taken effect.\n       (g) No Inference to be Drawn Where Rules Not Disapproved.--\n     If the Congress does not enact a joint resolution of \n     disapproval under section 4, no court or agency may infer any \n     intent of the Congress from any action or inaction of the \n     Congress with regard to such rule, related statute, or joint \n     resolution of disapproval.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL PROCEDURE.\n\n       (a) Joint Resolution Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term \"joint resolution\" means only a joint \n     resolution introduced after the date on which the report \n     referred to in section 3(a) is received by Congress the \n     matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: \n     ``That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the ____ \n     relating to ____, and such rule shall have no force or \n     effect.'' (The blank spaces being appropriately filled in.)\n       (b) Referral.--\n       (1) In general.--A resolution described in paragraph (1) \n     shall be referred to the committees in each House of Congress \n     with jurisdiction. Such a resolution may not be reported \n     before the eighth day after its submission or publication \n     date.\n       (2) Submission date.--For purposes of this subsection the \n     term ``submission or publication date'' means the later of \n     the date on which--\n       (A) the Congress receives the report submitted under \n     section 3(a)(1); or\n       (B) the rule is published in the Federal Register.\n       (c) Discharge.--If the committee to which is referred a \n     resolution described in subsection (a) has not reported such \n     resolution (or an identical resolution) at the end of 20 \n     calendar days after the submission or publication date \n     defined under subsection (b)(2), such committee may be \n     discharged by the Majority Leader of the Senate or the \n     Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, as the case \n     may be, from further consideration of such resolution and \n     such resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar \n     of the House involved.\n       (d) Floor Consideration.--\n       (1) In general.--When the committee to which a resolution \n     is referred has reported, or when a committee is discharged \n     (under subsection (c)) from further consideration of, a \n     resolution described in subsection (a), it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for a motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of the resolution, and all points of order \n     against the resolution (and against consideration of \n     resolution) are waived. The motion is not subject to \n     amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n     disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, the \n     resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the \n     respective House until disposed of.\n       (2) Debate.--Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable \n     motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n     to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally \n     between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A \n     motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. \n     An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion \n     to recommit the resolution is not in order.\n       (3) Final passage.--Immediately following the conclusion of \n     the debate on a resolution described in subsection (a), and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate \n     House, the vote on final passage of the resolution shall \n     occur.\n       (4) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the Chair \n     relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the \n     procedure relating to a resolution described in subsection \n     (a) shall be decided without debate.\n       (e) Treatment if Other House Has Acted.--If, before the \n     passage by one House of a resolution of that House described \n     in subsection (a), that House receives from the other House a \n     resolution described in subsection (a), then the following \n     procedures shall apply:\n       (1) Nonreferral.--The resolution of the other House shall \n     not be referred to a committee.\n       (2) Final passage.--With respect to a resolution described \n     in subsection (a) of the House receiving the resolution--\n       (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of \n     the other House.\n       (f) Constitutional Authority.--This section is enacted by \n     Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution described in \n     subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n     SEC. 5. SPECIAL RULE ON STATUTORY, REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL \n                   DEADLINES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the case of any deadline for, relating \n     to, or involving any significant rule which does not take \n     effect (or the effectiveness of which is terminated) because \n     of the enactment of a joint resolution under section 4, that \n     deadline is extended until the date 12 months after the date \n     of the joint resolution. Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to affect a deadline merely by reason of the \n     postponement of a rule's effective date under section 3(a).\n       (b) Deadline Defined.--The term ``deadline'' means any date \n     certain for fulfilling any obligation or exercising any \n     authority established by or under any Federal statute or \n     regulation, or by or under any court order implementing any \n     Federal statute or regulation.\n\n     SEC. 6.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act and shall apply to any significant rule that takes \n     effect as a final rule on or after such effective \n     date.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4599-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to speak \nbriefly about yesterday's approval by the Senate of line-item veto \nlegislation, which I supported. By giving the President and the \nCongress separate enrollment of appropriated items, new tax \nexpenditures and new entitlements, we are better able to maximize our \nlimited resources, make the wisest investments in our people and our \nNation, and move more responsibly toward a balanced Federal budget.\n  Will a line-item veto solve all our fiscal problems? No, of course \nnot. But I reject the notion that we should not use all available means \nto force the President and the Congress to prioritize Federal spending. \nOur inability, or unwillingness, to make these difficult choices has \nled to a nearly $5 trillion national debt.\n  Was the measure perfect? No, and I understand the legitimate concerns \nmany Members of this body had about a line-item veto. I think most \nwould agree, however, that changes need to be made in our budget \nprocess. Our $5 trillion debt is a testament to that fact. The \ndifferences lie in identifying the most desirable means to achieve \nresponsible reform.\n  As I see it, the current problem lies in the fact that the Congress \ncan ignore the rescissions proposed by the President. While the \nPresident can veto an entire appropriations bill, doing so forces the \nPresident to disapprove items which he supports as well. Thus, unless \nappropriations bills contain a particularly egregious item or items, \nPresidents now generally sign them, thereby permitting spending he \nconsiders unnecessary to continue in order to avoid striking down other \nitems which he does approve.\n  The separate enrollment of each item will allow the President to \nreach only those items he disapproves, and Congress will have to accept \nthose rescissions unless they are reinstated by a two-thirds vote in \nboth the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n  Does this cede power to the President? Certainly. But, I am willing \nto give the Chief Executive a strong check on spending.\n  I am willing to give our President the tools to make some tough \nfiscal decisions because a chief executive has, in my judgment, a \nsingular ability to envision national priorities and reconcile intense \ncompetition between disparate interests. It is infinitely easier for \none individual to prioritize spending than it is for 535 individuals \nwith varied and specific interests.\n  Not only will the measure passed last night allow the President to \nstrike items in appropriations bills, but it will also allow the \nPresident to strike authorizations of new tax expenditures and new \ndirect spending. These other types of spending contribute to our \ndeficit even more than appropriated items, and should be included. To \nresponsibly control spending, we have to put all options on the table.\n  I would, however, have preferred that the language covering tax \nexpenditures been made more clear in the legislation. While I believe \nthat the language included meets the same objectives as the Bradley \namendment, of which I was a cosponsor, I believe we should have made it \nclear and free of all ambiguity that tax breaks are on the table. \nNonetheless, I believe the language of similarly situated taxpayers \nwill be interpreted broadly which will subject a wide range of tax \nbreaks to a Presidential veto.\n  Mr. President, this body acted responsibly yesterday in approving \nline-item veto legislation. As a former Governor who had line-item veto \nauthority, I understand its importance in imposing a measure of fiscal \ndiscipline on the budget process. We urgently need this discipline at \nthe Federal level.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4601-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               THE DOLLAR'S DECLINE AS DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we are receiving regular reminders \nobliquely of the need for a balanced budget amendment.\n  In Sunday's Washington Post Jane Bryant Quinn's column ends with the \nwords: ``Big cuts in the Federal deficit would improve confidence \nabroad. But Congress and the voters aren't there yet.''\n  And in a column by Stan Hinden there is reference to Donald P. Gould, \na California money manager of a mutual fund.\n  In the Hinden column, among other things, he says: ``Gould noted that \nthe global strength of the dollar has been slipping for 25 years--\nexcept for an upward blip in the early 1980s.''\n  It is not sheer coincidence that for 26 years in a row we have been \noperating with a budget deficit.\n  Hinden also notes in his column: ``Since 1970, the dollar has lost \nmore than 60 percent of its value in relation to the German mark and \nhas dropped almost 75 percent in relation to the Japanese yen. In 1970, \nit took 3.65 German marks to buy one U.S. dollar. As of last week, you \ncould buy a dollar with only 1.40 marks.''\n  I served in Germany in the Army after World War II, and I remember it \ntook a little more than 4 marks to buy a dollar.\n  The Washington Post writer also notes: ``Gould, who is president and \nfounder of the Franklin Templeton Global Trust--which used to be called \nthe Huntington Funds--is not optimistic about the dollar's future. He \nsees little chance that the United States will be able to solve the \nfiscal and economic problems that have helped the dollar depreciate.''\n  We are getting that message from people all over the world.\n  I cannot understand why we do not listen\n  Finally, Donald Gould is quoted as saying: ``For the first time I am \naware of, during a global flight to quality, that quality has been \ndefined as marks and yen and not dollars.''\n  I hope we start paying attention to this kind of information.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/24/senate-section/article/S4601-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4601-S4602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
