What would we do and say today if we loved You with all our \nhearts? How would we deal with the present challenges we face here in \nthe Senate if we put You and the welfare of our Nation first above all \nelse? What do You want us to do to move forward?\n  You have taught us, ``If you have faith as a mustard seed, you will \nsay to this mountain, `Move from here to there' and it will move; and \nnothing will be impossible for you.''\n  Is Your promise applicable to us in our circumstances? Will You give \nus power to remove the mountainous differences that often divide us if \nwe have faith in You--even as small as a mustard seed?

The \nSenate will immediately resume consideration of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 57, the concurrent budget resolution, and will begin a \nlengthy series of consecutive rollcall votes, all on or in relationship \nto amendments. The first vote will be 15 minutes in length, but all \nremaining votes in the sequence are limited to 10 minutes in length. \nSenators are asked--implored--to remain in or around the Senate Chamber \nthroughout this voting sequence in order to facilitate the votes and \nhope to complete action on the budget resolution before a late hour \ntonight.\n  Again, I plead with the Senators to stay on the floor so we can go \nthrough this series of votes. It inconveniences all Senators when we \nhave one or two that get lost down the hall. Please stay close. I \nbelieve we can finish this series of votes in a reasonable period of \ntime.\n  I want to thank the managers of the bill, the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking member from Nebraska. They have been working \nhard to get through this list of amendments. I know they will continue \nto work to see if the long list can be reduced further by voice vote, \nor whatever, throughout the day. I ask for all possible cooperation \nwith them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5461-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1788\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I ask unanimous consent for a modification of amendment No. \n4019, the Dole-Hatch-Helms sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, the amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4019), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       The Senate finds that--\n       Drug use is devastating to the nation, particularly among \n     juveniles and has led juveniles to become involved in \n     interstate gangs and to participate in violent crime;\n       Drug use has experienced a dramatic resurgence among our \n     youth;\n       The number of youths aged 12-17 using marijuana has \n     increased from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.9 million in 1994, \n     and the category of ``recent marijuana use'' increased a \n     staggering 200% among 14 to 15-year-olds over the same \n     period.\n       The Senate finds that--\n       Since 1992, there has been a 52% jump in the number of high \n     school seniors using drugs on a monthly basis, even as \n     worrisome declines are noted in peer disapproval of drug use;\n       1 in 3 high school students uses marijuana;\n       12 to 17-year-olds who use marijuana are 85% more likely to \n     graduate to cocaine than those who abstain from marijuana;\n       Juveniles who reach 21 without ever having used drugs \n     almost never try them later in life;\n       The latest results from the Drug Abuse Warning Network show \n     that marijuana-related episodes jumped 39% and are running at \n     155% above the 1990 level, and that methamphetamine cases \n     have risen 256% over the 1991 level;\n       Between February 1993 and February 1995 the retail price of \n     a gram of cocaine fell from $172 to $137, and that of a gram \n     of heroin also fell from $2,032 to $1,278;\n       It has been reported that the Department of Justice, \n     through the United States Attorney for the Southern District \n     of California, has adopted a policy of allowing certain \n     foreign drug smugglers to avoid prosecution altogether by \n     being released to Mexico;\n       It has been reported that in the past year approximately \n     2,300 suspected narcotics traffickers were taken into custody \n     for bringing illegal drugs across the border, but \n     approximately one in four were returned to their country \n     of origin without being prosecuted;\n       It has been reported that the U.S. Customs Service is \n     operating under guidelines limiting any prosecution in \n     marijuana cases to cases involving 125 pounds of marijuana or \n     more;\n       It has been reported that suspects possessing as much as 32 \n     pounds of methamphetamine and 37,000 Quaalude tablets, were \n     not prosecuted but were, instead, allowed to return to their \n     countries of origin after their drugs and vehicles were \n     confiscated;\n       It has been reported that after a seizure of 158 pounds of \n     cocaine, one defendant was cited and released because there \n     was no room at the federal jail and charges against her were \n     dropped;\n       It has been reported that some smugglers have been caught \n     two or more times--even in the same week--yet still were not \n     prosecuted;\n       The number of defendants prosecuted for violations of the \n     federal drug laws has dropped from 25,033 in 1992 to 22,926 \n     in 1995;\n       This Congress has increased the funding of the Federal \n     Bureau of Prisons by 11.7% over the 1995 appropriations \n     level;\n       This Congress has increased the funding of the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service by 23.5% over the 1995 \n     appropriations level; therefore\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals \n     underlying this resolution assume that the Attorney General \n     promptly should investigate this matter and report, within 30 \n     days, to the Chair of the Senate and House Committees on the \n     Judiciary; and\n       The Attorney General should ensure that cases involving the \n     smuggling of drugs into the United States are vigorously \n     prosecuted.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nminutes on the procedures that we are about to begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we are about to begin a series of what \nprobably will be about 30 or more rollcall votes. These votes will \noccur in the order of the amendments as they were introduced and \ndebated on the Senate floor.\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\n  Each offerer of an amendment should be prepared to deliver a 30-\nsecond statement in favor of the amendment immediately prior to the \nvote on the amendment. This will require, if we are going to do it this \nway, the offerer of these amendments to make sure they are on the floor \nand prepared to go. Otherwise, the process is going to bog down. Under \nthe unanimous-consent agreement and the Budget Act, the offerer of the \namendment will control 30 seconds, and the majority manager, Senator \nDomenici, will control 30 seconds if he opposes the amendment. Only if \nthe chairman favors the amendment will this Senator control 30 seconds \nin opposition.\n  I urge Senators to prepare three crisp sentences that they want to \nsay in favor of their amendment. It will be unlikely that Senators will \nhave time to say more than that. I also urge Senators to make every \neffort, as has been said by the acting majority leader, Senator Lott, \nto be here on the floor at all times and, certainly as a priority \nmeasure, immediately before their amendment is scheduled for 1 minute, \nequally divided, of debate. Then we will go to a vote. I thank all \nSenators for their assistance in expediting the process. We have had \ngood cooperation, and I hope that will continue today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 1 minute equally divided between \nthe sides on each vote.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, 1 minute equally divided, so 30 seconds \neach?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side gets 30 seconds.\n  Mr. FORD. It is hard to say good morning in 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. We are going to have to change the procedures in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Are we ready to proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the Boxer amendment is first.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3892\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 3892 \noffered by the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer].\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Medicaid serves many of our citizens in \nnursing homes and serves millions of disabled children who are in \nwheelchairs, and millions of our working families. This budget hurts \nthose people. We would add back $18 billion, bringing Medicaid up to \nthe President's level. It is still below the Breaux-Chafee level. If \nyou vote for Breaux-Chafee, you should vote for this. If you voted for \nthe President's budget, you should vote for this. We hope you will \nsupport this. We pay for it by closing corporate tax loopholes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say to the distinguished whip \nand Senator Exon, the reason I was delayed, we are having a rather \nmajor disaster in my State, and a lot of agencies got together to see \nwhat they might do about it. I apologize to the Senate for not being \nhere promptly at 9:15.\n\n  The Boxer amendment would increase taxes and Medicaid spending by $18 \nbillion. It also contains sense-of-the-Senate language requiring the \nmaintaining of current law provisions on individual rights to sue in \nFederal courts, spousal impoverishment, and many other things. This is \nprecisely the direction we do not want to go in, and we do not want to \nraise taxes to pay for more spending.\n  I move to table the Boxer amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment offered by the Senator from California [Mrs. \nBoxer].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 120 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3982) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to yield immediately. Might I just remind \nSenators that was supposed to be a 15-minute vote. How long did it \ntake?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question now is the----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How long did we \nspend on the last vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Twenty-two minutes instead of fifteen. That will never \nget the job done unless you want to stay until midnight or all day \ntomorrow at 22 minutes each. The next time we have a rollcall vote, we \nhave already had unanimous consent that it is 10 minutes, and I would \nsay to Senators I have been authorized to call regular order at the end \nof 10 minutes, so I hope you are here and vote.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. EXON. The other thing I remind the Senate is, we are going to be \nhere today, as we usually are not, one vote after another. That tends \nto increase conversations on the Senate floor. That also is going to \ntake an awful lot of time away from us. Please leave the floor if you \nare going to have extended conversation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3984, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3984 offered by the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden].\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk and ask unanimous consent that the amendment be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3984), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Corporations and individuals have clear responsibility \n     to adhere to environmental laws. When they do not, and \n     environmental damage results, the federal and state \n     governments may impose fines and penalties, and assess \n     polluters for the cost of remediation.\n       (2) Assessment of these costs is important in the \n     enforcement process. They appropriately penalize wrongdoing. \n     They discourage future environmental damage. They ensure that \n     taxpayers do not bear the financial brunt of cleaning up \n     after damages done by polluters.\n       (3) In the case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster in \n     Prince William Sound, Alaska, for example, the corporate \n     settlement with the federal government totaled $900 million.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that assumptions in this resolution assume an appropriate \n     amount of revenues per year through legislation that will not \n     allow deductions for fines and penalties arising from a \n     failure to comply with federal or state environmental or \n     health protection laws.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, this amendment has been \nagreed to by both the majority and the minority. It simply says, if a \npolluter\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\nengages in action that violates our environmental laws and that action \nresults in a penalty or a fine, those actions would no longer be \ndeductible under our tax law.\n  Senator Kerry of Massachusetts joins me in this. I thank Senator \nDomenici of New Mexico and Senator Exon for support of this amendment, \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Finance Committee has reviewed this \nand made some modifications, and since it is acceptable to the Finance \nCommittee, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3984, as modified, offered by the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden].\n  The amendment (No. 3984), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3985\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the Wellstone \namendment, No. 3985.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, since I have just 30 seconds, this is \nan amendment that I proposed. It is a leadership amendment on our side \nwhich addresses the sense of the Senate that any tax revenue raised by \nthe Finance Committee that does not go toward a child tax credit will \nbe used to finance a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for higher \neducation tuition or to help pay off student loan interest or for \nstrict budget deficit reduction.\n  I cannot think of an issue that is more important to a broad section \nof the population than to be able to finance higher education for \nfamilies.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Wellstone amendment, although it is \na sense of the Senate and not binding, would tie the hands of the \nFinance Committee. The Senator from New Mexico does not think that is \nwhat we want to do.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the \namendment offered by my colleague Senator Wellstone. As I understand \nthe Wellstone amendment, it requires any tax revenues raised in excess \nof the amount needed to pay for a per-child tax credit be allocated \ntoward a $10,000 annual deduction for higher education tuition and \nstudent loan interest costs or for deficit reduction. After careful \nconsideration, and notwithstanding my support for the respective goals \nof deficit reduction and education assistance, I have concluded that I \nam unable to support the Wellstone amendment. Let me tell you why.\n  Mr. President, although I share Senator Wellstone's commitment to \nincreasing educational opportunities and easing the burdens associated \nwith the costs of higher education, I do not share his all-or-nothing \napproach to determining our Federal budget priorities. Our Nation faces \na number of difficult and complicated challenges arising out of our \nfailure to reduce the Federal budget deficit, to achieve sustained \neconomic growth, and to increase the global competitiveness of the \nNation's labor force.\n  I believe that the only way to meet these challenges is to adopt a \ncomprehensive plan of action that moves the Nation forward on every \nfront. Recognizing the need for such action, the members of the \nCentrist coalition offered a budget that called for deficit reduction, \neconomic growth, and education incentives. Moreover, all of our \nproposals were paid for by spending reductions and elimination of \nloopholes benefiting special interests and foreign corporations. \nFinally, Mr. President, the members of the centrist group concluded \nthat these investments and reforms would yield the maximum possible \nbenefit if they were enacted as part of a comprehensive package.\n  With respect to the education incentives, our group proposed a two-\npart package. The first component called for the enactment of an above-\nthe-line deduction for interest expenses paid on education loans. The \nsecond component was an additional above-the-line deduction for \nqualified education expenses paid for the education or training of the \ntaxpayer, his or her spouse, or the taxpayer's dependents.\n  As the centrist proposal demonstrated, it is possible to craft a \nbudget that fairly and equitably addresses our needs in critical areas \nsuch as education without excluding other important national \npriorities. Unfortunately, the Wellstone amendment leaves no room for \nmany of the economic reforms--such as capital gains and estate tax \nreform and small business incentives--that are also critical to \nproviding economic security for all of our citizens. It is this \nshortcoming that, in my opinion, creates a fatal flaw in my colleague's \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, although I am unable to support Senator Wellstone in \nthis particular instance, I do look forward to working with him, and \nothers, to find bipartisan solutions to the challenges that lie ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last month I introduced the Commonsense \nMiddle-Class Tax Relief Act which embodies the principles outlined in \nthis sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by the Senator from \nMinnesota. I enthusiastically support the pending amendment.\n  Too many hard-working families in Iowa and across the country are \nworried about a lot of things--and of paramount concern is their \nability to pay for college, for their children and for themselves. \nFamilies are struggling to pay the college tuition bill and student \ndebt is soaring. Middle-income families need a break.\n  The 1992 median income for families with children in Iowa was \n$35,100. Right now it costs $6,108 to pay tuition, fees, and room and \nboard for a year at the University of Iowa. The cost is about the same \nat Iowa State. There is no doubt the average working family in Iowa is \nhaving great difficulty paying for 4 years of college for their \nchildren.\n  But these families know that the key to a better future for their \nfamilies is intricately linked to a good education, including college \nand vocational training. Therefore, they are doing whatever they can to \nsend their kids to college. And for many, that means accumulating big \ndebts to pay for those educations.\n  Over the past decade and a half, college aid in the form of grants \nhas decreased and has been replaced by an increased reliance on loans. \nThe cost of attending the University of Northern Iowa is about $5,700. \nOver the past few years the average debt of students graduating from \nthis very modestly priced state university has been climbing. For the \n1990-91 school year, the average debt was $2,589 and rose to $4,395 for \n1994-95.\n  It is clear that many students are borrowing to pay for college. \nThese students and their families need help.\n  Today, middle-class Americans are working longer hours for smaller \npaychecks. This amendment would pave the way to provide a tax deduction \nfor college tuition and interest on student loans--giving American \nfamilies a raise in incomes, a raise in education and skills, and a \nraise in living standards.\n  The Commonsense Middle-Class Tax Relief Act and this amendment are \nbased on a fundamental premise: A higher education means higher income.\n  This amendment would cut taxes on hard-working families trying to get \nahead, raise incomes, and prepare Americans for the 21st century. It \nwill mean higher incomes, higher education, and higher quality jobs for \nhard-working Americans.\n  Mr. President, education is key to both the raising of incomes of \naverage Americans and to increasing the competitiveness of America in \nan increasingly global economy.\n  We should be able to agree on a bipartisan basis that this type of \nimportant middle-class tax relief is needed and will mean better \nopportunities and better incomes for millions of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \ncommonsense proposal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the motion to table \namendment No. 3985, offered by the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. \nWellstone].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n\n[[Page S5465]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendments are as follows: Wellstone, No. 3989; Snowe, No. \n4017; Faircloth, No. 4024.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3989, 4017, and 4024) were agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3986\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 3986 \noffered by the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone]. There will be 1 \nminute equally divided for debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May we have order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. The Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is to make sure we have the funds for the hiring \nof new police under the COPS Program in fiscal year 1997. This comes \ndirectly out of the violent crime reduction trust fund which we passed \nas a part of the crime bill in 1994. We were all very clear in our \ncommitment that the money would come out of this fund and the \ncommitment would be lived up to and it would be money that would be \nspent on the COPS Program. As a Senate, we made that commitment, and \nthis amendment just makes sure that we confirm that commitment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield back the 30 seconds that I have \nin opposition.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4028 to Amendment No. 3986\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for the violent crime reduction trust \n   fund programs in 2001 and 2002 with offsetting reductions and to \nexpress the sense of the Senate regarding administrative funding of the \n        President's public safety and community policing grants)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in \nbehalf of Senator Abraham and Senator Coverdell and ask that Senator \nAbraham be permitted to use the 30 seconds to describe his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Abraham, for himself, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Hatch, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 4028 to amendment No. 3986.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the pending amendment, strike all after ``SEC.  .'' and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE STATUS OF THE PRESIDENT'S \n                   ``COPS'' PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) It is the Sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the function totals and aggregates in this budget \n     resolution assume:\n       (1) full funding for the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund \n     through the Fiscal Year 2002; and\n       (2) that administrative funding for the Public Safety and \n     Community Policing grants should be reduced by half of the \n     President's request for the following reasons:\n       (A) in an interview with the New York Times on May 12, \n     1996, a senior presidential aid claimed that, under the COPS \n     program, ``43,000 of the 100,000 cops will be on the \n     street'';\n       (B) contrary to this claim, in a press conference Thursday, \n     May 16, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno stated that, ``What \n     I am advised is that there are 17,000 officers that can be \n     identified as being on the streets'' as a result of the COPS \n     program; and\n       (C) While the number of police officers actually placed on \n     the streets under the COPS program has lagged far behind the \n     White House's misleading claims, the President's request to \n     fund 310 administrative positions to oversee the COPS program \n     is an excessive $29,185,000.\n       The number on page 37, line 17, is deemed to be increased \n     by the amount of $1,900,000,000.\n       The number on page 37, line 18, is deemed to be increased \n     by the amount of $3,000,000,000.\n       The number on Page 37, line 24, is deemed to be increased \n     by the amount of $400,000,000.\n       The number on Page 37, line 25, is deemed to be increased \n     by the amount of $1,550,000,000.\n       The number on Page 32, line 6, is deemed to be decreased by \n     the amount of $1,900,000,000.\n       The number on Page 32, line 7, is deemed to be decreased by \n     the amount of $3,000,000,000.\n       The number on Page 32, line 13, is deemed to be decreased \n     by the amount of $400,000,000.\n       The number on Page 32, line 14, is deemed to be decreased \n     by the amount of $1,550,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment offered by myself, Senator \nHatch and Senator Coverdell is designed to effectuate the goals of the \nfirst-degree amendment, but rather than doing it by sense of the \nSenate, we actually want to get the job done.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. Senators want to talk. We cannot hear what the speakers are \nsaying. It is delaying things.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan will suspend until \norder is restored in the Senate. The Senate will come to order. \nSenators please take their conversations outside. The Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The objective of our amendment is to actually accomplish the goal of \nfunding the violent crime reduction trust fund for the years 2001 and \n2002. The trust fund is currently set to expire just 4 years from now. \nThis amendment keeps the fund going through the year 2002, providing \nnecessary support for prison grants, the COPS Program, the Violence \nAgainst Women Program, and so on.\n  To pay for it, we have offset funds from the 600-function programs \nfor the years 2001 and 2002. We point out that even with this offset, \nthere will still be more dollars in this budget for those programs than \nwas in the administration's request for those programs, and, therefore, \nwe think this is an effective way to both guarantee adequate funding \nfor 600 programs and maintain the violent crime reduction trust fund.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I have 30 seconds for a response?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the second-degree amendment does not \nsay anything about whether or not the funding is going to be there next \nyear for the COPS Program. That is the commitment we made. We made the \ncommitment it would come out of this\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\nviolent crime reduction trust fund, and we should honor that \ncommitment.\n  What the Senator is representing is that it can come from the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, it can come from aid for kids \nwith spinal bifida, MS, cerebral palsy.\n  This is a very different amendment. We made a commitment for full \nfunding in this trust fund. That is why we should support the amendment \nI offered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nAbraham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending question is amendment No. 3987 \noffered by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This sense-of-the-Senate simply says that in this \nbudget resolution the Congress shall not enact or adopt any legislation \nthat would increase the number of children who are hungry or homeless, \nand if in fact that does happen, that we take a look at it. And we \nwould revisit the provisions of any such legislation that would have \nthat effect.\n  I hope I will get a strong vote for this. It was introduced in the \nbeginning of this Congress and defeated. But then it was passed on a \nvoice vote. I think it is important that we have a vote on this and \nthat 100 Senators vote for the proposition that we are not going to \ntake action that will increase hunger or homelessness among children.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. Would he \naccept a voice vote?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No, Mr. President. I want a recorded vote. I had voice \nvotes before, and it got taken out in conference committee originally. \nThis time I want a recorded vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It might get taken out even with a vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. At least the Senate is on record.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest that nothing in this budget \nresolution would indicate that we are going to increase the number of \nhungry and homeless in the United States.

I have conferred with the distinguished Democrat \nmanager, and he concurs that we set aside the Wellstone amendment 3988 \nand that we proceed to 3990, which is a Kerry amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 3990.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, is it 60 seconds?\n  Mr. EXON. Thirty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixty seconds divided equally. The Senator has \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment would add back the \nPresident's level of funding for environmental cleanup. It adds back \n$7.3 billion over the 6-year period. That would go specifically to EPA \nenforcement, to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to \nscience technology research for the EPA and to the Everglades program \nas well as the National Park Service. This is critical funding in terms \nof their ability to meet increased responsibilities of research and \nprotection, and, as I say, it simply brings it back to the President's \nrequested level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the budget resolution before us provides \n$1.5 billion more in 2002 for natural resources and the environment \nthan the President does under his discretionary trigger. This amendment \nincreases taxes $6.3 billion to pay for additional spending. I move to \ntable the Kerry amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3991\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, by agreement with the minority, we are \nonce again going to set aside Senator Wellstone's 3988 and proceed to \nthe second Kerry amendment, 3991.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we are skipping out of order again. I would \nlike to inquire of the manager, is he suggesting that we skip over \nWellstone, which is No. 3988, a second time to go to the second Kerry \namendment? Is that right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is what I suggested. And I do not think I need any \nmore time than that. I still have one Senator I have to talk to about \nthe amendment we are passing over and then we can go right back to it.\n  Mr. EXON. I would not necessarily agree unless the Senator from \nMinnesota does agree that we have an agreement that we would go back \nfor a vote on the Wellstone amendment and bring that up following \nmoving ahead as the leader has suggested with the Kerry amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Nebraska for his remarks \ntrying to protect all Senators, but I have talked with Senator \nDomenici, and I am pleased to accommodate him on this. Whatever makes \nmore sense is fine. We will wait until the next one.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not want to waste a lot of time. The Senator from \nNew Mexico is not asking for anything untoward.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do not object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I know it is all right with you. It is Senator Exon.\n  Mr. EXON. It is all right with me if it is all right with the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, and he said it is. That takes care of it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this seeks to add back to the President's \nlevel the funding for various education programs ranging from the title \nI, Head Start, Pell grants, Goals 2000, and safe and drug-free schools. \nIt would effectively restore for 1.3 million students the Pell grants; \nit would restore 550,000 students who would lose money as a result of \ntitle I cuts; it would restore 20,000 children to the Head Start \nProgram and 130,000 youth and adults to job opportunities and skill \nenhancement.\n  This merely brings it back to the President's level, again, and is \nappropriately offset.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is an amendment which will add $56 \nbillion over the next 6 years to certain discretionary functions, and \nto do it,\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\ntaxes will be increased $56 billion. The increased funding will come \nfrom reducing tax deductions that are necessary for the child credit \nthat many of us think would be more appropriate.\n  So I believe we ought to table the amendment, and I move to table it \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment which \nSenators Kerry, Murray, and myself, along with others, are offering to \nprotect funding for critical education and training programs over the \nnext 6 years.\n  Last year, the budget resolution passed by the Republican majority \ncut discretionary education and training funds below current services \nby $40 billion over 7 years. This year's proposal again threatens some \nof America's most proven and essential education and training programs, \nat a time when the challenges for the future are even greater. The K-\n12, higher education and training initiatives that have proven to have \nthe most success over the years should be made stronger, not weaker, as \nwe enter the next century. What is a more important investment in our \nfuture?\n  The amendment which I am offering along with Senators Kerry and \nMurray, seeks to protect initiatives that we know work. Parents, \neducators, and students all know these programs work.\n  The amendment adds funding over 6 years to bring the amendment up to \nthe levels requested in the President's budget.\n  Mr. President, the part of the Federal budget which we are amending \nincludes valuable, proven programs like title I, Head Start, school-to-\nwork, vocational education grants, Pell grants, safe and drug free \nschools technology challenge grants, and the Technology Literacy Fund \nand impact aid as well as Goals 2000 and AmeriCorps.\n  Our amendment replaces the Republican proposal with the spending \nlevels proposed by the President. Under our amendment, we would invest \n$270.4 billion over 6 years in discretionary spending for education, \njob training, and social services programs, $56.1 billion more than the \nproposed budget resolution.\n  The Republican majority's budget fails to maintain fiscal year 1996 \nfunding levels for education and training programs. Over 6 years, it \nfalls $3.2 billion below a freeze at fiscal year 1996 levels for these \ndiscretionary programs. It does not provide for any adjustment for \ninflation, or increased enrollment. which could result in deep cuts in \nservices to children and education.\n  By contrast, the President's budget demonstrates his continued \ncommitment to a strong Federal investment in proven education programs, \nto ensure that America's children and families are prepared to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n  For example, the President's fiscal year 1997 budget request calls \nfor increasing title I funds by 7 percent over fiscal year 1995 levels \nto raise the academic achievement of 7 million disadvantaged students \nin over 50,000 American schools; special education is increased by 7 \npercent to maintain Federal support for the excess costs of educating \nalmost 6 million children with disabilities; the Pell grant maximum \naward is increased to $2,700, up $360 or 15 percent from the 1995 level \nof $2,340, to provide grant aid to 3.8 million low- and moderate-income \nstudents; the College Work-Study Program is up by 10 percent, enabling \nan expansion of the number of students who earn some of their college \ncosts from 700,000 to 1 million over the next 5 years; and the TRIO \nProgram is increased by 8 percent, to provide outreach and other \nspecial support services to encourage 682,000 disadvantaged students to \nenter and complete postsecondary education.\n  Last year, as the majority attempted to impose cuts on many education \nprograms, people at the grassroots of America spoke up. As I traveled \nacross Michigan, I heard again and again about the value of Federal \nsupport for such programs as title I and school to work, Pell grants, \nand Head Start. A recent Washington Post/ABC Poll indicates 82 percent \nof Americans oppose cutting education to balance the Federal budget. In \nearly January, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll found that education is the \ntop priority among voters, ranking above crime, the economy, health \ncare, and the deficit for the first time in history.\n  It is unclear if the resolution proposed by the majority provides \nadequate budget authority for the vital title I reading, writing and \nmath program for fiscal year 1997 to follow through on the agreement \nreached in the omnibus appropriations bill just a few weeks ago. \nEarlier versions of the majority's fiscal year 1996 appropriations \nmeasure would have cut title I by 17 percent, denying services to 1.1 \nmillion children nationwide and over 30,000 in my home State of \nMichigan. The School to Work Program which helps students make the \ntransition from school to future careers and education by forming a \nthree-way partnership between government, educators, and private \nindustry would have been cut by 22 percent. Goals 2000, which helps \nStates and local school districts raise academic standards and \nimplement their own comprehensive reform plans was cut by 25 percent; \nand summer jobs for youth would also have been cut by 25 percent. It is \nonly through the bipartisan efforts of my Democratic colleagues and \nsome on the other side of the aisle that we were able to reverse these \ndamaging cuts.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate budget resolution caps the Direct Lending \nprogram at 20 percent of loan volume, forcing 1.6 million students in \n1,100 colleges and universities out of the program against their will. \nColleges should be able to choose the student loan program that \nprovides the best services and lowest costs to their students. Direct \nlending permits college students to bypass the maze of lenders and \nmiddlemen in the guaranteed loan program and borrow directly from the \nFederal Government through their campus student aid office. At direct \nlending schools, needed money gets to students more promptly. The \napplication process is simpler. Student do not submit a separate loan \napplication to a bank.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, if direct lending is \ncapped or eliminated, banks and guaranteed agencies will reap between \n$70 and $106 billion in additional business over the budget period \ngenerating an estimated $4 to $6 billion in extra profits.\n  Under the Republican resolution, there is concern that the maximum \nPell grant award will decline substantially over the next 6 years and \nthat eligible recipients may be cut off of the program. I received a \nletter today from the president of the National Association of \nIndependent Colleges and Universities, David Warren, who states that:\n\n       The ability to maintain the Pell Grant maximum depends on \n     carry-overs in the funding from the previous year. The carry-\n     over is not expected to be available beyond FY 1997, but the \n     base has been severely reduced. It will not be possible to \n     maintain the maximum grant in FY 1998 and beyond under the \n     parameters provided in the pending budget resolution.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The important roll of education in our Nation's growth is \n     clear, over the last 60 years, education and advances in \n     knowledge have accounted for nearly 40 percent of our \n     Nation's economic growth. We cannot turn back now.\n  Mr. President, in addition to restoring funding for a variety of \nimportant education efforts, this amendment will also improve the \nfunding levels of several job training programs.\n  Education builds the foundation of a person's future. Job training \nprograms are available to help people expand that base if their careers \ntake unexpected turns. Unfortunately, more and more people are finding \nthemselves in a position where they have to retrain because their old \njob no longer exists. As the rate of change in our economy increases, \nso does the rate of dislocation. Every day we are faced with \nannouncements of major corporations laying people off. But unlike the \npast, people today may lose their jobs when they are 45 or 50. For \nthese people, the Job Training Partnership Act [JTPA] maintains two \nprograms: title II-A, adult training, and title III, training for \ndislocated workers.\n  Adult training is intended to prepare adults for participation in the \nlabor force by increasing their educational and occupational skills. It \nis operated\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\nat the local level through service delivery areas designated by the \nGovernor. The budget resolution would maintain a level funding line for \nadult training at a time when we are concentrating on reducing the \nnumber of people on welfare. Adult training reduces welfare dependency \nby helping people become productive and successful members of society. \nBy implementing the proposed budget levels, we will be serving 65,000 \nfewer adults in 2002 than we did this year.\n  This would be a tragic mistake. Our goal is increasing self-\nsufficiency and that is what adult training accomplishes.\n  The Job Training Partnership Act also funds a number of programs \nwhich are vital towards ensuring that our youth grow along with the job \nmarket and are not left behind. One of the most successful, and most \nwidely supported, programs of this type is the Job Corps. A residential \ntraining program for at-risk youth, over 70 percent of its enrollees \nleave the program to take full employment, go on for further education, \nor enter the military. Job Corps works, and yet, its future is \nthreatened by this budget.\n  Similarly, the funding levels proposed by the majority for the Summer \nYouth and the Youth Training Grant Programs will result in hundreds of \nthousands of young people who don't receive valuable training and work \nexperiences. Mr. President, now is not the time to walk away from our \ncommitment to the youth of this country. We are asking them to take \nresponsibility and to do that they must have the skills and the \nknowledge necessary to compete in the world. The programs I have \ndiscussed do that, and the amendment I am sponsoring today with my \nfriend from Washington will ensure that these programs continue to \nserve the people that need them.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that, over 6 years, the \namendment we are offering spends $17.7 billion less on function 500 \nthan would have been invested in the fiscal year 1995 pre-rescission \npolicies had kept pace with inflation. This is a moderate and prudent \nincrease. We can and should balance the budget over the next 6 years. \nWe can do so without sacrificing critical investment in America's \nfuture.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here we go again. The budget resolution \ngoes about balancing the budget in all the wrong ways by placing \neducation at the bottom of the Nation's priority list once again.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor and support the Kerry amendment. The \namendment puts education at the top of the national priority list by \nrestoring funds for vital education and training programs over the next \n6 years. The amendment eliminates the cuts in the budget resolution and \nprovides the investments to education and training as proposed by \nPresident Clinton.\n  You will hear a lot of talk from the other side that they provide \nincreases in education. Make sure you look beyond the blue smoke and \nmirrors because it is simply not true.\n  Just a few weeks ago we reversed deep education cuts by restoring \n$2.7 billion to the fiscal year 1996 education appropriations bill. \nHowever, the pending resolution does not include this restoration in \nthe baseline, therefore we are right back where we started from.\n  Unless we adopt this amendment not only there will be no real \ninvestments in education, but there will be cuts over even the \ninadequate fiscal year 1996 levels. And our Nation will suffer as a \nresult.\n  Mr. President, during the last year students, parents, teachers, \nschool boards, and school administrators were treated to a roller \ncoaster ride because of great uncertainties caused by the Federal \nbudget process. Let's not repeat that mistake again this year. The \nAmerican people are sick and tired of the partisan bickering and want \nus to get on with the business of governing.\n  We started last year with proposals for deep cuts in student loans. \nThe House planned to cut $18 billion, the resolution offered by the \nBudget Committee called for cuts of $14 billion. We finally adopted a \nbipartisan amendment in the Senate which reduced the cut to $4 billion. \nStudents and their parents were not thrilled, but saw this as at least \nan improvement.\n  But then the resolution went to conference and the cut was $10 \nbillion. Students and their parents started to worry again.\n  The Senate once again moderated the cuts and people rejoiced. The \nHouse did not and concern intensified.\n  The final deal drastically cut the successful direct lending program \nand included cut of about $5 billion. That bill was rightfully vetoed.\n  That was followed by the ups and downs of negotiations on the fiscal \nyear 1996 appropriations bill. The Government was shutdown twice. The 7 \nmonths the Federal Government was directionless because of short-term \ncontinuing resolutions instead of annual appropriations.\n  Parents worried that their children would not get the reading and \nmath assistance they need because title I funding was cut by 17 \npercent. Teachers worried about whether or not they would have a job. \nSchool boards and administrators were unable to plan for the upcoming \nschool year because they did not know what the budget would be for next \nyear. In short, chaos reined.\n  We should promise the American people that we will never do that \nagain. Passing this amendment would be a good place to start.\n  In addition to providing more sanity to the 1997 appropriations \nprocess, we will put out Nation on the right track for the future. We \nwill make the investments that will enable the United States to remain \ncompetitive into the next century by making sure we have the \nhealthiest, best educated and most skilled workers in the world.\n  I urge adoption of the Kerry amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think the regular order would return \nus to the Wellstone amendment No. 3988.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is strong bipartisan support for \nthis amendment. But last year with LIHEAP, the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, it was a nightmare with the stop-and-start-funding.\n  What this amendment just simply says is that we will have at least as \nmuch funding next year as we have had this year for this energy \nassistance program. I believe the chairman believes that is in the \nassumptions of the budget resolution. If so, fine. I hope we get a \nresounding vote because we had to fight very hard to keep this program \nintact this year. That is why I introduced the amendment and why I hope \nfor a strong recorded, positive vote.\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while I have great respect for Senator \nWellstone, I just want to tell the Senate this is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that reaffirms what is in the budget resolution. It says the \nsense of the Senate is that we do precisely what is in the budget \nresolution.\n  It seems to me that everybody can have that kind of sense of the \nSenate on everything in the budget resolution. Anything you like, you \njust come up and say, ``It's provided for, but I want to have a sense \nof the Senate on top of it being in the budget already.''\n  There is no way to keep the amendment from proceeding, except we are \ngoing to use 15 minutes on a vote that probably is going to pass \noverwhelmingly because it is already in the budget resolution. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. EXON. If there has not been a sufficient second, I ask for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to inquire, would the Senator \naccept a voice vote on this amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, no. I want a recorded vote on this \namendment because of the struggle over this past year. My understanding \nis that not until yesterday did we have anything really in writing that \nthe assumptions pointed to this. It has been too big a struggle. Many \nSenators in cold weather States know that. We know what happened in \nChicago last summer. I want to get a strong recorded vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram is one of the most important Federal programs for my home State \nof Massachusetts. I am pleased the President's budget calls for $1 \nbillion in LIHEAP funding for the next fiscal year, and $300 million in \nemergency funding.\n  After the severe weather of this past winter--which was even more \nefficient than our friends on the other side of the aisle at shutting \ndown the Government--I hope the Senate can speak with one voice and \nsend a message to the appropriators that funding for LIHEAP should \nmatch this year's outlays.\n  LIHEAP means real help to people who need it. As fuel prices continue \nto rise, Senators should know how important this program is to their \nconstituents. I know how important it is to mine.\n  For lower-income residents in Massachusetts--those who receive \nassistance under LIHEAP--nearly $1 in $5 of their income goes to pay \nfor energy bills. That is, Mr. President, 20 percent of a household's \nbudget just to heat the home. And after paying their fuel bills, the \naverage low-income New Englander has only $43 left over. We cannot \nexpect these people to live without LIHEAP, Mr. President. This program \nneeds to receive funds sufficient to serve lower income families in \nareas which experience colder winters.\n  LIHEAP pays up to half of the heating bills for a family during the \nwinter months in New England. Everyone in this country knows how cold \nit was in my region of the country this past winter, how much snow we \nhad, how people were literally freezing in the streets. In fact, twice \nas many people froze to death during the severe winter than were killed \nin the 1994 California earthquake. I will never forget this past \nwinter, as the temperature dropped below 20 degrees and the chairman of \nthe energy committee in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, \nRepresentative Albert Herren, told me my State's LIHEAP funds had been \ndepleted--in December.\n  Mr. President, it was so cold and so snowy in Massachusetts, some \nschools closed for snow days as late as April.\n  LIHEAP helps families and LIHEAP helps children, Mr. President. My \nfriends at Massachusetts General Hospital tell me that the number of \ncases of child malnutrition increase every winter as families are \nforced to choose between eating and heating. This country is better \nthan that, Mr. President.\n  I am pleased to join my friend from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, in \nsponsoring this sense of the Senate that funding for LIHEAP should \nmatch last year's outlays. That seems to me the minimum the Senate can \ndo to send a message to the appropriators and to the country that \nCongress wants lower income Americans to survive the upcoming winter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that says that when the Congress has adopted fundamental tax \nreform, we should, thereafter, adopt some kind of supermajority \nrequirement to raise taxes as a constitutional amendment.\n  This is the idea that came from the Kemp Commission, which said if we \never get to a single rate tax, whether a consumption tax or income tax, \nthereafter, we better make it harder to raise taxes because there is no \nplace to shelter income taxes. So once we have tax reform, we should \nhave a supermajority requirement.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this is a far reaching and very little \nconsidered amendment. It calls for a supermajority vote, presumably a \ntwo-thirds majority for Congress to approve a tax increase, but also \ncalls for a flat tax. While many of us support tax reform, we should \nnot be endorsing a particular plan without careful consideration of the \nalternative. I urge the Senators to vote against this unwise and \nundemocratic amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an analysis of the \namendment be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Center on Budget\n\n\n                                        and Policy Priorities,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1996.\n\n    Kyl Amendment on Taxes Threatens Deficit Reduction and Protects \n                          Wasteful Tax Breaks\n\n       The Senate is scheduled to vote on Sen. Kyl's amendment to \n     the pending budget resolution calling for ``fundamental tax \n     reform'' to replace the current ``indefensible'' federal tax \n     system, and endorsing an amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n     requiring supermajorities to ``raise tax rates, impose new \n     taxes, or otherwise increase the amount of taxpayer's income \n     that is subject to tax.''\n       Sen. Kyl's amendment is a ``sense of the Senate'' amendment \n     and therefore would not\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\n     have legal force, but Senators who vote for it may later be \n     pressed to vote for substantive legislation that would \n     replace current progressive taxes (which taken into account \n     ability to pay) with flat taxes, national sales taxes, or \n     other taxes that exclude investment income from the tax \n     base.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes to appear at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In addition, Senators who vote for the Kyl amendment will \n     be under great pressure to vote for S.J. Res. 49, Senator \n     Kyl's proposed amendment to the Constitution requiring \n     supermajorities to raise taxes.\n\n                      Kyl Constitutional Amendment\n\n       ``Any bill to levy a new tax or increase the rate or base \n     of any tax may pass only by a two-thirds majority of the \n     whole number of each House of Congress.''\n       The Kyl amendment to the budget resolution and the \n     companion constitutional amendment are undesirable for a \n     variety of reasons.\n       The nation will face very large deficits in coming decades \n     when the baby boom generation retires--perhaps exceeding 15 \n     percent of the economy by 2030--if current budget policies \n     are not changed. Many experts believe Congress will need \n     to consider both significant spending cuts and revenue \n     increases in the decades ahead. The Kyl amendments would \n     effectively preclude such a deficit reduction package, \n     because of the revenue increases they would contain.\n       Furthermore, the Kyl amendments would inequitably benefit \n     the wealthiest and most powerful at the expense of the rest \n     of the U.S. population. A two-thirds majority would be \n     required to curb special interest tax expenditures, which \n     disproportion benefit those at high income levels. By \n     contrast, a simply majority vote would suffice to cut federal \n     programs, which primarily benefit the middle class and the \n     poor. Apportioning the sacrifice of deficit reduction would \n     not be done on a level playing field.\n       The Kyl amendments could threaten the solvency of Social \n     Security, which may ultimately need payroll tax increases as \n     well as benefit cuts to restore long-term balance. A payroll \n     tax increase would require a two-thirds vote, and runs \n     counter to the stated policy of the Kyl Amendment against \n     payroll taxes (see footnote 1). The same is true for \n     Medicare, which may also need premium increases to restore \n     solvency. Yet any premium increase that takes into account a \n     beneficiary's ability to pay could be considered a tax, and \n     therefore prohibited.\n       The Kyl constitutional amendment has special problems of \n     its own--by requiring supermajorities for any new tax, base \n     broadener, or rate increase, it effectively precludes all tax \n     reform, from Chaffee-Breaux to Domenici-Nunn, from a flat tax \n     to a national sales tax. For example, the 1986 tax reform \n     bill, which lowered marginal rates while closing loopholes, \n     would have been unconstitutional simply because it broadened \n     tax bases. Last year's reconciliation bill would also have \n     been unconstitutional for the same reason.\n       The Kyl constitutional amendment undermines the basic \n     principles of majority rule that are at the heart of American \n     democracy. Nowhere in the Constitution are supermajorities \n     required to adopt or amend issues of public policy--in fact, \n     the framers explicitly and knowingly rejected \n     supermajorities. Further, because it would require a two-\n     thirds vote of the entire membership of the House and the \n     Senate (rather than two-thirds of those voting), this \n     proposal is even more restrictive than the two-thirds needed \n     to override a presidential veto or to amend the Constitution.\n\n\n   i. the constitutional amendment and the long-term fiscal forecast\n\n       The Federal deficit now has been reduced below two percent \n     of the Gross Domestic Product (the basic measure of the size \n     of the U.S. economy), a level that many economists believe \n     does not cause significant damage even if maintained over a \n     substantial period of time. But as the Bipartisan Commission \n     on Entitlement and Tax Reform warned in 1994, if not action \n     is taken to raise revenue or restrain Medicare, Social \n     Security, Medicaid, and some lesser entitlements--and other \n     Federal spending remains constant as a share of GDP--the \n     deficit will rise sharply when the baby boom generation \n     retires. The Entitlement Commission forecast the deficit will \n     exceed 15 percent of GDP by 2030 if no such action is taken. \n     Based on a recent slowdown in the rate of growth of health \n     care costs, current forecasts are a bit less pessimistic, but \n     not by much. President Clinton's new budget forecasts the \n     deficit will equal 12 percent of GDP in 2030 under current \n     tax and entitlement laws and rise further to 26 percent of \n     GDP by 2050. In short, any reasonable long-term forecast will \n     show projected deficits in the next century to be extremely \n     large and of a magnitude unhealthy for the U.S. economy To \n     avoid such a development, major deficit reduction that \n     extends far beyond the steps Congress and the Administration \n     are currently considering will ultimately be needed.\n       Testifying before the Entitlement Commission in 1994, \n     Robert Reischauer, then the director of the Congressional \n     Budget Office, observed that the public would be unlikely to \n     accept the steps that would be required either to extract all \n     of the needed deficit reduction in the decades ahead just \n     from government programs or to extract all of the needed \n     deficit reduction just from revenues. In the long run, \n     Reischauer predicted, policymakers will agree on some mix \n     of program cuts and revenue increases to prevent deficits \n     of a magnitude that would do substantial damage to the \n     economy.\n       The proposed constitutional amendment is designed to ensure \n     that virtually none of those future deficit reduction \n     measures come from the revenue side and virtually all come \n     from cutting programs. That the amendment would bar virtually \n     all revenue increases can be seen by examining House votes \n     for the four principal deficit reduction measures enacted \n     between 1982 and 1993 that raised federal revenue. Although \n     three of these four measures were signed by Republican \n     presidents and all four enjoyed the support of Democratic \n     Congressional leaders, none received two-thirds support on \n     the House floor. A fifth measure--the 1983 Social Security \n     rescue plan, which increased Social Security payroll tax \n     collections--also failed to secure a two-thirds vote despite \n     strong support from President Reagan and Congressional \n     leaders.\n       The constitutional amendment thus would likely lead to one \n     of several outcomes: (1) larger deficits over time; (2) a \n     greatly shrunken federal government that is unable to do much \n     beyond running Social Security and Medicare, maintaining \n     national defense, making federal pension and veterans \n     payments, and paying interest payments on the national debt; \n     and (3) steep reductions in Social Security and Medicare that \n     significantly reduce the living standards of millions of \n     elderly people who are not well off. Such stark outcomes are \n     not necessary if a balance of spending cuts and revenue \n     increases ultimately can be considered over the next three \n     decades. Such balance is what the amendment is designed to \n     prevent.\n       That the statements in the previous paragraph are not \n     hyperbole can be seen by examining a chart the Entitlement \n     Commission published in 1994 showing the fiscal forecast \n     through 2030 under current tax and entitlement law. When the \n     baby boom generation reaches retirement and an unprecedented \n     proportion of the population is elderly, some increases in \n     revenues are likely to be needed, in addition to actions to \n     restrain Social Security and Medicare costs and actions of \n     the type the President and Congress are proposing for the \n     years between now and 2002.\n\n\n   ii. the amendment effectively bars measures to close tax loopholes\n\n       The requirement for a two-thirds majority would apply not \n     only to measures to raise tax rates but also to measures to \n     cut unproductive tax expenditures that grant subsidies to \n     powerful special interests. A recent Congressional Budget \n     Office study found that over half of the corporate subsidies \n     the federal government provides are delivered through the tax \n     code. Curbing corporate welfare provided through the tax code \n     is one way to help reduce the deficit, but it would require a \n     two-thirds vote under the proposed amendment. This would \n     essentially rule out closing corporate loopholes as a way to \n     help shrink the deficit.\n       In fact, a substantial share of the federal budget would \n     effectively be placed off limits for deficit reduction by the \n     constitutional amendment. Provisions of the tax code that the \n     Joint Committee on Taxation classifies as ``tax \n     expenditures''--spending programs that operate through the \n     tax code by selectively reducing the tax liability of \n     particular individuals or businesses--now cost more than $400 \n     billion a year. (The corporate subsidy provisions that \n     operate through the tax code are a part of this total.) This \n     is more than the government spends on Social Security or \n     defense.\n       In testimony before the Entitlement Commission in 1994, \n     Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan referred to \n     these provisions of the tax code as ``tax entitlements'' \n     because they entitle those who qualify for them to government \n     subsidies provided in the form of a special tax reduction. \n     Greenspan testified that the tax entitlements should be \n     looked at, along with the spending entitlements, in \n     developing measures to address the nation's long-term deficit \n     problem.\n       If anything, the proposed constitutional amendment would \n     encourage the spread of more tax expenditures over time, \n     since such measures would take only a majority vote to enact \n     but a two-thirds vote to remove. In addition, if Congress \n     passed a series of tax changes that were thought to be \n     deficit-neutral, but clever, high-priced tax lawyers and \n     accountants then found ways to convert some of the measures \n     into tax shelters at greater-than-anticipated cost to the \n     Treasury, it would take a two-thirds vote to scale the \n     shelters back so the original measure did not produce a net \n     revenue loss.\n       Even measures to prevent companies from gaining tax \n     advantages by moving plants--and jobs--overseas would require \n     a two-thirds vote.\n\n\niii. amendment tilts toward the wealthy and the powerful at the expense \n                    of average families and the poor\n\n       Most government benefits that low- and middle-income \n     Americans receive come from government programs, such as \n     Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, student loans and \n     grants, unemployment insurance, school lunches, and food \n     stamps. By contrast, most government subsidies that wealthy \n     individuals and large corporations receive come through \n     tax subsidies. As a result, a constitutional amendment \n     that makes it extremely difficult to scale back tax \n     subsidies when decades of deficit reduction lie ahead\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\n     tilts the playing field in favor of the wealthy and \n     powerful over Americans of average or lesser means.\n       In addition, such a constitutional amendment would place \n     off limits even measures asking program beneficiaries who \n     have high incomes to pay more for the government benefits \n     they receive. For example, to ``means test'' Medicare \n     premiums by raising the premiums on those at high income \n     levels, Congress must rely on the tax code to collect the \n     increased premiums, since Social Security offices (which \n     administer Medicare) have no information on beneficiaries' \n     current incomes. Indeed, when the Republican budget bill \n     reached the House floor last fall, the House parliamentarian \n     advised that its provision raising Medicare premiums for \n     those at higher income levels could constitute a tax \n     increase. Under the constitutional amendment, measures of \n     this nature would require a two-thirds vote, rendering them \n     extremely difficult to pass. This makes it more likely that \n     when steps are taken to restrain Medicare costs, low-income \n     and middle-income beneficiaries will have to bear a heavier \n     share of the load.\n       The amendment also would be likely to injure the middle \n     class and the poor for another reason. If the federal \n     government is unable to raise revenue when needs for public \n     expenditures rise, one likely result will be to shift more of \n     the burden of raising revenue and meeting public needs to \n     state and local governments. Most state tax codes are \n     regressive (i.e., the taxes they impose consume a larger \n     percentage of the income of lower-income households than of \n     higher-income households). State and local governments \n     extract a larger proportion of the revenues they raise \n     from the middle class and the poor, and a smaller \n     proportion from the affluent, than the federal government \n     does. If revenue-raising burdens are shifted from the \n     federal to state and local levels, the share of the \n     overall tax burden borne by the middle class and the poor \n     is likely to rise.\n\n\n iv. amendment could lead to overly large cuts in social security and \n                           medicare benefits\n\n       Social Security and Medicare benefits need to be restrained \n     in the years ahead. Both programs are out of long-term \n     actuarial balance, and both contribute significantly to the \n     projected increase in the long-term deficit.\n       But the constitutional amendment would almost certainly \n     lead to larger reductions in Social Security and Medicare \n     benefits than otherwise would be needed, reductions that \n     could adversely affect the living standards of retirees, \n     including those of modest income and those in poverty. This \n     would be true for several reasons.\n       First, by effectively preventing revenues from contributing \n     to deficit reduction despite the need for large-scale deficit \n     reduction in the decades ahead, the amendment would place a \n     greater deficit reduction load on Medicare and Social \n     Security. These two programs are projected eventually to \n     constitute half or more of the federal budget, exclusive of \n     interest payments on the debt. If there is no revenue \n     contribution to deficit reduction, there will have to be a \n     greater contribution from Medicare and/or Social Security \n     benefits than would otherwise be the case.\n       Second, the amendment would effectively rule out measures \n     to raise Medicare premiums for those at higher income levels. \n     As noted above, last year's budget reconciliation bill \n     contained such a measure. When it was about to come to the \n     House floor, the House parliamentarian advised that it could \n     constitute a tax increase. A House rule that the new Congress \n     adopted in January 1995 requires a three-fifths majority for \n     measures raising tax rates, so the parliamentarian's advice \n     meant the budget bill would need a three-fifths vote unless \n     this rule was waived. The House leadership promptly arranged \n     for a waiver of the rule. But once a supermajority \n     requirement is in the Constitution, no waivers are possible.\n       Third, the constitutional amendment effectively rules out \n     even small adjustments in Medicare and Social Security \n     payroll taxes as part of the effort to bring these programs \n     into long-term actuarial balance and also help reduce the \n     deficit. Modest increases of a fraction of a percentage point \n     in the payroll tax would require a two-thirds vote, thereby \n     making them virtually impossible to achieve. Yet Medicare in \n     particular is so far out of actuarial balance that it is \n     difficult to see how to restore long-term balance to the \n     program without some increase in payroll tax contributions \n     along with other changes, unless the health insurance that \n     Medicare provides is scaled back very substantially.\n       In a symposium last September, Henry Aaron, Director of \n     Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution and a well-\n     known expert in this area, observed that the full $270 \n     billion that Republican Congressional leaders were seeking in \n     Medicare savings over seven years could be achieved if one \n     combined Republican Medicare proposals that represent sound \n     policy and yield about half of the $270 billion in savings \n     with an increase of one-quarter of one percentage point in \n     the employer and the employee shares of the Medicare payroll \n     tax. This would slightly reduce workers' wages. (Most \n     economists believe that both the employee and the employer \n     shares of payroll taxes are effectively borne by employees in \n     the form of wages lower than they otherwise would be paid. As \n     a result, claims that small increases in payroll taxes would \n     heavily burden employers and cause substantial job loss have \n     little merit.) In return, employees would get a Medicare \n     system that had the resources to provide continually \n     improving health care to their parents and ultimately to \n     themselves as it took advantage of emerging medical \n     technologies that improve health and prolong life.\n       Furthermore, one of several reasons that Medicare and \n     Social Security face long-term deficits is that over time, a \n     steadily increasing share of employee compensation is being \n     provided in the form of fringe benefits not subject to the \n     payroll tax, while a steadily smaller share is provided in \n     wages that are subject to the tax. Modest measures to shore \n     up Social Security and Medicare by slowing the erosion in the \n     share of employee compensation subject to the payroll tax \n     would, however, also require a two-thirds majority.\n       Even measures to bring all state and local government \n     employees into the Social Security system--a step nearly all \n     budget analysts favor regardless of whether they are \n     conservative or liberal, and which would strengthen the \n     Social Security system and reduce the deficit--would require \n     a two-thirds vote, because such measures would increase \n     federal revenue. Such measures would become virtually \n     impossible to pass. (For a further discussion of these \n     issues, see an accompanying Center on Budget and Policy \n     Priorities analysis, ``Proposed Constitutional Amendment \n     Would Make It More Difficult to Address the Long-Term Social \n     Security and Medicare Crises.'')\n\n\nV. The Constitutional Amendment Precludes Any Tax Reforms, from Chafee-\n                  Breaux to the Most Thorough Overhaul\n\n       Under the terms of the Kyl constitutional amendment, any \n     base broadener in a tax bill would make that bill \n     unconstitutional, absent a two-thirds vote by both chambers. \n     This would be true regardless of the amount of offsetting new \n     exemptions or deductions, regardless of any offsetting \n     reduction in marginal tax rates, and regardless of whether \n     the bill as a whole raised or lost revenue.\n       The Chafee-Breaux plan would therefore be \n     unconstitutional--unless it obtained a two-thirds vote--\n     because it contains the following items:\n       Elimination of the subsidy of Part B Medicare premiums for \n     high-income persons (a new tax).\n       Extension of expired tax provisions (such as the oil spill \n     liability tax and the federal unemployment surtax).\n       Improvement in EITC targeting (reducing eligibility for \n     those with other economic resources, thus raising their \n     taxes).\n       Closing tax loopholes and similar reforms (``corporate \n     welfare'').\n       Reduced indexation via the CPI (because the reduction would \n     decrease the degree to which income tax brackets, etc., \n     change to offset inflation).\n       For the same reason, last year's reconciliation bill would \n     be unconstitutional--it contained some loophole closers, and \n     it increased the effective tax rate on some small business \n     capital gains while creating a uniform, much lower capital \n     gains rate overall.\n       Most flat tax proposals broaden tax bases by eliminating \n     some or all of the current exemptions or deductions from \n     income. (Some would create new exemptions for investment \n     income.) Therefore, they also would be unconstitutional. \n     Similarly, the Domenici-Nunn USA tax would be \n     unconstitutional because it includes some base broadeners and \n     raises rates, despite its major new exemptions for investment \n     income. So would a VAT or national sales tax, since it would \n     constitute a ``new'' tax. Special environmental taxes, such \n     as California's 1991 tax on the production of lead (which \n     paid for the evaluation, screening, and medically necessary \n     treatment of children with lead poisoning), would be \n     unconstitutional as well.\\2\\\n\n\n                 vi. weakening our system of democracy\n\n       Finally, the amendment would gravely weaken the principle \n     of majority rule that has been at the heart of our system of \n     representative democracy for more than 200 years. In effect, \n     the amendment would give only one-half of a vote to any \n     Senator who votes to close a tax loophole, broaden at tax \n     base, raise any tax rate, or create any new tax or certain \n     new fees. Senators on the other side would get a full vote.\n       The constitutional amendment would partially restore the \n     system we had in the 1780s under the Articles of \n     Confederation, a system that functioned poorly and was soon \n     scrapped.\n       The Articles of Confederation required the vote of nine of \n     the 13 states to raise revenue. At the Constitutional \n     Convention in 1787, the Founding Fathers recognized this was \n     an insurmountable defect and fashioned a national government \n     that can impose and enforce laws and collect revenue through \n     simple majority rule.\n       The proposed constitutional amendment would end the ability \n     of a majority of the American people, acting through their \n     duly elected representatives, to decide whether they would \n     like to raise more revenues so the Federal Government can \n     address needs the majority finds legitimate. The amendment \n     would deny the majority this right both now and in future \n     generations.\n       At its core, the amendment is rooted in deep distrust of \n     the ability of the majority of the American people to make \n     decisions that the authors of the amendment believe to be \n     ideologically correct. Hence, the amendment seeks permanently \n     to deny the majority that right. Powerful, well-connected \n     minorities\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\n     would gain great power at the expense of the majority. In \n     short, the amendment fundamentally is anti-democratic.\n\n             Votes for Recent Legislation that Raised Taxes\n\n       Between 1982 and 1993, five pieces of legislation that \n     raised significant revenue were enacted. Presidents Reagan \n     signed three of these measures, while President Bush and \n     President Clinton each signed one. All five failed to secure \n     a two-thirds vote on the House floor.\n       In passing the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of \n     1982, a measure crafted in substantial part by Senator Bob \n     Dole, the House vote was 226-207. When the House considered \n     its version of the 1983 Social Security rescue plan the \n     following year, the vote was 282-148. The vote for the 1987 \n     budget reconciliation bill, a product of bipartisan \n     negotiations that contained both spending cuts and revenue \n     increases, was 237-181, while the 1990 budget agreement \n     passed by only 228 to 220. The 1993 budget agreement passed \n     by a slender 218-216 vote.\n       During this period only one measure that raised revenue \n     secured a two-thirds vote, the 1989 reconciliation bill. The \n     1989 bill was a minor measure. It did relatively little to \n     reduce the deficit and contained only very small revenue \n     increases. The revenue increases in all five of the pieces of \n     legislation that failed to secure a two-thirds vote exceeded \n     the level of revenue increases in the 1989 bill.\n\n               Law School Dean Warns of Perverse Effects\n\n       In testimony before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of \n     the House Judiciary Committee on March 6, Samuel C. Thompson, \n     Jr., Dean of the University of Miami Law School, warned of \n     potential perverse effects from the proposed amendment. \n     Thompson wrote:\n       ``. . . adoption of this proposed amendment would \n     significantly penalize the American public for mistakes made \n     in the tax legislative process. For example, assume that \n     after adoption of this Constitutional amendment, Congress \n     adopts a flat tax. Assume that it is estimated that the flat \n     tax will reduce revenues by $100 billion. It turns out, \n     however, that tax lawyers discover a gaping hole in this \n     legislation and that as a result the revenue loss is $200 \n     billion, not $100 billion. The Treasury immediately proposes \n     a base-broadening amendment to close the loophole and to \n     restore fiscal responsibility. The amendment is opposed by \n     powerful special interests who will prevail if they can \n     convince just 33\\1/3\\ percent of the members of either the \n     House or the Senate to vote against the amendment.''\n\n           Most States Do Not Have Supermajority Requirements\n\n       Only six states require the approval of at least two-thirds \n     of their legislatures for any tax increase. Five other states \n     either require such approval for some taxes but not others, \n     require a three-fifths rather than a two-thirds vote, or \n     both. Other states generally require simple majority approval \n     for revenue increases of all sorts.\n       Furthermore, a 1993 General Accounting Office study of \n     state budget trends found that a majority of states surveyed \n     had used both spending cuts and revenue increases to balance \n     their budgets in recent years. Revenue increases accounted \n     for about one-third of the deficit reduction these states \n     instituted to balance their budgets during the period \n     studied.\n\n                     James Madison on Majority Rule\n\n       The Constitutional Convention rejected requiring \n     supermajority approval for basic functions such as raising \n     taxes. Supermajority rules had applied in the Continental \n     Congress. The framers of the constitution had experience with \n     these rules and understood what they were rejecting.\n       In the Federalist Papers No. 58, James Madison, one of the \n     key figures in drafting the Constitution, explained why the \n     Constitution rejected supermajority rule:\n       ``It has been said that more than a majority ought to have \n     been required for a quorum, and in particular cases, if not \n     in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a decision . . . \n     [But that would mean] . . . [i]n all cases where justice or \n     the general good might require new laws to be passed, or \n     active measures to be pursued, the fundamental principle of \n     free government would be reversed. It would be no longer the \n     majority that would rule; the power would be transferred to \n     the minority. Were the defense privilege limited to \n     particular cases, an interested minority might take advantage \n     of it to screen themselves from equitable sacrifices to the \n     general weal, or in particular emergencies to extort \n     unreasonable indulgences.''\n       Madison equated majority rule with ``free government.'' In \n     his view, freedom consisted not just in protecting \n     individuals from unreasonable intrusion by government, but \n     also in the right of citizens to have an equal voice in the \n     affairs of government. According to Madison, a person whose \n     vote is diluted by supermajority rules is not an equal \n     citizen and so does not fully enjoy the fruits of freedom.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The Kyl amendment to the Senate budget resolution \n     endorses a tax system that is ``fairer, flatter, and simpler; \n     that promotes, rather than punishes, job creation, . . . that \n     provides incentives for Americans who save for the future . . \n     . that raises enough money to fund a leaner, more efficient \n     Federal Government . . .'' Some of these phrases are \n     problematic. For instance, the tax code is currently much \n     less progressive than it was in the 1950s, 1960s, and most of \n     the 1970s. Restoring some of that progressivity is viewed by \n     many as enhancing fairness, and the extra revenues could be \n     used either to reduce the deficit or reduce effective tax \n     rates on the middle class. Yet this runs counter to the call \n     for ``flatter'' taxes. Second, payroll taxes ``punish job \n     creation'' to a certain extent, but are considered by the \n     public as a fair trade for Social Security and Medicare. If \n     those programs were funded through general revenues, support \n     for them might erode. Third, tax breaks for private savings \n     tend to decrease national savings because of the federal \n     revenues they lose, and in any case favor investors over \n     workers, again raising questions of fairness. Finally, \n     although a ``leaner, more efficient Federal government'' \n     sounds desirable, the idea that revenues should be cut (which \n     increases the deficit) runs counter to the greater good that \n     can be obtained by reducing the deficit.\n     \\2\\ The California Court of Appeals recently, and apparently \n     correctly, overturned this California fee on the grounds that \n     it passed the California legislature without the requisite \n     two-thirds vote required by the California constitution.\n  Mr. EXON.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to vitiate the yeas and nays on the \nunderlying amendment in view of the success of the tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will give just a brief report. We \nstarted at 9:15. We have disposed of 12 amendments, 8 of them with \nrollcalls, and 4 accepted, or voiced. That is less than three actual \nvotes per hour. The total going into this was 39 pending amendments. We \nhave disposed of 12. If my arithmetic is right, we have 27 amendments \nremaining. On the last vote, we went 7 minutes over. We have been over \non every single one. I do not know what time we will decide to actually \nclose but we are getting perilously close to regular order on one of \nthese.\n  So I urge you to get here on time. I say to the Senate that I have \nspoken to Senator Exon and to a number of Senators.\n  When we get to 12:15, the 2 rollcalls following 12:15 will each be \n15-minute rollcall votes instead of 10. That is to allow Senators to \nget a cup of soup. They can take 20 minutes if they hurry up and vote \nand leave and come back. The max you can get is 30, but I am fearful \nthe time may run out on you. So that is going to be the case.\n  In fact, I propound that as a unanimous-consent request.\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, but I shall not object, I \njust want to compliment the manager of the bill for the very good \nsuggestion that we keep plowing ahead. I would just like to say at this \ntime I think it would be only fair to Members of the body if we tried \nto outline the proposition on the things to come. We have made some \nprogress, although I join my leader in the Budget Committee in \nappealing for faster movement. I simply say that I believe it is \nobvious, at least it is obvious to this Senator at this time, that with \nthe fact that we have an obligation that has been committed to for this \nevening, it would seem clear to me that there is no chance we will \nfinish voting on this resolution today. I am just wondering if that is \nthe feeling of the manager of the bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, I have not given up on completing it. I have not \neven agreed that we will be in recess during this dinner we have for \nspouses. My wife is not terribly impressed with going, she said to me, \nso I might be down here voting. If the distinguished Republican whip \ndoes not like that----\n  Mr. EXON. Is it possible to do anything on a 1-to-nothing vote?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We may be having rollcall votes all night tonight. I am \nthinking that is an option. But let me suggest maybe we can try \nsomething a little different.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators will be quiet, please. Please let \nthere be a modicum of decorum in the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe we will have our staffs do this, if you would \nlike to help us. Maybe we can take two or three of the sense-of-the-\nSenate propositions that have some symmetry and maybe we can ask for \nthem to be voted on en bloc, and maybe that would give everybody his or \nher vote.\n  I note some staffers are saying no. But we might try it. Let us see \nif we could package a few of them. I am not sure that will work.\n  Mr. EXON. We will talk on anything to expedite the process.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let us go to the next amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3996\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is an amendment to save a little bit of \nmoney in the LIHEAP Program, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram. There are 6 years in our budget. The budget of the President \nand the committee and my amendment are all the same for the first 2 \nyears at $1 billion. The next 2 years, I accept the President's budget \nnumbers, which are $934 million and $819 million respectively. Then, in \nyears 5 and 6, I keep the number, adding $119 million. So for the last \n3 of the 6 years, the numbers spent would be $819 million, which is the \nPresident's number in year 4. The total savings would be $633 million \nif we accept this amendment rather than going the route of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds against the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, may I have order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Just a second, Mr. President. I believe I have the \nauthority to designate the Senator in opposition. Senator Specter wants \nto do that. Can we give each one of them 30 seconds, Senator Specter \nand Senator Wellstone?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And Senator Kyl would get 30.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I strenuously oppose this amendment.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee having jurisdiction over LIHEAP \nfunding, I can tell you that we have fought hard for program funding \nthis year. There have been consistent reductions in program funding. We \nare into the bone. The LIHEAP funds are indispensable for the aging. We \nare talking about people who have the option of heating or eating. The \nvast majority, 80 percent, goes to people who have incomes of $7,000 or \nless. This funding ought not to be cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I defer to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I will be happy to speak now, and allow the Senator from \nMinnesota to have the last word.\n  I accepted the numbers from the President, whose budget office gave \nthat program a lower priority by virtue of the fact it was supposed to \nbe temporary. So in years 3 and 4 we have accepted the numbers of the \nPresident's budget and then just continued those numbers for years 5 \nand 6. This is not a drastic reduction, but it is one small step we can \ntake to at least show some sense of fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is not the President's budget, not \nthe last several years. It is a big difference. We just voted 88 to 12 \nfor support of this program. Now we are going to vote for hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in cuts in the outyears. I am delighted my \ncolleague is no longer trying to eliminate the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, but I would remind him that even in States like \nArizona, this summer it could be 110 degrees in nursing homes and you \nmight be eligible for cooling assistance. This is important for \nvulnerable citizens. We should have a strong ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 26, nays 74, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 129 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--26\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brown\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Dole\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Shelby\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--74\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 3996) was rejected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, the next two votes are the votes we are \ngoing to have 15 minutes on each of them. Senator Kennedy's amendment \nis up under the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if we could have order in the Senate, I \nwill just speak briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will not proceed until we come to \norder. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the current law does not permit what we \ncall double billing. If there are going to be services purchased for \nMedicare recipients, that will be payment in full.\n  Under the Republican proposal, they are creating additional kinds of \noptions to spread this out into the private sector. We say that that is \nfine, but we want to continue the same protection of no double billing. \nNo double billing is extremely important to all Medicare recipients. We \nshould maintain that concept in any new future private contracting with \nMedicare.\n  That is what this amendment does, and I think it is absolutely \nnecessary to protect our senior citizens.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, last year, we maintained current law \nprohibitions on balanced billing with traditional fee-for-service \nMedicare. If, however, a Medicare beneficiary wanted to choose a \nprivately offered Medicare plan under that new plan, he or she must be \npermitted to choose a plan which might allow the doctor to charge more.\n  This amendment would put us on record that we cannot have that kind \nof new plan which would be voluntary and chosen by the beneficiaries.\n  So, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. May I inquire of the chairman, it is true now that this \nwill be a 15-minute vote, as is the one to follow? Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This will be a 15-minute vote.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to lay on the table the \namendment of the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy]. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

Mr. President, if it is agreeable with the Senator from \nNew Mexico, I suggest we have a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3997) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3998\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our next amendment is focused on nursing \nhomes, to make sure the standards that were worked out in 1987, in a \nbipartisan way, which have been enormously effective in protecting \nseniors, are going to be continued not only that the Federal standards \nwill be continued but also Federal enforcement.\n  There is a question about whether we need this kind of an amendment \nor not. The House of Representatives now has been willing to accept the \nstandards but not the enforcement. Seniors are entitled to both. That \nis what this amendment does, maintain the current law. I believe it is \nnecessary for protecting our senior citizens.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, our Medicaid restructuring plan will \nmaintain current law and nursing home standards. As I read the Kennedy \namendment, it proposes to change country law as well.\n  I ask the Senator if we could accept the Kennedy amendment without a \nvote, thus permitting us to proceed to another amendment. Would the \nSenator consider a voice vote?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate the support for this \nprogram, but there is a very key element that differentiates this \nproposal with what has been happening in the House, and that is with \nregard to the enforcement. I think a strong voice for not only the \nstandards but the enforcement, as well, is a very important part of it. \nIt would be a strong indication, certainly to the conferees, that is \nthe will of the Senate. I think it is of sufficient importance that we \nought to go on record on that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to repeat, I have been assured by \nthe Finance Committee before this amendment came up that we keep \ncurrent law. I do not think we need a vote, but if the Senator wants \nit, I urge all Republicans vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to comment for the Senate.\n  How many minutes are we over the 15?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Eight minutes over when regular order was called for.\n  The next amendment is another Kennedy amendment.\n  Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3999\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct. Mr. President, this amendment just \nretains current law on spousal impoverishment. All of us remember 1987-\n88 when these amendments were offered by our friend and colleague, \nSenator Mikulski of Maryland, in the Senate in a bipartisan way in \nterms of protecting spousal impoverishment and adult members of \nfamilies, as well as prohibiting liens on the homes. We can all say we \nare for this proposal, but last year every single reconciliation piece \nof legislation that came before us went back on at least one of the \nfour major protections on spousal and family impoverishment.\n  By this record we will send a very clear signal that we want to \nretain the current law. It is important that we do so for these \nfamilies of nursing home members, and this amendment will put the \nSenate on record in favor of those protections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we assume precisely what the sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment provides. I understand the Senator wants to vote. \nSo he is entitled to a vote. I suggest that everybody vote for it.\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take 15 seconds. Last year every \nreconciliation had at least a cut back in one of the four major \nprotections. We want the Senate on record that we are all for those \nprotections. We have had bipartisan support it in the past. We should \nnot take a chance on it in the future.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I intend to ask unanimous consent to \nmodify the amendment. I send the modification, which I have shared with \nthe Senator from New Mexico, to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I discussed it with him, is that what he said? ``I \nshared it.'' He did not say I agreed to the unanimous consent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is, as always, accurate, in making the \nstatement he has not agreed. I had hoped he might agree, as we agreed \nto the modification of Senator Kyl, Senator Lott, and Senator Dole's \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And we may, indeed, have some others. I really have no \nobjection.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4000), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DAVIS-BACON.\n\n       Notwithstanding any provision of the committee report on \n     this resolution, it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     provisions in this resolution do not assume the repeal of the \n     Davis-Bacon Act.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the committee report says the budget \nresolution assumes the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act which protects \ncommunity wage standards for some 500,000 construction workers who work \non Federal projects. This repeal means workers will be paid $4.6 \nbillion less over the life of the budget. That is not fair. We should \nbe attempting to lift workers' wages.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senate will come \nto order.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We should be lifting workers' wages, not reducing them. \nThat is effectively what this amendment does. It ensures the Senate \nwill go on record that this resolution does not assume the repeal of \nthe Davis-Bacon Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4030 to Amendment No. 4000\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress that States should be \nallowed to require welfare recipients to stay drug-free as a condition \n           for receiving welfare benefits from the taxpayers)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment to \namendment No. 4000. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4030 to amendment No. 4000.\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following--\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, point of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will read the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the reading of the \namendment, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WELFARE \n                   RECIPIENTS BE DRUG-FREE.\n\n       In recognition of the fact that American workers are \n     required to be drug-free in the workplace, it is the sense of \n     the Congress that this concurrent resolution on the budget \n     assumes that the States may require welfare recipients to be \n     drug-free as a condition for receiving such benefits and that \n     random drug testing may be used to enforce such requirements.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, point of order. Is the Senator from Nebraska \ncorrect the amendment that has just been offered is not in order until \ntime has been yielded back on the previous amendment, which I do not \nthink was accomplished?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor had yielded back his time, had \nconcluded his time on the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is there time on the second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if there is any question, I yield back \nthe 30 seconds that I had in opposition to Senator Kennedy's first-\ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I think that clarifies it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor of the second-degree amendment has \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I believe it is an affront to the \nAmerican people to adopt and support drug habits in individuals by \nvirtue of subsidizing the welfare payments to those who continue on \ndrugs. It should be an option of States to be able to drug test \neffectively and to condition the receipt of welfare payments on people \nbecoming and remaining drug free.\n  I believe that we do not really help people as long as we finance \nthem while they are involved in drugs. So, the sense of the Senate \nstated here is that the States should have the right and opportunity to \ncondition participation of welfare recipients in programs based on \ntheir being drug free.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we all know what this is. The Senator \ncould have offered his amendment as an initial amendment or a second \ndegree to other amendments.\n  This is about working families. We are talking about construction \nworkers who average $27,000 a year. All we are saying in this bill is \nwe are not going\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\nto repeal Davis-Bacon. If we are going to do that, we ought to do it at \nother times.\n  This is about trying to maintain the existing standards which protect \nAmerican workers out there, and the second degree amendment is a clear \nattempt to undermine the protection of those workers.\n  I hope that the amendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, I just urge my colleagues to vote to \ntable the Kennedy amendment for a lot of reasons. The provisions that \nhe is dealing with deals with Davis-Bacon, goes back to 1931, the \nFederal Government saying if you are doing Federal construction work, \nthat the Department of Labor should set the labor rate, in many cases \nfar in excess of what the prevailing wage really is in those areas.\n  It costs taxpayers in excess of $3 billion. Maybe it is a payoff for, \nI do not know, $35 million for campaigns or something. It does not \nbelong. If you believe in free enterprise, if you believe in the \nmarketplace setting labor rates, you should vote to table the Kennedy \namendment.

My amendment adds $106 billion in budget authority and \n$65 billion in outlays to pay for programs like crime control, \neducation, safer highways, aviation safety, drug treatment, \nenvironmental cleanup, and clean water.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, it is with reluctance that I must \noppose the Byrd amendment. This would increase taxes and spending by \n$65 billion.

The question now occurs on amendment No. 4003 \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, this amendment simply notes that there \nare a number of indices that the Government uses to measure inflation \nand that we should strive to use the most accurate one that is \npossible. We have heard discussion of the CPI. There is another one \ncalled the chain-weighted GDP index.\n  There are all sorts of ways to go. This just says, let us pick the \nmost accurate one and get on with the business of then protecting the \nbudget of the United States to get a handle on the correct and most \naccurate method of indices of measuring inflation or deflation or \ndeflators or whatever we are using in this great complex formulae \nworld.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I supported this when it was offered a few \ndays ago by the Senator from Wyoming. As I understand the amendment, it \nin effect urges the Government to use the most accurate inflation index \navailable. That is pure and simple. We have no objection from this side \nand have heard of no objection from that side. I am wondering, since it \nseems to have universal support, if we could save some time by voice \nvoting this, if we could have the approval of that from the Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I was hoping to follow that precedent, \nbut I see that others have failed to do so. And I thought if I could \ntake 10 more minutes, we could get a vote which would show that indeed \nwe must be about our business. If we were to use the chain-weighted GDP \nindex, that would get you a .4 reduction in things. That is what both \nCBO and OMB use. I just want to get that vote, if I could.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCoverdell be added as a cosponsor of Senator Kyl's amendment No. 3995.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 4007, \noffered by the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham].\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment deals with two important \nissues. One is preserving the integrity of the Medicare trust fund, \nand, second, an effective assault against Medicare fraud. It provides \nthat any funds that are derived by suppression of Medicare fraud will \ngo back into the trust fund from which that fraud caused adverse \neffect. It would not be available for any other spending purposes.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment, which I think is \nboth a statement of our commitment to suppressing Medicare fraud, \nprotecting the Medicare trust fund, and balancing the Federal budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the Senator knows I am going to \ndo this.\n  The Graham amendment is not germane to the provisions of the budget \nresolution. I therefore raise a point of order against the amendment \nunder section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, anticipating this point of order, I would \nlike to point out to my colleagues that on page 53 of the budget \nresolution before us, beginning at line 12, is almost in the same \nverbatim form, a point of order, except that point of order does not go \nto the reconciliation bill, which amendment 4007 does, but rather goes \nto the appropriations bills.\n  If my amendment is considered to be nongermane, clearly, this \nprovision is nongermane. I also point out that in the last budget \nresolution for fiscal year 1996 there were two provisions, which \ncontained point of order enforcement of provisions within the budget \nreconciliation.\n  So, Mr. President, we await the Chair's ruling, which I hope will be \na finding that this is not a valid point of order on the Budget Act.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the proper order at the present time is \nthis: I move to waive the provisions of the Budget Act for the \nconsideration of the Graham amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hope the Senators will deny this \nmotion. This actually violates the Budget Act. This is a matter that is \nnot even within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee. This is a \npiece of legislation directing the treatment of savings of an \nentitlement in a future reconciliation bill. We have no authority to do \nit. We ought not be doing it here. I am not trying to treat one \ndifferent than the other. The same ruling was held in committee on four \nattempts to do the same thing in the committee as we marked up the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. EXON.

A while \nago in kind of a frenzy I said we were going to work right on through \nthis spousal banquet tonight, and I must tell you I have had more \nSenators concerned about this banquet than anything else we have done. \nI surmise that the wives have been watching on television. I know \nSenator Hollings told me that his wife called already, and she was kind \nof upset because she said Senator Domenici said that his wife did not \neven care about this event, and I just want to say to his wife Peatsy, \nI overstated my wife's position. My wife will be thrilled to be there \ntonight, and I really would ask that my previous comments, unless you \nobject, be stricken from the Record.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object. Reserving the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield.\n  Mr. EXON. Does the Senator's wife vote in New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My wife voted in New Mexico, and she is still going to \nvote for me in spite of what I said.\n  I thank the Senate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4008\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 4008 offered by the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft].\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this amendment would eliminate an unfair \ntax on a tax paid by American workers. Every American worker pays \nSocial Security taxes, but only after he or she has already paid taxes \non that money. This is an unfair disparity. The corporations which pay \nthe other half of that tax do not pay a tax on a tax. They get a \ndeduction.\n  Further, this amendment would promote and stimulate growth. The \ngrowth would be substantial--500,000\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\nnew jobs in the economy. It is a job-producing amendment that provides \nmiddle-class tax relief in a way that no other proposal does. I urge \nits adoption by the Senate.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. The budget resolution already has $122 billion plus in tax \ncuts, and the chairman of the Budget Committee on the House side says \nit is $182 billion. If you add the tax cuts that are being suggested by \nthis particular amendment, it is $276 billion on top of what they are \nalready suggesting, whatever that is.\n  This amendment will more than triple an already unwise and \nunwarranted tax cut in this budget. It slashes discretionary spending \nby an additional $217 billion and adds over $75 billion in unspecified \nmandatory savings. We will never balance the budget if we are unable to \ncontrol our urge to provide tax cuts in an election year. I urge \nSenators to vote against this budget-busting proposal that has, as far \nas I know, the support of none of the committees.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays, Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will please come to order. The \nquestion now occurs on amendment No. 4009, offered by the Senator from \nTexas [Mr. Gramm].\n  The Senator is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. In 1993, \nthe President argued that he did not raise income taxes on anyone who \nwas not rich. On its face, that is not valid. As I demonstrated in the \ndebate on the floor of the Senate, the 1994 IRS 1040 form and its \nexplanation show that the 1993 tax increase raised income taxes on the \nSocial Security benefits of people who make $34,000 or more, counting \nhalf of their Social Security benefit. It seems to me that by no \nstretch of the imagination can these people be called rich.\n  What I do in the amendment is call on the President to work with us \nto come up with a way of repealing this tax and at the same time \nworking together to protect Social Security and Medicare. This is an \neminently reasonable amendment. I hope we will get a unanimous vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I noted with interest the comment the \nSenator from Texas made. We just debated it a day or so ago. The \nprovisions of the 1993 act that have been roundly criticized and are \nagain being criticized now, raised taxes on only the top 13 percent--\nthe top 13 percent--of retirees. By contrast, the 1983 Reagan tax \nincrease, which was the first tax increase that ever addressed taxation \nof any kind on Social Security, was supported by the sponsor of this \namendment. I simply say that will raise taxes for 22 percent of the \nretirees. This amendment would cost over $33 billion.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4033 to Amendment No. 4009\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4033 to amendment No. 4009.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``SEC.'' and insert the following:\n\n       . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOLVENCY OF THE MEDICARE TRUST \n                   FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that repeal of certain \n     provisions from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \n     would move the insolvency date of the HI (Medicare) Trust \n     Fund forward by a full year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that no provisions in this Budget Resolution should worsen \n     the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will take my 30 seconds to explain this \namendment.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that repeal of the 1993 \nchange, as proposed in the Gramm amendment, will move the insolvency \ndate of the Medicare trust fund forward a full year. It is astonishing \nto me that the same Senators who claim to be concerned, even alarmed \nsometimes, about the solvency of the Medicare trust fund would sponsor \nlegislation that will have the opposite effect.\n  The second-degree amendment, thereby, assures that no action therein, \nas a part of that act, should worsen the solvency of the Medicare trust \nfund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Does this amendment \nsimply add to mine, or does it substitute for the language of my \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will examine the amendment and make \na ruling in just a moment.\n  Mr. EXON. What the amendment does, simply said, is we can do nothing \nin these considerations that will further weaken or hurt the trust \nfund. That is basically what it does. The amendment of the Senator from \nTexas hurts the solvency of the fund. This amendment corrects that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is advised that it \nstrikes all words after the first word and replaces it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am simply going to offer my amendment as \na second-degree amendment to all the other amendments that come up \nuntil we vote on it. Now, if the Senator would like to add his language \nto mine, I made it very clear in my sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \nwe wanted to work with the President to repeal the Social Security tax \nin such a way as to protect Medicare. If he wants to add his amendment \nto mine, I will support it, we will adopt it, and that will be the end \nof it.\n  Mr. EXON. I will simply say that I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment as offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Gramm of Texas to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mr. Gramm \n     proposes amendment numbered 4034 to amendment No. 4009.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS THAT THE 1993 INCOME TAX \n                   INCREASE ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS SHOULD BE \n                   REPEALED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the assumptions \n     underlying this resolution include that--\n       (1) the Fiscal Year 1994 budget proposal of President \n     Clinton to raise federal income taxes on the Social Security \n     benefits of senior citizens with income as low as $25,000, \n     and those provisions of the Fiscal Year 1994 recommendations \n     of the Budget Resolution and the 1993 Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act in which the 103rd Congress voted to raise \n     federal income taxes on Social Security benefits of senior \n     citizens with income as low as $34,000 should be repealed;\n       (2) that the Senate Budget Resolution should reflect \n     President Clinton's statement that he believed he raised \n     federal taxes too much in 1993; and\n       (3) that the Budget Resolution should react to President \n     Clinton's Fiscal Year 1997 budget which documents the fact \n     that in the history of the United States, the total tax \n     burden has never been greater than it is today, therefore\n       --It is the Sense of the Congress that the assumptions \n     underlying this Resolution include--\n       (1) that raising federal income taxes in 1993 on the Social \n     Security benefits of middle-class individuals with income as \n     low as $34,000 was a mistake;\n       (2) that the federal income tax hike on Social Security \n     benefits imposed in 1993 by the 103rd Congress and signed \n     into law by President Clinton should be repealed; and\n       (3) President Clinton should work with the Congress to \n     repeal the 1993 federal income tax hike on Social Security \n     benefits in a manner that would not adversely affect the \n     Social Security Trust Fund or the Medicare Part A Trust Fund, \n     and should ensure that such repeal is coupled with offsetting \n     reductions in federal spending.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I can save the Senate time. This is the \nsame amendment we had pending a moment ago. What the amendment says is \nthat it was a mistake to impose a confiscatory tax on Social Security \nrecipients that earn $34,000 a year when you count half of their Social \nSecurity benefits. It simply calls on the President to work with us to \nrepeal that tax.\n  We already had in the amendment the provision saying that it is the \nsense of the Senate that we do it in a way that would not adversely \naffect the Social Security trust fund or Medicare. The Senator from \nNebraska added a sense of the Senate resolution saying that nothing we \ndo should adversely affect Medicare. I do not strike that provision. In \nfact, I voted for it. But I want this Senate to go on record that it \nwas a mistake to raise taxes on Social Security beneficiaries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I simply point out that this amendment will \ncost over $33 billion and does not say how we will pay for it. Another \nway of saying that is that this is a political amendment to make a \npolitical statement without saying how we are going to pay for this \nkind of reduction in revenue. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 4034. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

The yeas and nays having been vitiated, the \nquestion is on the underlying amendment, as amended.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4009), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, might I say that some Members \nhave gotten ourselves in trouble because we were planning to meet while \nour spouses were having dinner. We have canceled that radical idea. I \nwant everybody to know we are going to go out at 5:30 because a number \nof Senators want, for some reason, to get ready for this event.\n  Mr. EXON. May I ask that the Senator not include we in that \nstatement, just to clarify the record.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did that on purpose. I did not think anybody would \nobject.\n  One of the chairmen asked me to make an announcement, if I may have \n30 seconds. Senator Bond asked that I announce that the Small Business \nCommittee will hold a short meeting to dispose of two business matters \nthat the committee is aware of in room S-214 at approximately 4:40, \nwhich would probably be after the next vote. In any event, it will be \naround that time. I do not think unanimous consent is required. This is \npermitted. Is that satisfactory?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, it is in the Vice President's office.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4019, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow turn to the consideration of the Dole amendment No. 4019. I have \ncleared this both with Senator Exon and the minority leader.\n  Mr. EXON. That is true. When the 30 seconds on the Dole amendment \ncomes up on our side, I will yield 15 seconds to the two Senators from \nCalifornia, in any order they choose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending question is amendment No. 4019.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I call up Senator Dole's amendment No. \n4019, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, an L.A. Times newsstory gave rise to this \namendment. I think a report by the AG is in order. I will vote ``yes.'' \nI think that report will show vigorous support of law enforcement. I \nthank Senators Domenici and Dole for deleting certain provisions.\n  I yield to Senator Feinstein.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I echo the statement of my colleague, \nSenator Boxer, and only add to it that in a discussion with an editor \nof the Los Angeles Times on this matter yesterday, I think there is \nconflicting data as to whether there are certain guidelines or \nthresholds below which there is not prosecution. I believe this needs \nto be cleared up.\n  I thank the majority leader and Senator Domenici for their \nunderstanding in this matter. I think it is important that there be an \ninvestigation on what prosecutorial guidelines, thresholds, any other \nprovisions for prosecution of across border crime there may be.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Dole amendment expresses the sense \nof the Senate that the Attorney General should investigate whether drug \nsmugglers are avoiding prosecution in the United States because of the \npolicies of the Department of Justice and report to the chairman of the \nHouse and Senate Judiciary Committees on that matter within 30 days.\n  The amendment also expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nAttorney General should change the policy in order to ensure the \nvigorous prosecution of drug smugglers and direct all U.S. attorneys to \nvigorously prosecute them.\n  That is Senator Dole's interpretation of his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the Dole amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Coverdell be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted for the amendment offered by the \nmajority leader on the subject of drug prosecutions in the Southern \nDistrict of California, but I wish to take a moment to clarify any \nmisperceptions that the amendment may have prompted. Some have implied \nthat the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California is weak \non drug prosecutions. This implication is false and unfair.\n  The facts are that the U.S. attorney's aggressive policies have led \nto more drug prosecutions, more prosecutions of border drug smugglers, \nmore criminal alien prosecutions, and more alien smuggling \nprosecutions. This is a record to be proud of.\n  Let us take a look at the facts. Total prosecutions by the U.S. \nattorney have more than doubled over the past 5 years. Let me say that \nagain, the U.S. attorney is prosecuting more than twice as many \nfelonies as his predecessor.\n  The U.S. attorney initiated a formal cooperative agreement on drug \nprosecutions with the San Diego District Attorney. In the past, the DA \ndid not prosecute border-related drug cases at all. Last year, the \nlocal DA prosecuted more than 1,000. As a result of this unprecedented \nFederal-county cooperation, total border-related drug prosecutions have \nmore than tripled over the past 5 years.\n  This cooperative Federal-county relationship is credited by the San \nDiego District Attorney with making a positive impact on San Diego's \noverall crime rate.\n  In January 1995, the U.S. attorney revised its criminal alien \nprosecution guidelines for the first time in more than 10 years. As a \nresult, 1,334 criminal aliens were prosecuted in 1995, compared to only \n179 in 1992--a 745 increase.\n  The U.S. attorney has led a major effort to prosecute alien \nsmugglers. Nearly three times as many alien smugglers were prosecuted \nin 1995 as were prosecuted in 1994. And more will be prosecuted in 1996 \nthan last year.\n  The Dole amendment implies that the U.S. attorney refuses to \nprosecute cases involving less than 125 pounds of marijuana. This is \nabsolutely false. In fact, of the 184 felony marijuana cases prosecuted \nthis year, 50 percent involve less than 125 pounds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that additional material detailing the U.S. \nattorney's record be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This responds to your letter of May 14, \n     1996, concerning a recent Los Angeles Times article on the \n     drug prosecution policies in the Southern District of \n     California. That article provided an incomplete and \n     inaccurate picture of felony drug prosecutions in the \n     Southern District.\n       The most serious inaccuracy in the L.A. Times article is \n     the suggestion that the United States Attorney's Office \n     (``USAO'') is ignoring narcotics cases involving less than a \n     predetermined quantity of drugs. The United States Attorney, \n     in conjunction with the San Diego County District Attorney, \n     pursues all drug cases on the border in which prosecutors \n     believe charges are warranted, regardless of the quantity of \n     drugs involved.\n       Upon taking office in November 1993, United States Attorney \n     Bersin revised the Southern District's prosecution policies \n     in order to make more effective use of sanctions available \n     under the immigration laws. Those revisions have resulted in \n     a 58 percent increase in the total number of felony \n     prosecutions brought by the USAO from 1993 to 1995.\n       Prior to the change in policy, the USAO retained \n     jurisdiction over every defendant arrested for illegal \n     activity at the border, regardless of the seriousness of the \n     offense. As a result of the volume of cases, the USAO treated \n     as misdemeanor possession cases many drug cases that could \n     have been prosecuted as felonies based on the quantities of \n     controlled substance seized.\n       United States Attorney Bersin worked with the District \n     Attorney to change that system. They agreed that the District \n     Attorney would prosecute border-related cases with a San \n     Diego nexus (i.e., the defendant is a resident of or the car \n     is registered in San Diego, or the drugs are destined for San \n     Diego). The District Attorney now prosecutors as felonies \n     many border-related drug cases that would have been brought \n     by the USAO as misdemenaors, if at all, prior to 1994.\n       As a result of this agreement, the number of federal felony \n     drug prosecutions, combined with the District Attorney's \n     felony border drug prosecutions, rose from 764 in 1994 to \n     1,406 in 1995. The agreement has also permitted the United \n     States Attorney's Office to redirect prosecutorial resources \n     from minor drug cases to major narcotics investigations such \n     as those arising from the Department's Southwest Border \n     Initiative. Moreover, the increase in felony dispositions--\n     followed inevitably by deportation--\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\n     has made more defendants eligible for prosecution under the \n     stiff provisions of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326 should they reenter \n     illegally. During 1995, the USAO prosecuted 1,334 such \n     criminal aliens, more than were prosecuted during the entire \n     nine years prior to 1994.\n       Nor was the L.A. Times correct that the USAO automatically \n     declines cases involving less than 125 pounds of marijuana. \n     In the first four months of this year, fully half (92 out of \n     184) of the felony drug cases filed by the USAO were in that \n     category. More important, most of the 2,000 cases referred to \n     the District Attorney since 1994 involved less than 125 \n     pounds of marijuana.\n       There are certain cases in which USAO declines prosecution \n     in favor of immigration proceedings. Where proof of knowledge \n     and criminal intent is lacking, and where the defendant is \n     not a U.S. citizen, has no criminal record, has little or no \n     information about organized drug smuggling, and is found with \n     less than 125 pounds of marijuana, prosecution is deferred \n     and the case is sent to the Immigration Court for an \n     exclusion hearing. All five factors must be present to \n     warrant deferral.\n       At the time of such deferral, the alien's immigration green \n     card or border crossing card is confiscated, he is ejected \n     from the country, and after a hearing can be formally \n     excluded. Under the previous policy, when these cases were \n     prosecuted as misdemeanors, green cards were not confiscated. \n     Moreover, a person who has been excluded, and who reenters \n     the United States with illegal drugs within five years, may \n     be prosecuted for both the new and prior drug offenses.\n       Contrary to the assertion in the L.A. Times article, the \n     policy of deferring prosecution of certain cases is not a \n     ``free pass'' for those who transport less than 125 pounds of \n     marijuana. Seizure of a green card or border crossing card is \n     a serious and immediate sanction and has a far greater effect \n     on drug trafficking than misdemeanor prosecution. Indeed, \n     Peter Nunez, who served as United States Attorney under \n     President Reagan and as the Assistant Secretary of Treasury \n     for Enforcement, has endorsed the use of exclusion \n     proceedings. Former Bush Administration U.S. Attorney William \n     Braniff expressed similar views, as reported in the L.A. \n     Times on May 18, 1996:\n       ``If I had the option that [U.S. Attorney Bersin] has today \n     of immediately ejecting and taking the green card, I would \n     have used that rather than misdemeanor prosecutions. * * * I \n     think in most cases it is a greater deterrent * * *''\n       Finally, the L.A. Times article mischaracterized the eight \n     specific cases that it cited as examples of the U.S. \n     Attorney's Office's purportedly lax prosecution policy. Based \n     on available information, felony charges were, in fact, filed \n     in four of the eight cases. Three of those defendants are in \n     custody; the fourth is a federal fugitive. Of the remaining \n     four cases, the San Diego District Attorney declined to \n     prosecute one because of insufficient evidence to support \n     criminal charges; two were declined by the USAO on the same \n     ground. In the eighth case, prosecution was delayed as the \n     government attempted to secure the cooperation of the \n     suspect. That failed and investigation of the case continues.\n       In sum, the primary implication of the L.A. Times article \n     is misleading and the case-related facts are largely \n     inaccurate. The United States Attorney for the Southern \n     District of California and the District Attorney for San \n     Diego County have vigorously prosecuted drug smugglers at our \n     borders and their efforts should serve as a model for \n     cooperation between law enforcement agencies at the federal \n     and state levels. A careful and responsible analysis of the \n     District's prosecution policies and case statistics can lead \n     to no other conclusion.\n       If I can be of further assistance on this matter, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Janet Reno.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            The District Attorney,\n\n\n                                          County of San Diego,\n\n                                      San Diego, CA, May 15, 1996.\n     Attorney General Janet Reno,\n     Main Justice Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Reno: A recent Los Angeles Times article suggested \n     that drug smugglers crossing the border into California are \n     not being prosecuted. Specifically, it was claimed that \n     criminals who smuggle less than 125 pounds at the border are \n     not charged. Since my office files over 160 marijuana border \n     drug cases every month, I want to correct any misapprehension \n     on this point.\n       Here are the facts:\n       1. The San Diego District Attorney's Office prosecutes \n     border drug cases referred to us by the federal government. \n     This is part of a cooperative effort between the U.S. \n     Attorney and local law enforcement to control border crime. \n     Since 1994 this office has prosecuted approximately 2000 of \n     these cases.\n       2. There is no ``weight limit'' on these cases. The notion \n     that the only marijuana smuggling cases prosecuted are over \n     125 pounds is false. In fact, the average weight is 901 \n     pounds and of the 180 cases currently pending all but 25 of \n     them involve less than 125 pounds. I should note that some \n     cases referred to my office are declined. That percentage \n     (about 23 percent) is consistent with the rejection rate for \n     cases generally and is based solely on the sufficiency of \n     evidence. Those cases that are rejected are still handled by \n     the immigration court.\n       3. Border drug cases are prosecuted successfully. Of the \n     cases referred to our office 85% have been convicted, 9% are \n     pending, and 6% failed to appear for court. There have been \n     no acquittals.\n       Finally, I will note that the success of this cooperative \n     effort has freed resources for major narcotic investigations \n     and has made a positive impact on San Diego's overall crime \n     rate.\n       I am attaching our current list of pending border drug \n     cases which includes by name, date and offense the border \n     drug cases currently being prosecuted. The report should \n     dispel any false impressions about border drug prosecutions. \n     The cases are prosecuted--routinely and successfully.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Paul J. Pfingst,\n     District Attorney.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                         U.S. Customs Service,\n\n                                      San Diego, CA, May 17, 1996.\n\n  Statement of P. Jeffrey Casey, Deputy Special Agent in Charge, U.S. \n                    Customs Office of Investigations\n\n       The quote attributed to me in the May 12, 1996, Los Angeles \n     Times article concerning border drug prosecutions is \n     inaccurate. My ``quote'' was made in the context of \n     describing one component of a three tiered prosecution system \n     in place here in San Diego.\n       I explained to Mr. Reza the three mechanisms in place to \n     prosecute Port of Entry Border drug smugglers apprehended in \n     San Diego County. I told Mr. Reza that one mechanism is \n     Federal prosecution, a second mechanism is County prosecution \n     and the third mechanism is deferred prosecution which is used \n     in those cases where there is insufficient evidence to \n     establish criminal knowledge and intent.\n       The assertion that cases involving 125 pounds of marijuana \n     or less are not prosecuted in San Diego is false. I never \n     made any such statement, nor could I since our U.S. Customs \n     Special Agents present literally hundreds of such cases \n     annually for prosecution as the County and Federal level.\n                                                 P. Jeffrey Casey.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, last week the distinguished majority \nleader, Mr. Dole, reacted with justifiable indignation to a May 12 Los \nAngles Times report indicating that the Clinton-appointed U.S. attorney \nin San Diego is failing to prosecute some of the drug smugglers \ndetected and reported to him. In fact, more than 1,000 suspected \ntraffickers have been sent back to Mexico since 1994 with scarcely more \nthan a slap on the wrist--if that.\n   The U.S. attorney's office in San Diego reportedly has virtually \ndiscontinued filing charges or prosecuting drug smugglers. Instead they \nare merely deported. The Los Angeles paper estimates that 25 percent of \nall detected drug smugglers in the southern district of California are \nsent back to Mexico where they are free to renew attempts to smuggle \ndrugs into the United States.\n  Senator Dole's concerns are well-founded, Mr. President: Consider \nthese cases: Two U.S. citizens were arrested when found to have 150 \npounds of marijuana, in their possession. Another had 386 pounds. All \nthree were released without jail or prosecution.\n  Two Mexican women, transporting 24 pounds of marijuana and 32 pounds \nof narcotics across the border to California, were handed tickets back \nacross the border, where they no doubt reloaded for another trip to \nCalifornia.\n  Customs inspectors are working hard on the borders, but hundreds of \ntraffickers are avoiding prosecution. One Customs inspector told the \nLos Angeles Times: ``Lack of enforcement is not because inspectors are \nnot trying. It's because of the policy coming from upstairs.''\n  Mr. President, the pending sense of the Senate amendment calls on the \nU.S. Attorney General to investigate this situation immediately and \nreport promptly to the respective chairmen of the Judiciary Committees \nof the House and Senate.\n  International drug trafficking is fundamentally a matter of national \nsecurity, Mr. President. The drug trade is one of the gravest threats \nto the security of U.S. today. Smugglers are crossing our southern \nborders with impunity, selling illicit drugs in our communities and \npoisoning our children. Senator Dole refers to these drug smuggling \nthugs as ``merchants of death.'' The distinguished Senator has that \nright--and the problem is getting worse by the day.\n  There's been a resurgence in illegal drug usage among our youth. \nSince 1992, the number of high school seniors using drugs on a monthly \nbasis has jumped 52 percent. And during the current administration, the \nprice of illegal drugs have fallen significantly, suggesting that the \nflow and the availability of illegal drugs are increasing.\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\n  The Clinton administration's record on illicit drug use has been \ndescribed by a Senate Judiciary Committee report as ``benign neglect.'' \nIt is worse than that--it is an abdication of duty.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts states that there was a \n12 percent decline in drug prosecutions between 1992 and 1994. \nFurthermore, the Clinton administration's budget request for fiscal \nyear 1995 would have resulted in a cut of 621 drug enforcement \npositions from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, and other Federal agencies. Fortunately, Congress \nrestored many of these proposed cuts in law enforcement manpower.\n  At a time when drug use is skyrocketing, there should be an urgent \nincrease in aggressive prosecution of the criminals who transport \nillicit drugs across our borders. This is a national problem, Mr. \nPresident, yet the administration has reduced drug prosecutions at the \nvery time that drug use is soaring. It's time for the administration to \nrejoin the war on drugs and the vigorous enforcement of our Federal \ndrug laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Kansas. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 143 Leg.]\n\n                               YEAS--100\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 4019), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4010\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 4010 offered by the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown].\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will not ask for a rollcall vote on this. \nI think it can be voice voted. It is very direct. It speaks to the \nproblem that we have which the Entitlement Commission pointed out that \nsays they were not going to have the money to pay people their \nentitlements--retirement funds--when they come due. It says that in the \nfuture the COLA--the cost-of-living adjustment--that occurs \nautomatically will only apply to the first $75,000 of retirement pay. I \nhave checked. The Defense Department tells me no military personnel \ncome under this. OMB tells me that something like one-tenth of 1 \npercent of total retirees would have this applied to them. But 30 years \nfrom now, after people who joined the military service or joined civil \nservice under these rules come to retirement, it will have an impact. \nIt is one way in the future prospectively to make sure we have money to \npay the retirements that we promised.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds of our time to my friend \nand colleague from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I disagree strongly with this. I think it \nunfairly limits people in the future. It is an arbitrary attempt to \nattack the earned pension benefits of the more highly compensated \nFederal employees, both military and civilian. The higher paid \nemployees receive higher pension benefits, and I think it is unfair to \npenalize some Federal employees because they were good at their job, \nbecause they were promoted and because they make a better salary in \ntheir retirement.\n  Now, the amendment was defeated in the Budget Committee. It is \nbrought up again here. It is, in effect, a future income cut for these \npeople. Once again, we are trying to make our senior military and our \ncivilians the whipping boys because of our failure on other budget \nmatters. I think it is drastically unfair.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, did somebody ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Ohio did.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Even though he is willing to go by voice?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes, because I disagree strongly with the amendment for \nreasons I just gave.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We can vote it down by voice, and then the Senator \ncould still get the yeas and nays after.\n  Mr. GLENN. I certainly want to know what the ruling would be in that \ncase. I am not going to do it because I know what the decision would \nprobably be.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. I certainly would not object to the request for a vote \nafter he hears the ruling of the Chair if he wishes to do that. My only \nthought was a voice vote would expedite procedures. I am happy to go \nalong with either procedure you prefer.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He is just suggesting that if he happens to lose on a \nvoice vote, he can then have a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. OK, I agree with that, if we have the agreement that if we \nlose on the voice vote, we will then have a record rollcall vote. That \nis fine. I trust all the people on our side will be in good voice.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There are a lot of people in the Chamber. Only Senators \nmake their voices heard now. None of the staff votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the yeas and nays \nare vitiated. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4010) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4011\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non agreeing to amendment No. 4011 of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Harkin is up.\n  Mr. EXON. I am not sure the Senator from Iowa heard. I think the \nChair was asking him to proceed. The next amendment up is No. 23 on my \nlist, which is No. 4011 by Senator Harkin. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is Senator Harkin's amendment now.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What happened to the vote on the other one?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are finished. We have done it.\n  Mr. EXON. To answer the Senator's question, it was turned down by \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I see.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment divides the first \nreconciliation bill. All this amendment does is it takes welfare reform \nand separates it from Medicaid reform. It puts welfare reform in the \nfirst reconciliation bill. It leaves Medicaid reform in the second \nreconciliation bill so that we can have a straight vote on welfare \nreform. We should pass welfare reform in this Congress. We should and \nwe can. It is not likely to be signed if it has a controversial \nMedicaid bill attached to it. So I call this the let-real-welfare-\nreform-become-law amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will move to table the amendment \nshortly. But let me just say the budget resolution has a first \nreconciliation bill that will include welfare reform and Medicaid. This \namendment strikes the Medicaid from that reconciliation bill and puts \nit into one with Medicare and other entitlements. I do not believe we \nought to do that. We have thought it\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\nthrough and we want it in two pieces. The first one should be welfare \nreform and Medicaid.\n  Therefore, I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the motion to table \namendment No. 4011, offered by the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. May I suggest the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, I wonder if Senator Bumpers will be \nwilling to proceed with his second of sequential amendments--the one on \nthe firewalls--now, and then we will proceed immediately to the other \namendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Which one do you want to do first?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Firewalls.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. You want to do firewalls first?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask it be in order for Senator Bumpers \nto proceed to the Bumpers-Simon amendment No. 4014.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have been preparing for the amendment on asset sales. \nWe are not really quite ready to go to firewalls. Is there any \nobjection to going ahead with the asset sales?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have a second-degree amendment to yours, and we are \nnow checking that amendment to make sure that it is not subject to a \nparliamentary impediment. If it is, we will try to repair it, and we do \nnot have enough time to repair it in 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I think it is irreparable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will set it aside and take firewalls. If \nyou want, I can explain the firewalls amendment for you.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. We would rather like to offer the asset sales first and \nthen get the second one disposed of one way or the other.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment NO. 4013\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment is one that we have voted \non a number of times. We voted twice last year. It got 47 votes the \nfirst time, it got 49 votes the second time. It simply says, you cannot \nsell assets of the Federal Government and score those assets on the \nbudget deficit. If you sold $130 billion worth of Government property \ntoday, you could balance the budget this year, but next year you are \ngoing to have the same budget deficit you had. Rudolph Penner, Bob \nReischauer both say it is bad policy. It is dishonest budgeting. We \nought not to be doing it. From 1987 to 1995 we specifically provided in \nthe budget resolution that we would not score asset sales.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that at least we can get this body to vote \nfor honest budgeting. I am not suggesting that you not sell assets. I \nhave voted one asset sale this year. I am saying, do not score it. It \nreminds me of the guy that came home from the office and told his wife \nhe had a great day at the office. She said, ``What happened?'' He said \nhe sold his desk. That is what we are doing when we sell the assets and \nput it on the deficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

CORPORATE SUBSIDIES AND SALE OF GOVERNMENT ASSETS.\n\n       (a) Corporate Subsidies.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional levels and aggregates in this budget \n     resolution assume that:\n       (1) the federal budget contains tens of billions of dollars \n     in payments, benefits and programs that primarily assist \n     profit-making enterprises and industries rather than provide \n     a clear and compelling public interest;\n       (2) corporate subsidies can provide unfair competitive \n     advantages to certain industries and industry segments;\n       (3) at a time when millions of Americans are being asked to \n     sacrifice in order to balance the budget, the corporate \n     sector should bear its share of the burden.\n       (4) federal payments, benefits, and programs which \n     predominantly benefit a particular industry or segment of an \n     industry, rather than provide a clear and compelling public \n     benefit, should be reformed or terminated in order to provide \n     additional tax relief, deficit reduction, or to achieve the \n     savings necessary to meet this resolution's instructions and \n     levels.\n       (b) Sale of Government Assets.--\n       (1) Budgetary Treatment.--\n       (A) In general.--For the purposes of any concurrent \n     resolution on the budget and the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974, no amounts realized from the sale of an asset shall be \n     scored with respect to the level of budget authority, \n     outlays, or revenues if such sale would cause an increase in \n     the deficit as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (B).\n       (B) Calculation of net present value.--The deficit estimate \n     of an asset sale shall be the net present value of the cash \n     flow from:\n       (i) proceeds from the asset sale;\n       (ii) future receipts that would be expected from continued \n     ownership of the asset by the Government; and,\n       (iii) expected future spending by the Government at a level \n     necessary to operate and maintain the asset to generate the \n     receipts estimated pursuant to clause (ii).\n       (2) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     `sale of an asset' shall have the same meaning as under \n     section 250(c)(21) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (3) Treatment of loan assets.--For the purpose of this \n     subsection, the sale of loan assets or the prepayment of a \n     loan shall be governed by the terms of the Federal Credit \n     Reform Act of 1990.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of the \nSenate on an issue of profound importance to the American people--the \nreform and elimination of undue corporate subsidies in the Federal \nbudget.\n  The amendment finds that the Federal budget contains billions of \ndollars in payments, benefits and programs that predominantly assist \nprofitmaking enterprises rather than provide\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\na clear and compelling public benefit. Such largess can provide unfair \ncompetitive advantage to certain industries and industry segments and \nhas become an enormous drain on the Treasury.\n  And, the amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nCongress should reform or terminate such programs in order to provide \nadditional tax relief, deficit reductions, or achieve the savings \nnecessary to meet the resolution's budget instruction.\n  Mr. President, we are asking millions of Americans--from families who \nreceive food stamps to our men and women in uniform--to sacrifice in \norder to stop the Nation's fiscal bleeding.\n  As a matter of simple fairness, we have a moral obligation to ensure \nthat corporate interests share the burden. The Cato and Progressive \nPolicy Institutes, have identified 125 Federal programs that subsidize \nindustry to the tune of $85 billion every year, and PPI found an \nadditional $30 billion in tax loopholes to powerful industries.\n  The public cannot understand why we continue to shell out billions of \ndollars in subsidies to powerful corporate interests, when we simply \ncannot afford such largess, and at a time when many corporate CEO's are \nearning bonuses that resemble the budgets of many school districts.\n  Corporate pork cannot be justified in such an environment and it has \nno place in a diminishing Federal budget.\n  Some believe that corporate pork is a thing of the past. Sadly that \nis not so. While some gains were made this year in trimming the fat, \nthe effort was been disappointingly anemic.\n  We still subsidize the overseas advertising of multimillion dollar \ncompanies through the Marketing Promotion Program; hundreds of millions \nare earmarked for unrequested hometown military construction projects; \nwe still coddle wealthy peanut and sugar growers with anachronistic \nproduction quotas and tariff restrictions; billions remain in the \npipeline for highway demonstration projects which are not even \nconsidered priorities in the States where they will be built;\n  And the biggest and most obscene example, we still plan to give away \nbillions of dollars in publicly owned electromagnetic spectrum to \naffluent communications companies; and that list goes on and on.\n  Last November, I offered an amendment along with Senator Thompson and \nothers to eliminate and reform 12 of the most celebrated and egregious \nforms of corporate pork identified by CATO and PPI. The fact that 74 \nSenators voted against the amendment is ample testimony to the problem.\n  Mr. President, corporate pork wastes resources, increases the \ndeficit, distorts markets and has no place either in a free market \neconomy or in a budget where we are asking millions of Americans to \nsacrifice for the good of future generations.\n  As the Public Policy Institute observed, ``The President and Congress \ncan break the current impasse and substantially reduce both spending \nand projected deficits * * * if they are willing to eliminate or reform \nscores of special spending programs and tax provisions narrowly \ntargeted to subsidize influential industries.''\n  ``If we are willing''? That's the million dollar question, Mr. \nPresident. This amendment will determine where the Senate stands on \ncorporate subsidies, and will serve as a springboard to make the \nchanges necessary to regain control of the budget and restore the \npublic's confidence in the budget process.\n  Mr. President, a portion of this amendment crafted by Senator \nDomenici addresses the question of how asset sales should be treated in \nregard to budget scoring. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico \nwill explain that particular language in his remarks.\n  I thank Senator Domenici and I urge all Senators to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, to summarize, this amendment makes two changes to the \nBumpers asset sales amendment. First, it would add language expressing \nthe sense of the Senate that corporate subsidies should be reduced. The \nlanguage states we should eliminate any unjustified corporate subsidies \nin the budget and use the savings for deficit reduction and tax relief. \nSecond, in lieu of the Bumpers amendment, it would prohibit using asset \nsales to balance the budget. This amendment would prohibit the scoring \nof proceeds from asset sales that would lead to a financial loss by the \nFederal Government over the long run.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona's amendment is \nnot the worst amendment in the world. But it simply does not address \nthe problem. It essentially says that if we are going to sell an asset, \nlet us get fair market value. That is not the problem, even though in \ncases it has a tendency to be the problem.\n  But the problem is that we have been proposing around here to sell \nthe PMA's. If you have a power marketing system in your State, there \nhas been a proposal to sell it. We sold one in Alaska, just voted to \nsell the Uranium Enrichment Corporation. There have been proposals to \nsell Elk Hills. It is now on the block. I am not suggesting we are not \ngoing to get fair market value for it, even though we will not because \nit is money--as the Senator from Arizona says, the amount of money \ncoming in over the next 30 years is more than we are going to get. All \nI am saying is, sell it if you want to, put it on infrastructure; but \ndo not put it on the deficit when you have to come back next year and \nredress it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for at least \nrecognizing that our amendment is not the worst amendment in the world. \nWe greatly appreciate that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It is close.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is obvious this amendment is a good amendment. It \nsays asset sales cannot cost the Government over time, present value \ncannot cost the Treasury any money. We think that is a good rule. We \nhope we adopt it. I ask for the yeas and nays on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \nMcCain second-degree amendment No. 4035. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] and \nthe Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 0, as follows:\n  \n\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 145 Leg.]\n\n  \n\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n  \n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  \n\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n  \n\n     Dodd\n     Lieberman\n       \n  \n\n  The amendment (No. 4035) was agreed to.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 4036 to Amendment No. 4013, as Amended\n\n(Purpose: To restore common sense to the budget rules by reversing the \n               rule change on the scoring of asset sales)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Bradley, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 4036 \n     to amendment No. 4013, as amended.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       The pending amendment, as amended, is amended by adding the \n     following:\n       Not withstanding subsection (1) of this amendment regarding \n     the sale of government assets, the sale of assets shall be \n     treated as follows:\n       (1) Budgetary treatment.--For purposes of any concurrent \n     resolution on the budget and the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974, no amounts realized from sales of assets shall be \n     scored with respect to the level of budget authority, \n     outlays, or revenues.\n       (2) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``sale of an asset'' shall have the same meaning as under \n     section 250(c)(21) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (3) Treatment of loan assets.--For the purposes of this \n     section, the sale of loan assets or the prepayment of a loan \n     shall be governed by the terms of the Federal Credit Reform \n     Act of 1990.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I would like to \nannounce for the Senate--and I hope Senators will listen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When we finish this second-degree amendment by Senator \nBumpers, which we will start very shortly, there will be no further \nvotes tonight. When we wrap up business today, we will indicate in the \nunanimous consent that at 10 a.m. in the morning we will begin a series \nof rollcall votes on the budget resolution. We believe we have 11 of \nthem. We will work until 1 o'clock and have a recess for 1 hour, return \nat 2 o'clock and we will be finished sometime shortly thereafter. By \nthat time, we will probably be down to three or four amendments.\n  That is what we have agreed to. I am not putting it before the Senate \nin a consent, but I thought you would like to know.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator has yielded for a question of the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator if the \nMcCain amendment we have adopted has any application to the Bonneville \npower administration as it relates to its corporate status.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The corporate subsidies and all matters related thereto \nwere never intended to relate to Bonneville.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And/or similar projects to Bonneville.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senate for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I know everybody wants to get to the \nparty. This amendment, the second-degree amendment, is precisely the \nsame amendment as my first-degree amendment which was taken down by the \nMcCain amendment. The McCain amendment does one thing that is good. It \nsays that you cannot sell an asset for less than its net present value, \nbut that does not affect an asset like a national park that has no \nincome stream. And second, let me repeat, Rudolph Penner and Bob \nReischauer, two of the most respected directors of the Congressional \nBudget Office we have ever had, said it is terrible policy to score \nasset sales on the budget deficit.\n  Please vote yea on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senate overwhelmingly voted to substitute this \namendment. We voted for it. There is no use going back and undoing what \nwe have done by another amendment. So I move to table the Bumpers \namendment and ask for yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Bumpers amendment No. 4036. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] and \nthe Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question now occurs on amendment No. 4013, \nas amended.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the underlying amendment, \nas amended, be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4013), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we continue our important quest to \nfree the children of this country from an enormous burden of debt; we \ncan start to free up the Federal Government from the compounding \ninterest payments that threaten our fiscal future. The vote today is a \nvery important one. It shows whether we are determined to balance the \nbudget in a meaningful and attainable way, or whether we want to see \nbusiness as usual in the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, the problem of lowering the deficit is not a new one. \nWe got to this point over a period of 40 years. Over the last 30 years, \nwe have seen a clear and uninterrupted trend of increasing deficits. \nDuring the 1960's, deficits averaged $6 billion per year. In the \n1970's, deficits averaged $36 billion per year. In the 1980's, they \nclimbed to $156 billion per year. It doesn't stop there, in the 1990's, \nso far, deficits have averaged $259 billion per year.\n  I think there is plenty of blame to share among all the Members of \nCongress and all the U.S. Presidents during these decades of debt \nbuildup. The Vietnam war, the rise in entitlements, the creation of new \nagencies and roles of Government--all of these and other factors \ncontributed to the budget mess we are in today.\n  But, today, Mr. President, the question is not so much how we got in \nthe hole, but how we get out.\n  Today, Mr. President, we can only lay blame on those who do not \nsupport a plan to balance the budget by the year 2002 and utilizing \nreal numbers. Today, we have an opportunity to begin the process of \naddressing our deficit head-on and setting our country on the road to a \nbalanced budget.\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\n  Mr. President, the taxpayers pay for the deficits the Federal \nGovernment keeps running up. Every year the hard-working Americans work \nto pay for our fiscal irresponsibility. But, the hurt from our spending \ndoes not stop there. The ones who are going to bear the brunt of this \ndebt are our children and grandchildren. A child born today will pay \n$187,000 in taxes throughout his or her lifetime just to pay the \ninterest on the debt our annual deficit spending has amassed.\n  This debt amounts to roughly $18,500 per person today with annual \ninterest charges exceeding $2,575 per taxpayer. This is not right.\n  Mr. President, balancing the budget will help to lighten this burden \non our families, and most importantly, on our children and \ngrandchildren. It will take a long time to pay off a $4.9 trillion \ndebt. But, by voting on a resolution to balance the budget by 2002, we \ncan at least begin the process. And, we can face the dawn of a new \ncentury with a renewed commitment to fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I think that almost all of us theoretically agree that \nwe must balance the budget. And, clearly, the debate involves setting \npriorities. But, the real test is one of political will. Not one of us \nis going to get his or her own way on everything in this budget \nresolution. But, the larger issue still looms. Are we determined to \nbalance the budget? Are we willing to compromise a little here and \nthere for achievement of a goal that has been eluding us for decades?\n  We must use reliable data. Using rosy estimates and forecasts may \nmake the job of Federal budgeting easier for us and for the President, \nbut it won't work. When I commute to the Hill in the morning, I can \nestimate that it will take me 5 minutes. But, that estimate won't make \nme on time.\n  We need to use conservative, real-life estimates of what the economy \nis going to look like in the future so we adopt reasonable policies to \nefficiently react to the economic environment of the future.\n  The difference between the Republican budget resolution and the \nbudget submitted by President Clinton is what it gives to the American \npeople. The Republican bill lowers the cost of Government, keeps the \nMedicare trust fund solvent longer, contains attainable spending \ncontrol, and allows the American people to keep more of their hard-\nearned money.\n  Many of my colleagues have complained about the control we put on \nspending in this legislation. I can only say to them that if we do not \ndo it now, the pain will be even greater later on. What will we tell \nseniors when their savings are devoured by inflation? What will we tell \nour kids in just a few years when a greater share of our annual budget \nis allocated to debt service than to domestic programs such as \neducation or public health?\n  Mr. President, this is where the rubber meets the road. Do we \ncontinue to hide behind business as usual, using rosy estimates and \ngimmicks? Do we front-load spending on all the popular programs in the \nfirst few years and back-end all the serious reductions into the last 2 \nyears? That strategy obviously appeals to President Clinton since that \nis the basic idea in his budget. Personally, I see no virtue in \npostponing the inevitable. The deficit cancer will not cure itself if \nwe ignore it longer.\n  I, for one, am not willing to leave the future of this country to the \nstatus quo. I believe that the most important thing we can do is \ncontinue to move down the road to fiscal responsibility. I want to \ncommend Senator Domenici and my colleagues on the Budget Committee. \nHaving served on the Budget Committee, I am well aware of the \ndifficulty in bringing a budget resolution to the Senate floor, let \nalone one that is honest, straightforward, and gets the job done. I \njoin in supporting this budget resolution.\n\n\n     maintaining economic development agency field representatives\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has adopted \nmy amendment on the Economic Development Administration. This amendment \ncalls for the EDA to place high priority on maintaining field-based \neconomic development representatives and requests reconsideration of \nthose staff and offices that are now slated to be terminated and closed \nas part of the EDA's recent reduction in force.\n  Mr. President, I support the Economic Development Administration's \nefforts over the last 30 years in New Mexico. Recently, New Mexico has \nmoved from 48th to 47th place in the Nation in terms of per capita \npersonal income. New Mexico, in terms of export sector growth, has been \nfirst in the Nation for the last 5 years. While I don't wish to imply \nthat the EDA has directly caused all of these changes, I do believe \nthat the EDA has played a vital role in helping to nurture economic \nactivity in areas of New Mexico that might not otherwise have made the \nsort of efforts that are now underway.\n  The Economic Development Administration is not designed to help urban \nareas further develop. Rather, EDA's mission is to nurture economic \ncompetence and help seed economic activity in nonurban regions of the \nNation, particularly in economically disadvantaged communities. The EDA \ndoes a great many things that have been important in New Mexico and \naround the Nation including the promotion of industrial park \ndevelopment, business incubators, water and sewer system improvements, \nvocational and technical training facilities, technical assistance and \ncapacity building for local governments, economic adjustment \nstrategies, revolving loan funds and other projects which the private \nsector has nor generated or will not generate without some assistance \nfrom the Government.\n  The Economic Development Administration maintains six regional \noffices which oversee staff that are designated field-based \nrepresentatives. These regional offices are located in the urban areas \nof Austin, Seattle, Denver, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago, but \nmost of the field representatives are located in the States that they \ncover.\n  The budget that Congress finally approved for the EDA in 1996 capped \nsalaries and expenses at $20 million, which represents a 37-percent \nreduction from fiscal year 1995 levels. The new Assistant Secretary of \nEconomic Development, Dr. Phillip Singerman, has certainly had very \ndifficult staffing decisions to make in leading a reduction-in-force \nprocess to bring the staffing level down to what the budget would \nallow. I know that this has been a painful, difficult process, and I \nappreciate the letter from Dr. Singerman on May 6 announcing the \ntermination of our New Mexico-based economic development representative \nin which he wrote that New Mexico would continue to get his personal \nattention.\n  My problem today is not with Dr. Singerman's intent. I know that he \nhas tried to cut staff from all parts of EDA--including approximately \n18 positions from the Washington headquarters. My concern is that while \nDr. Singerman and the EDA might have every intent of covering New \nMexico, they will not be on the ground working on a regular basis with \ncommunities that do need and have benefited from contact with a field-\nbased economic development representative.\n\n  The Washington headquarters of EDA is about 2,000 miles from New \nMexico, and the Austin regional office which oversees New Mexico is \napproximately 700 miles from Santa Fe. There is no doubt that the \ncommunities of New Mexico that have been pulling themselves together \nand generating much needed economic infrastructure are losing a very \nimportant resource because of the EDA's decision to shut down our local \noffice.\n  The States that are losing field representative coverage include New \nMexico, Arizona, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Illinois, Indiana, \nMaine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Mississippi, and North Carolina. \nAmong these, New Mexico ranks 47th in per capita personal income in the \nNation. Oklahoma ranks 46th. Mississippi is about 49th. North Dakota is \n42d, Arizona 35th, Maine 34th, and North Carolina 33d.\n  In Dr. Singerman's letter to me, as well as to some of my other \nSenate colleagues, he stated that the decision to cut these positions \nor to not replace retiring personnel was based on such criteria as \n``local need.'' The States I have mentioned certainly rank high in the \nneed category.\n  While the EDA was closing down the New Mexico EDA office, it was \nbolstering the Austin Regional Office with personnel from Washington, \nDC. To make matters worse, Texas is one of the few States in the Nation \nwith two\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\nfield-based representatives, both of whom work out of the Austin \noffice, and neither of these positions was cut. Oklahoma and New Mexico \nboth lost their field representatives in this process, and I think that \nthis just runs counter to Economic Development Administration's \nmission.\n  Many of the most recognizable places in New Mexico, and many of our \nmost ambitious efforts to improve our economy have been brought to life \nthrough the efforts of Jim Swearingen and the Santa Fe EDA office. \nDuring the 30 years of EDA operation in New Mexico, the EDA office has \nprovided millions of dollars of Federal assistance toward economic \ndevelopment projects including Albuquerque's KIMO Theater, the Sweeney \nConvention Center in Santa Fe, the Mesilla Plaza, the Taos Plaza, the \nUNM Technology Commercialization Center, the Carlsbad Advanced \nManufacturing Training Center, the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, and \nnumerous other projects. So far this year, EDA has provided $400,000 \nfor infrastructure supporting Fort Sumner's Cheese Factory Project, $1 \nmillion for a business incubator in Farmington, and $4.5 million for \nthe Crownpoint Institute of Technology in Crownpoint. Jim Swearingen \nhas served New Mexico for 24 years--and is a person widely respected in \nmy State. He has made a great difference.\n  I strongly believe that the EDA needs to keep its field \nrepresentatives out with the people and communities it serves. I am \npleased that there was strong bipartisan agreement in the Senate that \nthe EDA should reconsider the nature of its current reduction-in-force \nand should make field representation one of its highest priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5461-6", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n THE NOMINATION OF COL. JOSEPH T. MURPHY TO BE A BRIGADIER GENERAL IN \n                      THE U.S. ARMY NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has given \nits approval to the nomination of Col. Joseph T. (Tim) Murphy to be a \nbrigadier general in the U.S. Army National Guard. He has faithfully \nserved in the South Dakota Army National Guard for more than 25 years \nand currently serves as the State's assistant adjutant general.\n  I have had the honor and pleasure of working with Tim Murphy on a \nnumber of National Guard issues over the years and have been \ncontinually impressed by his commitment and dedication. He has been an \noutstanding advocate for the South Dakota National Guard and has served \nhis State and country with the utmost integrity.\n  Considering the excellent leadership that he has provided, it is easy \nto understand why the South Dakota National Guard has been so \nsuccessful. Just recently, for instance, the 854th Engineer Company in \nMobridge and Lemmon, SD won the 1995 National Guard's Itschner Award \nfor the most outstanding engineer company in the Active Army, Army \nReserve, and the Army National Guard. This is the fifth time during the \npast 20 years that a South Dakota National Guard unit has won the \nprestigious award.\n  I have a great deal of respect and admiration for Tim Murphy and am \nconvinced that his nomination is well deserved and long overdue. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to review some of the highlights of \nhis distinguished career in the South Dakota Army National Guard.\n  Tim Murphy enlisted in the South Dakota Army National Guard upon \ngraduating from Brookings High School in 1960. He subsequently attended \nthe South Dakota Military Academy officer candidate school and was \ncommissioned a second lieutenant in 1965. In the same year, he served \nas a full-time technician and administrative officer for the 139th \nTransportation Battalion in Brookings. In 1971, he was selected as the \nfirst recruiting and retention manager for South Dakota.\n  During his tenure with the South Dakota Army National Guard, Tim \nMurphy served in many other capacities. As his extensive biography \nindicates, he was a maintenance officer, a personnel officer, and an \nassistant operations training officer. He was also the 129th Public \nAffairs Detachment commander and the South Dakota State Area Command \nrecruiting and induction officer. In addition, he served as the plans, \noperations and military support officer; the director of personnel; and \nthe director of logistics.\n  Tim Murphy was promoted to colonel in 1984. Five years later, he \nentered active duty and became the U.S. Property and Fiscal Officer for \nSouth Dakota. In 1991, he became the chief of staff for the South \nDakota Army National Guard at Camp Rapid in Rapid City, SD. He \nmaintained that position until he was promoted to assistant adjutant \ngeneral earlier this year.\n  In addition to the many assignments that he has held in the Army \nNational Guard, Tim Murphy has also earned numerous military awards and \ndecorations. He has received the Meritorious Service Medal with four \noak leaf clusters, the Army Commendation Medal with two oak leaf \nclusters, and the Air Force Commendation Medal.\n  Tim Murphy also earned the National Defense Service Ribbon, the Army \nReserve Component Achievement Medal with three oak leaf clusters, and \nthe Army Service Ribbon. In addition, he received the Armed Forces \nReserve Medal with XX device, the Overseas Training Ribbon, the \nNational Guard Bureau Eagle Award, and a Master Aviator Badge.\n  I congratulate Tim on his nomination to be a brigadier general in the \nArmy National Guard. As I mentioned, his nomination is well deserved \nand long overdue. I wish him and his wife, Carol, the very best and \nhope their future is filled with good health and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5490-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5490-S5491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IKE AND DUCKWORTH\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, in the Wall Street Journal yesterday \nthere was an article entitled ``They Also Served Who Bark and Sniff.'' \nI think perhaps some Members of the Senate may have missed this. Since \ntonight is the night we honor President Eisenhower, I urge all Members \nto read this very touching story about a small dog that was a mascot to \nthe Air Corps in World War II and what Ike did about that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 20, 1996]\n\n                  They Also Served Who Bark and Sniff\n\n                          (By Frank Whitsitt)\n\n       Time has run out on World War II anniversary stories, but \n     there's an overlooked one, about a general and a dog. It came \n     to light in a recent exhibit at the Eisenhower Library, in \n     Abilene, Kan., that showed what animals--either as beasts of \n     burden or as mascots--have meant to the armed forces, which \n     we honor today, Armed Forces Day.\n       Three young Army fliers were inseparable during their World \n     War II training in Florida until the day one of them, \n     Bostonian John Stuart Duckworth II, was transferred to Texas. \n     His pals, Richard East of New York and Harold Taff of \n     Indiana, went hunting for a squadron mascot to name for \n     Duckworth. At a city pound in St. Petersburg, they plucked \n     off death row a small, black-and-white springer spaniel with \n     an irresistible way of cocking his head.\n       Duckworth the dog flew a lot of bombing missions in \n     Northwest Africa. He was always the first off after the \n     bomber rolled to a stop. He'd head for the landing gear's \n     left wheel and do what's expected of a dog cooped up for \n     hours. When Lts. East and Taff switched to fighter planes, \n     the mascot was grounded. Nonetheless, he would patiently \n     await one or the other's return.\n       But the day came--April 4, 1943--when Lt. East did not come \n     back. He was listed as missing in action until Allied forces \n     found the wreckage of his plane when they moved into Tunis. \n     Lt. Taff took the loss hard. Dick East had been the best man \n     at his wedding. And it took some time for Duckworth to \n     realize that Lt. East would never fly back into his life. For \n     days he had waited at the airfield, his excitement over each \n     landing fading when someone other than Lt. East deplaned. But \n     the dog still had Lt. Taff, and Lt. Taff still had Duckworth.\n       Unaware of this relationship, Lt. East's father, Bion R. \n     East of the Columbia University medical faculty, wrote Gen. \n     Dwight Eisenhower, asking if the dog could be sent to him and \n     the grieving mother.\n       Ike directed that every effort be made to do so. Duckworth \n     was put aboard a plane to start the journey to the States. \n     But Ike was soon notified that a flier named Taff was \n     heartbroken over losing the dog and was remaining with the \n     plane until it took off. Putting military morale first, Ike \n     wrote Dr. East of his decision to return the dog to Lt. Taff. \n     Then Ike shared with Dr. East what his own dog meant to him. \n     Ike's words may explain why he interrupted his rather \n     important job of kicking the Nazis out of Africa\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\n     merely because of the friendship between a man and his \n     dog:\n       ``The friendship of a dog is precious. It becomes even more \n     so when one is so far removed from home as we are in Africa. \n     I have a Scottie. In him I find consolation and diversion. \n     For me he is the one `person' to whom I can talk without the \n     conversation turning back to the war. Duckworth is performing \n     a patriotic service. I am confident you will view the \n     situation similarly despite the natural desire to have this \n     close companion of your gallant son.''\n       Dr. East wrote Lt. Taff, apologizing for nearly separating \n     him and Duckworth, and asked, ``When you have returned to \n     your wife and family, would you consider letting us keep \n     him?'' So Duckworth stayed, and the war went on.\n       Young Lt. Taff, daring, skillful and lucky, survived nearly \n     100 missions. His commanders decided he had given enough and \n     sent him home. The squadron agreed that Duckworth should \n     accompany him, that the dog, too, had gone the extra mile. \n     Three days after their departure, Dr. East got a call from \n     Chicago. ``This is Harold Taff, came the words. ``I've \n     brought Duckworth home to you and Mrs. East.''\n       The Easts' Plainfield, NJ., residence was not the home Lt. \n     East grew up in. When he entered the house, Duckworth was \n     casual until he reached a room where the Easts has placed \n     their son's possessions. He became excited, jumping on the \n     son's bed. Then he sniffed out the clothing and uniforms in \n     the closet. His every action confirmed that this room would \n     be his. And so it was the rest of his days.\n       A couple of years later Dwight Eisenhower came to Columbia \n     for a convocation honoring World War II leaders. Dr. East got \n     a chance to greet Ike. ``General, do you remember \n     Duckworth?'' he asked. The quick Eisenhower grin showed that \n     he did. ``You must be Dr. East,'' he said. ``I'd sure like to \n     meet that dog.''\n       While Ike and Duckworth did not meet on the first occasion, \n     there were opportunities to do so after the general became \n     president of Columbia in 1948. What a fitting capstone it \n     would have made for the little wartime morale booster had Ike \n     and he become good friends at Columbia. But Dr. East's seven \n     typewritten pages about Ike and Duckworth, filed in the \n     university's archives, are silent on that possibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5490-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING JOHN R. FOX\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we near the honoring of all our Nation's \nveterans through the celebration of Memorial Day, I would like to bring \nspecial attention to a World War II Army veteran from Boston, MA. On \nChristmas Day, 1944, 1st Lt. John R. Fox volunteered to serve as an \nartillery forward observer in the village of Sommocolonia, in the \nSerchio Valley, Italy. The following morning, trapped in a church \nsteeple, Fox radioed his command to ask for artillery fire on his own \nposition. No one at the artillery battalion command had ever heard such \na request. They radioed back for clarification. John Fox answered, \n``There are hundreds of them coming. Put everything you've got on my \nobservation post.''\n  Mr. President, this is one of the most incredible acts of heroism \nabout which I have ever heard. John Fox literally made the decision to \nsacrifice his life for his country. He has, along with six other \nAfrican American soldiers from World War II, been nominated for our \nNation's highest honor, the Medal of Honor. I would like to pay tribute \nhere not only to Lieutenant Fox, but to all black veterans from all \nAmerican wars. Our great country will always be in debt to all the men \nand women who have given or risked their lives for the preservation of \nfreedom. It is long past time that we properly honor those whose \nremarkable patriotism and sacrifices have not previously received the \nrespect and attention they deserve. I am thankful that on this Memorial \nDay the proper steps finally are being taken to accomplish that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5491-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to deny the payment \nof Social Security and supplemental security income benefits to \nprisoners, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the prevention of prisoner double-dipping act\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, a less formal but somewhat more revealing \ntitle for this bill would be ``The Prevention of Prisoner Double-\nDipping Act.'' A rose by any other name is still a rose and this bill \nis a winner by any name. It will save millions of dollars of the \ntaxpayers' money and it will put a stop to the injustice of paying \nscarce Social Security disability benefits to prisoners charged with a \nfelony who have been in jail for 30 or more days awaiting trial.\n  Current law prohibits payment of disability benefits to anyone in \njail after conviction for a felony. A loophole permits prisoners to \ncontinue receiving benefits despite the fact that they are in jail if \nthey have not yet been convicted of the crime charged. This bill will \nclose that loophole.\n  Mr. President, I learned that prisoners are continuing to receive \nthese benefits when Sheriff Mike Joyce of Stokes County, NC, wrote me \nearlier this year about it. Sheriff Joyce wrote to me about Earl \nBlevins, a career criminal and convicted murderer, who has been in \nStokes County jail since December 16, 1995, awaiting trial on charges \nof larceny and breaking and entering. Incredibly, Blevins has been \nreceiving disability payments since 1988, even though as Sheriff Joyce \nstated, Blevins obviously is healthy enough ``to run from a bloodhound \nand hide up under leaves under a tree.''\n  Until last month, when Blevins was convicted of unrelated felony \ncharges in Surry County, he was receiving $450 per month in disability \npayments while Stokes County taxpayers were picking up the tab for his \nroom and board and other care.\n  Mr. President, Sheriff Mike Joyce is a fine law enforcement officer. \nHis outrage about the Federal Government's paying prisoner Blevins $450 \nper month in Social Security disability benefits while he is in jail \nawaiting trial on yet another felony charge, will be matched by the \noutrage of the public at large once they learn about it.\n  The point is this: Earl Blevins and other career criminals prey on \nlaw-abiding citizens. When they are apprehended, their food, clothing, \nshelter, and often their legal fees are paid for by the very citizens \nwhom the criminals have victimized. It is unwarranted salt rubbed in \nthe taxpayer's wounds that these predators are allowed by law to \ncollect disability benefits while awaiting trial. This bill will change \nthat law.\n  The purpose of Social Security disability payments is to provide a \nminimum income to beneficiaries in order to insure that they have \naccess to food and shelter. A prisoner awaiting trial is already being \nprovided these needs and the taxpayers are paying the bill. Prisoners \nshould not be allowed to ``double-dip'' into the pocket of taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\n  Mr. President, for the record, I reiterate that current law stops \nSocial Security disability payments to anyone who has been convicted of \na felony. It also stops payments to the criminally insane who are \nconfined to a mental hospital. Other disability benefits, for example, \nSSI, are cut off to a recipient who is locked up for 30 or more days, \neven if they have not yet been brought to trial. My bill will simply \napply the same policy to Social Security [OASDI] disability benefits \nthat we now have for SSI disability benefits.\n\n  Mr. President, the existing situation brings to mind the case of \nMichael Hayes who cold-bloodedly killed four people and shot five \nothers during a 1988 murder spree in Winston-Salem. After being \nconfined to a State mental hospital, he began receiving over $500 a \nmonth in Social Security disability payments which he used to buy \nluxuries like leather coats, electronics, and even a motorcycle. \nPayments to Hayes finally stopped last year after the 103d Congress \npassed and the President signed my bill which I had offered in response \nto this outrage. It's now time for this Congress to act to stop further \nwaste of Social Security funds.\n  Mr. President, let me make clear for the Record what the pending \nbill, the Prevention of Prisoner Double-Dipping act will do:\n  It will eliminate pretrial benefits to anyone charged with a felony \nwho has been in jail for 30 or more days;\n  It will authorize $50,000,000 for the Social Security Office of \nInspector General to increase the number of investigators and auditors \npursuing charges of fraud against the SSA;\n  It will require SSA to make recommendations to insure the timely and \naccurate reporting of pre-trial felony detainees in order to stop \nbenefits to those who will no longer qualify under this bill;\n  It will give the Commissioner of SSA the authority to make payments \nto State and local correctional facilities that report the receipt of \nbenefits by those who are in custody;\n  It will give the SSA power to impose civil monetary penalties of up \nto $5,000 each time someone fraudulently uses a Social Security number \nor card, in addition to being subject to an assessment of up to five \ntimes the amount of disability benefits paid; and\n  It will require SSA to make recommendations to streamline the review \nand appeals process.\n  Mr. President, a few concluding thoughts: I expect some of my \ncolleagues will raise concerns about the constitutionality of the \nPrevention of Prisoner Double-Dipping Act. I am confident that this \nlegislation will easily pass constitutional muster because prisoners \nhave no constitutional right to be paid while they are sitting in jail.\n  Second, although this bill is targeted towards prisoners, it is not \npunitive. These payments should be stopped because they are \nduplicative, not because Congress is imposing a punishment on the \nrecipient. The payments would be stopped regardless of the ultimate \nfinding of guilt.\n  Finally, stopping payments to a prisoner will have no effect on the \npayment of benefits to children and other dependents who are otherwise \nentitled to these or other benefits.\n  I do hope the Senate will expedite consideration of these common \nsense reforms of the Social Security Act and thereby, save millions of \ndollars that the taxpayer would otherwise have to provide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of S. 1789 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1789\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to increase \nthe penalties for the manufacture, distribution, and possession of \nmarijuana, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE ENHANCED MARIJUANA PENALTY ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are losing the battle against \nillegal drugs. All indicators point to a dramatic surge in drug use, \nespecially by our most vulnerable citizens--children.\n  The President's 1996 drug strategy sent to Congress just a few weeks \nago contains some very disturbing information:\n  Marijuana use is back on the rise, and among young people between the \nages of 12 and 17, the use of marijuana has almost doubled between 1992 \nand 1994. One of every three high school seniors now smokes marijuana;\n  The number of heroin-related emergency room episodes in 1993 was \ndouble what it was in 1988, and for cocaine, emergency room episodes in \n1994 were the highest ever;\n  Methamphetamine, once confined to the West and Southwest, is a \nscourge spreading across the country, including my own State of \nKentucky. Last year, law enforcement officials seized five \nmethamphetamine labs in Kentucky; in 1994, there were no such seizures;\n  Unless we tackle the drug problem anew, we risk producing a new \ngeneration of drug abusers. And the consequences of drug abuse are \nfrightening: the spread of diseases like hepatitis, TB and HIV; social \ndeviancy; lost productivity at the workplace; and a lot more crime, in \nparticular violent crime.\n  Our Nation's drug problem is compounded by a lax attitude within \nsegments of the enforcement agencies responsible for our antidrug laws. \nRecently, the Los Angeles Times reported that Immigration and Customs \nofficials are handing out get-out-of-jail-free cards and letting drug \ndealers go unprosecuted.\n  Non-United States nationals are sent back to Mexico instead of being \nprosecuted. And, American citizens are being let go if it's their first \noffense or if the quantities of drugs aren't big enough. So, one pusher \nwith 32 pounds of methamphetamine was set free and another with 37,000 \nquaaludes. One American was stopped at the border with 53 pounds of \nmarijuana in January, 51 pounds in February and 41 pounds in May. He's \nonly being prosecuted for this third offense, although he has a \ncriminal history going back four decades.\n  It's not surprising that a President whose policy is ``don't inhale'' \ngives us a ``don't enforce'' antidrug policy.\n  This is simply unacceptable. It's evidence of an administration \nAWOL--absent without leadership.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill to increase the penalties for \ntrafficking in marijuana, a drug that poses a grave threat to our young \npeople. It is commonly known that marijuana impairs short-term memory, \ncore motor functions and the ability to concentrate. But it also has \nlong-term devastating effects:\n  Marijuana use causes chronic bronchitis, acute chest illness, \nheightened risk of pulmonary infection and lung disease;\n  Prenatal exposure to marijuana causes impaired intellectual ability \nin young children; in shorthand--low IQ babies; and\n  THC, the principal psychoactive ingredient, has been found in lab \nrats to be addictive.\n  And, who is smoking marijuana? Kids, more of them and at younger \nages. The number of 12- to 17-year-olds using marijuana increased from \n1.6 million in 1992 to 2.9 million in 1994. As the chart shows, more \n8th, 10th, and 12th-graders are smoking marijuana and there is no \nindication that this trend is going to be reversed anytime soon.\n  A surprising fact is that more children smoke marijuana than have \nsmoked five packs of cigarettes, as the second chart reveals. Five-\npoint-seven percent of 12- to 15-year-olds report smoking cigarettes, \nbut 6.6 percent report smoking marijuana. For older teens even more are \nsmoking marijuana--20.5 percent smoke cigarettes and 26.1 percent smoke \nmarijuana.\n  That is an astounding statistic: Teens are less likely to smoke \ncigaretts than marijuana, and fewer teens say smoking marijuana is \nrisky. As young people soften their attitudes toward drugs, usage \nincreases.\n  Not only is marijuana harmful in and of itself, but it is considered \na gateway drug. Teenagers who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to \nuse cocaine. Sixty percent of children who smoke marijuana before age \n15 move on to cocaine.\n  My bill is very straightforward. It enhances the penalties for \ntrafficking in marijuana. Current law creates a disparity in the \nmandatory minimums for heroin, cocaine and marijuana. My bill will \neliminate the disparity by lowerng the threshold for the mandatory \nminimum sentences for refined marijuana. The third chart reflects the \ndisparities.\n  Currently, an individual has to be caught with 1,000 kilos of \nmarijuana, with a street value of as much as $10 million, in order to \nget the 10-year mandatory minimum. For cocaine, the threshold quantity \nand street value is much lower--only 5 kilos with a value between \n$420,000 and $750,000. For heroin, the threshold is 1 kilo, with a \nstreet value of $1.2 million. And growing 1,000 marijuana plants gets \nyou the same 10-year mandatory minimum.\n  My bill will bring the threshold quantity for refined marijuana into \nline with the other drugs by lowering it from 1,000 kilos to 100 kilos \nfor the 10-year mandatory minimum and from 100 kilos to 10 kilos for \nthe 5-year mandatory minimum.\n  The bill also directs the Sentencing Commission to conform its \nguidelines to this change.\n  Last summer, this Sentencing Commission effectively lowered the \npenalties for marijuana trafficking, for quantities less than the \nthresholds for mandatory minimums. It's time we reversed that misguided \naction and this bill will ensure that the Sentencing Commission does \njust that.\n  Some will argue that prosecutors have more pressing matters than to \nchase every marijuana dealer selling as little as 10 kilos. As the Los \nAngeles Times reported, Federal prosecutors in southern California \ndon't think it's worth their effort to prosecute for quantities of less \nthan 125 pounds, an amount that should get a drug trafficker about 3 \nyears in a Federal prison.\n  But I would argue just the opposite. Marijuana is doing irreparable \nharm to our kids and we've got to put the people who sell to our \nchildren out of business and behind bars. Ten kilos of marijuana is 22 \npounds, with a street value of about $100,000. That amount of marijuana \nwill reach a lot of teenagers in small, but harmful quantities.\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\n  Mr. President the time has come to admit that we have a serious \nmarijuana problem among our teens. I say it's worth protecting the \nfuture of our children by locking up the pushers. Let's toughen the \npenalties and send a message to the drug dealers that we won't tolerate \nit anymore. And let's tell Federal prosecutors it's their job to send \nthese outlaws to prison. What can be worth more than saving our next \ngeneration?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1790\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Enhanced Marihuana Penalty \n     Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the number of children in the United States between 12 \n     and 17 years of age using marihuana increased from 1,600,000 \n     in 1992 to 2,900,000 in 1994, which constitutes an 80-percent \n     increase;\n       (2) currently, one-third of all high school seniors smoke \n     marihuana;\n       (3) the perception of the dangers of using marihuana is \n     declining among youthful marihuana smokers;\n       (4) scientific research has demonstrated that--\n       (A) marihuana impairs short-term memory, core motor \n     functions, and the ability to concentrate;\n       (B) THC, the principal psychoactive ingredient of \n     marihuana, may cause drug dependency;\n       (C) regular marihuana use may cause chronic bronchitis, \n     increased frequency of acute chest illness, heightened risk \n     of pulmonary infection, and lung disease; and\n       (D) prenatal exposure to marihuana may cause impaired \n     intellectual ability in young children;\n       (5) children between the agency of 12 and 17 who use \n     marihuana are 85 times more likely to use cocaine than \n     children who do not use marihuana;\n       (6) there are 39,000,000 children in the United States who \n     are younger than 10 years old, and neglect of our Nation's \n     marihuana problem will lead to the creation of a new \n     generation of drug abusers, prone to criminal and other \n     socially deviant behavior; and\n       (7) existing penalties for trafficking in marihuana are \n     inadequate to deter those who sell marihuana to our Nation's \n     most vulnerable citizens.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to increase, effective as of December 1, 1996, the \nrates of disability compensation for veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for \nsurvivors of such veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans Affairs.\n\n\n    the veterans' compensation cost-of-living adjustment act of 1996\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me, as \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, to introduce, \nand comment briefly on, legislation to grant to recipients of \ncompensation, and dependency and indemnity compensation [DIC] benefits, \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] a cost of living \nadjustment [COLA] increase to take effect at the beginning of next \nyear. This legislation is appropriate and warranted--even as we proceed \nthis very week to debate budget reconciliation.\n  Mr. President, let me assure this body that the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs will meet the reconciliation targets that the \nCongress ultimately adopts. Indeed, I expect that I will offer \namendments to this bill--with the bipartisan support of the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs--once we receive reconciliation instructions from \nthe Congress as an whole. No one need fear that I have lost my zeal for \ngaining control over entitlement spending; I surely have not. \nNonetheless, I believe that the recipients of veteran's benefits ought \nto receive a COLA--and they can receive such a COLA even as we progress \non a path to a balanced budget. We can balance the budget, and \nsimultaneously treat our veterans, and their survivors, with fairness \nand compassion.\n  This bill is simple and straightforward. It would grant to recipients \nof certain VA benefits--most notably, veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities who receive VA compensation, and the surviving spouses and \nchildren of veterans who have died as a result of service-connected \ninjuries or illnesses, who receive dependency and indemnity \ncompensation--the same COLA that Social Security recipients will \nreceive. So, for example, if Social Security recipients receive a 2.6-\npercent adjustment at the beginning of next year, then so too would the \nbeneficiaries of VA compensation and DIC.\n  Last year, the committee's COLA bill put into effect certain \nmodifications, as approved by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, on \nhow COLA's are computed. For example, our 1996 COLA contained a ``round \ndown'' feature. To summarize, Mr. President, VA benefits are paid in \nround dollar amounts. As a result, when a round dollar benefit amount--\nsay, as an example, the current benefit of $266 per month going to a 30 \npercent disabled veteran--is multiplied by a consumer price index \npercentage of, say, 2.6-percent, it almost invariably yields a \nmathematical product that is not a round dollar amount. In the case of \na $266 benefit check, for example, a 2.6-percent increase would yield a \nnonrounded number of $272.92.\n  VA practice, in the past, has been to ``round up'' fractional dollar \namounts of $0.50 or more, and ``round down'' fractional dollar amounts \nof $0.49 or less. So, in the above case, a 30-percent disabled veteran \nwould get a monthly check next year of $273 under past practice. Last \nyear's COLA bill directed VA to ``round down'' in all cases, so, in the \nabove example, a 30-percent disabled veteran would get a monthly check \nof $272.\n  It may happen, Mr. President, that the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nwill again elect to direct that VA ``round down'' as part of a package \nof measures approved to reach whatever reconciliation targets Congress \nultimately adopts. Indeed, it is, perhaps, likely that we will approve \nsuch a measure since rounding down is a relatively painless way to \nachieve some fairly significant savings over the long term. Such a \nmeasure--which would\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\ncost no VA beneficiary more than $1 per month--would save, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, almost $500 million over a 6-year \nperiod.\n  Be that as it may, Mr. President, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nwill ``cross the bridge'' of identifying how it will meet its \nreconciliation targets once it has received those targets. In the \nmeantime, I want to assure all by the introduction of this COLA bill \nthat the Committee on Veterans' Affairs fully anticipated approving a \nCOLA bill this year--just as it did last year when I was honored to \nassume the chairmanship of the committee.\n  The rounding down provision that the committee approved last year \nserves as an excellent example of the sort of measures that are \navailable to assist in balancing the budget. I do not suggest that it \nwill be easy to reach that goal. But the availability of real savings \nfrom measures like a simple rounding down of a COLA ought to strengthen \nthe resolve of each of us to get that vital job done. In the Veterans' \nCommittee, we expect that we will be directed to find ways to reduce \nthe growth in VA's mandatory budget accounts by over $5 billion in 6 \nyears. We will find ways to meet that goal. And no veteran, or \nveterans' survivor, will suffer inordinate harm as a result. Despite \nthe inaccurate, unfair, unfounded, and, yes, partisan pronouncements of \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and despite what veterans, and \nSenators, have heard from service organizations, ``crying wolf,'' we \nwill not cut veterans benefits. We never have.\n  We do not need to cut veterans benefits in order to balance the \nbudget. Nor do we need to endure the cuts--real cuts, not just \nreductions in the growth rate--in veterans health care spending \nproposed by the President in order to achieve a balanced budget. We can \nkeep faith with our veterans and balance the budget. As Chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, that is what I intend to do.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time that has been afforded me to \naddress this subject.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1791\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-\n     of-Living Adjustment Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN COMPENSATION RATES AND LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall, as provided in paragraph (2), increase, effective \n     December 1, 1996, the rates of and limitations on Department \n     of Veterans Affairs disability compensation and dependency \n     and indemnity compensation.\n       (2) The Secretary shall increase each of the rates and \n     limitations in sections 1114, 1115(1), 1162, 1311, 1313, and \n     1314 of title 38, United States Code, that were increased by \n     the amendments made by the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\n     Living Adjustment Act of 1995 (Public Law No. 104-57, 109 \n     Stat. 555). This increase shall be made in such rates and \n     limitations as in effect on November 30, 1996, and shall be \n     by the same percentage that benefit amounts payable under \n     title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) \n     are increased effective December 1, 1996, as a result of a \n     determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     415(i)).\n       (b) Special Rule.--The Secretary may adjust \n     administratively, consistent with the increases made under \n     subsection (a)(2), the rates of disability compensation \n     payable to persons within the purview of section 10 of Public \n     Law 85-857 (72 Stat. 1263) who are not in receipt of \n     compensation payable pursuant to chapter 11 of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       (c) Publication Requirement.--At the same time as the \n     matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(O)) are required to be \n     published by reason of a determination made under section \n     215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 1996, the Secretary \n     shall publish in the Federal Register the rates and \n     limitations referred to in subsection (a)(2) as increased \n     under this section.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 1792. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ncompanies to donate scientific equipment to elementary and secondary \nschools for use in their educational programs, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE COMPUTER DONATION INCENTIVE ACT OF 1996\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, 10 weeks ago, thousands of \nvolunteers throughout California helped make NetDay 96 one of the most \nsuccessful 1-day public projects in history. At the time, we all noted \nthat this electronic barn-raising could be a turning point in \neducational history--but only if we followed through with other steps \nto help our children travel the information superhighway.\n  I would like to take one such step by announcing the Computer \nDonation Incentive Act of 1996.\n  This important piece of legislation--which my colleague Senate Chafee \nand I are introducing in the Senate, and my friend Ann Eshoo is \nintroducing in the House--will change the Federal Tax Code in order to \npromote gifts of computer hardware, software, and expertise to our \nNation's schools.\n  The Computer Donation Incentive Act will provide a greater tax \ndeduction than is currently available for donations of nearly new \ncomputers to elementary and secondary schools for educational purposes.\n  The amount of the deduction for computer manufacturers is equal to \ntheir manufacturing costs plus half the difference between those costs \nand the selling price. So, if the manufacturing cost is $400 and the \nselling price is $700, then the manufacturer would receive a tax \ndeduction of $550.\n  For nonmanufacturers, the deduction is based on the computer's \npurchase price minus depreciation. For example: if a company buys a \ncomputer for $2,000, take a depreciation of $400 1 year and gives the \ncomputer to a school the next year, then the company can take a \ndeduction of $1,600.\n  The Boxer-Chafee-Eshoo bill will also provide the same deduction for \nbusinesses who give computers to libraries, recreational centers and \nother public institutions, or to nonprofit organizations that refurbish \ncomputers and then give them to schools.\n  The successful education of America's children is now closely linked \nto the use of innovative educational technologies, particularly \ncomputer-aided research and instruction. Unfortunately, far too many \nclassrooms lack the computers they need to take advantage of these new \neducational tools.\n  NetDay 96 was an important step forward in meeting this challenge. By \nall accounts, it was tremendous success. Taking inexpensive cooper wire \nand priceless expertise, computer technicians worked with parents, \nstudents, faculty, and staff at each school to connect classrooms, \nlibraries, and computer labs to the Internet. By the end of the day, \nhundreds of public and private schools were wired into the Net.\n  But the very success of NetDay brought up another problem for most of \nour schools: If young students are to have access to the Information \nSuperhighway, what are they going to drive?\n  In Sylvandale, CA, for example, NetDay volunteers installed three \nInternet connections in each of a school's 40 classrooms. Counting the \nlibrary and computer lab, this particular school now has 190 potential \nInternet connections. However, only four of the school's computers are \npowerful enough to access the Internet; so there are only four active \nconnections out of 190.\n\n  If schools cannot get computers into the classrooms, and if they \ncan't get expert help to get up and running, then they will not really \nhave access to the Internet. At a time when public schools in \nCalifornia and around the country are struggling to buy up-to-date \ntextbooks and maintain school buildings, classroom computers may seem \nhopelessly out of reach. As a result, public schools lag far behind \nprivate schools in computer use.\n  Current tax laws provide no incentives for businesses to donate \ncomputers to public schools. As a matter of fact, the Federal Tax Code \nactually discourages companies from giving to public schools.\n  Section 170(e)(4) of the Federal Tax Code allows computer \nmanufacturers to take a reasonable deduction when they donate computers \nto universities for scientific or research purposes. Following a recent \nIRS ruling, manufacturers can also take this deduction for gifts to \nprivate elementary and secondary schools--but not for gifts to public \nelementary and secondary schools. Moreover, a manufacturer who donates \na computer to a public college can now take the deduction if the \ncomputer is\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nused only for advanced research but not if it is used for other \nteaching purposes.\n  To make matters worse, only computer manufacturers are eligible for \nthe higher education. Computer dealers and distributors, along with \nmany other businesses, get no tax incentive to do this.\n  Section 170(e)(4) was written in 1981--before the explosion of \ncomputer-based technology made computer literacy a must for every \nAmerican student. I know that the authors of this provision did not \nmean to exclude public schools from the computer revolution; they just \ncould not foresee the day when every school would need computers.\n  The Boxer-Chafee bill will revise this archaic section of the Tax \nCode. Our Computer Donation Incentive Act is designed to give donations \nfor educational purposes the same tax break as those for scientific \nresearch purposes. It will allow businesses to give to public and \nprivate elementary and secondary schools as well as institutions of \nhigher learning and still receive the tax break. And it will encourage \ndonations from software producers, computer distributors, and other \ncompanies as well as hardware manufacturers.\n  Along with computers and software, businesses should also donate \ntheir expertise, providing the training required to bring our schools \nfully on-line--and we challenge them to do so. Teachers and students \nboth need such training in order to integrate computer-based lessons \ninto their basic curriculum.\n  The Computer Donation Incentive Act will provide a reasonable \nincentive for businesses to donate computers to the schools.

A bill to amen the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide that the \nrequirement relating to making imported articles and containers apply \nto fresh cut flowers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the tariff act of 1930 amendment act of 1996\n\nMr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to amend the \nTariff act of 1930, to provide that the requirements relating to \nmarking imported articles and containers will apply to fresh cut \nflowers as well. Under current law and commercial practices, unlike \nother imported goods, flowers are not required to be labeled with \ncountry of origin. It is my belief that consumers have the right to \nknow this information when they shop for flowers.\n  U.S. law requires that merchandise imported into the United States be \nmarked with country of origin information. This marking must be \n``conspicuously, legibly, and permanently marked in English'' (19 \nU.S.C. 1304). Unfortunately, this act also grants the Secretary of the \nTreasury authority to exempt certain items from these requirements \nflowers are among the items that have been exempted. My bill would \nrevoke this regulatory exemption.\n  The result is that the boxes or sleeves in which imported flowers are \nshipped are required to be marked only at the point of entry and no \nfurther. Often, before resale to consumers, flowers are taken out of \nboxes either by importers, wholesalers or retailers. In many cases, \neven the retailer from whom flowers are purchased is unaware of the \nproduct's origin. Domestic fresh cut flower producers have had a \nnatural advantage over importers with respect to freshness due to their \nproximity to local markets. Quite simply, domestic flowers last longer \nand they are grown in conformance with strict U.S. pesticide laws as \nwell. United States consumers should be able to choose to purchase \nfresh, long-lasting domestic cut flowers produced under strict \npesticide controls. Historically, however, without a means of \ndistinguishing their product, domestic growers have found it difficult \nto promote to consumers and handlers the freshness of their flowers, or \nwarn of hazardous pesticide residues on imported flowers.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will not place an undue burden \non retailers or wholesalers. I'm sure all of us, when we shop for \ngroceries, have seen perishable products routinely labeled either by \nsticker or a simple sign by the product. This legislation would also \nprovide our domestic growers, who enjoy advantages of proximity to the \nmarket and the controlled environment of the greenhouse a valuable \nmeans of distinguishing their fresh product from imported flowers that \nare several days old and potentially grown under lax pesticide laws.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the provisions of my bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1793\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MARKING OF FRESH CUT FLOWERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 \n     U.S.C. 1304) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (f), (g), (h), and (i) as \n     subsections (g), (h), (i), and (j), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(f) Marking of Cut Flowers.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, no exception may be made under subsection \n     (a)(3) with respect to fresh cut flowers described in or \n     classified under superior heading 0603, or subheading \n     0603.10, 0603.10.30, 0603.10.60, 0603.10.70, or 0603.10.80 of \n     the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, as in \n     effect on January 1, 1996.

A bill to amend chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, \nto provide for the forfeiture of retirement benefits in the case of any \nMember of Congress, congressional employee, or Federal justice or judge \nwho is convicted of an offense relating to official duties of that \nindividual, and for the forfeiture of the retirement allowance of the \nPresident for such a conviction; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n  the congressional, presidential, and judicial pension forfeiture act\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which is, \nunfortunately, a necessary measure. Even its name--the Congressional, \nPresidential, and Judicial Pension Forfeiture Act--does not give any of \nus a good feeling. However, I do not introduce this bill \napologetically, because I believe there is a compelling need to enact \nthese changes in order to regain public confidence and trust in elected \nofficials and top federal appointees.\n  I urge all of my distinguished colleagues to examine this bill and to \nask themselves the same kinds of questions the American people have \nbeen asking for a long time. ``Why are Members of Congress not held \naccountable for their decisions, and more importantly for their \nwrongdoing? Why do they seem to think they are above the people who \nelected them, and even sometimes above the law?''\n  Recent events have only confirmed such cynicism. I'm sure none of us \nwould like to be reminded of the embarrassment caused by these \nscandals, which are representative of an increasing trend of privilege \nabuse. Thirty-four Members have served felony prison sentences since \n1900, 13 of those in the last decade. Perhaps we need a deterrent, a \nstatutory deterrent--such as the Congressional, Presidential, and \nJudicial Pension Forfeiture Act--which would cause those who may be \ntempted to abuse the privileges of public service to think twice before \nexploiting those powers. More importantly, this bill is also aimed at \nestablishing a commonsense approach to fair play in the use of \ntaxpayers' money--an approach that the public understands instinctively \nbut to which Congress has yet to conform.\n  This bill would deny congressional pensions to any Members who commit \nspecified felony crimes during their term in office. The crimes relate \ndirectly to the execution of congressional duties and were taken from a \ncompilation of Federal ethics laws prepared by the Committee on \nGovernment Affairs. These crimes are acts which we all know are wrong, \nand for which any American citizen would pay dearly in a court of law. \nYet we as, Members of Congress, were elected on the basis of integrity \nand character and, as such, we should hold ourselves to higher ethical \nstandards than the average citizen. This is true in the military, whose \nofficers, if convicted in a court-martial, lose their pensions for \nserious wrongdoing. We should ask ourselves if we, too, should submit \nto the kind of standards worthy of our offices. I think we should.\n\n  Mr. President, the question here is accountability. How accountable \ndo we perceive ourselves as being for the decisions we make? While we \nwould never deny that we all make mistakes--and our constituents would \nnever expect us to be perfect--the American people do have a right to \nexpect that we serve them honorably, with a strong mind, and with a \nclear conscience. More specifically, they have a right to expect that \nwe perform our duties free of corruption. Therefore, I strongly urge \nall of you to consider the source of public cynicism and the bad image \nwhich Government has recently acquired. Sixty-six percent of eligible \nAmerican voters decide to stay home on election night, not because they \nwould rather watch TV, but because they have lost faith in their \nelected officials--in us--and in the importance of their votes in a \ndemocratic system they no longer feel is responsive to them. And this \ntime, it is not about issues; it is about accountability. None of us \nwould claim here on the floor of the Senate that we do not hold \nourselves accountable for our own actions. Hopefully, my colleagues \nwill agree to support this bill as a step toward regaining the respect \nand the trust of the American people.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Senators Reid and Nickles, who have \nbeen working independently on this issue and are joining me today in \nintroducing this bill. Also, I would like to thank my colleagues who \nhave come forward and have demonstrated their support for the bill by \nbecoming original cosponsors. It is gratifying, and I am very honored, \nto have my distinguished colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, \njoining me on this issue.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROTH:\n  S. 1795. A bill to restore the American family, enhance support and \nwork opportunities for families with children, reduce out-of-wedlock \npregnancies, reduce welfare dependence by requiring work, meet the \nhealth care needs of America's most vulnerable citizens, control \nwelfare and Medicaid spending, and increase State flexibility; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n      the personal responsibility and work opportunity act of 1996\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today is the day we have reached the \ntop of a great divide. We can clearly see both what lies ahead and that \nwhich is behind us. Today is the day we decide whether we dare to press \nforward and change a welfare system that is crippling children and \nfamilies.\n  Today is a day of contrasts--39 months ago, President Clinton \npromised the Nation's Governors and the American people that he would \nend welfare as we know it. Nothing happened.\n  He abandoned welfare reform and instead pursued a misguided attempt \nto take Government control over the world's finest health care system. \nIt didn't work.\n  Today, the Republicans in the House and Senate are introducing \nlegislation which will deliver on the promise of welfare reform and \nwhich will protect the health benefits of needy families as they move \nfrom welfare to work. Today we are introducing welfare and Medicaid \nreform based on the bipartisan recommendations of the Nation's \nGovernors. While the Clinton administration has pursued policies of \nnational control from Washington, we believe the future of these \nprograms belong in the States.\n  Without even having seen our proposal, President Clinton labeled \nMedicaid reform a ``poison pill.'' We think it is good medicine. Under \nour proposal, Federal spending for the Medicaid program will total $371 \nbillion over the next 6 years. This represents an average annual growth \nrate of 6.5 percent between 1996 and 2002 while still achieving savings \nof $72 billion compared to current law.\n  But $371 billion represents many important things in addition to how \nmuch the Federal Government will choose to spend on the third largest \ndomestic program in the Federal budget.\n  It represents bipartisan compromise.\n  It represents the future of how Government will work to help families \nescape welfare dependency.\n  And it represents the future of governmental relationships in our \nconstitutional system of federalism.\n  First, $371 billion represents an important element of compromise in \nthe political process. In the budget negotiations with President \nClinton last\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\nDecember, the Republican leadership recommended Medicaid savings of $85 \nbillion. During the negotiations, President Clinton wanted to reduce \nthe savings level for Medicaid to $59 billion. At that time, there was \na recognition by the administration that Medicaid spending indeed was \nout of control. For example, between 1994 and 1995, total Federal \noutlays grew by 3 percent.\n  But Medicaid spending grew nearly three times as fast.\n  On a number of occasions, the administration has indicated that the \nPresident intends to reduce Medicaid spending by $59 billion.\n  The President's fiscal year 1997 budget released in March includes \nsaving of $55 billion.\n  Thus, by setting Medicaid spending at $371 billion, we are meeting \nPresident Clinton halfway. The difference between us is now $13 \nbillion. This is less than 2 percent of the total Federal Medicaid \nspending over the next 6 years. This is a difference of 16 cents per \nMedicaid recipient per day.\n  When President Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he \nargued that the Medicaid budget savings cut too deeply.\n  The adoption of today's budget resolution and the introduction of \nthis legislation clearly demonstrates that the debate over Medicaid is \nnot about spending. The issue is, who will control the spending, \nWashington, or the States?\n  In February, the Nation's Governors unanimously adopted a proposal to \nrestructure the Medicaid Program. Democratic and Republican Governors \nalike have called upon the President and Congress to dramatically \nchange the Medicaid Program.\n  The Medicaid proposal we are introducing reflects the Governors' \npolicies, including guarantees for children, pregnant women, the \nelderly, and persons with disabilities.\n  Together, the Democratic and Republican Governors have testified \nbefore Congress that budget savings should be between $59 and $85 \nbillion. The Republican proposal of $72 billion in savings reflects \nthis spirit of bipartisan compromise and is the midpoint of these \nsavings figures.\n  The Medicaid debate therefore is about policy, not budget. Medicaid \nis the largest welfare program and must be part of the solution for \nmoving families from welfare to work. It costs more than the AFDC, Food \nStamp, and SSI Programs combined.\n  The growths in the welfare programs are intimately linked to \nMedicaid. Medicaid is the nucleus of authentic welfare reform.\n  The Nation's Governors support reform and share the common goal to \nend the status quo. Democratic and Republican Governors have forged a \nbipartisan blueprint for reform.\n  Our legislation reflects the principles and framework of the \nGovernors' proposals and meets their goals.\n  Nearly everyone, including President Clinton, recognizes that the \nwelfare system is broken and must be fixed. The Governors, Democratic \nand Republican alike, know that Medicaid and welfare were in the same \ncar wreck and both require major reconstructive surgery as soon as \npossible.\n  The Governors understand there are major problems in the Medicaid \nProgram. To begin with, Medicaid is an all-or-nothing proposition.\n  A person either qualifies for all Medicaid benefits or no Medicaid \nbenefits. There is no flexibility in the current system to provide \nbenefits tailored to a family's needs.\n  As such, the welfare system often creates disincentives to work and \ngross inequities for low-income working families, many of whom have no \nother way to provide health care for their children.\n  For the individual, the current Medicaid program is often self-\ndefeating as it encourages dependency. Many proud families can describe \nwhat they are forced to do to acquire and maintain Medicaid coverage.\n  If a family's income rises above the eligibility level by just $1, \nthe entire Medicaid package is taken away.\n  Medicaid performs as it was designed 30 years ago--$731 billion \ntherefore represents a new opportunity to refocus our welfare programs \nto help the present and future generations to escape dependency.\n  Governors know that Medicaid is a critical link in moving families \nfrom welfare to work. They understand it can be difficult to convince a \nfamily that work pays more than welfare if the price includes the loss \nof their health insurance.\n  The Medicaid current program discourages expansion of coverage and \ninnovation.\n  There is little flexibility or reward for the States to experiment \nwith ways of improving access to care.\n  The Governors have testified how their ideas to cover more families \nhave been stopped cold by Federal rules and regulations.\n  The bureaucracy often thwarts targeting of benefits which, for \nexample, could be more effective in lowering infant mortality rates.\n  Medicaid lags far behind the private sector in adopting progressive \nmanaged care strategies which have saved employers and working families \nbillions of dollars.\n  Two-thirds of the people covered by employer-sponsored health plans \ntoday are enrolled in some type of managed care plan.\n  In contrast, only about one-quarter of the Medicaid recipients are in \nany form of managed care.\n  Medicaid contains a number of barriers to managed care.\n  For example, Florida is facing major disruptions in its entire \nMedicaid system because two of its best HMO's do not meet Medicaid's \n``75/25'' requirements.\n  Freed from the choke hold of the Federal bureaucracy, States will be \nable to harness their enormous purchasing power to improve the delivery \nof services at lower costs.\n  The central issue of the pending Medicaid debate is who can best \ndesign a State's public health insurance program--the Federal \nbureaucracy or the States?\n  The idea that the children and elderly citizens in a State must be \nprotected from their Governor and State legislators is not only wrong.\n  Mr. President, it is insulting.\n  Finally, slowing the rate of growth represents a fundamental decision \nabout the future of federalism. Our elected State officials are \nhostages to the demands of the current Medicaid Program. The Federal-\nState partnership cannot survive the skyrocketing cost of the Medicaid \nProgram which ricochets throughout State budgets.\n  For example, in 1990, Medicaid replaced higher education as the \nsecond largest State spending category, exceeded only by elementary and \nsecondary education.\n  In 1987, elementary and secondary education accounted for 22.8 \npercent of State spending. Medicaid took 10.2 percent of State \nspending.\n  According to the latest report issued by the National Association of \nState Budget Officers, the share of State spending for elementary and \nsecondary education has declined to 20.9 percent while Medicaid's share \nhas nearly doubled to 19.2 percent.\n  If present trends continue, Medicaid will soon pass elementary and \nsecondary education as the largest item in State budgets.\n  Medicaid has seized the power of decisionmaking from State officials. \nIt is simply draining resources from other priorities.\n  As summarized by the State budget officers' report, ``Medicaid * * * \ncontinues to limit the ability of decisonmakers to use the budget as a \ntool for implementing public policy.''\n  Last January, President Clinton proclaimed an end to big government. \nNothing could demonstrate a true allegiance to this pledge better than \nto return the responsibility and authority for welfare programs to the \nStates.\n  In sum, the critical difference between President Clinton and the \nRepublicans is not about the level of Medicaid spending.\n  Mr. President, the difference lies in the vision of the proper roles \nof Government and in the faith of the American people to govern \nthemselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, the joint statement of managers that \naccompanied the conference report to S. 735,\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, contained an \ninadvertent error relating to section 809, assessing and reducing the \nthreat to law enforcement officers from the criminal use of firearms \nand ammunition. I ask that the correct description of that section be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n       Section 809--Senate recedes to House amendment section 112. \n     This section requires that the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     conjunction with the Attorney General, conduct a study which \n     assesses the threat to law enforcement officers from the \n     criminal use of firearms and ammunition, and to examine ways \n     in which such threats can be reduced.\n       In particular, the study will examine whether current \n     passive defensive strategies, such as body armor, are \n     adequate to counter the criminal use of firearms against law \n     officers. The study will also comprehensively examine or \n     gather information on the general circumstances, statistics, \n     and data surrounding the killing or injury of law enforcement \n     officers, whether intentionally or accidentally, by various \n     types of firearms, ammunition, types, and calibers.\n       An important component of the study will be to examine the \n     number, the facts, and the circumstances surrounding deaths \n     or serious injuries to officers attributable to projectiles \n     defined as ``armor piercing ammunition'' under 18 U.S.C. \n     921(a)(17)(B)(i) and (ii) piercing the protective material of \n     bullet resistant vests or bullet resistant headgear being \n     worn by the officer. Since 1986, federal law has prohibited \n     the sale or manufacture of such ammunition, except for \n     government or law enforcement use. Armor piercing ammunition \n     is defined as a projectile or projectile core which may be \n     used in a handgun and is constructed entirely (except for \n     trace elements) of certain hard metals. The Violent Crime \n     Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 further amended the \n     definition of armor piercing ammunition by establishing a \n     bullet jacket weight test.\n       Recognizing that ammunition used primarily by law-abiding \n     citizens, and that any study of this nature and magnitude has \n     the potential to affect regulatory policy in the future, this \n     section requires that all parties interested in the outcome \n     of the study outcome (including Federal, State, and local \n     officials, non-governmental organizations including all \n     national police organizations, national sporting \n     organizations, and national industry associations with \n     expertise in this area) be consulted on the study contents, \n     methodology, and specific study objectives. The study is due \n     12 months from the date of enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5501-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING LT.

After \nleaving active duty, he joined the Alaska Army National Guard in 1956. \nOver the years, he has held a number of positions within the Alaska \nArmy National Guard. He was appointed assistant adjutant general, Army, \nand served in that position until 1990.\n  General Lestenkof took over the Alaska National Guard on December 21, \n1994. Since that time, he has worked to integrate the Alaska National \nGuard with our Nation's defense requirements. General Lestenkof has \nworked closely with the U.S. Army, Pacific, and the National Guard \nBureau, to build units that are relevant to the total force as we move \ninto the 21st century.\n  It is my pleasure to see him promoted in acknowledgment of his years \nof service to the country and to the State of Alaska.

Congratulations to him and his family and the Alaska National \nGuard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5502-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5502-S5503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOOD AID FOR NORTH KOREA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, North Korea is considered today a \nrogue state--the last country with a Stalinist system and surely the \nmost isolated country in the world. During the cold war, when we looked \nat other nations as enemies, we made clear that our differences with \nthose nations were with their governments and not with their people. \nThe same should be true of North Korea today.\n  The food situation in North Korea is turning dire. There are reports \nof conditions approaching famine, caused by natural disasters, poor \nharvests, and economic mismanagement. The World Food Program, with \npersonnel on the ground to assess conditions and monitor deliveries, is \nappealing for more food aid to avert a disaster. Hunger could lead to \ninstability, which could cause desperate actions by the North Korean \nmilitary, and that would be in no one's interest.\n  The administration wisely granted $2 million in food aid earlier this \nyear, but the situation has worsened, and we should do more. The \nfollowing editorial from today's New York Times urges the President to \nput hunger above politics and provide food aid. That is the right thing \nto do--for humanitarian reasons and in the interest of reducing \ntensions on the Korean peninsula.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 22, 1996]\n\n                       Famine Aid to North Korea\n\n       Near-famine conditions in North Korea pose a moral and \n     political challenge to the United States and its allies. \n     America's goal should be to feed the hungry without \n     reinforcing the already dangerous military capacities of an \n     erratic, belligerent and poorly understood regime.\n       This can be done by providing generous amounts of grain and \n     other basic foodstuffs, but insisting on a reasonable degree \n     of international monitoring to make sure the aid is \n     distributed throughout the country and not hoarded or sold by \n     the Communist Party and military elite.\n       The United States has previously provided modest quantities \n     of aid through the United Nations World Food Program and \n     Unicef, both of which monitor deliveries. South Korea has \n     supplied more substantial aid through direct shipments. But \n     animosity on both sides of the 38th Parallel scuttled the \n     South Korean effort, and now Seoul is pressing Washington to \n     hold back as well. South Korea wants further food aid \n     suspended until North Korea accepts President Clinton's \n     recent proposal for four-way peace talks involving the two \n     Koreas, China and the United States.\n       Bowing to that pressure would violate an admirable American \n     tradition of not using food as a diplomatic weapon. An entire \n     people should not be punished for the sins of their hard-line \n     Communist leaders. The United States joined other Western \n     donors in feeding Ethiopia during its famine in 1991-1992, \n     though its Marxist tyranny was no less unsavory. The same \n     principle should apply to North Korea if it is stricken by \n     widespread famine this summer, as a new United Nations alert \n     predicts.\n       For most of its 50-year history, North Korea did all it \n     could be discourage trade and even humanitarian assistance \n     from the outside world. Fearing ideological contamination, \n     Pyongyang preached an extreme doctrine of self-reliance and \n     used its heavy-handed police apparatus to keep out all but a \n     few trusted Communist friends.\n       But decades of economic mismanagement, political \n     uncertainties following the 1994 death of Kim II Sung and the \n     abrupt loss of Russian and Chinese support, combined with \n     disastrous flooding last year, have brought widespread \n     suffering and forced the regime to appeal for help.\n       The Clinton Administration should grasp this opportunity to \n     put hunger above politics and advance its own policies of \n     cautious courtship of North Korea. The nuclear freeze \n     agreement the two countries reached in 1994 marked a \n     recognition by Washington that a nuanced combination of \n     military deterrence and diplomatic engagement offers the most \n     promising approach to maintaining security on the Korean \n     Peninsula.\n       In present circumstances, humanitarian aid, military \n     deterrence and opening North Korea to fresh winds of change \n     all go together. The Clinton Administration would be right to \n     explore the possibilities.\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO TIMOTHY MARQUIS, JOANNE MILLETTE, SYMA MIRZA, AND KENNETH \n           JOHNSON, NEW HAMPSHIRE 1996 PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate four \noutstanding New Hampshire high school students on receiving the 1996 \nPresidential Scholar Award. Timothy Marquis and Joanne Millette from \nWinnacunnet High School in Hampton; and Syma Mirza and Kenneth Johnson \nfrom Alvirne High School in Hudson were all honored with this \nprestigious award.\n  The U.S. Presidential Scholars Program was founded by Executive order \nof the President in 1964 to recognize outstanding high school students \nin America. These four New Hampshire students should be very proud of \nthis honor because the selection process is quite rigorous. Based on \nstudent scores from SAT and ACT testing, the top 20 men and women from \neach State are invited to apply for the Presidential Scholar Program. \nAn independent review committee, composed of various academics such as \nguidance counselors and college admissions officers, then review the \napplications of these students and determine 500 semifinalists for the \naward. The committee uses a variety of criteria to evaluate each \nstudent such as personal character, academic achievement, leadership \nservice in school as well as the community, and an essay analysis. From \nthe pool of semifinalists a 32-member commission appointed by the \nPresident chooses 141 scholars to be honored for their accomplishments \nduring National Recognition Week.\n  These four hard working New Hampshire students will be guests of the \nWhite House Commission on Presidential Scholars in Washington, DC, from \nJune 18 through June 23. While in Washington, the students will be \ninvolved in various activities such as informative panel discussions, a \nceremony at the White House, and an evening at the Kennedy Center \nfeaturing performances by the Scholars in the Performing Arts.\n  As a former high school teacher myself, I applaud the hard work and \ndedication of Timothy, Joanne, Syma, and Kenneth. Their outstanding \nacademic performance have won them this distinguished national honor. I \ncommend these special students for achieving excellence in their \nschools and communities, and wish them great success in their future \nendeavors. Their contributions to New Hampshire and the Nation serve as \na role model for others to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5502-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CAMP RAMAH DAROM\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on May 27, the United Synagogue of \nConservative Judaism will commemorate a milestone in the life of the \nconservative Judaic community in the South. May 27 marks the opening of \nCamp Ramah Darom, near Clayton, GA, as well as the installation of the \nboard and officers of this very special institution.\n  Camp Ramah Darom has been made possible by the hard work and \ndedication of many individuals to a shared dream. The camp will provide \na unique center for the conservative Jewish community throughout the \nSouth to share and strengthen their community ties. The camp will be a \nplace for the children to foster bonds with friends throughout the \nregion and a retreat for families separated by distance but bound by a \nstrong common heritage. At a time when it is so critical to preserve \nand reinforce the family and community values that are the basis of our \ngreat Nation, the dedication of Camp Ramah Darom is especially \nimportant.\n  I know my colleagues from the South and the rest of the Nation will \njoin me in commemorating the inauguration of this special event and in \ncongratulating and thanking the many who made Camp Ramah Darom a \nreality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5503-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5503-S5504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REPORT OF SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, it has been my practice in each of \nthe 41 years I have spent in public life to volunteer a detailed \naccounting of my finances.\n  I ask that my financial report for 1995 be printed in the Record.\n  The financial report and related announcement follow:\n\n                              Announcement\n\n       For the 41st consecutive year that he has held public \n     office, U.S. Senator Paul Simon, D-Ill., has released a \n     detailed description of his income, assets and liabilities--\n     the last such report that he will file before retiring from \n     the Senate when his term ends in January 1997.\n       Simon has been making the voluntary annual statements \n     longer than any other national officeholder. Simon set his \n     policy when he left the newspaper publishing business he had \n     established to enter public service and has followed the \n     practice during his eight years in the Illinois House of \n     Representatives, six years in the Illinois Senate, four years \n     as lieutenant governor, 10 years in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives and now 11 years in the U.S. Senate. The \n     listing predates disclosure requirements of state and federal \n     law and continues to exceed those requirements. Senate rules \n     today require only the listing of income within broad \n     brackets. Simon's practice also has set the standard for many \n     officeholders in Illinois.\n       Simon also continues to exceed Senate requirements by \n     listing detailed income for his wife, Jeanne.\n       The Illinois Senator lists 1995 income for himself and \n     Jeanne Simon totaling $196,300.60, down from $206,287 in \n     1994. The figure includes Paul Simon's Senate salary, Jeanne \n     Simon's per diem compensation as chair of the Naional \n     Commission on Library and Information Science, and \n     reimbursements to Paul and Jeanne Simon for travel and other \n     expenses.\n       The Simons had assets of $551,837.35 and liabilities of \n     $106,979.79 for a net worth of $444,857.56. Earlier \n     disclosures have shown Simon to be one of the least wealthy \n     members of the United States Senate.\n       The detailed 1995 financial report of Senator Paul Simon \n

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \ncompletes its business today, it stand in adjournment until the hour of \n12 noon on Thursday, May 23; further, that immediately following the \nprayer, the Journal of the proceedings be deemed approved to date, no \nresolutions come over under the rule, the call of the calendar be \ndispensed with, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, and the \nSenate then resume consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 57.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then proceed to vote \non or\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\nin relation to the remaining pending amendments to the budget \nresolution in the order in which the amendments were offered; that each \nrollcall vote, after the first one, be limited to 10 minutes in length, \nand that there be 1 minute of debate, equally divided, prior to each \nvote for a brief explanation of each amendment.\n  I finally ask that any second-degree amendments, if offered, be \nlimited to 1 minute of debate, equally divided, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, and I do not \nsuspect I will object. The reason is, we were told by the floor leader \nthat we would be in at 10 and start voting at 10 in the morning, and we \nwould be out from 1 until 2 and then come back and complete it. Then we \nheard it was going to be 11 o'clock. Now it is twelve o'clock. We are \ntrying to adjust our schedules, and here within 30 minutes we have had \na 2-hour shift. I would like to hold up until I have had an opportunity \nto discuss it with our leader to be sure of the arrangements they have \nworked on based on the previous announcement.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I may comment, Mr. President, we are trying to \naccommodate many requirements by the various Members. We did not have \nany indication of concern about beginning later in the morning. I was \ngoing to further ask that no rollcall votes occur between the hours of \n1 and 2 on Thursday in order to accommodate a Democrats' luncheon on \ntechnology, or something like that.\n  Mr. FORD. I appreciate that. I have no objections now, I say. But it \nis just the idea of clearing things as you would clear them on your \nside. We will be clearing it with somebody different in a couple weeks.\n  Mr. LOTT. I hope so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will add the additional part. I ask unanimous consent \nthat no rollcall votes occur between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. on Thursday in \norder for the Democrats to conduct a luncheon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5504-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, tomorrow at 12 p.m. the Senate will begin a \nseries of rollcall votes on the remaining amendments to the budget \nresolution. That is expected to continue throughout the day, with the \nbreak between the hours of 1 and 2. The Senate is expected to complete \naction on the budget early Thursday afternoon. We should be able to \nfinish in the 4 to 5 o'clock range, it looks like, I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky. All Senators are asked to remain \nin or around the Senate Chamber during Thursday's session in order to \nfacilitate the votes. If a Member gets down the hall or gets lost, he \ninconveniences 98 or 99 Senators, and it is very hard to stay within \nthe timeframes called for.\n  I also remind Senators that, following the first vote, all votes will \nbe limited to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/22/senate-section/article/S5505-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AUTHORITY FOR INTRODUCTION OF A BILL\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
