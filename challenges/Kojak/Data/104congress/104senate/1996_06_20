We did make substantial \nprogress on the bill yesterday, and I hope we can continue with \namendments and short time agreements during today's session as well. We \nwould like to complete action on the DOD bill this week if at all \npossible. We will continue working through the afternoon with votes \nuntil early evening.\n  We will recess or leave for the day in time for an event at the White \nHouse tonight, and then we will, after consultation with the Democratic \nleader, make some announcement later today about exactly what will \nhappen on Friday.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Alan \nGreenspan, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Alan \nGreenspan, of New York, to be Chairman of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System.\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 hours of debate equally divided.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the President, and I wish him good morning.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by commending the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin, for demanding our careful consideration of \nthe nomination of Alan Greenspan for another term as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board. The Senate has the duty and the obligation to \nthoroughly review the record of any nominee to such a key post. No one \nhas met that obligation more consequentially than has Senator Harkin, \nor has made a greater contribution to this debate.\n  This debate over Federal Reserve policy, while seemingly distant to \nmany Americans, actually affects the lives of every American family. It \naffects families trying to buy a house or to make a payment on one. It \naffects families trying to buy a new car, farm families trying to get a \nloan to put in next year's\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\ncrop, small business people trying to get a loan to operate their \nbusinesses for yet another year. Even more fundamentally, it affects \nwhether millions of Americans will have a job at all and whether those \nwithout jobs can find one.\n  In judging nominees for the Federal Reserve, their records are the \nmost important factor to consider. Despite some reservations, I believe \nMr. Greenspan's performance justifies his reconfirmation.\n  Congress has mandated that the Federal Reserve conduct its monetary \npolicy to ``promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable \nprices and moderate long-term interest rates.'' We must judge Mr. \nGreenspan by how well he has fulfilled this mandate and, I must say, \nhis record is mixed.\n  Back in 1990, under the direction of Chairman Greenspan, the Federal \nReserve failed to act quickly enough in lowering interest rates when a \nrecession hit in the summer of that year. Recently released transcripts \nshow that as late as October, Mr. Greenspan still insisted there was no \nrecession. The Fed's failure to understand and respond to the recession \nmade it last longer and run deeper. That recession hit farmers and \nfamilies in my own State of South Dakota especially hard.\n  Thankfully, the economy turned around in 1993, and it has remained \nstrong and steady ever since, with inflation remaining under control. \nThat sustained recovery grew out of the President's economic plan of \nthat year, and that plan passed Congress, I remind all of our \ncolleagues, without a single vote from the other side.\n  While Democrats in Congress and the President led the 1993 fight for \nthe economic plan, Mr. Greenspan helped that plan realize success. He \noffered encouraging words during the plan's consideration, which helped \nit gain credibility in the financial markets.\n\n  Following its enactment, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates down \nfor a while. As Mr. Greenspan noted later:\n\n       The actions taken [in 1993] to reduce the federal budget \n     deficit have been instrumental in creating the basis for \n     declining inflation expectations and easing pressures on long \n     term interest rates.\n\n  So the results speak for themselves. Since 1993, nearly 10 million \njobs have been created. These are nearly eight times more private-\nsector jobs than were created during the entire Bush administration. \nThese are not just any jobs: more than two-thirds of them are high-wage \npositions--the kinds of jobs you can raise a family on and plan for the \nfuture.\n  Along with jobs, the overall U.S. economy has grown steadily. Again, \nthe Democrats' 1993 economic plan sparked a real turnaround. During the \nprevious 4 years, economic growth averaged just 1.3 percent. But since \n1993, the economy has grown by more than twice that rate, averaging \nmore than 3.2 percent each year.\n  We have cut the deficit in half in the last 4 years. As many of us \nremember, the deficit stood at a whopping $290 billion in 1992. This \nyear, we have cut the deficit to $130 billion, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. Our plan created 4 consecutive years of \ndeficit reduction for the first time since the 1940's.\n  It remains an open question whether Mr. Greenspan's more recent \npolicies have raised interest rates too high again. Few people realize \nthat in 1 year, from 1994 to 1995, Mr. Greenspan increased the Federal \nfunds rate seven times. In fact, his actions helped to double interest \nrates over that period of time.\n  Here are the figures: In February 1994, the Federal funds rate was 3 \npercent; in February 1995, it doubled to 6 percent. Every homeowner, \nevery farmer, probably most Americans, know what doubling interest \nrates can mean. Since that time, despite any indication that inflation \nwas threatening to rise, the rate has dropped by only three-quarters of \na point, to 5.25 percent.\n  Senators Harkin and Dorgan have made a good case before the Senate \nthat Mr. Greenspan has tended to place a higher priority on fighting \ninflation than creating jobs.\n  Mr. Greenspan needs to reconsider whether by lowering interest rates \nthe economy could expand more quickly without triggering inflation. \nIndeed, a number of prominent business leaders and economists argue \nthat unemployment, currently at 5.6 percent, could be pushed to as low \nas 5 percent without affecting inflation at all. Taking this step would \ngenerate an additional 600,000 jobs. This strikes me as a plausible and \nworthwhile goal which Mr. Greenspan and the entire Federal Reserve \nshould take very seriously.\n  After all, jobs are a critical part of the Federal Reserve's mandate. \nJobs also top the list of priorities for most American families. Jobs \nare certainly on the top of the list of every member of the Democratic \ncaucus.\n  I am deeply concerned that many of our colleagues on the other side, \nled by the distinguished Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, and our \nformer colleague, Senator Dole, have proposed dropping jobs as a \nFederal Reserve priority. The Federal Reserve generates perhaps the \nmost important economic policy decisions of this country. To remove \njobs from their mandate would prove devastating to American workers.\n  The Mack-Dole bill would limit the Fed to considering only inflation \nwhen making its decisions. It directs the Fed to ignore unemployment \nand focus solely on price stability. Imagine putting this question to a \nfamily sitting around a kitchen table: Do you think the most powerful \neconomic institution in this country should be more or less concerned \nabout creating jobs? You can bet the family would say, ``Focus more on \njobs--more on jobs--not less.''\n  Clearly, one powerful group places a higher priority on controlling \ninflation than on promoting economic growth. Wealthy investors, wealthy \nbondholders are hurt far more by small increases in inflation than by \nincreases in unemployment. They are the major constituency for an \ninitiative of this kind. I believe the Fed should pay more attention to \nworking families who are feeling a growing sense of economic insecurity \nin this country.\n\n  While the statistics I have outlined show a strong economy, when I go \nhome I hear a lot of anxiety from farmers, small businesspeople, and \nfamilies just trying to make a living wage. In fact, wages have \nstagnated for many middle-class working families. Every year it seems \nharder and harder just to make ends meet.\n  The simple fact is that if there is a crunch out there, it is the \nFed's crunch.\n  We need a Federal Reserve to serve as an ally, not an opponent, in \nthe fight for more high-wage jobs. If we really mean to raise living \nstandards and fight for higher wages, the Federal Reserve should \nconsider lowering interest rates now, this year, this month.\n  But monetary policy is only one part of economic policy. Democrats in \nCongress are promoting an agenda that goes even further to address the \ninsecurities so many people rightly feel today.\n  We are fighting for paycheck security, starting with raising the \nminimum wage now.\n  We are committed to health security and to controlling health care \ncosts that are eating up workers' compensation gains.\n  We are developing a legislative package to promote retirement \nsecurity so that economic security can last a whole lifetime.\n  At the same time, we have a plan to balance the budget without \ndamaging the economy and without hurting those who need help the most.\n  As Mr. Greenspan himself advocates, we must continue to invest in \neducation, training, and technological development. The Democratic plan \nmakes those investments in America's future.\n  On balance, Mr. Greenspan's successful partnership with us in the \nwake of the 1993 plan merits my support for his reconfirmation. As he \nhimself has noted, the 1993 economic plan ``was an unquestioned factor \nin contributing to the improvement in economic activity that occurred \nthereafter.''\n  Still, he should take heed of the arguments made so effectively by \nSenators Harkin and Dorgan that he needs to do more to promote economic \ngrowth. Our goal must be to extend the economic recovery to all \nAmericans--not just the stock and bondholders of Wall Street, but the \nfamilies and the shops on Main Street.\n  Essentially, the record of the past 4 years shows that we have \ncreated economic growth and jobs. I can support\n\n[[Page S6551]]\n\nMr. Greenspan's nomination, but with the caveat that jobs should remain \nas one of the Fed's top priorities. The hard-working people of this \ncountry deserve an agenda that continues to raise their standard of \nliving. That ought to be the responsibility not only of the Congress, \nbut of the Federal Reserve Board as well. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. One of the things that mystified me in regard to the work \nthat we have done----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am sorry to interrupt you. The Senator from \nIowa controls the time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield whatever time he may consume to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. I thank Senator Harkin.\n  One of the things that has mystified me during the work I have been \ninvolved in and the study by the General Accounting Office has been the \nlack of attention by the press and others about what we have found \nthrough the General Accounting Office regarding how the Fed is run.\n  Senator Harkin, Senator Dorgan, and others, have talked a lot about \nmonetary policy. I respect them and join with them in those statements.\n  But what I want to talk about today again for a few minutes is what \nthe General Accounting Office found in their study of the Fed. Mr. \nPresident, if I were on the Senate floor talking about one of the \nFederal agencies having overspent their budget, there would be cries \nfor an investigation.\n  Let us take a closer look. If you really look at what the Fed has \ndone, it is not just a question of overspending their budget, it is a \nquestion of their spending being uncontrolled.\n  For example, within the Fed itself you are reimbursed for travel in \nmany different ways. Unlimited travel expenses are reimbursed. You have \na foyer going from a few thousand square feet to 20,000 square feet. \nThat is just the entry room to one of their buildings. There is nothing \nin it except marble.\n  The General Accounting Office only peeked at their perks. But what \nthey did find when they took a peek is that, for example, in the Fed \nsystem you can get a security system. You know, their vice presidents \nhave them, vice chairmen have them. They have security systems for \nreasons I do not understand. Some of them have door-to-door travel.\n\n  We do not, I indicate again, Mr. President, know exactly what they \nhave. A preliminary report that was issued by the General Accounting \nOffice, their final report, only confirmed further what is going on at \nthe Fed, but nobody seems to care. If this were an agency of the \nFederal Government or State government, people would be raising their \nhands.\n  One of the big things they are looking at now on the House side--it \nhas not hit here yet; I assume it will--is whether Members of Congress, \nwhen they go to receptions, sit down and eat a sandwich. If they do, it \nis a violation of the rules. If they stand, it is OK. If you sit, it is \nnot. That is what we are looking at here. With the Fed, they can do \nwhatever they want to do. It is not a question of sitting or standing. \nThey can do just about anything they want to do.\n  The Fed operating costs have grown considerably: 50 percent between \n1988 and 1994. Salary costs increased 44 percent, travel costs \nincreased 66 percent during that same period of time, but nobody seems \nto care.\n  This is an organization that has no oversight. This is an \norganization that does not have an annual audit. This is an \norganization that keeps $3.7 billion in a trust fund, a slush fund. \nThey call it a rainy day fund. Why? They said, ``We might need it \nsometime.'' In 79 years, they have never needed it. The $3.7 billion \nshould be returned to the Federal Treasury. They still have the $3.7 \nbillion. No one seems to much care that they have the money stashed \naway.\n  We are going to begin markup of this year's appropriation bills over \nin the Senate. We are going to get our allocation and then look at \nmilitary construction and then the defense spending bill, maybe foreign \noperations. We are going to be fighting for dollars just for little \nprojects. I have a project for $55,000, but we will have trouble \nfunding it. It is extremely essential to saving a lake in Nevada, \nextremely important to an Indian tribe in Nevada. We probably cannot \nget that money. Yet, the Fed has $3.7 billion there for no purpose, and \nnobody seems to care.\n  The final report of the General Accounting Office, Mr. President, was \nissued yesterday. ``The Federal Reserve System: Current and Future \nChallenges Require Systemwide Attention.'' They are not going to have \nany ``systemwide attention'' because Members of this body do not seem \nto care about what is going on at the Fed. This final report issued \nyesterday confirmed everything found in the preliminary report.\n  The real news here, in my opinion, is the Fed's unwillingness to \naccept any of the recommendations made by the independent study. The \nreport demonstrates the absolute arrogance of a tremendously powerful \nentity that believes it is unaccountable to mere taxpayers. It has \nevery reason to believe that it is unaccountable, because it is.\n  The Fed has chosen to reject these recommendations. That is their \nprerogative. We, as a legislative body, have let them get away with it. \nIt is really just a rejection of taxpayer requests, that is all.\n  The Fed may think they need not bother themselves with these requests \nfrom the taxpayer for greater efficiency, and it appears maybe they are \nright. It is obvious that those of us who believe this nomination \nshould not go forward, we are going to lose, but we are gaining ground. \nWe are going to get more votes than last time. I know that, because I \nam one of the people that is going to join those who feel that the Fed \nneeds some direction change.\n\n  We are not going to go away quietly. We are going to say our piece \nhere today, and then we are going to come back in the weeks ahead with \nlegislation. We are not going to wait until the next nomination process \ncomes through. We are going to go through with the legislation, and we \nare going to continue.\n  We are going to call for an annual audit. We are going to call for \nsome of the things that the General Accounting Office thinks should be \ndone. We are going to keep talking about this until the American public \ngives other Members of this body and the other body the backbone to go \nforward and do something.\n  Taxpayers, and I believe this Congress, should no longer tolerate the \ninefficiency, the mismanagement, and questionable accounting procedures \nof the Fed. I repeat: inefficiency, mismanagement, and questionable \naccounting procedures.\n  Greenspan and the Fed have an unlimited budget. They can spend money \nhowever they want. There is no oversight, no investigations, no audits. \nBudgets can be exceeded within house. What difference does it make? \nThey control the money.\n  We have heard numerous times that the Fed has said, ``We will put the \nbrakes on the economy.'' I think we should put the brakes on the Fed. \nThat would be the better way to approach this.\n  Also, the General Accounting Office talks about conflicts of \ninterest, talks about how they let contracts. I repeat, if this were \ndone in the private sector or in another agency of Government, it would \nbe scandalous. But the Fed just does it and turns their head the other \nway and goes on with their business.\n  The report raises the legitimate questions about fiscal management \nwithin the Fed. Important questions need to be answered, and they have \nnot been answered. They have been requested, but they simply do not \nanswer them, just like they did not answer most of the questions that \nthe General Accounting Office presented.\n  This report is about ensuring greater accountability to the American \ntaxpayer and improving fiscal responsibility. The Fed has pocketed $3.7 \nbillion in taxpayer money. It claims this quietly held fund is \nnecessary to cover systemwide losses that it has never had and never \nwill have. In its 79-year history, the Fed has never operated at a \nloss. Excessive salaries increased by 44 percent; 120 top Fed officials \nearned more than the Chairman in 1994, increasing excessive \nexpenditures; benefits increased by 89 percent since 1980 and were \nfound to be more generous than any other Federal agency; travel \nexpenses, I repeat, increased by 66 percent.\n\n[[Page S6552]]\n\n  Board members travel in high style, to say the least. Travel \nreimbursement policies vary from bank to bank, and they are permitted \nto reimburse either on a per diem or actual costs basis. There is no \nconformity, no uniformity. A uniform travel reimbursement policy would \nunquestionably yield greater savings to the taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, as far as I am concerned, the most important thing is \nthe need for an independent audit. To date, there has been no \ncomprehensive audit of our central banking system. We need permanent \nannual independent audits. There is a double standard. This report \ndemonstrates the double standard that is practiced by the Federal \nReserve. While counseling others to decrease their spending, the Fed \nhas increased theirs.\n  I conducted a meeting. Mr. Greenspan was there, and he was asked the \nquestion: What is the most important thing to do? Cut spending. I guess \nfor every place except the Fed, because while we have cut and hacked \naway at these budgets coming through here, theirs has done everything \nbut balloon up and fly away. They are bloated. They are gluttonous.\n  Congress heeded the advice of the Fed and took painful but necessary \nsteps to get the deficit under control, but they did not. The Fed \nstaffing grew, while the rest of the Government shrunk by 2 percent. We \ntightened our fiscal belts, and the Fed sat down to enjoy all you can \neat, in response to the report, that ``we are not interested, we will \nrun our own show, you leave us alone.''\n  The Fed has powerful defenders willing to turn a blind eye to any \ncriticism. This General Accounting Office report provides a tough \nprescription that some may find hard to swallow. But I believe the \nalternative to treatment is simply an unfair cost to the taxpayer who \nwould continue to be forced to pay.\n  I yield the floor and express my appreciation to the Senator.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I want to point out that I think when the \nBanking Committee considered the nomination of Chairman Greenspan some \n4 years ago, there was only 1 vote cast in opposition to Mr. Greenspan. \nThat opposing vote was this Senator. There were no other votes cast \nagainst him.\n  So I rise today to say that I am pleased that the concerns that I had \nwith respect to Chairman Greenspan were proven to be wrong. The \nChairman has done a most diligent job--in spite of the failure of the \nCongress to address the problems of the people of this Nation in a \nforthright, intelligent way, as it relates to dealing with our \nspending.\n  Throughout his tenure, the Chairman, even during turbulent political \ntimes, has remained constant and true. Some can be critical--regardless \nof whether the Congress is in control of the Democrats or Republicans, \nor split, or regardless of the stewardship of the Presidency, be it \nRepublican or Democrat. However, absolutely essential to the well-being \nand the economic growth of this country was a necessity to reduce our \ndeficits and to demonstrate that we were going to do this for real, not \nwith make-believe numbers, because we have seen that too often.\n  Indeed, I remember well the years 1979 and 1980, with inflation rates \nthat made it impossible for small businesses and entrepreneurs to \ninvest in plants or equipment and working middle-class families to \npurchase homes. I recall fear, consternation, panic. Chairman Greenspan \nunderstands and remembers well the lessons of that inflation. It was \ndevastating to the morale of the people of this Nation, to our economic \nwell being, and to our leadership at home and abroad.\n  With that in mind, he has kept a steady hand at the wheel, instead of \ntaking the politically expedient course of saying: Slash the discount \nrate. Slash it and let us pump up the money supply and, with that \naction, create doubts in the domestic and global business community \nabout our resolve against inflation. These doubts will result in the \nkind of inflation where they used to change the prices of the canned \ngoods so fast they would put one sticker on top of the other. Today, \nthey would not do that. You would not even know they were doing it \nbecause they would do it by way of the computer markings. But in the \nlate 1970's, people saw those price changes, felt their effects, and \nunderstood the results. I hope we have not forgotten those lessons.\n  In the late 1970's and early 1980's, prime interest rates were over \n20 percent. Who could buy a house? That is the kind of thing we can \nvery easily have today if the Federal Reserve overreacts. What experts \ndoes the Congress have who are talking about slashing the interest \nrates? The politicians who want to go home and say, ``We are going to \ngive you everything for nothing.'' Why do we not cut the discount rate \nto 1 percent? How about a half-percent? How about a quarter percent? It \nis now about 5\\1/4\\ percent. I will tell you what will take place if \ninterest rates are unnecessarily cut while the economy is near its \nproductive capacity. The cuts will fuel a speculative market, inflation \nand long-term interest rates will soar and young people who want to \npurchase homes will not be able to buy them.\n  Mr. President, I am going to make some more remarks. I know the \nchairman of the Budget Committee is here and he has a very difficult \nschedule. I believe he would like to speak. I am ready to yield the \nfloor to my distinguished colleague for as long as he wants so that he \nmight make some remarks. But I intend to come back to this debate.\n  Let us not hold responsible the Chairman of the Federal Reserve for \nour failures, the failures of the Congress of the United States to \naddress the problems we have. Congress wants to be all things to all \npeople, and never wants to cut anything. Members of Congress want to \nspend and spend, and then come into this Hall and say that the reason \nwe are having the slowness in economic growth is because Alan \nGreenspan, in a mean-spirited or shallow way, does not want to cut the \ndiscount rate. If you really believe cutting the discount rate is going \nto solve all of the problems of the Nation, let us cut it. I have not \nheard people come forth and say that is going to be the answer. I have \nnot seen any economists of any note say that is going to create long-\nterm economic growth. I mean, this is nonsense--absolute, pure pap.\n  I have to tell you something. If you are really going to get down to \nsaying, let us not confirm Mr. Greenspan because economic growth has \nnot been fast enough, that would be like saying that the Chicago Bulls \nshould not re-sign Michael Jordan because the Bulls did not beat \nSeattle fast enough by sweeping Seattle in four games. That is nonsense \nfor the Chicago Bulls, and not confirming Chairman Greenspan would be \nthe equivalent.\n  We have steady growth now. We have not had the kind of cycle that \nmany have predicted because the economy is in the steady hands of \nsomeone who has not yielded to the expedience resorted to by many in \npolitics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I may speak for a shorter period of time \nthan I thought. My voice seems to be having a little trouble today. Mr. \nPresident, in a few hours, the U.S. Senate will confirm three \nappointees to the Federal Reserve Board. I am very confident that we \nwill do that. We will do it because, to do otherwise, would be \nfoolhardy.\n  First of all, I am delighted to take this opportunity not only to \nspeak on behalf of Alan Greenspan's renomination as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, but to congratulate him on a masterful job in his \nprevious term--most recently, guiding the economy into the sixth year \nof expansion.\n  While many will try to take credit for the upbeat economy right now \nand for its consistency, I believe it is a reflection of the anti-\ninflationary policies, which began under Paul Volcker and have \ncontinued under Alan Greenspan. Let me repeat. I believe no \ninstitution, including the Presidency, including the Congress, deserves \nmore credit for the 6 years of sustained growth in this economy than \nthe Federal Reserve Board, headed by Alan Greenspan. By keeping \ninflation low, businesses and households alike are able to make \ninvestments and savings decisions with greater certainty, permitting \nmore efficient functioning of\n\n[[Page S6553]]\n\nthe economy. Households have been spared the tragedy of having \ninflation erode their savings nest eggs, while countless home buyers \nhave benefited from lower long-term interest rates which have followed \nthe Fed's disinflationary policies.\n  Of note, the Volcker/Greenspan tenure has seen economic growth in 12 \nof the last 13 years. Furthermore, Chairman Greenspan has played a very \nimportant role in enhancing banking regulation, ensuring that depositor \nsafety is maintained in the midst of sweeping technologic breakthroughs \nin electronic banking, smart cards, and home banking.\n  I am somewhat amazed by Chairman Greenspan's critics, who argue that \nhe is responsible for the low 2.1-percent level of trend economic \ngrowth. Now I am as intent upon boosting long-run growth as anyone \nhere. But, it is important to realize that the solution to this long-\nterm growth, which we want, and a higher rate of GDP growth than we \nhave had, does not rest with the current Fed. Numerous academic studies \nhave shown that the best way for central banks to boost growth is by \ntargeting price stability. The United States is already very close to \nprice stability right now, with inflation at or below 3 percent for the \nlast 4 years. As such, there is little more that the current Fed can do \nto boost long-run growth further. The same was not true in the mid to \nlate 1970's, when rampant inflation was having negative impact on \ninvestment and savings decisions. Such economic turmoil prompted a \nswitch in 1979, from an easy money policy to a strong anti-inflation \nregime under then Chairman Volcker, followed by Chairman Greenspan. \nThis switch brought inflation down over 12 percentage points in 6 years \nand gave rise to the second longest expansion this century during the \n1980's. However, it is this very successful policy of reducing \ninflation that Chairman Greenspan's critics would change, and charge \nhim with doing less than a good job. This is ironic since excessive \nmonetary easing now would actually harm growth, not enhance it as some \nwill claim. With the economy at full potential, an easing now would \nonly provide a short-run boost, before inflationary pressures \nresurfaced. This would necessitate subsequent tightening and economic \nslowdown. It is precisely this type of feast or famine monetary policy \nthat injects economic uncertainty and constrains long-run growth and \ncauses a rollercoaster in the economy instead of sustained growth over \nlong periods of time.\n  We want more growth. I do, and I talk to more and more people, and \nthey all seem to think we should have more growth than the 2.1 to 2.3 \npercent GDP growth of late. Just as an explanation, our gross domestic \nproduct is like a big pie, perhaps a big cherry pie. What happens is \nwhen the pie is getting smaller, you have a recession. When it is \ngrowing, you have more jobs, better pay, more resources to split and \ndivide among the various activities, including our working peoples' \nsalary paychecks. This must grow or we have stagnation.\n  Mr. President, 2.1 to 2.2 percent added to that cherry pie is not \nsufficient. But what we must do is to urge that the Federal Reserve do \njust what it has been doing and then we, as policymakers, must do at \nleast four things.\n  First, we must balance our budget within a reasonable period of time; \nstop using up the savings of the American people to pay for the debts \nof our country, rather, making it available for growth and to enhance \nproductivity.\n  Second, we must throw away the tax policies of today. Throw out the \ntax laws and start over with a brand new set of tax policies that are \nprogrowth, proinvestment, prosavings--simpler, easier to administer, \nand not so onerous on American business. We must cut taxes wherever we \ncan.\n  Then we must take a serious look at all the regulations in the \ncountry, and where we find regulations that are not needed, take those \nburdens away from the economy, thus making room for growth.\n  And last, we must totally reform the education system of America. \nThere is no question that the education system is not working. There \nare many who are not getting educated sufficiently for the jobs of \ntoday. There are many who need retraining, reeducating. The system \nseems to be floundering.\n  I think, just as we need a reform in fiscal policy, we need a reform \nin education so we can do a better job of helping people get ready for \njobs in this economy. I note just today in the paper that some \ncompanies are paying a bonus to attract people to come to work in the \nbeginning jobs in our economy, the startup jobs. We need to do a better \njob of training people, getting them educated enough to take the jobs \nand then move up to better jobs.\n  So, it seems to me, we should not say to the Federal Reserve Board: \nYou should do all this and cause the growth, with the obvious problem \nthat that can produce superinflation. We have seen it. We saw the day, \nin the waning months of the Carter administration, when, if you went to \na grocery store you would see, right in the aisles of the grocery \nstore, people changing the prices of food every day because inflation \nwas so high that they had to have their clerks changing prices every \nsingle day. That was happening throughout the economy.\n  America needs low inflation to have sustained economic growth. \nAmerica does not need a Federal Reserve Board that loosens up the money \nsupply to invite inflation, or pushes interest rates down when they do \nnot belong any further down, just for the sake of a spurt in growth \nonly to be followed by very, very negative impacts on our people.\n  So, instead of blaming the Federal Reserve, we ought to look clearly \nat ourselves. We ought to look at what we spend our money for, how much \nwe tax our people. Are we spending enough of the tax dollar in \nproductive activities or are we spending it just exchanging money \nbetween our citizens? Do we have an education system that is feeding \ninto our production machine students of all ages ready to take the jobs \nthat we have today, with retraining and high skills being required? Do \nwe have regulations that are too severe, that are not worth the costs \nthat we are imposing?\n  If we were to do this for ourselves, none of us would be here looking \nfor excuses by blaming the Federal Reserve Board that has caused 6 \nyears of sustained growth, has gotten rid of the roller coaster, gotten \nrid of the idea that once you have growth you have to have a \nprecipitous downturn that goes way down and lasts for a while. This \nFederal Reserve has slowed those peaks, which I think is worth a huge \namount to the average working man and woman in America.\n  So, today, I am hopeful in a few hours from now we will \noverwhelmingly support Alan Greenspan. I will put my remarks in the \nRecord regarding the other two candidates, whom I will support. I do \nnot know their effectiveness as Federal Reserve Members because they \nhave not been there. But it does appear to me the President has chosen \ntwo others who will, in complement with Alan Greenspan and the others, \nmake a good team to keep America on the right path.\n  At present, the Fed's main challenge is to preserve low inflation and \nto keep the economy as close to its potential growth as it can. By \ndoing so, the Fed can ensure that any economic downturns are mild and \nshort-lived. Greenspan has succeeded in this regard, keeping the 1991 \nrecession very shallow, despite widespread pressures in the banking \nsector. In fact, unemployment rose to only 7.7 percent in 1992, well \nbelow the double digit levels seen in the early eighties. Furthermore, \nwith a preemptive strike on inflation in 1994, he was able to achieve \nan economic soft landing in 1995. He removed any nascent inflationary \npressures, allowed firms to pare back their inventory overhang without \nprecipitating a recession and set the stage for continued trend growth \nof 2.1 to 2.2 percent in coming years.\n  For those who would still argue that the Fed should run an easier \npolicy in efforts to boost growth, I recommend a trip down memory lane. \nRemember back to the 1970's. Twice during this period, inflation topped \n12 percent in conjunction with oil price shocks. However, the primary \ndriver of these sustained inflation gains was not commodity prices per \nse, but the Fed's reaction to them. In both cases, then Fed Chairmen \nBurns and Miller pursued easy money policies to cushion the economy \nfrom the impact of the oil shocks. While well-intentioned, such \npolicies exacerbated the situation by\n\n[[Page S6554]]\n\ningraining inflation expectations, driving bond yields above 13.5 \npercent, plunging the dollar, and discouraging investment. There were \ndirect human costs as well. In addition to skyrocketing mortgage rates \nand the plunging value of private savings, real average hourly earnings \nfell 3 percent in 1974, and another 2 percent in 1975. After making \nfractional gains in the late 1970's, they fell another 2.9 percent in \n1979 and 4.7 percent in 1980. Clearly, this is not a period upon which \nwe can look back with any favor.\n  Economic studies have shown that such large inflation spikes do \ncurtail long-run economic growth, because of the disruption to business \nand consumer savings and investment decisions. Recent crosscountry \nsurveys have shown that a 10-percentage-point increase in inflation per \nyear is consistent with a 0.2 to 0.3 percent lower per capita GDP. \nOther studies show even larger negative effects. This highlights the \neconomic risks if inflation had remained at high levels into the \n1980's.\n  With the economy on the brink of economic crisis in 1979, President \nCarter appointed Paul Volcker as Fed Chairman that fall. Realizing the \ngravity of the situation, Volcker tightened credit appreciably, using \nmoney supply targeting as his compass. While there was a painful period \nof economic adjustment during 1980-82, the situation would have been \nfar worse had inflation continued to spiral out of control. Post 1982, \nthe benefits of the Fed's policy soon became evident. The economy \nentered the second longest recovery of this century, which lasted from \nthe end of 1982 to the middle of 1990 and the onset of Iraqi-United \nStates military tensions. The economic statistics from the 1980's \nrecovery are nothing short of remarkable. GDP growth averaged 3.7 \npercent--20.8 million jobs were created. Median family earnings rose \nover 10 percent. All of this occurred as inflation was finally brought \nunder control, falling from 14.5 percent in 1980 to below 2 percent by \n1986, and remaining at relatively low levels thereafter. Interest rates \nfollowed suit, with the Federal funds rate falling from highs of \nroughly 20 percent in 1981 to just under 6 percent in 1986. Indeed, the \n1980's recovery might well have extended beyond 1990 had it not been \nfor gulf war tensions and the savings and loan crisis.\n\n  There was another essential element to the 1980's recovery, as well, \nthat I haven't mentioned yet. Under Ronald Reagan, we had a government \nthat was committed to reducing the tax and regulatory burden on the \nAmerican people. Via the tax reform acts of 1981 and 1986, individual \neffective income tax rates fell 13 percent. Such benefits were well \ndispersed--the lowest 40 percent saw their individual tax rates fall 31 \npercent between 1980 and 1990, while the top 40 percent saw a 9-percent \ndecline.\n  As we entered the nineties, however, only half of the successful \nrecipe for 1980's growth remained. We still had a Federal Reserve \ncommitted to low inflation under the tenure of Alan Greenspan. This \nensured that growth would remain close to potential with minimal \neconomic disruption. However, what we lost was the pro-growth, low tax, \nless regulation philosophy of Government. Instead, we inherited \nPresident Clinton's high tax, large Government approach. This \ncombination has kept trend growth steady but artificially depressed.\n  In a reversal of Reagan's efforts to scale back Government intrusion \nin peoples' lives, President Clinton and congressional Democrats passed \nthe largest tax increase in history in 1993. It saddled average \nAmericans with higher gas prices and lower Social Security take-home \nbenefits, it hurt businesses by altering deductions, and it boosted \nmarginal tax rates for EITC recipients and higher income individuals \nalike. Thus, it is not surprising that productivity under President \nClinton has averaged only 0.5 percent, well below the post 1973 average \nof 1.1 percent. Such meager productivity growth has kept real wages \nstagnant, giving rise to much of the economic angst which so many \nworkers have experienced. Just to emphasize this point, real average \nhourly earnings were $7.40 when Clinton took office and are the same \n$7.40 today despite 3 years of growth during this period. Furthermore, \nreal median family earnings were lower in 1994 than they were at the \nbottom of the last recession. The only one consolation is that \nPresident Clinton's massive Government takeover over the health sector \nnever occurred. Had it materialized, I fear that productivity, savings, \nand standards of living would have been even worse than they are. For \nthat, we have congressional Republicans to thank.\n\n  Lackluster productivity growth stresses the need for more substantive \naction on the part of policymakers. One effort that I have devoted \nenormous effort to is reducing the budget deficit. By bringing the \nbudget to balance in 2002, CBO estimates that growth will be boosted by \nan additional 0.4 percent over this time period. It will free up \nsavings for investment, it will allow citizens to keep more of their \nhard earned money, and it will boost standards of living--the \noverriding goal of all policy. Now some will say that President Clinton \nshares this goal too, and note that the deficit has declined since he \ntook office. However, I would first call attention to the President's \nfiscal year 1996 budget, in which he proposed a deficit of $195 billion \nin the year 2000. He only hopped onto balanced budget efforts after the \nRepublican Congress championed this issue.\n  Furthermore, I would argue that most of the current deficit reduction \nand economic growth has occurred in spite of President Clinton not \nbecause of him. If one looks at CBO's projection of the 1995 budget \ndeficit when President Clinton took office and compares it to actual \nnumbers, some interesting facts appear. A full 50 percent of this \ndeficit reduction stems came from technical factors, notably from the \nresolution of the thrift crisis. Another 11 percent came from economic \ngrowth, a tribute to Fed Chairman Greenspan more than anything else. \nThe remaining chunk stemmed from higher taxes and user fee hikes. Less \nthan 1 percent came from spending cuts. Now some will argue that debate \nover why the deficit has fallen is just partisan sniping. Far from it, \nhowever. It is crucial to know how the deficit came down in order to \nassess whether it will stay down. The path of deficit reduction that I \nhave just described does not bode well for future progress. We can't \nrely on savings from thrift crisis resolution forever. We can't assume \nthat the economy will always be a positive for deficit reduction.\n  In addition to a balanced budget, there are other needed components \nfor long-run growth strategy as well--overall tax reform and enhanced \neducation and job training opportunities are critical. The current U.S. \nTax Code is designed to favor consumption over savings so it should be \nno surprise that it has given the United States one of the lowest \noverall savings rates in the G-7. We must alter our Tax Code to favor \nsavings by increasing IRA's and allowing businesses to expense their \ninvestments.\n  We also need to be as concerned with human capital as we are with \nphysical capital. We must look for innovative ways to enhance the \ntraining that our children and workers receive. As technology advances, \njob advancement will be linked to skill levels more and more, serving \nto widen income differentials unless action is taken. States should be \nencouraged to experiment with a variety of voucher programs at the \nprimary and secondary level. It does no good to put emphasis on \npostsecondary education if secondary schools are turning out students \nwithout adequate reading and writing skills. We must also work to \nfacilitate the transition of many workers between jobs. This can be \ndone by using State job training vouchers as well as encouraging \nconsortiums of small businesses to provide training to their workers \ncollectively. This has already been done successfully with small \nbusiness pension programs.\n  And lastly and very importantly, we must ensure that the Federal \nReserve continues to follow an anti-inflationary policy. We should give \nour full support to Chairman Greenspan as he endeavors to keep \ninflation low and growth centered around longrun trend. We, as \npolicymakers, should be the ones trying to boost trend growth from \nhere, not the Fed.\n  Alan Greenspan has done an exceptional job since he first assumed the \nChair in 1987, and will undoubtedly\n\n[[Page S6555]]\n\ncontinue this track record if reappointed. I encourage all my \ncolleagues to give their full and unwavering support for Chairman \nGreenspan's reappointment.\n  I thank my friend, Senator D'Amato, chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, for yielding. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I think if anybody has earned the respect \nof our colleagues on the issues of the Federal budget and domestic \nspending, it is certainly Senator Domenici. It is imperative that we \nnot attempt to attribute slow economic growth to the Fed. That is an \neasy political ploy, whether it be used by Democrats or Republicans.\n  I think Senator Domenici is absolutely correct. In the area of \nfailing to balance the budget, that is the failure of Congress; that is \nthe Executive's failure; that is the failure of past administrations \nand the present administration, past Congresses and the present \nCongress. We have all failed to develop and implement which will bring \neven greater confidence and economic stability, domestically and \nworldwide.\n  If we want interest rates to come down and create better investment \nopportunities, we need a Tax Code which encourages savings to bring \nabout more capital formation, leading to more jobs and more \nopportunity. Obviously, as the Senator has touched on, the fact is that \nwe are failing in our educational system to meet the challenges of \nretraining and providing a trained labor pool. Many businesses cannot \nget the qualified personnel that they need. As a matter of fact, we \nhear those who are opposed to some of the proposed immigration reforms \nbecause, they say, the reforms would make it impossible to get the kind \nof talented work pool needed from outside the United States. This is a \nfact.\n  So for us to say, well, the reason we do not have a better growth \nrate than 2.5 or 2.2 percent is because of Chairman Greenspan or that \nhe is opposed somehow to greater economic growth is just fallacious.\n  Let me address, if I might, the question of the GAO report. We are \ngoing to look into this. It is important. Chairman Greenspan \nacknowledged that the report has touched on a number of areas where \nthey believe they can do better.\n  I must comment on this business of saying that there is a $3.7 \nbillion slush fund. The Federal Reserve turns over about $20 billion a \nyear in earnings to the Treasury and keeps a reserve--let us say it is \n$4 billion. To say that this reserve is a slush fund is just not \ncorrect. It is wrong. Let me tell you why. You need to understand the \nnature of this reserve. This is the central bank of the United States. \nWe have had all manner of occasions where the financial system \nexperiences stress and crises. Sometimes there are even significant \ncosts to the taxpayer. For example, we saw in the savings and loans \ndebacle $150 billion of taxpayers' moneys being needed to end that \ncrisis. We have seen worldwide situations that developed when our \ncentral bank and others have to move in quickly. We have in terms of \ndeposits insured by the Federal Government roughly $4 trillion--$4 \ntrillion--in the American system. Let me say that the Fed surplus of $4 \nbillion represents one-tenth of 1 percent of those deposits. That is \nnot a tremendous amount for the central bank to hold in the event it \nhas to deal with an emergency. My colleagues who run around and banter \nthat the Federal Reserve has a $3.7 billion fund with some unknown \npurpose need to understand the ramifications of dealing with a \nfinancial system that includes $4 trillion in deposits insured through \nthe FDIC.\n  I think it is rather irresponsible to somehow equate holding this \nreserve to the people's money being negligently managed. Indeed, Mr. \nGreenspan is known as the world's preeminent central banker. President \nClinton did not nominate Chairman Greenspan because he is a Republican \nor a Democrat or a partisan. He nominated him because he deserved the \nposition and he has been universally applauded for his overall \nperformance of the last 8 years.\n  I want to include at the end of my remarks a number of editorials \nwhich illustrate the overwhelming support that Mr. Greenspan enjoys. \nAgain, if we want to do something to bring about more growth, then let \nus see that the Congress manages the business of the people in a more \neffective, more efficient way. There is room for agreement and \ndisagreement as to how we can do better, but let us put our own fiscal \nhouse in order and we will get interest rates down for the long term. \nWe do not need false stimulation that will give some temporary relief \nfor short-term borrowing costs but ultimately create inflation of \ndouble digits once again, causing long-term interest rates to rise so \nthat young families are denied the opportunity of purchasing homes and \nbusinesses are unable to figure out their long-term borrowing costs.\n  That is not the kind of management our Nation needs. We need steady, \nprudent management of our economy. Most importantly, we have to see \nthat the Congress of the United States makes the necessary reforms in \nour current tax system which does not reward savings or investment and \nin fact penalizes savings. Our tax system and our complex system of \nregulations help retard economic growth and expansion. We have an \neducational system that has too many bureaucrats and not enough money \ncoming into classrooms and not enough choice for people to make in \neducating their children. This is particularly true in poor inner \ncities where we find that the working poor are trapped and do not have \nthe ability to send their children to schools that can give them \nmeaningful educational opportunities to enable them to compete. We have \nbecome a nation entrapped in the bureaucracy that comes out of \nWashington.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the nomination of \nChairman Greenspan. I ask unanimous consent that the articles I have \nalluded to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Financial Times, Jan. 29, 1996]\n\n                       Renominating Mr. Greenspan\n\n       The identity of the person who will hold what is arguably \n     the most powerful post in the United States will shortly be \n     known. If the present incumbent, a major figure in domestic \n     politics, survives the peculiarly American ritual of \n     nomination then a landslide victory can be all but assured. \n     Unfortunately for President Clinton, whose practical \n     authority and command depends so much on the co-operation, \n     often not forthcoming, of others, the position concerned is \n     chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the person is Mr. \n     Alan Greenspan.\n       The chairman's present term expires on March 2 and he has \n     indicated a willingness to accept a third period as the \n     world's most important central bank chief. Since his initial \n     appointment by President Reagan in 1987, Mr. Greenspan has \n     built a formidable reputation for himself. He has managed to \n     combine a reputation for vigorous economic orthodoxy with \n     Wall Street and world markets whilst in practice proving \n     rather more flexible than that image would suggest. He has \n     mastered the art of being a political figure whilst not \n     looking one. His genuine internationalism, and capacity to \n     innovate, have earned high praise within the G7 and beyond.\n\n\n                             Little Option\n\n       It is not surprising then that the president not only \n     should renominate him but almost certainly will. Given a \n     Republican Senate, Mr. Clinton has precious little option but \n     to back the current chairman. This is compounded by the \n     failure of previous White House efforts to acquire influence \n     on the Fed through more aggressive nominations.\n       The first Clinton appointment, Ms. Janet Yellen, was \n     perceived as insufficiently orthodox and has been a \n     marginalised figure throughout her tenure. Mr. Alan Blinder, \n     elevated to vice-chairman, and widely touted as the favoured \n     candidate for chairman, never recovered from a speech that \n     questioned the minimisation of inflation as the board's \n     exclusive mission. He announced his return to academia this \n     month. The president has still to find a replacement for Mr. \n     John LaWare, who quit last year, that the Senate will accept. \n     The administration will be playing with congressional fire \n     again if, as suggested, it offer Mr. Felix Rohatyn as Mr. \n     Blinder's replacement.\n\n\n                              Good fortune\n\n       Whether Mr. Greenspan is wise to court further office is \n     another matter. Central bank governors require luck as well \n     as judgment and he has had an unusually large share of good \n     fortune over the past nine years. To stretch that record for \n     another four years is surely tempting fate.\n       Yet he must consider the short-term signs to be \n     encouraging. Given last weeks' agreement, the federal \n     government--and hence his office--will at least be open on \n     March 2. It took the merest hint of a credit downgrading from \n     Moody's for previously gung-ho congressional Republicans to \n     make assuring noises on the debt ceiling.\n       In the medium term, if any multi-year bargain on the \n     federal budget deficit is reached, deliberately restricting \n     fiscal options, then\n\n[[Page S6556]]\n\n     monetary policy and the control of it will become even more \n     significant. Were this fiscal shift enshrined in a balanced \n     budget amendment to the American Constitution, that enhanced \n     significance would become permanent. The Federal Reserve \n     Board is likely to be an increasingly important body in the \n     21st century.\n       In such circumstances, the prospective renomination of Mr. \n     Greenspan is especially appropriate. The president would be \n     well advised to announce his intentions immediately.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 9, 1996]\n\n                                 Fed Up\n\n       A President nearing the end of his term can expect to have \n     a hard time moving nominations through the Senate, especially \n     if the other party is in the majority. The party reasons \n     that, if only it waits, its candidate may win the next \n     election and be the one to fill the job. It may therefore \n     come as no surprise that President Clinton's nominations of \n     Alan Greenspan to be chairman, Alice Rivlin to be vice \n     chairman and economist Laurence Meyer to fill a vacancy on \n     the Federal Reserve Board are stalled--except that it isn't \n     Republicans doing the stalling.\n       The nominations are being held up by a small group of \n     Democrats led by Sen. Tom Harkin. Their complaint is that Mr. \n     Greenspan, in his zeal to suppress inflation, has kept the \n     economy from growing as fast as it should and thereby cost \n     the country--working people in particular--jobs and income. \n     Sooner or later they are expected to relent; they don't \n     expect to deny him the nomination so much as to call \n     attention to their argument and--who knows?--possibly soften \n     up the board and cause it to alter course a little.\n       It's fair enough to make the argument if they want to, and \n     Republicans earlier went much further in deflecting \n     altogether the nomination of investment banker Felix Rohatyn \n     as vice chairman; they argued he was too pro-growth. Of \n     course, the Democrats said in response that it was wrong to \n     make a capable nominee a pawn in a political dispute--and \n     that's as true in this case as it was in that.\n       All three of these people are excellent choices whose \n     instincts will keep them well within the envelope of \n     acceptable policy. There will always be a debate about how \n     fast the economy can safely be allowed to grow and where the \n     balance point exists between the risks of renewed inflation \n     and lingering slack. The more success the Fed has had in \n     combating inflation lately, the more that risk has seemed to \n     recede, but that hardly means the board's policy has been \n     wrong.\n       Our own sense is that the board has both less latitude and \n     less fine control over the economy than some of the rhetoric \n     surrounding its decisions would suggest. Its ability to tilt \n     in the direction of growth is further constrained by Congress \n     itself, or by the elected branches generally. The budget \n     deficits they have compiled in recent years have given the \n     board little choice but to lean on the brakes as an offset. \n     Mr. Greenspan seems to us to have done a good job of \n     navigating a narrow channel. As Mr. Harkin's own president is \n     fond of saying, the unemployment and inflation rates are both \n     pretty low just now.\n       But the real point is that those who believe the mix of \n     risks in the economy has changed a little in recent years, so \n     that it would be both safe and beneficial to shoot for a \n     slightly higher rate of growth, can make that argument in the \n     confirmation process, as to some extent they already have. \n     Merely putting nominations on hold is obstructionism, not \n     debate. It is time for the Senate to liberate Mr. Clinton's \n     three nominees and take a vote.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 3, 1996]\n\n                          A Job for the Senate\n\n       If the Senate has some time to kill when it reconvenes this \n     week--and the Senate is always killing time--we have a \n     suggestion. It could debate and vote on the president's \n     choices to complete the Federal Reserve Board. They have been \n     held up too long.\n       It was in February that Mr. Clinton announced his intention \n     to nominate Alan Greenspan to another term as chairman of the \n     seven-member panel, Alice Rivlin to be vice chairman and St. \n     Louis economist Laurence Meyer to fill a vacancy. The \n     paperwork went up a few weeks later, the Banking Committee \n     held a hearing March 26 and sent the nominations to the floor \n     the next day. They've languished since because of opposition \n     on the part of, not the majority Republicans, but a handful \n     of discontented Democrats led by Iowa's Tom Harkin.\n       The opponents think that, in its zeal to suppress \n     inflation, the Fed in recent years has kept the economy from \n     growing as rapidly as it safely could. The slower growth has \n     cost the country income and jobs; so they believe, and in \n     part they blame Mr. Greenspan. It's the ancient argument: \n     Which is the greater danger, the risk of renewed inflation or \n     the consequences of economic slack? Mr. Harkin and the others \n     on his side believe the latter, and want to use the debate on \n     the nominations as a consciousness-raising session. The \n     argument has had to do with how much time they'll be given, \n     but surely that can be worked out. They ought to get it done.\n       Our own sense has been that the Fed has done a pretty good \n     job of late of steering between the risks of inflation and \n     slack; the inflation and unemployment rates are both pretty \n     low. Its maneuvering room in this regard has also been \n     constrained by Congress itself. The country has had a wide-\n     open fiscal policy in recent years; the deficit is its \n     emblem. The Fed has had little choice but to offset it. The \n     pro-growth types in both parties complain about a policy of \n     constraint that they themselves have helped to force.\n       Sure, the Senate ought to debate these issues. They're a \n     lot more important than much of what it does debate. But it \n     ought not hold these nominations hostage in the process. The \n     president has chosen well. The nominees are qualified. The \n     senators can talk all they want, and they usually do. But \n     time now to vote as well.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 8, 1996]\n\n                    The Unfair War on Alan Greenspan\n\n       Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa has single-handedly blocked a \n     vote to confirm Alan Greenspan's reappointment as chairman of \n     the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Greenspan will no doubt be \n     approved, eventually. But the annoying delay could grow worse \n     if, as is now threatened, his confirmation is tied to that of \n     a number of controversial judicial nominations.\n       The truth is that Mr. Greenspan's record, by testimony of \n     liberal and conservative economists alike, deserves high \n     praise, not Mr. Harkin's thoughtless barbs.\n       Mr. Harkin accuses Mr. Greenspan of needlessly shackling \n     the economy, and there are some economists and businessmen \n     who agree with him. But the record says otherwise.\n       The economy has grown during seven of the eight years that \n     Mr. Greenspan has led the Federal Reserve Board. Unemployment \n     has steadily declined. So has inflation--an unusual \n     combination of good outcomes. What Mr. Harkin criticizes is \n     the fact that the steady growth rate has, by comparison with \n     the 1950's and 60's, been relatively slow--about 2.5 percent \n     per year. Mr. Harkin wants growth of 3 or 4 percent.\n       The sobering fact is that the Fed has no say over long-term \n     growth and employment. Growth is limited to about 2.5 percent \n     a year because of slow population growth and productivity \n     growth, two trends over which the Fed has almost no control. \n     What the Fed does control is the amount of money circulating \n     through the economy, which determines how fast prices rise. \n     The best way the Fed can make sure the economy grows as fast \n     as possible is to remove the fear of inflation from the \n     decisions to work and invest that are made by ordinary \n     citizens. On that score, Mr. Greenspan's record has been very \n     good.\n       It is true that the Fed can, when the economy is in a \n     temporary lull, bring down interest rates in an attempt to \n     spur investment and boost economic activity back up to \n     capacity levels. But there are fairly strict limits on how \n     far the Fed can go. At some point--economists disagree \n     where--unemployment falls so low that wage and price \n     inflation begin to soar.\n       Mr. Harkin asserts that the economy could operate without \n     threat of inflation at an unemployment rate well below the \n     current level of 5.6 percent. That may be true. But even if \n     the Fed turned activist, and Mr. Greenspan's critics turned \n     out to be right about inflation, the impact on the economy \n     would be modest and temporary. If, for example, the Fed \n     nudged unemployment down to 4.5 percent, it would mean only \n     that the economy could grow a bit quicker, around 3.5 \n     percent, for about two years. Then growth would slip back \n     down to its long-run potential of 2.5 percent.\n       A case can be made, in hindsight, that the Fed has erred in \n     the direction of caution the past couple of years. But the \n     errors have been slight and the impact small. The important \n     fact is that Mr. Greenspan has kept the economy on a steady \n     course through turmoil on Wall Street and a war in the \n     Persian Gulf. Mr. Harkin's carping is not just annoying. It \n     is wrong.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Dallas Morning News, Oct 8, 1995]\n\n      Federal Reserve--Greenspan Deserves 4 More Years as Chairman\n\n       The job of Federal Reserve Board chairman requires a steady \n     hand, which is why President Clinton should reappoint Alan \n     Greenspan to a third four-year term.\n       The Fed's main mission is to preserve the value of the \n     nation's currency by managing the money supply. In this, the \n     Fed has performed extremely well under Mr. Greenspan's \n     direction, and often in difficult circumstances. Prudent Fed \n     adjustments of short-term interest rates have helped to keep \n     inflation low during more than four years of unbroken \n     economic growth.\n       Not that Mr. Greenspan has been without controversy. Mr. \n     Clinton has been known at times to resent his anti-inflation \n     hawkishness. President George Bush felt Mr. Greenspan waited \n     too long to lower interest rates, when a well-timed lowering \n     might have provided an economic stimulus to aid his doomed \n     re-election effort.\n       But in general, Mr. Greenspan has led the Fed to sound \n     decisions. Despite the fact that his prior appointments were \n     by Republicans, Mr. Clinton should reward him for his \n     impartial and intelligent deliberations.\n       The choice is important. Over the next six months, Mr. \n     Clinton must fill three vacancies on the Fed's seven-person \n     board of governors. At the same time, Congress is expected to \n     try seriously to eliminate the 26-year string of federal \n     budget deficits.\n       Because the deficit may at last vanish, the temptation will \n     be for Mr. Clinton to appoint inflation doves. That's not \n     necessarily bad, if Congress actually balances the budget. \n     The\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\n     nation may need a looser monetary policy to stimulate \n     investment and jobs while the economy adjusts to smaller \n     government.\n       But, in that event, financial markets will demand a \n     chairman who is a known and respected quantity, a proven \n     inflation fighter, a seasoned dealer with congressman and \n     presidents. Mr. Greenspan is that choice.\n       If Mr. Clinton deems Mr. Greenspan capable, he should be \n     able to reappoint him. Besides, Mr. Greenspan's 14-year term \n     as a Fed governor doesn't expire until 2002. As long as he's \n     on the board, he should be able to serve as chairman.\n       The choice is clear: Give the green light to Greenspan.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Not to overuse a good statement, but I am going to do it \nagain, Chairman Greenspan has been a success. He should be rewarded, \nand the people should be protected. He has actually won the \nchampionship, much like the Chicago Bulls, and winning that economic \nchampionship has not been easy. It has not been a knockout in every \nsense. He did not sweep the series. But, again, refusing to confirm Mr. \nGreenspan because economic growth has not been fast enough or high \nenough would be like the Chicago Bulls saying we are not going to sign \nMichael Jordan because the Bulls did not sweep in four games but just \nwon the championship in a way that did not meet the expectations of all \nthe critics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I had a real good sleep last night so I am \nwell rested and I hear quite well. I heard apparently the Senator from \nNew York compare, was it the Federal Reserve Board to the Chicago \nBulls? Did the Senator from New York just compare the Chicago Bulls \nchampionship basketball team to the Federal Reserve Board?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I did not hear the last comparison that the Senator \nasked me to comment on.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I just said I had a good sleep, and I am hearing fairly \nwell this morning. I thought I heard the Senator say that the Federal \nReserve Board is kind of like the Chicago Bulls, and apparently one was \nreferring to the fact that the Federal Reserve Board has been champions \nin winning this battle against inflation and the Chicago Bulls are the \nworld championship basketball team, and I thought, well, maybe I did \nnot hear very well.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is true. I think the Federal Reserve has done an \nexcellent job. They have put us on a strong and steady course, and I \nwould compare that course to any worldwide, to all the other major \neconomies, the Japanese, the Germans, et cetera. I would say that the \nfailure to make an economic sweep comes from the Congress and the \nfailure of us to do our jobs, coupled with the White House--not just \nthis White House but other White Houses as well.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator for yielding on that point. I \nthought, heck, I guess I do not understand this debate. If the Fed is \nlike the Chicago Bulls, where is the Dennis Rodman? There would be no \none down at the Fed who would be countenanced as having contrary views.\n  The Federal Reserve Board, as you know, operates behind closed doors \nand in secret. It is the last dinosaur in our Government making \nmonetary policy decisions that affect everyone. We talk a lot about \ntaxes on the floor of the Senate. When the Fed hikes interest rates, \nthere is a tax imposed on every single American, with no debate or \ndemocratic process about whether the families in America should pay \nthese taxes.\n  There is a tax imposed on every single American when the Fed says \nbehind closed doors, ``We're going to keep the Federal funds rates \nhigher than it should be.''\n  Why?\n  ``Because we, as a group of economists and bankers and others who run \nthe Federal Reserve Board are worried about inflation.''\n  What inflation? Five years in a row inflation has come down, not gone \nup. That is not, I say to my friend from New York, a function of the \nbehavior of the Federal Reserve Board.\n  The global economy has put downward pressure on wages. Why? Because \nthe global economic system is says that our largest corporations are \ninternational citizens. These corporations say we want to consign \nAmerica's work force, at least the lower two-thirds of the work force \nin America, to compete with 2 or 3 billion other people around the \nworld, some of whom are willing to work for 10, 12 or 25 cents an hour. \nThis puts downward pressure on wages.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will my colleague yield for an observation?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. First of all, let me say Mr. President, I believe my \ncolleague has brought up, absolutely correctly, the need to have a \nthorough, thoughtful discussion and review of how the Federal Reserve \nconducts its business. And I, as Chairman of the Banking Committee \nwhich has jurisdiction, promise you that discussion and review. I also \nwelcome your active participation.\n  My colleague and friend, Senator Dorgan, has not been a Johnny-come-\nlately to scrutinizing the Federal Reserve. Senator Dorgan has been \nthoughtful in addressing a number of issues, and just recently brought \nto the chairman's attention one of his concerns. I wanted to stop at \nthis point and say the Senator is correct. We have to examine the \nFederal Reserve's operations and look at how much secrecy and \nconfidentiality is required. Senator Dorgan and I both understand there \nare certain instances where confidentiality is unquestionably \nwarranted, in order to avoid speculative actions in financial markets. \nI think Congress has to thoughtfully look at these issues and examine \nthem in light of the world markets we have and in light of the \ncommunications we have.\n  I also want to indicate to you that we have responded to the concerns \nraised by Senator Dorgan in his letter. I do not know if you have \ngotten a response to your recent inquiry regarding to some of the very \ndisturbing reports on the Los Angeles branch of the San Francisco \nFederal Reserve. These reports discuss irregularities which involve \nhundreds of millions of dollars. I have asked the Federal Reserve to \nrespond to these reports. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dorgan's \nletter and my letter to the Federal Reserve be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I'm writing to urge that the Senate \n     Banking Committee hold a hearing to thoroughly examine the \n     troubled currency reporting practices recently uncovered at \n     the Los Angeles Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank in San \n     Francisco.\n       According to recent press reports, Federal Reserve \n     employees at the Los Angeles branch bank knowingly engaged in \n     an ongoing practice of falsifying cash reports sent to the \n     Board of Governors. It is my understanding that the Federal \n     Reserve Board uses this information to help determine the \n     level of money in circulation, to assess currency needs in \n     different parts of the country and for other important \n     reasons.\n       In the last three months of 1995, there reportedly were \n     errors in currency and coin activities that totaled more than \n     $178 million. It is alleged that this practice has occurred \n     for years and was actually condoned, if not directed, by bank \n     management.\n       This is simply outrageous if the reports are anywhere near \n     accurate. I think that Federal Reserve officials ought to \n     fully explain to the American people if there are \n     mismanagement and accounting lapses at the Los Angeles branch \n     bank, and tell us what steps, if any, are being taken to \n     prevent this from happening in the future. I also believe the \n     matter should be fully audited by the General Accounting \n     Office. One thing is clear: if we ultimately find out that \n     money is actually missing at the branch bank, American \n     taxpayers are the real losers. That's why we can't allow the \n     Federal Reserve Board to simply brush this matter aside and \n     allow it to become just another case of business as usual \n     when questions arise about Federal Reserve oversight.\n       Again, I urge you to hold hearing to examine this matter at \n     the first available opportunity.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my request. I look \n     forward to hearing from you soon.\n           Sincerely,\n     Byron L. Dorgan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                U.S. Senate,      \n                                     Committee on Banking Housing,\n\n\n                                            and Urban Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC.

The executive said the discrepancies were \n     being investigated.\n       Internal documents showed that in the 1995 fourth quarter, \n     employees were ``forcing'' balances that did not add up, so \n     that the reports sent to the Fed board would appear correct.\n       Current and former employees say the practice has been \n     going on for at least a year in the cash-handling operation \n     and that far larger discrepancies may have occurred over \n     time. The Los Angeles branch runs one of the largest Federal \n     cash vaults, putting money into circulation and destroying \n     old currency.\n       But none of the people familiar with the situation said \n     there was evidence that cash was missing.\n       The apparent management lapses in one of the Fed's most \n     basic and important functions may prove an embarrassment for \n     the central bank at a time when it is already under fire from \n     the General Accounting Office for its spending and management \n     practices, particularly at some of the Fed's 12 district Fed \n     banks.\n       Although there was no evidence that other branches had \n     problems akin to the Los Angeles branch's, the incident may \n     renew questions about Fed bank management as its chairman, \n     Alan Greenspan, awaits Senate confirmation for a third term.\n       On Friday, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, a Texas \n     Democrat and longtime Fed critic, asked the Government \n     Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, for an \n     emergency audit of the Los Angeles cash unit. He asserted \n     that senior managers in Los Angeles had known of ``deliberate \n     falsifications'' of the cash reports.\n       The chief operating officer of the San Francisco Fed, John \n     F. Moore, confirmed that ``there were some reports that \n     contained inaccuracies that were identified by management in \n     January.''\n       ``There were months when the report had to be completed \n     before deadline when they sent it up without substantiating \n     certain numbers,'' Mr. Moore said.\n       The Fed board uses cash reports from district banks to \n     track the level of currency in circulation, to order new cash \n     from the United States Mint and to monitor how much has been \n     destroyed and for other statistical purposes.\n       According to an internal compliance report prepared in \n     January by the staff at the Los Angeles branch, discrepancies \n     varied sharply from month to month. In November 1995, for \n     example, the report sent to the Fed board claimed $61.8 \n     million more than it should have; in December, the figure was \n     too low by $111.1 million.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the American Banker, June 4, 1996]\n\n                  Fed Branch Accused of Juggling Books\n\n                          (By Bill McConnell)\n\n       WASHINGTON--Managers at the Los Angeles branch of the \n     Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco falsified their books \n     to cover up accounting errors, Rep.

Wilke)\n\n       Washington.--The Los Angeles Federal Reserve branch appears \n     to have had some trouble counting its money, and has doctored \n     cash reports sent to Washington after finding discrepancies \n     totaling tens of millions of dollars.\n       The altered reports were confirmed by an executive of the \n     San Francisco Fed bank, which oversees the Los Angeles \n     branch. He said the discrepancies are being investigated. \n     Internal documents show that in the 1995 fourth quarter, \n     employees were ``forcing'' balances that didn't add up so \n     that the reports sent to the Fed board would appear normal.\n       Current and former employees say the practice has been \n     going on for at least a year in the cash-handling operation \n     and that far larger discrepancies may have occurred over \n     time. The Los Angeles branch runs one of the largest federal \n     cash vaults, putting money into circulation and destroying \n     old currency.\n       The apparent management lapses in one of the Fed's most \n     basic and critical functions could prove to be an \n     embarrassment for the central bank at a time when it is \n     already under fire from the General Accounting Office for its \n     spending and management practices, particularly at some of \n     the 12 district fed banks.\n       Although the problems appear to have been confined to the \n     Los Angeles branch, the incident could renew questions about \n     Fed bank management as its powerful chairman, Alan Greenspan, \n     is awaiting Senate confirmation to a third term.\n       Rep. Henry Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat and longtime Fed \n     critic, asked the GAO late Friday for an emergency audit of \n     the Los Angeles cash unit. He charged that ``deliberate \n     falsifications'' of the cash reports were known to senior \n     managers in Los Angeles.\n       John F. Moore, chief operating officer of the San Francisco \n     Fed, confirmed that ``there were some reports that contained \n     inaccuracies that were identified by management in January.'' \n     He said local managers apparently continued the practice even \n     as they tried to correct the problem, deliberately sending \n     misleading reports to the Fed board.\n       ``There were months when the report had to be completed \n     before deadline when they sent it up without substantiating \n     certain numbers,'' he said.\n       Mr. Moore said that no cash was actually missing from the \n     bank. ``We balance to the penny all the money coming in and \n     out of the bank everyday.'' Other Fed employees said that \n     given the huge discrepancies, this assertion couldn't be \n     proved unless separate manual cash tallies were checked. ``If \n     they are forcing the balances on these reports, you still \n     have to establish where that cash is,'' one said. However, \n     none of the people familiar with the situation said there was \n     evidence of missing cash.\n       According to an internal compliance report prepared by the \n     Los Angeles branch staff in January, discrepancies varied \n     sharply from month to month. In November 1995, for example, \n     the report sent to the Fed board claimed $61.8 million more \n     than it should have; in December, the figure was too low by \n     $111.1 million.\n       The Fed board uses cash reports from the district banks to \n     track the level of currency in circulation, order new cash \n     from the U.S. Mint, monitor how much has been destroyed, and \n     for other statistical purposes.\n       Mr. Moore said that there was a $178 million difference \n     ``between what our compliance group was able to add up and \n     what was sent to the board'' in the cash reports in the 1995 \n     fourth quarter. But he insisted: ``This is a statistical \n     problem, not a financial one.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   [From the USA Today, June 4, 1996]\n\n                   Critic Says Fed Juggled Its Books\n\n       Federal Reserve employees were ordered to falsify reports \n     to cover up $179 million in discrepancies, a longtime Fed \n     critic alleged Monday.\n       Rep. Henry Gonzalez of Texas, senior Democrat on the House \n     Banking Committee, claims Fed employees used accounting \n     gimmicks to cover discrepancies in Fed reports the last three \n     months of `95.\n       The employees work at the Fed's Los Angeles branch, one of \n     the nation's largest currency processing centers. The General \n     Accounting Office has been asked to investigate the \n     allegations, Gonzalez says.\n       He says the accounting gimmicks covered up shortages of \n     $5.8 million in October and $111.1 million in December \n     between two different reports.\n       In November, the report that was changed actually came in \n     $61.8 million higher than another report. That left a net \n     shortfall of $55 million for the three months, although there \n     are no accusations of missing money.\n       John Moore--chief operating officer of the San Francisco \n     Fed, which oversees the Los Angeles branch--says there have \n     been report inaccuracies.\n       But new procedures have been put in place to correct the \n     problems, Moore says.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am not suggesting for one second that \nwhile I support Mr. Greenspan as Chairman that we should not take a \ncareful look at the practices of the Federal Reserve that, in some \ncases, are so esoteric. I think we have an obligation to review this, \nand I say to you, I will support such an endeavor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate that. I think that is a helpful response.\n  Let me frame this issue the way it should be framed. I said before, \nand I want to say again, this is not personal with me. In fact, I \nadmire Chairman\n\n[[Page S6559]]\n\nGreenspan. I think he has performed a substantial amount of service for \nthis country. I disagree fundamentally with the monetary policy that is \nnow employed by the Federal Reserve Board, because I think it \nartificially restricts economic growth in this country in a way that is \nunwarranted. I think it serves interests that are not the interests of \nthe producers and workers. It serves the money center bank interests. I \nthink they are fighting a ghost foe. The Fed's fighting inflation that \ndoes not exist and claiming credit for bringing inflation down. Again, \ninflation is being brought down by the pressures of the global economy. \nSo it is not personal with me.\n  In addition to the issues of monetary policy, the GAO raises, I \nthink, some fundamental questions about the mechanics and the \noperations of the Reserve Board, and I think those need to be examined. \nAnd I appreciate the response of the Senator from New York that he \nintends to do that.\n  Let me say that the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, has only asked \nthat there be a debate and a full discussion about Mr. Greenspan's \nnomination on the floor. We had people in the Senate who said, ``Well, \nwhat we would like to do is move these nominations by unanimous \nconsent, and we don't have time for a debate.''\n  The Senator from Iowa, I think, has suffered some significant \npressures and criticism by people who said, ``What are you doing?''\n  Well, he was not bowed by that, fortunately. He was doing what he \nthought was right and what I think is right: Asking that this Senate \ndiscuss monetary policy.\n  We are now discussing it, and we are going to have a vote. Mr. \nGreenspan, I predict, is going to be confirmed by a wide margin. I \npersonally am not going to vote for his reconfirmation for a second \nterm. It is nothing personal, but I think the Fed is marching in the \nwrong direction.\n  I am going to read some quotes, but let me first respond to something \nsaid by the Budget Committee chairman. He said if the Congress were \nmore responsible in fiscal policy, we would have better economic \ngrowth. I heard that before. Let me respond by reading this.\n  This is a comment by the former Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, Robert Reischauer. He is now with the Brookings Institution. He \nsays:\n\n       Whether or not the supply-siders think cutting taxes will \n     make the economy grow faster doesn't really matter. . . . If \n     Alan Greenspan thinks the economy can't grow faster than 2.2 \n     percent a year without triggering inflation, it isn't going \n     to happen.\n\n  That is Mr. Reischauer. If Mr. Greenspan does not want growth rates \nhigher than 2.2 percent, it is not going to happen. I agree with him.\n  The Federal Reserve Board believes that unemployment should not drop \nmuch below 5.5 percent, maybe even 6 percent, because they worry it \nwill trigger more inflation. They believe the economy should not grow \nmore than 2 or 2.5 percent a year, because they worry it will trigger \nmore inflation. I have said they view themselves as a set of human \nbrake pads whose sole mission it is to slow down the economy. My Uncle \nJoe can do that. Maybe we should put my Uncle Joe on the Federal \nReserve Board. He does not have any experience, but he could certainly \nslow down the American economy.\n  If the Federal Reserve Board believes that its mission is to slow \ndown the economy, then they are doing just fine, because we have an \nanemic rate of economic growth. Mr. President, 2 or 2.3 percent \neconomic growth is not the kind of economic growth that is going to \nprovide the opportunity and the jobs that the American people need and \ndeserve. The fact is, we can have a better rate of economic growth \nwithout stoking the fires of inflation. Inflation is coming down, not \ngoing up.\n  Let me read some quotes, lest you think it is only myself or the \nSenator from Iowa who believes this. The chairman of the General \nElectric Co., John Welch, Jr.:\n\n       We don't see a connection between the numbers out there and \n     what we feel in our business. There is absolutely no \n     inflation. There is no pricing power at all.\n\n  Dana Mead, chief executive of Tenneco, who I believe is also chairman \nof the National Association of Manufacturers:\n\n       I believe very strongly that the Fed should be leaning more \n     toward growth and not be so concerned with the threat of \n     inflation.\n\n  I think the numbers support Mr. Mead's contention.\n  Felix Rohatyn:\n\n       There was a time when 2.8 percent growth would be \n     considered a modest rate of growth. Today, it is considered \n     dangerously robust. Most corporate leaders don't agree with \n     this notion of dragging the anchor just as soon as the \n     economy has wind behind it. They understand that we can \n     sustain high growth based on muscular productivity \n     improvements that they are generating in their own \n     businesses.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not about idle debate about theory. This is a \ndebate that reaches every home and every worker in this country. A \ncentury ago, we would have been debating interest rate policy from \nbarbershops to barrooms all across this country. The Senator from New \nYork is one of the real historians in our country and serving in this \nbody. You read the financial history of this country and the debate \nsurrounding the large economic issues of this country. You read in the \nlast century that monetary policy and interest rates were a predominant \npolitical issue in America.\n  Over two centuries, there has been a wrestling match between those \nwho produce in America and those who finance production in America. \nThere has always been this wrestling match, this tension. One wants to \novercome the other. It is about profits and money.\n  You look at these two centuries of that struggle, and you find you go \na decade or two, and one side has an upper hand, those who finance \nproduction have the power and wield the power and have the upper hand; \nthen it turns and the pendulum swings, and those who produce have the \nupper hand.\n  We are in a period in this country today where those who finance \nproduction not only have the upper hand, but have an abiding ally among \nthose who make this country's money policy. It sounds like theory to a \nlot of people, but what it means is in every household at the end of \nevery month when every American pays their bills, they are paying a \ntax. It has been imposed on their family by an institution that keeps \ninterest rates higher than they can justifiably be kept in this country \ntoday.\n  These costs of higher interest rates will cost the American people, \nnot $20, $50, or $100 billion, but hundreds of billions of dollars in \nextra costs coming out of their pockets. Credit card interest rates are \nhigher, the prime rate is higher, business operating loans are at a \nhigher interest rate, all because they come off the Federal funds rate.\n  The Federal funds rate is higher now than can be justified. There is \nno doubt about that. There is no real debate about that, in my \njudgment. They will say it is higher because they are worried about the \nthreat of inflation.\n  In North Dakota, for example, North Dakotans will pay close to $400 \nmillion over the next 5 years in excess interest costs. That's $80 \nmillion a year in excess interest charges because we have those sitting \non monetary policy who manage it in a way that keeps interest rates \nexcessively high in order to restrict the rate of economic growth in \nour country. I fundamentally disagree with that.\n  I hope, in the context of having a debate about monetary policy and \nthe Federal Reserve Board, that we can perhaps light the fuse that will \nresult in a larger debate in this country about in whose interest are \nwe conducting monetary policy?\n  We will have some people stand up in this Chamber and say that the \nfight against inflation is the only fight that counts. Let us evaluate \nthat for just a moment. What has happened to inflation? Inflation has \ncome down 5 years in a row. It now stands at 2.5 percent, and the \ncurrent Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board says the 2.5 percent may \nbe overstated by 1.5 percent. If that is the case, we have virtually no \ninflation in America.\n  In fact, we have one of the prominent economists in our country, who \nwas born out in my part of the country, Glendive, MT, born not so far \nfrom the North Dakota side I was on, Lester Thurow, who is an economist \nwhose views I value. He has written a chapter on the subject in a \nrecent book that I think is interesting. He talks about this interest \nrate policy and the decision by the Federal Reserve Board to\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\nfight a foe that Mr. Thurow says no longer exist.\n  ``Beliefs,'' Mr. Thurow says, ``change more slowly than reality. \nInflation is largely gone, but inflation fighting still dominates \ncentral bank policies.'' He says, every time the Chairman, \nAlan Greenspan, admitted that the Fed could not point to even a hint of \ninflation in the current numbers--he said, the Fed could not point to \ninflation because there was no inflation. The broadest measure of \ninflation, the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product \nfell from 2.2 percent in 1993 to 2.1 percent in 1994. In the third \nquarter of 1995, it was running at the rate of six-tenths of 1 percent.\n\n  If all these factors are put together that he described in this \nchapter, ``The real rate of inflation, outside of the health care \nsector, was undoubtedly very low, perhaps even negative during the \nentire period when Alan Greenspan was worried about inflation. \nGreenspan could not see any inflation in the indexes because there was \nno inflation to be seen.''\n  I have described my interest and concerns in the construct of money \npolicy. I hope we will have a Federal Reserve policy that at some point \nwould countenance an honest debate, and inside the Federal Reserve \nBoard, and perhaps come to a conclusion that we have twin economic \ngoals in this country--stable prices and full employment. Not one goal, \ntwin goals.\n  Let me turn just for a moment to the report that was issued by the \nGovernment Accounting Office, the ``Federal Reserve System, Current and \nFuture Challenges Require Systemwide Attention.'' This is the report \nthat the Senator from New York alluded to. I will make just a couple \nbrief observations about it.\n  It moves from the issue of my disagreement with monetary policy to a \ncouple of issues that relate to how the Fed now functions. The Senator \nfrom New York pointed out that the surplus that has been accrued down \nat the Federal Reserve Board is really kind of an innocent surplus.\n  It is at $3.7 billion surplus account accrued to meet the needs when \nthe Fed might have a loss. Of course, the Fed has not lost money in the \nlast 79 years, and the Fed in the next 79 years is not expected to lose \nmoney. When you are guaranteed by your operations to make money, you \nare not expected to lose it.\n  The point that we raised--the point I did not know; and I do not know \nwhether other Senators knew it--is that this surplus, this $3.7 billion \nthat has been squirreled away by the Federal Reserve Board, has \nincreased by over 70 percent between 1988 and 1994, at the very time \nthe Fed was telling everybody else, ``Tighten your belt.'' They say, \n``This little rainy day fund we have we want to increase by 79 \npercent.'' I say: Wait a second. You have not had a loss in 79 years. \nYou are suggesting that everyone tighten their belt. Why are you \nincreasing your surplus down at the Fed by over 70 percent?\n  That is something I hope that the Banking Committee will evaluate. I \ndid not bring the charts today because I presented them previously. I \nknow the Senator from Iowa is also presenting them. But the charts that \nshow the amount of expenditure at the Fed show that they are expending \nmore and more money on employee benefits, travel and other issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute by unanimous consent \nfrom Senator Harkin's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Just to conclude, I will not discuss it in any greater \ndetail. But this one-of-a-kind report, which took the GAO over 2 years \nto complete, shows that at a time when the Federal Reserve Board was \nsaying to everyone else, ``Tighten your belts, downsize,'' they were \nincreasing their expenditures rather substantially.\n  One would say, if this is the house on the hill that operates in \nsecret, with the shades drawn, you cannot see inside, and we finally \ndiscover what is going on inside, aside from monetary policy, and the \npractices inside are not in keeping with what they are counseling the \nrest of the Government, I think there is something wrong.\n  Again, I respectfully say in conclusion I am going to vote against \nMr. Greenspan. It is not personal. I admire him. I think their monetary \npolicy is wrong. I think there are very serious management practices \nthat need to be addressed. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I inquire of my distinguished friend \nand fellow New Yorker, is time being allocated?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I certainly yield time to the Senator \nfrom New York. I believe he would like to make some remarks in support \nof Mr. Greenspan. I am wondering if the managers on the other side--if \nwe could not agree to attempt to work out some system whereby we would \nyield the floor to each other. I would be happy to do that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether I could lean on the \nother side, and ask unanimous consent to follow the Senator from New \nYork, and we could alternate back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in emphatic and enthusiastic \nsupport for the nomination of the Honorable Alan Greenspan to a third \nterm as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem. He is a national treasure. He has served our Nation with \nprinciple and wisdom, and as I shall attempt to show in these brief \nremarks, unprecedented success.\n  Let me cite four principal reasons he should again be confirmed by \nthe Senate.\n  The economy is now in the 64th month of an expansion that shows no \nsigns of ending.\n  Unemployment for May was at 5.6 percent, and has been below 6 \npercent, which is roughly agreed to be full employment, for almost 2 \nyears.\n  Inflation is in check, measured by the Consumer Price Index, which \neconomists generally believe overstates inflation. Consumer prices have \nincreased by less than 3 percent per year for the past 4 years. That \ncould, in truth, be more like a 2 percent figure.\n  Finally, that renowned misery index, the sum of the unemployment rate \nand the inflation rate, is about 8 percent, the lowest level in a \nquarter century.\n  In the course of this debate about whether the economy could be \ngrowing faster, I believe it ought to be pointed out that 20 or 25 \nyears ago, the figures I have just cited would have been thought \nunattainable. It would not have been thought within the range of \npossible economic outcomes, much less economic management and planning, \nto produce this combination of 5-year, 6-year expansions, full \nemployment near zero inflation. This could be taught in a textbook as \nan ideal, and with the full and firm understanding that it would not in \nour lifetimes, perhaps in any lifetime, be achieved. You would measure \nyour performance by the distance between what was ideal and what, in \nfact, you could do. I do not think we understand--perhaps it is part of \nour historical distance--how much social learning has taken place in \nour country and to what consequence, an area which was thought to be \nabsolutely essential to our economic, socio-political well-being, which \nis employment.\n  I speak as someone who entered the Kennedy administration in 1961. I \nwas an Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy Planning. I know what \nour highest expectations were in those days. I say to you on this floor \nthey never would have contemplated what we have achieved in this last \n10 years or so of American policy.\n  Mr. President, on the front page of the Washington Post this morning \nthere is a story which may be the first such in the history of this \nNation. The headline says: ``Labor Shortages May Be Slowing Economy.'' \nReferring to the latest surveys of regional economic conditions by \nFederal Reserve Banks, the subheading states: ``Fed Finds Firms in Some \nRegions Having a Hard Time Filling Jobs.''\n  The article begins:\n\n       Signing bonuses are nothing new for basketball players and \n     Wall Street traders. But hamburger flippers?\n       Some fast-food restaurants in St. Louis are now paying as \n     much as $250 in signing bonuses for new hires, according to \n     the latest Federal Reserve survey of regional economic \n     conditions released yesterday.\n       Companies all over the country are going to extra lengths \n     to attract workers, the Fed\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\n     reports, in the latest sign that the pool of unemployed \n     workers has shrunk to the point that it is limiting economic \n     growth. Unemployment nationally has hovered around 5.5 \n     percent for the past 18 months and in more than half the \n     States this spring it is below 5 percent.\n\n  I interpolate, Mr. President, that in Madison, WI, it is now at 1.8 \npercent. I say that is statistically almost impossible, but that is a \nfact.\n\n       A Minneapolis company is offering a chance at free \n     vacations in Las Vegas for employees who recruit new hires. \n     Temporary employment agencies in Chicago say more employers \n     are snaring their workers for permanent positions. Banks in \n     Salt Lake City are having a hard time finding tellers.\n       According to the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, a \n     growing number of firms wanting to hire skilled workers have \n     stopped advertising because they got no responses. ``Perhaps \n     we should call them `discouraged employers,' one Minnesota \n     state official quipped.\n\n  Again, Mr. President, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, one of the \ncontinued concerns, a legitimate one, on the part of a person working \nin the field of labor statistics was something called hidden \nunemployment, which referred to workers who had given up looking for \nwork. By definition, you are not in the work force unless you are \nworking or looking for work. These discouraged workers had dropped out \nof the work force, but represented unemployment, even so.\n  Now, we have a phrase ``discouraged employers.'' I am not saying the \nworld has transformed itself, but I am saying in a lifetime in this \narea, this field, I have never heard the term ``discouraged employer'' \nbefore.\n  The article goes on to say that Minnesota is now one of the 10 States \nwith a jobless rate of 3.9 percent or less. In the Kennedy \nadministration, Mr. President, in the 3d year, the report of the \nCouncil on Economic Advisers made a bold and unprecedented assertion of \noptimism, in an optimistic age. They said, ``We call for a national \ngoal of an unemployment rate of 4 percent.'' It was not going to happen \nin our lifetimes, but that is what goals are for. Now here it is: more \nthan half the States are under 5 percent, and 10 States are under 4 \npercent.\n  According to the Minneapolis Fed, businesses are now looking more at \nwhether people will be available to work at a new plant, than at \nwhether the company can get incentives or tax breaks to build there.\n  Mr. President, a century and more of State governments, and local \ngovernments, offering tax abatements, cash incentives, to bring the \nfirms into their high unemployment areas and, suddenly we are told, \n``We do not need your tax abatements. Do you have any workers?''\n  I quote an official from Minneapolis: ``This parallels the dilemma \nthat eastern South Dakota has faced for some time. It is difficult to \nattract new industry when labor seems short.''\n  Mr. President, I simply want to say, sir, if I may repeat, that in a \nlifetime of involvement with these matters I have never read such data, \nor heard such comments. It is a wonderful play on usage--the idea of \ndiscouraged employers who cannot find workers. And so, is it \ninappropriate to attribute these outcomes, in significant measure, to \nthe wisdom and the practical knowledge with which Alan Greenspan has \nconducted his stewardship of our Nation's monetary policies over the \nlast 9 years? That is not to say--and he would certainly so insist--\nthat he is solely responsible for the performance of the economy in \nthis period.\n  Without wishing to introduce anything like a partisan note, I still \nsay that much credit is owing to the President, President Clinton, and \nthe 103rd Congress, which enacted a 5-year, $500 billion deficit \nreduction in the summer of 1993--$600 billion, if you include the \neffects of the decline in interest rates that came about in the \naftermath of the 1993 deficit reduction package.\n  Alan Greenspan himself has testified that there was an inflation \npremium on interest rates. With the anxiety--just a touch, but \nsufficient--of a country going into debt as fast as we would do, could \nit be that we would someday monetize the debt, which is to say, through \ninflation, wipe it out? Well, that costs you something in interest \nrates. When it appeared that we were going in a different and better \ndirection, interest rates came down--bringing additional deficit \nreduction, and all the advantages of lower interest rates across the \neconomy.\n  Not since the Kennedy-Johnson administrations, in which we had the \nlongest peacetime expansion of 106 months, have monetary and fiscal \npolicy been so well coordinated. We seem to have learned to manage \naffairs that were previously thought beyond our reach. Yet rather than \ncelebrating, some of us are complaining that we need to accelerate \neconomic growth. And no one can say that slightly faster growth will \nlead to higher inflation. Almost certainly, that has to be a concern. \nUltimately, if it should, there will be an end to the expansion. You \nwill lose more production in a downturn than ever you will have lost by \nnot speeding to the point where you produce a downturn.\n  Last week, the distinguished junior Senator from Iowa stated that ``* \n* * the bottomline is that Chairman Greenspan has this long history of \nfocusing solely on inflation to such an extent that all focus on \nexpanding our economy has been lost.'' My good friend added, ``We have \na mindset at the Fed that 2 percent growth is acceptable, that the \neconomy cannot grow any faster--maybe 2.5, but that is getting close to \nthe limits--but that we cannot have the 3 percent growth of the 1970's \nor the 4 percent growth of the 1960's. That is the mindset of the \nFed.'' Might I say that, in the judgment of this Senator--and it will \nbe for the Senate itself to make a collective judgment--the issue is \nnot whether 2.5 percent growth is acceptable, but rather, is any higher \nrate possible?\n  There are realities in the world of economics, and there are \nconstraints. Economists of every school, every range of opinion, will \nagree that growth and capacity or potential of the economy is \ndetermined by two basic factors: increases in productivity, output per \nworker hour; and growth in the labor force.\n  In the February 1996 Economic Report of the President, the Council of \nEconomic Advisers estimated that for the next several years, \nproductivity growth would be about 1.2 percent per year, and the labor \nforce would grow at about 1.1 percent. You put those two numbers \ntogether, and you have about a 2.3 percent possible economic growth for \nthe year.\n  Do not underestimate 2.3 percent, Mr. President. It means that your \ntotal economic product doubles every 30 years or so--an experience that \nis new to mankind. It may sound low, but if you keep it up, you double \nyour wealth every generation. That is what we are now doing. It is \nrecession, and worse, that puts an end to economic growth, if you think \nin terms of a generation.\n  The Senator from Iowa correctly noted last week that, in the 1960's, \nthe economy grew at 4 percent a year, and, indeed, it did. But, Mr. \nPresident, at that time, the labor force was increasing at 2 percent a \nyear, and productivity was rising at about 2 percent. So you have that \n4 percent potential.\n  That labor force increases at absolute constraint. We have reached \nabout the limit of labor force participation. It used to be a much \nlower rate than it is now, and the consequence of women entering the \nwork force in larger numbers has kept us going. But we are now at a \nvery small rate of increase. This is a demographic fact--who was born \n20 years ago? You cannot change it through manipulating interest rates \nor demand or supply. The supply is fixed. Yet, our performance in this \nsituation is extraordinary.\n  We are actually at full employment. We have a period of economic \ngrowth, now in its sixth year of sustained economic growth. We have \ndone so without any of the intrusive Federal Governmental measures that \nhave been associated with response to emergencies in the past.\n  I do not want to hold the floor longer than this. I have tried to \nmake two points, Mr. President. With Dr. Alan Greenspan as Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve, we have entered a period for which many persons \nmay properly claim a measure of responsibility, but for which he is \nuniquely held responsible.\n  We have entered a period of unprecedented growth--full employment, \nprice stability and year after year after year of growth. What more \nwould be asked? Can we not take some satisfaction in our performance as \na country, as a society? We have learned to do this.\n  We have reached the point, Mr. President, which as a sometime \nAssistant\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\nSecretary of Labor I certainly never thought we would see, and I do not \nthink anybody in Washington 35 years ago would have ever seen, where on \nthe front page of the Washington Post we learn that labor shortages may \nbe slowing the economy--not Alan Greenspan, but, rather, the \nextraordinary success of accumulated understandings and practices have \nbrought us to the point where there is a shortage of workers, an idea \nthat we would hardly have entertained. And that wonderful phrase --I \nsuppose you have to have been around the subject long enough to \nappreciate the irony--``discouraged employers.'' The idea that in \neastern North Dakota, as cited here and elsewhere around the country, \nemployers looking for new plant sites are no longer looking for tax \nbreaks and other incentives. They say, ``Are there enough workers for \nthe plant?\"\n  Well, can we not, in the midst of a Presidential election and a lot \nof distress on all sides, recognize what good fortune we have had as a \nnation and how much Alan Greenspan has contributed to that good \nfortune?\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me this extensive time. I thank my \nfriend, the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, for \nindulging me. I hope he feels I have not gone on too long. But I do \nsay, sir, I have gone on about an event that has never happened before \nand is worth noting.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that the article from the Washington \nPost be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Labor Shortages May Be Slowing Economy\n\n                           (By John M. Berry)\n\n       Signing bonuses are nothing new for basketball players and \n     Wall Street traders. But hamburger flippers?\n       Some fast-food restaurants in St. Louis are now paying as \n     much as $250 in signing bonuses for new hires, according to \n     the latest Federal Reserve survey of regional economic \n     conditions released yesterday.\n       Companies all over the country are going to extra lengths \n     to attract workers, the Fed reports, in the latest sign that \n     the pool of unemployed workers has shrunk to the point that \n     it is limiting economic growth. Unemployment nationally has \n     hovered around 5.5 percent for the past 18 months and in more \n     than half the states this spring it is below 5 percent.\n       A Minneapolis company is offering a chance at free \n     vacations in Las Vegas for employees who recruit new hires. \n     Temporary employment agencies in Chicago say more employers \n     are snaring their workers for permanent positions. Banks in \n     Salt Lake City are having a hard time finding tellers.\n       According to the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, a \n     growing number of firms wanting to hire skilled workers have \n     stopped advertising because they got no responses. ``Perhaps \n     we should call them `discouraged employers,' '' one Minnesota \n     state official quipped.\n       In Minnesota, one of 10 states with a jobless rate of 3.9 \n     percent or less, economic development officials say that \n     businesses are looking more at whether people will be \n     available to work at a new plant than at whether the \n     company can get incentives or tax breaks to build there, \n     according to the Minneapolis Fed. ``This parallels the \n     dilemma that eastern South Dakota has faced for some time: \n     It is difficult to attract new industry when labor seems \n     short,'' the report said.\n       Many Fed officials have expressed surprise that, with the \n     unemployment rate so low, there have not been more problems \n     on the inflation front, with wages rising to attract workers. \n     But the Fed's latest survey turned up only scattered \n     instances in which tight labor markets were causing wages \n     overall to increase rapidly.\n       Economists and government policy makers aren't exactly sure \n     why labor costs haven't begun to rise more rapidly in \n     response to the nation's low unemployment rate. Some analysts \n     say the best explanation is twofold: Heightened concern among \n     workers about job security in a world of corporate downsizing \n     has made them squeamish about asking for raises. That's \n     coupled with strong resistance by employers to raise overall \n     wages because they know that in a low-inflation economy, it \n     is difficult to raise prices to cover higher costs.\n       So even though some companies are having to increase their \n     offers of starting wages to get workers, in the aggregate, \n     pay hikes are still modest by historic standards.\n       And companies aren't going begging for workers everywhere \n     in the country. Indeed, in places such as the District, New \n     York and New Jersey, a southern tier of states stretching \n     from Mississippi west through Texas to New Mexico and most \n     important, California, finding workers isn't as tough as it \n     is elsewhere. Joblessness in California, whose recovery has \n     lagged that of the rest of the nation, is 7.5 percent. Only \n     West Virginia at 7.7 percent and the District at 8.4 percent \n     have higher rates.\n       To many economists, this is a picture of a nation \n     essentially at full employment. That means that going \n     forward, the economy can grow only as fast as its capacity to \n     produce goods and services grows.\n       How fast that growth can occur is the subject of much \n     debate these days. Indeed. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) delayed \n     the full Senate's vote to confirm Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan \n     to a third term until today so he could hold a public \n     discussion the subject. Harkin believes the economy could \n     grow much faster if Greenspan would only lower interest rates \n     and stop worrying so much about inflation. ``A turtle \n     makes progress only when it sticks its neck out, even \n     though that is when it is most vulnerable,'' Harkin said \n     in an interview. He said that the Fed cannot be sure the \n     jobless rate can't be pushed down to 5 percent or 4.5 \n     percent without making inflation worse.\n       Few people in official Washington agree with Harkin, \n     though. The Clinton administration, the Congressional Budget \n     Office and many private economists all peg the economy's \n     capacity to grow at a little above 2 percent.\n       According to White House economist Martin Baily, the \n     administration's estimate of 2.3 percent a year ``is based on \n     supply-side factors,'' meaning labor supply and productivity.\n       If the economy is at full employment, additional labor is \n     largely a matter of how fast the population is growing, \n     including immigrants. When the post-World War II baby boomers \n     were entering the work force in the 1960s and 1970s, labor \n     supply was increasing roughly 2 percent a year.\n       Now it is increasing only about 1 percent a year. All other \n     things equal, that difference means the economy's capacity to \n     grow is a full percentage point lower than it used to be.\n       And gains in productivity slowed sharply after 1973 for \n     reasons economists still can't explain fully. But over the \n     past year, output per hour worked at private nonfarm \n     businesses rose 1.3 percent, exactly the pace the \n     administration foresees for coming years.\n       At a recent conference on economic growth sponsored by the \n     Boston Federal Reserve Bank, Baily said that Fed policy \n     doesn't directly affect either of these determinants of \n     growth. ``I don't think monetary policy in the United States \n     is seen as a significant restraint on economic growth in the \n     next few years,'' Baily told the conference.\n       Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve \n     Bank, said in a recent interview that in his district, where \n     the average unemployment rate is not much above 4 percent, \n     business executives aren't complaining about Fed policy.\n       The complaint Hoenig hears most frequently, he said, is, \n     ``I can't get enough of the type of help I need. I have heard \n     no one say, I could grow faster if you lowered interest \n     rates.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I know my colleagues on the other side want to be \nrecognized, but I am going to make a request and ask that those who \nspeak on behalf of Mr. Greenspan--I think we have about 31 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask that they hold their remarks down to 5 minutes, if \nthey could. I would be deeply appreciative, because there are a number \nwho have indicated they would like to speak, and so we have a limited \nperiod of time. When we do yield on this side, I will yield for the \npurpose of recognizing those who would speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is to be recognized if that time is yielded by the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-six minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have about \n3 minutes to respond to the Senator from New York and that then the \nSenator from Minnesota be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the senior Senator from New York, Mr. \nMoynihan, talked that if you want growth, you have to have productivity \ngrowth and labor growth. He correctly pointed out that right now we \nhave 1.2 percent productivity growth and about 1.1 percent labor \ngrowth. That is about 2.3 percent growth per year and there is nothing \nyou can do about it. He correctly pointed out that in the 1960's, as I \nsaid last week, we had 4 percent growth, but then we had about 2 \npercent growth in the labor force and about a 2-percent growth in \nproductivity.\n\n[[Page S6563]]\n\n  Let me respond to my friend from New York by saying that is the \nchicken-and-egg argument. Is this something that we have to accept, \nthat productivity growth is only 1.2 percent? I know some have said \nthat is what it is going to be, but based on what? And labor growth of \n1.1 percent per year, based on what?\n  I would refer my friend to an article that appeared in the June 12 \nWall Street Journal talking about the million missing men, that there \nare studies now, they said, that when the Labor Department reported \nFriday a jobless rate of 5.6 percent and 7.4 million unemployed people, \nan additional 1 million were not included; many of them are sitting at \nhome too discouraged to hunt for a job. They can be found in all 50 \nStates. Actually, some economists, such as Lester Thurow at MIT, say \nthere may be far more than that out there in the labor force.\n  Therefore, there is a possibility, I would submit, that labor growth \ncan exceed 1.1 percent per year. That is, if we get off of this old \nidea the Fed has of NAIRU, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of \nunemployment, in which it is felt that if we reduce unemployment below \na certain level, which they first assumed to be 6, now they are saying \nmay be 5.5 percent, that somehow inflation will not just increase but \nwill accelerate. And, that premptive strikes are needed to block \nexcessive growth.\n  So I say to my friend from New York that I believe we can have a \nhigher rate of growth in the labor force because there are a lot of \npeople out there not even counted. There are a lot of people out there \nwho are underemployed. There are a lot of women out there who are \nunderemployed at minimum wage part time jobs who could be employed \nbetter. So I believe that the labor force can, indeed, grow much \nfaster.\n  Secondly, in terms of productivity growth, I do not accept that the \nAmerican work force has to be stuck at 1.2 percent productivity growth. \nI say that knowing full well we are still the leader in the world in \nproductivity. Our work force is still the leader. We have more output \nper hours worked than any other country in the world.\n\n  Does that mean we can just sit there and say that is OK? Productivity \nhas to do a lot with what is happening in that work force out there \nright now. There are a lot of workers out there now who have been \ndiscouraged because of downsizing. They are discouraged because of wage \nstagnation. I see it in my own family, my relatives, who are working at \nmanufacturing jobs. They are discouraged, and so their output could be \nbetter. Their output per hour worked could be more if in fact they \nthought their wages were going to go up, if they thought they were \ngoing to have a better stake in our economy. We can have more efficient \nmethods to produce goods by the way we structure companies and through \ntechnology.\n  I predict that the productivity growth in America could boom a lot \nmore than what it is. That yields then to more labor growth, more \nproductivity growth, which leads to higher growth in our economy. Those \ntwo things will not happen as long as the Federal Reserve continues to \nadhere to this NAIRU concept and as long as the Fed, every time growth \nstarts to go up, puts on the brakes.\n  I respect very much the insight of my friend from New York. My \npremise, and I believe the premise of those of us who are taking the \nopposite side, is that we can, indeed, grow faster in this country and \nwe can grow faster because we have an untapped labor source and our \nproductivity can, indeed, increase but if and only if the Federal \nReserve takes the brakes off and lowers the interest rates in this \ncountry.\n  I thank the Chair. I then yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I am going to actually pick up on \nsome points that have been made by my colleague from New York, for whom \nI have deep respect, and by my colleague from Iowa. First of all, let \nme thank Senator Harkin from Iowa for doing something very important as \na Senator. He has insisted that at least we have a debate about \neconomic policy, that we have a debate about monetary policy, that we \nnot just go forward and confirm someone to be Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board without any discussion or debate. I do not think this \ndebate is at all personal. I think each and every one of us has gone \nout of our way to say that we hold the Chairman in high personal \nregard. But this is a debate about economic policy. My colleague has \ntaken a lot of criticism for insisting that there be a debate. That is \nall he has ever asked for. I thank him for doing that. My colleague \nfrom North Dakota earlier made an important point, which is, it used to \nbe, back in the 1870's, 1880's, 1890's, and the early part of this \ncentury, that there was an important debate about monetary policy. It \nwas not conspiratorial, it was important, because people know that real \ninterest rates and monetary policy can make or break communities' \nlives. They can make or break families' lives. They have a huge impact, \na huge impact on small business people, a huge impact on farmers, a \nhuge impact on whether people can afford to buy a home, a huge impact \non whether or not people can afford to take out a loan for their son or \ntheir daughter to go on to higher education.\n\n  This is a fundamentally important debate we are having. It is not \nhate; it is debate. I think it is an extremely important question that \nmy colleague has been raising.\n  When I listen to this discussion, I have to smile, because I do think \nto a certain extent some of my colleagues, either by accident or by \ndesign, are being a bit ahistorical.\n  Let me also, teacher to teacher, professor to professor, respond to a \nlittle bit of what Senator Moynihan said. He never, of course, leaves \nout a historical analysis, and people in good faith can reach very \ndifferent conclusions, but I would like to go back to the 1946 \nEmployment Act in our country which called for the Federal Reserve \nBoard to be a part of this and to keep inflation down, but also with \nthe mandate of achieving maximum employment. That was an important \npiece of legislation.\n  There was a classic book written called ``Congress Makes a Law,'' by \nStephen K. Bailey, all about the Murray-Wagner Act that finally passed \nin 1946. Full employment, the idea that people should be able to find \nwork, decent wages under civilized working conditions, was the No. 1 \nissue for the country. The Depression was fresh in everybody's memory, \nand World War II, in fact, pumped up the economy, and people found it \nto be a pleasant experience to be able to work. Women were in the work \nforce. Men and women of color were also finding jobs. So after the war \nwas over, the No. 1 challenge for our country was, how do you have an \neconomy that generates jobs for people that are living-wage jobs? That \nis what it was all about.\n  I smile when I hear some of the analyses by some economists--not by \nall--that, as a matter of fact, what we have here is a situation of \nfull employment, because the unemployment rate is 5.6 percent. \nTherefore, we have full employment.\n  People in Minnesota and around the country have to just be scratching \ntheir heads and wondering what is going on here. Ten blocks from here, \nwhy do we not go out and ask people whether or not they think we have \nfull employment. Just ask them. This does not measure subemployment, it \ndoes not measure the 1 million discouraged workers, it does not measure \npeople who are working part time because they cannot work full time.\n  Do you know what else it does not measure? It does not measure all \nthe people who have jobs but not jobs they can count on. It does not \nmeasure all the working poor people, who work 52 weeks a year, 40-\nhours-plus a week, and still make only poverty-level wages.\n  So, when we hear all these macro figures about how we cannot afford \nto have unemployment below 5.5 percent, otherwise we will set off this \ninflationary cycle, this is the old ``Phillips curve'' argument. It has \nbeen discredited over and over again. It is not the experience in our \nown country. We have had no evidence that we are about to see a cycle \nof inflation.\n  What we have instead is a policy that works great for bondholders, \ngreat for Wall Street, but does not work well for families in our \ncountry. Every time we are about to have a real recovery and every time \nsmall businesses are about to have a break or every time farmers are \nabout to have a break or every time homeowners are about to have a \nbreak or every time some of the businesses in our country which are \ninterest-sensitive businesses are about to\n\n[[Page S6564]]\n\nhave a break and every time we are about to generate more jobs that \npeople can count on, we have this policy, which I think is outdated and \nwhich I think, in fact, helps some folks at the top but puts a squeeze \non the vast majority of people in this country. That is what this \ndebate is all about.\n\n  When we get to this policy of maintaining and insisting that 2 \npercent growth is all we can do as a Nation, that we have to always \ncool down the economy, that we have to have price stability, the \nquestion that needs to be asked on the floor of the Senate is the \nquestion people ask in cafes in our country: Who exactly is deciding? \nWho exactly is benefiting? And who is being asked to sacrifice? Who \ndecides that we can only afford economic growth of 2 percent a year? \nWho decides that interest rates will be kept at this high level and not \nreduced? And whose farm goes under the auctioneer's hammer? Who goes \nwithout a job? Who goes without a job that pays a decent wage? Who goes \nwithout a job working under civilized working conditions? Who is not \nable to pay for higher education for their children? That is what it is \nall about.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that this argument that we now have about \nfull employment--my God, just tour the cities. Go to Hartford. Go to \nMinneapolis. I heard statistics about my State. Yes, the official \nunemployment level is down, but that does not measure subemployment. I \nwill repeat that. Not the discouraged workers, not people who are part-\ntime workers, and not people who are working but working at jobs they \ncannot count on--that is what this is all about: living-wage jobs. I \ncan tell you that a much too significant percentage of the population \nall across this country, including Minnesota, is struggling to make \nends meet.\n  This effort to always cool the economy down, fight this bogeyman of \ninflation and insist on this stringent monetary policy has made it very \ndifficult for families to do well. That is what this debate is all \nabout.\n  My colleague from New York talked about the piece that he read today \nin the Washington Post about discouraged employers. It is interesting \nto hear about discouraged employers, but I suggest to colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, that is only one piece of the story. \nThat is true.\n  I meet with businesses owners in Minnesota who say the same thing. I \nmeet with small businesses owners and a good many of them say to me, \n``Paul, we are not worried about the minimum wage raise, but do you \nknow what? We are technology companies and we cannot find skilled \nworkers.''\n  That is true. That is one piece of it. But I also suggest to my \ncolleagues, it is only one small piece of it. The other piece has to do \nwith this effort to keep economic growth down, to argue we can only \nafford 2 percent a year growth in our economy, to constantly, \ntherefore, make this an economy where we have a recovery but a recovery \nwhere people are not able to find the jobs at decent wages.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a second?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague for making that point. Yes, there \nwas a story in the paper this morning about discouraged employers \ntrying to find certain specific people to work. There is another story \non the front page of the New York Times, also on the front page of the \nUSA Today: ``Income Disparity Between Poorest and Richest Rises. Trend \nin U.S. Confirmed. New Report by Census Bureau Shows Gap Is at Its \nWidest Since World War II.'' That is another part of this debate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Because any time you have high interest rates, think \nabout it as a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the richest \nclass. Because, after all, who borrows money? It is our working \nfamilies. They borrow money to buy a car, they borrow money to buy a \nhouse, they borrow money to send their kids to school, and when they \npay these exorbitantly high interest rates--and I will get to that in \nmy remarks later--that is a hidden tax on our working families.\n  So I say people ought to look at this and start asking questions \nabout our monetary policy and how that affects the disparity between \nthe rich and poor in our country.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for pointing that out.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague essentially made what was \nmy second point. One had to do with the Employment Act of 1946 and what \nis the mandate of the Federal Reserve Board and how this monetary \npolicy has, in fact, made it impossible for our country to achieve what \nshould be the No. 1 domestic priority, which is an economy that \nproduces jobs that people can count on, jobs at decent wages, living-\nwage jobs under civilized working conditions where men and women can \nsupport their families.\n\n  This is the tradeoff. Some people are very generous with other \npeople's suffering. It is great for bond holders, great for Wall \nStreet. It is not great for Main Street. It is not great for wage \nearners. It is not great for farmers. It is not great for small \nbusiness people. It is not great for homeowners. It is not great for \npeople trying to afford a higher education for their children. And the \nsecond point is precisely this: there is a rather significant \ncorrelation between the tight monetary policy and the lopsided economy \nwe have. That is what we have right now. We ought to be focusing on how \nwe can raise the standard of living of middle-class and working \nfamilies in our country.\n  I suggest to you one of the reasons we have not been able to do that, \none of the reasons that the bottom 60 percent has been standing still \nand even losing ground over the past 20 years-plus is because of this \nmonetary policy. It is time we debate it and, I must say, that I \nbelieve that this policy has been profoundly mistaken with very harsh \nconsequences for the vast majority of working people in this country.\n  Mortimer Zuckerman, in an editorial in U.S. News & World Report, \nwrote:\n\n       Alan Greenspan's ``dear money'' leadership has caused the \n     Fed to exert a monetary choke hold on one of the weakest \n     economic recoveries since World War II at the cost of \n     billions of dollars in lost output and tens of thousands of \n     uncreated jobs.\n\n  That is the point I was trying to make.\n  The renowned economist, James Galbraith, criticizes Greenspan this \nway:\n\n       He is pathologically adverse to full employment, \n     pathologically overanxious about inflation. His policies are \n     the reasons, for the most part, that unemployment has stayed \n     high and that wages have not raised in the past decade, and \n     he's determined to keep things that way.\n\n  Again, that is my point about this whole issue of good jobs and good \nwages.\n  Finally, Felix Rohatyn writes:\n\n       Every major American social and economic problem requires \n     stronger economic growth for its solution. This includes \n     improvements in public education, as well as increasing \n     private capital investment and savings, balancing the budget \n     and maintaining a social safety net, improving the economic \n     conditions in our big cities and reducing racial policies as \n     a result.\n\n  This, again, is tied in to the whole question of monetary policy. \nThomas Palley, of the New School for Social Research, writes:\n\n       Greenspan's ``soft landing'' has been perfect for Wall \n     Street, keeping the lid on wages while keeping consumer \n     demand strong enough to earn massive profits.\n\n  Mr. President, I think Felix Rohatyn is right on the mark. I maintain \nthat this debate is not about one person. This is a debate about \nmonetary policy that should be a front-burner issue in the United \nStates of America. This is policy that can make or break people's \nlives; that can make or break small businesses; can make or break \nfarmers, I say to my colleague from North Dakota; can make or break \nmiddle-class families; can make or break working people.\n  The key to decent jobs at decent wages, the key to investment in our \ncities, the key to economic opportunities, the key to improving the \nstandard of living for the vast majority of people in this country is a \ncombination of a number of different things. I suggest that one \ncritical piece is monetary policy.\n  I believe that Chairman Greenspan's policies have, again, been \nprofoundly mistaken and I think have had serious consequences for the \nvast majority of people in this country. I would rather stand for Main \nStreet interests, I would rather be on the side of small business \npeople, I would rather be on the side of working families, I would \nrather be on the side of middle-income Americans, I would rather be on \nthe\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\nside of growing this economy, I would rather be on the side of jobs \nwith decent wages, I would rather be on the side of economic fairness, \nI would rather be on the side of economic opportunity and, for those \nreasons, I will vote ``no.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I do not see the distinguished Senator from \nNew York, but I believe pursuant to an earlier agreement, I am to be \nrecognized after Senator Wellstone's remarks. I understand we are \noperating under a 5-minute constraint.\n  Mr. President, let me paraphrase, if I can. First of all, let me say \nto my colleague from Iowa, I, too, appreciate the fact he has raised \nthis issue. I think it is important we have a debate and certainly a \ndebate about monetary policy is not inappropriate at all.\n  I think we will be making a tragic mistake, I will say this morning, \nif we do not confirm the nomination of Alan Greenspan and, I will add, \nAlice Rivlin and Laurence Meyer as well. We all are very familiar with \nAlice Rivlin, since she's currently Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget. She was also the first Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office and is very well known to many Members. I \nthink she will do a wonderful job.\n  Laurence Meyer, a highly respected economist, I think will do a \nremarkably fine job as well.\n  I believe that the President has done an excellent job in selecting \nthese three nominees and he should be commended for presenting the \nSenate with such laudable choices for service on the Fed Board.\n  I will not disguise, Mr. President, the fact that I was a strong \nadvocate of Felix Rohatyn to be Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard. That nomination, unfortunately, did not get much of a hearing in \nthe Senate, despite the President's support for him. I thought Felix's \naddition to the Board would have created a wonderful debate--the kind \nof debate, in fact, we are having to some degree this morning--within \nthe Federal Reserve Board about growth.\n  The absence of Felix Rohatyn does not make that debate impossible, \nbut I felt his addition to the Board would have been healthy for the \ncountry to have a good discussion about how you achieve a higher growth \nrate without also fanning the flames of inflation.\n  Obviously, that did not occur. I have great respect for Felix \nRohatyn, and I believe he can still make a significant contribution. I \nurge my colleagues to follow his writings on growth and how we might \nachieve it. I point out, as he has said, and this is something with \nwhich I totally agree, that while monetary policy obviously has a lot \nto do with growth, tax policy also is a major element of our growth \nrates. Investing in the infrastructure of this country has a great deal \nto do with whether we achieve growth. And, clearly, education and \ntraining has a lot to do with whether or not we can grow properly. \nThere is not just one issue. Monetary policy is important, but there \nare other major elements that contribute to our ability to grow.\n  Let me just say, Mr. President, to those who are focusing on the \ninterest rate debate, and I certainly have been as critical as others \nwhen the interest rates have gone up. I did not think in several \ninstances it was warranted over the last several years. But it is \nundeniable as well that we have created more than 10 million new jobs \nover the last number of years in this country, an unprecedented growth \nrate in employment. We are witnessing the lowest misery index rate in \n28 years. That is a combination of inflation and unemployment.\n  I remember very well what it was like back in the late seventies--you \nwant to talk about a tax; inflation is a tremendous tax on people--when \nit was 20 percent inflation rates. You talk about jobs and middle-\nincome people and homes, when you have staggering inflation rates, it \nis crippling to people.\n  I am a strong advocate that we can grow more than 2 or 2.5 percent. \nFrankly, if we just grow two-tenths of a percentage point more, we \nwould just about wipe out the deficit--two-tenths of a percentage point \nand we would just about wipe out the deficit.\n  But I am also very conscious of the fact that it is relatively easy \nfor me as a Member of Congress to be able to advocate that, but also \nunderstanding when I advocate certain monetary policies, there can be \ninflationary implications to it. So I have to be very aware of that as \nI make those decisions, if I am sitting on the Federal Reserve Board.\n  So while I get frustrated and I get angry from time to time, we set \nup a system in this country to insulate, if you will, the Federal \nReserve from the vagaries of day-to-day emotions of the country when it \ncomes to these policies. Rather than setting them on a daily basis \nwhere we could fluctuate back and forth, we provide some stability to \nit, so that there is an opportunity for these decisions to be able to \nwork themselves out and then determine the full, broad implications of \nthem.\n\n  So while I want to see us grow more--and I think there are things \nthat can be done, such as encouraging savings in the country and not \nrewarding debt--these stories we have over the last several days of the \nhighest rates of consumer debt in a number of years, I think they are \nprimarily due to the fact that we reward debt, we encourage it, we \nallow you to deduct it from your taxes. But if you save in this \ncountry, you do not get a reward at all.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to look at a proposal by Senator \nDomenici and Senator Nunn that would contribute toward a tax policy \nthat would contribute significantly toward our savings rate. As Senator \nMoynihan, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, pointed out, it \nis fiscal policy as well.\n  This is not a partisan policy. But the fact of the matter is, we have \nhad 3\\1/2\\ years of consecutive deficit reduction. It is the first time \nsince the Truman administration that has occurred. The size of the \nFederal work force is coming down. The Federal bureaucracy and the \nregulations are being reduced. As a result, that is contributing, I \nthink, to the reaction in the markets. That, plus monetary policy, have \ngiven us this period of tremendous stability, significant growth, and I \nthink creating new opportunities.\n  My State, I will tell you quickly, has not been one of those that has \nbenefited from all this in the short term. We are going through the \npains of the end of the cold war in a State that is dependent upon \ndefense contract work. We had a tremendous problem with real estate in \nthe Northeast in the mid-1980's. The recession and the credit crunch \ndealt us a significant blow.\n  So I know, just when you are talking about the States that have felt \nthe kind of recovery that is being talked about today, my State is not \none of them. Connecticut has not been one. We think that will change in \nthe coming years, as we begin to make the transition to an economy not \nbased as heavily as it has been on defense contract work.\n  But, nonetheless, I happen to believe that a steady, reliable hand \nhere makes some sense. So, Mr. President, while I think it is extremely \nimportant for us to have this debate and to discuss monetary policy, I, \nfor one, would like to see us do away with the geographical \nrequirements to serve on the Fed. I think the term of the Fed Chairman \nought to coincide with the Presidential term, something my colleague \nfrom Iowa has recommended over the years. Those are suggestions that I \nthink are worth debating and, hopefully, adopting here.\n  But on the fundamental question of whether Alan Greenspan has done a \ngood job at the Fed, despite my disagreements from time to time, I \nthink the strong bipartisan answer ought to be a strong, resounding \nyes. For those reasons, I will vote for confirmation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of \nAlan Greenspan to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. As you can \nsee, this appointment has strong bipartisan support. More than any \nother appointment that the President will make, this one must foster \nstability--in our markets, on Wall Street, and on Main Street. That is \nwhy the reappointment of Chairman Alan Greenspan is so important.\n  Mr. President, as my friend and colleague from Minnesota, Mr.\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\nWellstone, has just noted, stability on Wall Street has a lot to do \nwith stability on Main Street. Let me show you a chart that shows the \nstabilizing impact Chairman Greenspan has had on the markets. These are \nconventional mortgage interest rates, which are the rates working \nfamilies pay when they purchase a home. As you can see, rates were \ngyrating from high to low and back again when Chairman Greenspan took \noffice. Yet soon after becoming Chairman, these rates went from wild \nfluctuations to the smooth, lower mortgage interest rates we now have.\n\n  Let us next look at the inflation rate in consumer prices. Again, \ndirectly following the beginning of Chairman Greenspan's term you begin \nto see a lower, less fluctuating inflation rate and therefore lower, \nmore stable consumer prices. What could be more important to Main \nStreet than stable, low consumer prices and stable, low mortgage rates? \nThis is what affects our daily lives in America as much anything else.\n  Chairman Greenspan's term has shown us the value of low inflation \naccompanied by predictability and stability. We no longer have a gold \nstandard, but we do have something I would call ``The Greenspan \nStandard.'' That standard results in low inflation, low interest rates, \nstrong financial markets and, contrary to the arguments of his critics, \ncontinued low unemployment.\n  He is a proven, independent, steady hand at the helm. Everything we \nare speaking about today says one thing--a steady hand at the wheel. \nThat might be the most important thing we can ask from the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board.\n  Regardless of the President's policies, we should all agree that the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board must be independent. Regardless \nof political comings and goings in Washington, we need someone who will \nprotect one of the most important indicators of the economic strength \nof this country. That is the U.S. currency, and that is what Chairman \nGreenspan has done.\n  He has resisted pressures to pursue one policy or another for short-\nterm political gain. He has kept his eye on the financial horizon. He \ncontinues to speak out for a balanced budget. He is holding down \ninflation while preserving GDP growth. Everyone has confidence that he \ncan enhance the stability and predictability of the U.S. dollar.\n  Additionally, it is important for the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nto understand crisis management, to foresee economic troubles on the \nhorizon. We must have a Fed Chairman who can sense economic trouble \nbefore it happens and act decisively to keep problems from becoming \ndisasters.\n  That has been one of Alan Greenspan's most important responsibilities \nat the Fed. People sometimes joke about predicting the weather or \npredicting the economy because no one can do it perfectly. That is why \nwe need someone like Chairman Greenspan. Since there is no economic \ncrystal ball, his time-tested experience and expertise helps him \nappreciate the difference between short-term conditions and long-term \ntrends--and thus act accordingly.\n  If you look at his record, one of the most telling attributes of \n``The Greenspan Standard'' has been his ability to anticipate what \ncould have become major disasters but, because of his steady hand, did \nnot.\n  For instance, the stock market crash of 1987 did not lead to a \nrecession. That is a phenomenal achievement. It was because we had an \nexperienced, steady Fed Chairman. When that crash came, we could have \nbarreled into a recession. But he was there to cautiously and correctly \noversee our Nation's monetary policy.\n  What about the failures in the thrift industry in the late 1980's? \nThat could have led to the collapse of our entire banking system. But \nit did not, due in large part to the confidence our Nation had in Fed \nChairman Alan Greenspan. He is a proven crisis manager and has always \nbeen a steady hand at the wheel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will end by saying there is no other \nperson in America who has the confidence of elected officials and \neconomic experts, of Wall Street and Main Street, who can anticipate \nmonetary problems before they reach crisis stage. There is no one else \nwho can measure up to ``The Greenspan Standard.'' For these reasons, I \nurge the Senate's support. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-four minutes. The Senator from New York \nhas 23 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Iowa for \nthis time. I first want to commend the Senator from Iowa for triggering \nthis debate and initiating this discussion.\n  We have two elements that contribute to economic policy in this \ncountry: Fiscal policy, that is run by the Congress and the President \nof the United States, and monetary policy, that is governed by the \nFederal Reserve Board. It is this combination of fiscal and monetary \npolicy that determines the health of the U.S. economy.\n  Mr. President, when Alan Greenspan was first nominated and the first \nconfirmation vote was held on the floor of this Senate, I was one of \ntwo votes in opposition at that time. I was in opposition because I \nbelieved Mr. Greenspan's entire record reflected a view that he favored \na high interest rate policy.\n  Mr. President, this has nothing to do with personalities. I \npersonally admire Mr. Greenspan. I find him to be an engaging \nindividual and have enjoyed visiting with him, but I profoundly \ndisagree with his monetary policy of the United States.\n\n  His monetary views have been confirmed by his actions as head of the \nFederal Reserve Board. What could be more clear? In 1994 and 1995, he \nraised interest rates seven times in a row. Effectively doubling \ninterest rates during that period, or nearly doubling them. He did this \nbased on a threat of inflation.\n  Mr. President, he was fighting yesterday's war. He was fighting \nyesterday's battle. He did profound damage to the economy of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, there was no evidence of inflation in 1994 and 1995. \nAs Mr. Greenspan, time after time, led the Federal Reserve Board in a \nsequence of actions to raise interest rates and, as I say, nearly \ndoubled them.\n  What was this effect on the U.S. economy? The effect was to take the \ngrowth out of this economy, to take the job generation that was moving \nalong at a healthy level, and dramatically reduce it.\n  Mr. President, this was a profound mistake. History will record that \nMr. Greenspan was dead wrong--dead wrong. He is of the old, static \nview. The old, tired, view that if you do not raise interest rates as \njobs are starting to be created, inflation will be kicked off. The \nproblem with that view is the world economy has changed. It has \nprofoundly changed what policymakers in this country think ought to be \ndone.\n  Mr. President, what could be more clear--we have moved below 6 \npercent unemployment in this country. That level has traditionally been \nviewed as the level at which inflation would be triggered. There is no \ninflation. There was no inflation in 1994 and 1995 when Mr. Greenspan \nmoved to raise interest rates.\n  Look at the chart of the Senator from Iowa. It shows clearly, in \n1994, interest rates were 3 percent; 1995, they doubled to 6 percent. \nGoing back to that time, was there any evidence of inflation anywhere? \nI ask my colleagues, where was it? It was not at the wholesale level. \nIt was not at the retail level. It was not at the commodity level. \nThere was no evidence of inflation then, nor is there much evidence of \ninflation now.\n  The fact is, at the time Mr. Greenspan was taking these actions to \ndramatically raise interest rates to slow this economy, to kill the \njob-generating power of this economy, to put our workers in a place \nwhere they could start to see raises after 20 years of stagnation, Mr. \nGreenspan made a profound series of mistakes: raising rates, time after \ntime, killing the energy in this economy, and doing it on an old, tired \nnotion of an economic theory that no longer relates to reality.\n\n[[Page S6567]]\n\n  Mr. President, what could be more clear? There was no evidence of \ninflation. There was no evidence of inflation because the economy has \nchanged. The economy has profoundly changed. Now U.S. workers are not \njust competing against other U.S. workers; U.S. workers are competing \nagainst workers worldwide.\n  All one has to do is go to Indonesia and see people working for $1 a \nday and go to other parts of Asia and see people working for 50 cents a \nday to understand why we have seen no real increase in wages in this \ncountry for 20 years. Because the world economy has changed, American \nworkers and American businesses are no longer competing just against \nAmerican workers and other American businesses. They are competing on \nan international and global-reach basis.\n  As a result of that, reduced unemployment in this country does not \ntrigger off the kind of wage inflation one saw in the past. What could \nbe more clear? What could be more clear?\n  Mr. President, business leader after business leader has told us \ninflation is not present, has not been present, and that we ought not \nto pursue this high-interest-rate policy. Let me quote John Welch, \nchairman of General Electric:\n\n       We don't see a connection between the numbers out there and \n     what we feel in our business. There's absolutely no \n     inflation. There's no pricing power at all.\n  Mr. President, that is John Welch, Jr., chairman of General Electric.\n  Dana Mead, chief executive of Tenneco Inc.:\n\n       I believe very strongly that the Fed should be leaning more \n     toward growth and not be so concerned with the threat of \n     inflation.\n\n  Felix Rohatyn said:\n\n       There was a time when 2.8 percent would have been \n     considered a modest rate of growth; today, it is considered \n     dangerously robust. Most corporate leaders don't agree with \n     this notion of dragging the anchor just as soon as the \n     economy has wind behind it. They understand how we can \n     sustain high growth based on muscular productivity \n     improvements they are generating in their own businesses.\n\n  James Robinson, former CEO of American Express, said:\n\n       Inflation is not a threat in the United States. Nor is it \n     for the foreseeable future. It has been remarkably flat and \n     will remain so unless the Fed or the markets begin spurring \n     inflation with high interest rates. The old domestic \n     indicators, while perhaps important in gaging narrow trends, \n     no longer determine the broader inflation outlook.\n\n  Mr. President, what could be more clear? We are engaged in a new \nworld economy where as unemployment falls below 6 percent, it is no \nlonger a trigger for inflationary wage pressures. Why is that? It is \nbecause we are now engaged in global competition. Our workers are up \nagainst the workers in Mexico who are getting one-third as much. Our \nworkers are up against workers in Indonesia who are being paid $1 a \nday.\n  These are new realities. Mr. Greenspan has not adjusted to them. As a \nresult, he has kept interest rates far too high. He is killing economic \ngrowth. He is killing a chance for American workers to receive the \nincreases they so justly deserve. This is a flawed economic policy. It \nought to be stopped.\n  I voted against Mr. Greenspan. At that time, there were only two of \nus voting against his first confirmation. I will vote against him, \nagain, today. I dare say, there will be more than two votes against his \nnomination this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I inquire as to the amount of time \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 minutes, and the Senator \nfrom Iowa has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Faircloth.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Mr. \nGreenspan. I think his reappointment a Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard is one of the most important things we are going to be voting on \nin this session.\n  First, let me talk about Mr. Greenspan as an individual. He is a man \nof unquestioned integrity and honesty. I have come to know him well \nsince my election to the Senate in 1992. The Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board has an incredibly important job. For this reason, I think \nthat having someone with Mr. Greenspan's character and standing is \nvitally important.\n  Mr. Greenspan's tenure at the Fed since 1987 has been marked by a \ngreat stability in our economy. Since 1991, inflation has not been \nabove 3 percent. Since he was first appointed in 1987, only once has \ninflation exceeded 5 percent. This is an amazing record of reliability, \nand it is one the American people have benefited from greatly.\n  Do we really want to return to the days of 20 percent inflation and \n20 percent interest rates, when inflation was ravaging the savings of \nAmericans? I well remember the days, as I had several million dollars \nworth of automobiles on my floor plan that I was paying that 20 percent \non.\n  I have heard speeches today about the need to create jobs versus \ninflation. If you look at the front page of the Washington Post, it \nsays, ``Labor Shortages May Be Slowing Economy.''\n  We are talking about looking for jobs where they offer a bonus, an \nincentive to find someone to work in fast foods. Can you imagine? And \nthen they say that we still need people--people are looking for work, \nand we have unemployment. I can tell you that there is not much \nunemployment in this country today. Anybody that wants a job can find \none. Companies are giving bonuses for low-wage jobs.\n  What this article says is that we are close to full employment right \nnow. Given this reality, I really fail to see the argument that the \nFederal Reserve has endangered job growth to keep inflation low. This \narticle suggests that we have both, and I think they are absolutely \nright.\n  Mr. President, much of this debate has been about economic growth. \nThere seems to be a belief that someone somewhere has decided that we \nshould not have economic growth, or that it should be at a certain \nlevel. Growth in the United States is not artificially set. Our level \nof growth is determined by the policies we pursue here in Congress.\n  How much growth can we have when we have spent more than two decades \nwithout balancing the budget? How much growth can we have when we are \n$5 trillion in debt? How much growth can we have when we spend $230 \nbillion a year in interest payments? How much growth can we have when \n41 percent of all income taxes sent by our citizens to Washington is \nused to simply pay the interest on the debt?\n  If we want growth, we have to unleash the private sector. That is \nwhere growth is. But every time someone attempts to make money in this \ncountry, this society, we either regulate it or tax it. How can we \nachieve growth in this type of environment? The irony is that the \nFederal Reserve policies have served us well by maintaining a low \ninflation environment.\n  Can you imagine how much deeper in debt we might be if we did not \nhave low inflation, if we had to borrow money at 10 to 20 percent? Can \nyou imagine the cost to the Federal Government if cost-of-living \nadjustments had to be paid for runaway inflation? Would job growth \nsimulate revenue to the point to pay for the risk of inflation? I do \nnot see how if, as the Washington Post reports today, we have close to \nfull employment.\n  I think the issue is clear. We need price stability in the economy. \nThis is the kind of policy that we have had for the past several years, \nand that is why I think President Clinton chose to renominate Alan \nGreenspan. Even President Clinton, with whom I do not agree on most \nmatters, sees the wisdom of having him at the helm of the Federal \nReserve.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude that I am in strong support of \nChairman Greenspan and urge my colleagues to support him, also.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of \nAlan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.\n  As Fed Chairman, Mr. Greenspan has earned the respect of national and \ninternational business and financial communities. During his 8-year \ntenure, economic performance has been remarkable--consumers and \nbusinesses alike have benefitted from a lengthy period of stable, \npredictable prices. Interest rates have reached near historic lows, and \nmillions of Americans have realized their dream of purchasing a home.\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\n  Mr. President, I believe Mr. Greenspan's achievements deserve high \npraise. Let me just take a moment to highlight two basic, but major \naccomplishments: the economy has grown during 7 of the last 8 years, \nand both unemployment and inflation have declined.\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate that praise for Mr. Greenspan's \nrecord is not limited to persons on this side of the aisle. In \ntestimony before the Banking Committee, the President's Budget Director \nstated:\n\n       . . . at the moment, the economy, at last at the aggregate \n     level, is performing extremely well. Unemployment is lower \n     than many economists would have thought possible without \n     igniting inflation, yet inflation is not visibly accelerating \n     . . . The challenge now, both for monetary and fiscal policy, \n     is to keep up the good work and find the continuing set of \n     policies that will enable the U.S. economy to attain maximum \n     sustainable growth as we move into the 21st century.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude my remarks with a brief \ncommentary on economic growth.\n  I have listened to my colleagues argue that current economic growth \nrates pale in comparison to those in the 1950's and 1960's. The \nreality, however, is that the Fed cannot control long-term growth and \nemployment. In fact, slow population growth and limited productivity \nincreases, have played major roles in limiting economic growth to 2.5 \npercent--and we all know the Fed has almost no control over either of \nthese trends.\n  What the Fed does control is the amount of money in circulation and \nthe price of goods. The Fed can enhance economic growth by removing \ninflationary fears and encouraging investment. During sluggish economic \ntimes, the Fed can cut interest rates and spur investment and boost \neconomic activity. However, there are limits on how far the Fed can go. \nAt some point, unemployment will decline so much that wage and price \ninflation soar. I need only refer to my earlier comments on employment \nand growth as evidence of Mr. Greenspan's accomplishments in these \nareas.\n  Mr. President, as we all know hindsight is 20-20 vision, and a case \nmight be made that the Fed has erred in the direction of caution the \npast couple of years. But the errors have been slight and the impact \nsmall. The reality is that Mr. Greenspan has kept the economy on a \nsteady course through major national and international turmoil. In \nlight of his leadership, I strongly support the renomination of Alan \nGreenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and urge my \ncolleagues to join me.\n  Mr. President, again, I strongly support the renomination of Alan \nGreenspan to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the nomination of \nan outstanding Laurence Meyer, an outstanding Missourian, to serve on \nthe Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n  I believe the Federal Reserve, which is only one tool that affects \neconomic growth and inflation in this country, has done an outstanding \njob with the fiscal policy which has threatened to bring back inflation \nand stifle job growth. I think the record that has been established by \nMr. Greenspan is an outstanding one.\n\n\n                             laurence meyer\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today in support of a fellow Missourian, \nDr. Laurence Meyer, for his nomination to the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors. With more than 27 years experience in academics, consulting, \nand economic forecasting, Dr. Meyer is a leading figure in national \neconomic forecasting and development. I believe that his background in \nthe public, private and academic sectors make him uniquely qualified \nfor a position on the Federal Reserve Board.\n  In my home State of Missouri, Dr. Meyer has played a key role in the \ndevelopment and expansion of the economics department of Washington \nUniversity. As former university professor and department chairman, Dr. \nMeyer has been recognized repeatedly for his academic achievements by \nstudents and faculty alike. Fellow economists similarly appreciate his \nexpertise, having twice granted him the prestigious Annual Forecast \nAward for being the most accurate forecaster on the panel for the Blue \nChip Economic Indicators.\n  Having served as an economist at the New York Fed and as a visiting \nscholar in the St. Louis division, Dr. Meyer also brings a personal, \nin-depth understanding of the unique role and purpose of the Federal \nReserve Board.\n  As an adviser to each of the last three Presidents, Dr. Meyer has \ndemonstrated an ability that is truly rare in Washington--the capacity \nto rise above partisan politics. Even today, Dr. Meyer counts among his \nclients the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the office of \nOMB, and the Departments of Treasury and Commerce. To balance his \nperspective, Dr. Meyer also advises our House colleague and Budget \nCommittee Chairman John Kasich on budget-related issues.\n  Finally, Dr. Meyer also represents the entrepreneurial spirit in all \nAmericans. Almost 15 years ago, this university professor and two \nformer students invented the first macroeconomic model that could be \nprogrammed into a personal computer. Today, his business sells models \nand forecasts to major corporations and governmental agencies across \nthe Nation.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe Dr. Meyer's experience in \npublic, private and academic arenas will prove invaluable as we move \ninto the 21st century.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support his nomination.\n\n\n                              Alice Rivlin\n\n  The third nominee causes me a great deal of difficulty, because, as I \nsaid initially, I felt that Dr. Rivlin had good credentials and had \nbeen a good economist that worked at various posts. However, my \nexperiences over the last several months, as we worked on the budget in \nappropriations, have led me to have grave reservations.\n  We all know that the President submitted a budget that he says, under \nCBO scoring, reaches a balance in 2002. It does reach a balance in 2002 \nif it includes the automatic trigger--the cuts of 10 percent in 2001 \nand 18 percent in 2002--that they established.\n  Well, some say the budget the President submitted includes \nsignificant cuts even before that. I happen to chair the subcommittee \nthat handles the appropriations for the Veterans' Administration, EPA, \nNASA, and HUD. When Secretary Brown of the Veterans' Administration \ncame before me, I asked him about the budget that the President had \nsubmitted. This, Mr. President, is the budget that has been submitted \nby the President for the Veterans' Administration. You will note on the \nchart that, after going up nicely in 1997 during an election year, it \nfalls off precipitously, from over $17 billion to around $13 billion in \nthe year 2000. That is before any triggers occur. I asked the Secretary \nof the VA, who has complained bitterly about having his budget held \nflat, how he was going to live with those drastic draconian cuts. I was \nstunned when he told me that he had been assured by the President and \nhis people that he did not need to worry about those cuts. In other \nwords, we did not have to worry, as we looked at the increases proposed \nfor this year, about what would happen when a quarter of the budget of \nthe Veterans' Administration would be cut out by the year 2000, and \nthey would not be able to build new hospitals and have new programs. \nHow were they going to do it? The Secretary of the VA told me he had \nbeen assured that they were not going to make those cuts. I was \ndumbfounded.\n\n  And then the head of NASA came before me, and I asked about the $3 \nbillion dollar-plus cut in NASA budget. He said he had been told not to \nplan on those cuts because he would not have to make them.\n  I got similar assurances from the Administrator of the EPA, Carol \nBrowner. She said, ``I have been assured that my agency is not going to \nbe cut.''\n  I went into another subcommittee and asked HHS Secretary Donna \nShalala how she would live with the cuts, and she outlined a whole list \nof programs that would not be cut.\n  Well, Mr. President, nobody would own up to the fact that there had \nto be cuts. When I presented this budget showing the Clinton budget \nfigures, a representative of the Office of Management and Budget was \nquoted in a newspaper, the St. Louis Post Dispatch, saying that I was \nmisrepresenting their budget. Misrepresenting their budget? Mr. \nPresident, these are the figures. These are the figures--unless the \nClinton administration has two sets of books. Under one set of books, \nthey would assure those of us who believe in the compelling need to \nbalance the\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\nbudget that they really are going to balance the budget. On the other \nhand, there is another set of books that apparently is shown to \ndepartment directors and the interest groups they serve, in which they \nassure them that there are going to be no cuts.\n  Which is it? I found this to be very troubling. The OMB is presenting \ntwo sets of books. This is a shameless charade. The President says that \nwe are going to balance the budget. Yet, he says, no, we are not going \nto make any cuts. We asked in a letter signed by my colleagues to Dr. \nRivlin whether they were going to follow the budget and make the cuts \nnecessary to balance the budget, or whether there was another set of \nbooks. The letter that she responded to us with says that we are going \nto work together and everything is going to come out all right, and we \nwill make the cuts.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed in Dr. Rivlin. She is willing \nto subvert her professional judgment in submitting a budget to the \npolitical directives of the White House to avoid any cuts. I regret to \nsay, and I am sorry to say, that I do not believe we can afford to have \nsomeone willing to subvert their professional judgment to political \ndirectives serving on the Federal Reserve Board. I must oppose her \nnomination.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nVirginia, Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of Mr. Greenspan \nwhom I have known for many, many years.\n  Today, particularly in this town, the word ``character'' is being \nreferred to very often. So I thought I would go to the Thesaurus, \nRoget's Thesaurus. I will quote from Webster's and Roget's Thesaurus.\n  Webster's, of course, says, ``Moral or ethical quality; qualities of \nhonesty; courage, or the like; integrity; reputation.'' And the \nThesaurus says, ``Probity, rectitude, upright, integrity, honesty, \nhonor, worthiness,'' and right on down.\n  I will put the rest of them in.\n  But I can tell you. I have known Alan Greenspan very, very well for a \nnumber of years. I cannot find any of the definitions relating to \n``character'' in any of the leading sources that conflict in any way \nwith this man's own character. He is a monument to the definition of \n``character.''\n  And I am privileged to vote to have him continue in the service of \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank Senator \nDaschle and Senator Lott for making sure that we had this time for \ndebate.\n  Some of my colleagues have said before--and I have said since this \nnomination came down to us in March--that what we wanted was some time \nto lay out the record and to debate monetary policy. I wish we did this \nmore often.\n  This is not a debate about personalities, or character. I have a \ngreat deal of respect for my friend from Virginia. It is not a debate \nabout character at all. I and others happen to think that Mr. \nGreenspan's performance at the Fed has left us wanting in this country; \nand that his guidance and direction of the Fed is taking us in a slow \ngrowth path that is robbing us of jobs and economic growth in this \ncountry. It has nothing do to do with character.\n  I just happen to think that Mr. Greenspan happens to be wrong. I and \nthose of us who are taking this position are not alone in that \nassessment.\n  I will read some quotes from a lot of people that believe that Mr. \nGreenspan basically has the wrong concept of what is happening \neconomically in America today.\n  So what is this debate really about? Is this a lot of economic terms? \nI have been guilty myself. I have thrown out ``NAIRU''; ``price \ndeflators''; and ``CBI's.'' And people's eyes tend to gloss over when \nwe talk about those things. Sometimes we have to get down to what this \ndebate is really about.\n  It is about working men and women; it is about small business; it is \nabout our farmers; it is about the middle class; it is about the impact \non their lives from a policy of high interest rates--a policy that says \nthat every time we have a spurt in growth the Fed raises its interest \nrates and slams on the brakes. This debate is about growth in our \neconomy.\n  There are those who look at the last several years of Mr. Greenspan's \nstewardship at the Fed and say, ``Well, we have had growth.'' Well, \nyes. We have. It has been comparatively about a C average. If we are \nhappy with a C average in America, fine. I am not. I believe we can do \na B, or an A in America. I believe our workers can be even more \nproductive. I believe technological changes that are rapidly coming on \nline are going to increase our productivity.\n  To say that we have reached some plateau of growth is like saying \nthat when the cavemen invented the wheel they said they did not need \nanything else. I am sure they probably thought at that time that they \ndid not need anything else. They had reached their limits.\n  We have heard it time and time again--that somehow we have reached \nour limits of growth in America. I do not buy that for a minute. And I \ndo not buy it--that we can only grow 2 or 2.5 percent when there are so \nmany indicators out there that we can grow at 3 or 3\\1/2\\ maybe as much \nas 4 percent for a sustained period of time, and not just 1 year.\n  You look at Mr. Greenspan compared with the years before him. We look \nat growth from 1959 to 1987 versus 1987-95. What do we find under Mr. \nGreenspan? We find that in the previous year before Mr. Greenspan real \nGDP averaged 3.4 percent growth. Under Mr. Greenspan it averaged only \n2.2 percent growth.\n  Income per capita averaged 2.5 percent growth prior to Mr. Greenspan; \nonly 1.2 percent under Mr. Greenspan.\n  Payroll and jobs: 2.4 percent prior to Mr. Greenspan; 1.7 percent \nunder Mr. Greenspan.\n  And, productivity: Prior to Mr. Greenspan, our productivity went up \nat an average rate of 2.3 percent per year; under Mr. Greenspan, it has \nonly been 1.1 percent.\n  So I guess, if you are happy with this kind of lackluster performance \nin our economy and what the Fed has been doing, I submit that you \nprobably ought to vote for Mr. Greenspan because that is the direction \nhe is guiding and directing our Federal Reserve policy. I do not think \nthat is acceptable for America. I believe we can do better than that. \nAnd it is monetary policy that is doing it. It has nothing to do with \nour vote here in the Senate or in the Congress. It has to do with what \nthe Fed is doing with interest rates.\n  Again, I would say that this is not a debate as some have said \nbetween high inflation and low growth, that somehow if we grow faster \nwe are going to have high inflation, and, therefore, we cannot have \nthat high growth because we want low inflation.\n  Mr. President, I refer my colleagues to chapter 9 of Lester Thurow's \nnew book called ``The Future of Capitalism.'' I am going to read \ncertain parts of it because I know that Mr. Thurow has done a very good \njob in pointing out that the ``beast of inflation'' has indeed been \nslain and that we are fighting old battles. As my friend from North \nDakota said, Mr. Greenspan is fighting a war that occurred back in the \n1970's but we keep dredging it up all the time.\n  Here is what Mr. Thurow had to say. He said:\n\n       In the 1970s and 1980s fighting inflation became the \n     central preoccupation of the industrial world. . . . The \n     factors that produced inflation in the 1970s and 1980s simply \n     disappeared, and structural changes have occurred to make the \n     economies of the 1990s much more inflation-proof than those \n     of the 1970s and 1980s. . . . But as is often the case, \n     beliefs change more slowly than reality. Inflation is gone \n     but inflation fighting still dominates central bank policies. \n     . . .\n       The problem can be seen in the activities of the American \n     Federal Reserve Board in 1994 and 1995. At the beginning of \n     1994 the Fed saw an economy so inflation-prone that even what \n     was by historical standards a slow recovery from the 1991-\n     1992 recession (2.4 percent growth in 1993; 3.5 percent in \n     1994) represented an overheated economy. Because of\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\n     this belief, seven times in twelve months, from early 1994 to \n     early 1995, the American Federal Reserve Board boosted short-\n     term interest rates.\n\n  How much? One-hundred percent. To this day, when I tell audiences \nthat the Fed increased interest rates under Mr. Greenspan by 100 \npercent in 1 year, they do not believe me. But this is the fact. Since \nFebruary 1994, Federal funds rate, 3 percent; February 1995, 6 percent. \nAnd what has happened since then? We have only come down three-quarters \nof a point, and we are still at this very high level.\n  I am quoting now from Mr. Thurow's article:\n\n       Yet every time, the Chairman, Alan Greenspan, admitted that \n     the Fed could not point to a hint of inflation in the current \n     numbers. The Fed could not point to inflation because there \n     was no inflation. The broadest measurement of inflation, the \n     implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product, fell \n     from 2.3 percent in 1993 to 2.1 percent in 1994. In the third \n     quarter of 1995 it was running at the rate of .6 percent.\n\n  Mr. Thurow goes on:\n\n       If all of these factors are put together, the real rate of \n     inflation outside of the health care sector was undoubtedly \n     very low, perhaps even negative, during the entire period \n     when Alan Greenspan was worrying about inflation. Greenspan \n     could not see any inflation in the indexes because there was \n     no inflation to be seen.\n       By raising interest rates in 1994, the Fed killed a weak \n     American recovery that had yet to include many Americans and \n     slowed a recovery that was barely visible in the rest of the \n     industrial world.\n\n  Well, Mr. Thurow I think laid it out very clearly. As he said:\n\n       The numbers that have increased the Treasury bond rates and \n     30-year fixed mortgages are not because of inflationary \n     expectations. They reflect an uncertainty and hence the risk \n     premiums that investors must demand to protect themselves \n     from a Federal Reserve Board prone to seeing inflation ghosts \n     where they don't exist.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article by Mr. \nThurow be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        The Future of Capitalism\n\n\n                     inflation: an extinct volcano\n\n       In the 1970s and 1980s, fighting inflation became the \n     central preoccupation of the industrial world. Wage and price \n     controls were tried in a number of countries, including the \n     United States, but empirically it seemed to be impossible to \n     control inflation without deliberately creating an \n     environment of slow growth and high unemployment. Inflation \n     was not conquered in this war. The factors that produced \n     inflation in the 1970s and 1980s simply disappeared, and \n     structural changes have occurred to make the economies of the \n     1990s much more inflation-proof than those of the 1970s and \n     1980s--just as the economies of the 1960s were much more \n     inflation-proof than those of the 1970s or 1980s.\n       But as is often the case, beliefs change more slowly than \n     reality. Inflation is gone but inflation fighting still \n     dominates central bank policies. They still believe that the \n     natural rate of unemployment--the rate of unemployment at \n     which inflation starts to accelerate--is so high that they \n     and the fiscal authorities must step on the monetary and \n     fiscal brakes long before tight labor markets can push wages \n     up.\n       The problem can be seen in the activities of the American \n     Federal Reserve Board in 1994 and 1995. At the beginning of \n     1994 the Fed saw an economy so inflation-prone that even what \n     was by historical standards a slow recovery from the 1991-92 \n     recession (2.4 percent growth in 1993; 3.5 percent in 1994) \n     represented an overheated economy. Because of this belief, \n     seven times in twelve months, from early 1994 to early 1995, \n     the American Federal Reserve Board boosted short-term \n     interest rates.\n       Yet every time, the chairman, Alan Greenspan, admitted that \n     the Fed could not point to even a hint of inflation in the \n     current numbers. The Fed could not point to inflation because \n     there was no inflation. The broadest measure of inflation, \n     the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic products, \n     fell from 2.2 percent in 1993 to 2.1 percent in 1994. In the \n     third quarter of 1995 it was running at the rate of 0.6 \n     percent.\n       Having fallen during the previous recession, the producer's \n     price index for finished consumer goods in December 1994 was \n     below where it had been in April 1993 and annual rates of \n     increase decelerated from 1.2 percent in 1993 to 0.6 percent \n     in 1994. In 1994 labor costs rose at the slowest rate since \n     records have been kept, and the core rate of inflation (the \n     rate of inflation leaving out volatile energy and food \n     prices) was the lowest rate recorded since 1965.\n       The OECD in its end-of-the-year 1994 report saw no \n     inflation ahead in the United States in 1995. Abroad in the \n     world's second biggest economy, Japan, wholesale prices were \n     8.5 percent below 1990 levels and were still falling in mid-\n     1995.\n       Officially, the rate of inflation in the consumer price \n     index (CPI) fell from 3.0 percent in 1993 to 2.6 percent in \n     1994, but Chairman Greenspan had himself testified to \n     Congress that the CPI exaggerated inflation by as much as 1.5 \n     percentage points, since it underestimates quality \n     improvements in goods (in computers, for example, it has \n     performance rising at only 7 percent per year) and since it \n     both has poor coverage and gives no credit at all for quality \n     improvements in services. It is clear that service inflation \n     is much smaller than reported.\n       An official government commission, the Boskin Commission, \n     has estimated an upward bias of between 1.0 and 2.4 \n     percentage points in the CPI. This is made up of 0.2 to 0.4 \n     percentage points of bias, because the official index fails \n     to keep up with consumers as they shift to cheaper products; \n     0.1 to 0.3 percentage points of bias, since the official \n     index fails to keep up with consumers as they shift to \n     cheaper stores; 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points of bias, because \n     the index underestimates quality improvements; 0.2 to 0.7 \n     percentage points of bias, since it lags behind in \n     introducing new products; and a formula bias of 0.3 to 0.4 \n     percentage points, due to the mishandling of products that \n     come into the index at temporarily low prices.\n       If one is willing to assume that the sectors where quality \n     improvements are hard to measure are in fact improving \n     quality at the same pace as those sectors where quality is \n     easy to measure (and it is hard to think of why they should \n     be radically worse performers), the over-measurement of \n     inflation may be closer to 3 percentage points.\n       In addition, health care inflation cannot be controlled \n     with higher interest rates and slower growth. To know what is \n     going on in that part of the economy that is potentially \n     controllable with higher interest rates, health care \n     inflation rates have to be subtracted from the totals. Since \n     health care accounts for 15 percent of GDP and health care \n     prices are rising at a 5 percent annual rate, mathematically \n     another 0.75 percentage points of inflation (almost one third \n     of 1994's total inflation) can be traced to health care. In \n     reality, more than this amount can be traced to health care, \n     since some of health care inflation gets built into the price \n     indexes more than once. If states raise sales taxes to cover \n     the costs of their health care programs, for example, health \n     inflation shows up once as increased costs for health care \n     and once as a sales tax increase in the consumer price index.\n       If all of these factors are put together, the real rate of \n     inflation outside of the health care sector was undoubtedly \n     very low, perhaps even negative, during the entire period \n     when Alan Greenspan was worrying about inflation. Greenspan \n     could not see any inflation in the indexes because there was \n     no inflation to be seen.\n       Nor were there any private inflationary expectations at the \n     beginning of 1994. None of the standard private economic \n     forecasting services were suggesting that inflation would \n     accelerate either. The first unexpected increase in interest \n     rates in 1994 imposed hundreds of millions of dollars of \n     losses on some of the world's most sophisticated investors \n     (George Soros, Citibank), who had been betting that interest \n     rates would fall or remain constant. If they had believed \n     that there was any inflation over the horizon, they would not \n     have placed those bets.\n       Theoretically, there is no reason why inflation should \n     adversely affect capitalistic growth. Capitalists are smart \n     enough not to suffer from money illusion. Negative effects \n     only appear when inflation gets so high that speculation and \n     inflation avoidance become more profitable than normal \n     business activities and that requires hyperinflation before \n     it occurs. Empirically, there is no evidence that modest \n     rates of inflation hurt growth. Looking at the experience of \n     over one hundred countries for a thirty-year period, a study \n     for the Bank of England found no negative effects on growth \n     for countries that averaged less than a 10 percent per year \n     inflation rate and only very small effects for countries that \n     averaged much more than 10 percent.\n       An argument can also be made that capitalism works best \n     with something on the order of a 2 percent per year rate of \n     inflation. Anything lower starts to create problems. If \n     prices are falling, one can make money by holding one'e money \n     in the proverbial mattress. To stimulate people to take the \n     default risk of lending requires a positive money interest \n     rate of 2 or 3 percent. As a result, if inflation is \n     negative, real interest rates must be high. Real interest \n     rates reached 13 percent in 1933 because prices were falling. \n     Real interest rates cannot be very low unless there is a \n     modest rate of inflation, and without low real interest \n     rates, investment cannot be high.\n       In a dynamic economy some real wages need to fall to induce \n     labor to move from sunset to sunrise industries. Real-wage \n     reductions are very difficult and disruptive if they have to \n     take the form of lower money wages. Labor rebels. But real-\n     wage reductions are much easier to accomplish if the employer \n     is simply giving wage increases smaller than the rate of \n     inflation. The real reductions can be blamed on the amorphous \n     system rather than on himself.\n       The same is true for prices. In any economy it is always \n     necessary to change relative prices. If inflation is very \n     low, that can only happen if many sectors experience falling \n     money prices, but capitalism doesn't work very well with \n     falling money prices. With falling prices there is an \n     incentive to postpone. Why buy or invest today when tomorrow \n     everything will be cheaper? In a\n\n[[Page S6571]]\n\n     world of deflation the pressure to act is sharply reduced. \n     Yet action is what causes economic growth. Zero is simply not \n     the right inflationary target in capitalistic societies \n     interested in growth.\n       When the Fed started raising interest rates in early 1994, \n     it stated that it had to have higher interest rates now to \n     stop inflation twelve to eighteen months into the future \n     because of the time lags in the economic system. Growth in \n     fact accelerated from 3.1 percent in 1993 to 4.1 percent in \n     1994 and was very close to what was expected at the beginning \n     of the year. By the end of the year neither had the economy \n     slowed down nor had the signs of inflation become more \n     visible than they had been twelve months earlier. By \n     September it was clear that 1994's inflation would be much \n     less than the low rates that were forecast at the beginning \n     of the year. The business press was proclaiming that ``the \n     inflationary `ogre' has been banished--maybe for good, \n     certainly for the foreseeable future.'' Nor was inflation \n     accelerating in 1995, even though monetary policies did not \n     bring about the expected slowdown in economic growth until \n     the second quarter of that year.\n       The Federal Reserve Board was chasing ghosts. Inflation was \n     dead but the Fed wasn't willing to admit it.\n       While the 1970s and the 1980s were inflationary decades, \n     the 1990s and the decades beyond are going to be very \n     different. Inflation died in the crash in asset values that \n     began in the mid-1980s with the collapse of the American \n     savings and loan industry. This was followed by a collapse in \n     property values that rolled around the world. A decade later \n     both purchase prices and rents were still far below their \n     previous peaks. The crash in the Taiwanese stock market was \n     followed by a crash in the Japanese stock market.\n       While capacity utilization rates were rising in the United \n     States during 1994, in a global economy it is world \n     unemployment and world capacity utilization rates that \n     count--not American rates by themselves. In 1994 the world \n     was awash in excess production capacity. The rest of the \n     industrial world was having a very slow recovery from the \n     earlier recession--at the end of 1994 Japanese growth was \n     strongly negative and European growth only marginally \n     positive.\n       As we have also seen in detail in the last chapter, \n     globally unemployment rates were at levels not seen since the \n     Great Depression. Labor shortages were not going to be \n     driving up wages for a long time to come.\n       U.S. measures of capacity and hence capacity utilization \n     are also out-of-date. They don't reflect the outsourcing that \n     has happened. Outsourcing means that effectively firms \n     increase their production capabilities without having to \n     invest themselves. But the capacity increases of their \n     supplies remain unmeasured, since the capacity indexes assume \n     that nothing has changed in the proportions of value added \n     contributed by component suppliers and original equipment \n     manufacturers (OEMs).\n       Investments in new information and computer technologies \n     have also made it possible to get more output out of the same \n     capital with fewer people. That is part of what downsizing is \n     all about, yet downsizing is not reflected in official \n     indexes of capacity.\n       The Fed also doesn't seem to understand that some important \n     structural changes have occurred that make it impossible for \n     inflation to arise from the grave. The addition of the \n     Communist world to the capitalist world and the effective \n     collapse of the OPEC oil cartel in the aftermath of the \n     Persian Gulf War means that a repetition of the energy, food, \n     or raw material shocks of the 1970s are simply impossible in \n     the 1990s. Oil prices are lower in real terms than they were \n     when the first OPEC oil shock happened in the early 1970s, \n     yet exploration and exports from the old Soviet Union have \n     barely begun and Iraq has yet to be brought back into world \n     oil markets.\n       The real-wage declines that began in the United States are \n     now spreading across the industrial world. The downsizing of \n     big firms with high wages and good fringe benefits continues \n     at an unrelenting pace. If anything, wage reductions are \n     going to be accelerating. The second world and the rest of \n     the third world will join the small parts of the third world \n     that were export oriented in the 1980s. Downward price and \n     wage pressures from these low-cost producers can only \n     accelerate. In 1994 unit labor costs declined by 2.9 percent \n     in manufacturing and rose by only 0.9 percent in nonfarm \n     businesses.\n       At the same time productivity growth is running at the \n     highest rates seen since the 1970s. In most of the 1970s and \n     1980s, service productivity was falling, but now it is \n     rising. Services just aren't going to provide an underlying \n     inflationary push as they did earlier. Wages down, \n     productivity up--that simply isn't the recipe for inflation.\n       All across America large firms are forging new supplier \n     arrangements such as those recently put in place at Chrysler. \n     The number of suppliers is dramatically reduced, suppliers \n     are guaranteed much larger sales, original equipment \n     manufacturers (OEMs) share information and technical \n     expertise with suppliers on design and manufacturing, but \n     suppliers in return commit to annual price reductions in the \n     components they supply to OEMs. The OEMs in turn pass some of \n     these reductions on to their customers to increase market \n     share.\n       The world is essentially back to the conditions of the \n     1960s, with much less inflationary-prone economies. Supply \n     elasticities were high then because of the recovery from \n     World War II and the economic integration forced by the cold \n     war. Now supply elasticities are high because of the \n     integration of the second world into the first world and the \n     decision of most of the third world to replace import \n     substitution with export-led growth.\n       Since World War II, American firms have typically held \n     prices constant, or even raised them, while distributing the \n     fruits of higher productivity in the form of higher wages or \n     higher profits. But under the pressure of international \n     competition, that system is rapidly eroding. In the 1990s \n     many more of those productivity gains are showing up as \n     falling prices and many less are showing up as rising \n     wages.\n       Knowing that governments have lost their ability to shorten \n     recessions also radically changes expectations. Producers \n     know that they cannot hold prices constant while waiting for \n     a quick recovery from cyclical downturns. The early 1990s \n     demonstrated that no government would come running to the \n     rescue with large fiscal and monetary packages designed to \n     stimulate demand during recessions. Instead, recessions will \n     be allowed to run their course and governments will simply \n     wait for a recovery. If downturns are sharper and longer, \n     business firms will have to reduce prices if they wish to \n     survive those downturns.\n       There are no ghosts in the attic. Inflation is not about to \n     rise from the dead.\n       By raising interest rates in 1994 the Fed killed a weak \n     American recovery that had yet to include many Americans and \n     slowed a recovery that was barely visible in the rest of the \n     industrial world. In just two and a half months after the Fed \n     initiated its actions, interest rates on thirty-year Treasury \n     bonds had risen 1.1 percentage points and those on thirty-\n     year fixed rate mortgages had risen 1.3 percentage points. \n     These rates did not soar because there was a sudden upward \n     adjustment in thirty-year inflationary expectations. These \n     numbers reflect the uncertainty, and hence the risk premiums, \n     that investors must demand to protect themselves from a \n     Federal Reserve Board prone to seeing inflation ghosts where \n     they don't exist.\n       If the battle against inflation is primary, central bankers \n     will be described as the most important economic players in \n     the game. Without it, they run rather unimportant \n     institutions. It is well to remember that in 1931 and 1932 as \n     the United States was plunging into the Great Depression, \n     economic advisers such as Secretary of the Treasury Andrew \n     Mellon were arguing that nothing could be done without \n     risking an outbreak of inflation--despite the fact that \n     prices had fallen 23 percent from 1929 to 1932 and would fall \n     another 4 percent in 1933. The fear of inflation was used as \n     a club to stop the actions that should have been taken. \n     Central banks are prone to see inflationary ghosts since they \n     love to be ghost busters. While no human has ever been hurt \n     by ghosts in real life, ghost busters have often created a \n     lot of real human havoc.\n       Since growth did not in fact slow down in the year in which \n     Alan Greenspan was raising interest rates, the question Why \n     worry? can be raised. The answer is of course that higher \n     interest rates often act like sticky brakes. The driver \n     pushes down on the brakes and initially nothing happens. So \n     she pushes harder. Suddenly the brakes grab and the car is \n     thrown off the road. And that is exactly what happened in the \n     second quarter of 1995. Growth effectively stopped.\n       If the economy's maximum noninflationary rate of growth is \n     2.5 percent (the Fed's announced target), surplus labor is \n     going to be pushing wages down. Even the manufacturers who \n     have to pay those wages think that a 3.5 percent growth rate \n     could be achieved without inflation.\n       Our societies tolerate high unemployment since only a \n     minority suffer from that unemployment. Most of the movers \n     and shakers in society know that they will not be affected. \n     Politically, high inflation is much more worrying to those in \n     or seeking office, since it seems to reduce everyone's \n     income. Economists can point out that every price increase \n     has to raise someone's income and that the balance between \n     gains and losses seems to indicate that very few are real-\n     income losers as long as inflation is less than 10 percent \n     per year, but all of that analysis is irrelevant. To the \n     voter it does not seem to be true. They merit wage increases \n     but are cheated by price increases.\n       The high unemployment necessary to fight inflation is one \n     of the factors leading to falling real wages for a large \n     majority of Americans, but this reality is too clouded by \n     other factors and too indirect to be seen as the cause. \n     Political power lies on the side of those who declare a holy \n     war against inflation. Yet those who do so are indirectly \n     advocating lower real wages for most Americans.\n       The inflationary volcano of the 1970s and 1980s is extinct, \n     but the mind-set produced by its eruptions lives on. As a \n     result, business firms in their planning have to \n     simultaneously plan for a world where there is no inflation, \n     but there will be periodic deliberate recessions designed to \n     fight imaginary inflations.\n       Labor will continue to live in a world where governments \n     talk about the need to restore real-wage growth but \n     deliberately create labor surpluses to push wages down. As a \n     result, no one should pay attention when they talk about \n     restoring a high-wage economy with growing real incomes. \n     Wages go up when there are labor shortages, not when there \n     are labor surpluses.\n\n[[Page S6572]]\n\n       Officially, central banks always hold out the prospect that \n     if they just hold down inflation long enough, they will gain \n     anti-inflation ``credibility'' with the financial markets and \n     rapid noninflationary growth will resume. but it doesn't \n     work. If the German Bundesbank does not by now have \n     ``credibility'' as an inflation fighter no central bank will \n     ever get this mythical status. Despite its anti-inflation \n     credibility West Germany has had a very slow growth rate--2.3 \n     percent per year from 1981 to 1994. Rapid growth never \n     resumes.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. So, yes, there is a lot of complicated economic terms, \nstatistics, and charts that we can put up here. Let us not get lost in \nthese complexities. We are talking about simple fundamental things--\nreal people, families trying to make a payment on their house, trying \nto buy a new car, trying to work with their bank to get the funds to \nput in next year's crops for our farmers, or to operate a small \nbusiness. We are talking about creating more and better jobs in \nAmerica, about growing our economy faster, about raising wages.\n  That is what this debate is about. After all, Mr. President, raising \nthe living standards and real wages of ordinary Americans should be our \nNo. 1 economic challenge, but time and again the policy of the Federal \nReserve under Mr. Greenspan has stood in the way. That should not be.\n  Under current law, the Federal Reserve is obligated to conduct a \nbalanced monetary policy to reconcile reasonable price stability with \nfull employment and strong economic growth and production. But under \nthe Greenspan Fed that balance has been lost.\n  In 1978, we passed the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which mandated that the \nFederal Reserve take into account employment, full employment, and \nproduction along with inflation in setting its policies. I see my \nfriend from Florida is in the Chamber. He has introduced a bill on the \nSenate side, the Mack bill, that would remove that consideration from \nthe Federal Reserve, to consider full employment and production and \nleave the Fed only to consider inflation. I respect his opinions on \nthat, his judgment. We happen to disagree on that. I think the Fed \nought to have in its considerations a balanced approach--inflation, \nyes, but also full employment and production. I would point out that \nMr. Greenspan has come out in favor of the Mack bill, to take away from \nthe Federal Reserve requirements in law that we say they must take into \naccount, full employment and production, in their setting of monetary \npolicy. I think that is wrong. And for Mr. Greenspan to support that \npolicy indicates that he again has his eye only on inflation, the \n``ghost of inflation,'' as Mr. Thurow says, and not on a balanced \npolicy.\n  So what has happened? Middle-class Americans have paid the price. We \nhave seen what has happened with interest rates. And we have higher \ninterest rates. Let me just say this very clearly, Mr. President. What \nwe have operating now in America on middle-class families is what I \ncall the Greenspan tax--yes, the Greenspan tax on American families. \nHigher interest rates are nothing more than a tax on hard-working \nmiddle-class families, farmers, and main street businesses.\n  One of my colleagues was in the Chamber last week and referred to \nhigh inflation as an unfair tax on working families. That is true. But \nhigh interest rates are also an unfair tax. We do not have any \ninflation out there, there is none of it on the horizon, and yet we \nhave inordinately high interest rates. The real threat and the real tax \ntoday on our middle class, our farmers, and our small businesses is \nunnecessarily high interest rates. So we need a Fed Chairman who looks \nat growth and jobs and wages and says we can do better, not saying, oh, \n2.2 percent is fine. We can grow much faster than that. And we do it \nwithout the threat of inflation. We live in a global economy, a time of \nunprecedented competition, rapid technological change. All of this \nmeans we can have fuller employment, higher productivity without \ninflation.\n  We seem to be living in a world that if we begin to do better and our \neconomy begins to grow, that is bad for America, the Fed slams on the \nbrakes, and we cannot grow any faster than that. It is seen as a bad \nthing. But faster growth and higher wages and more jobs and lower \ninterest rates should not be seen as obstacles. They should be sought \nout as our goals.\n  In short, we need a balanced policy based on raising economic growth, \nincreasing jobs, the long-cited continued vigilance against inflation. \nI do not believe we have gotten that under Mr. Greenspan, and we have \nseen that common thread throughout his entire record, that all through \nhis entire time Mr. Greenspan has focused on inflation.\n\n  Start with 1974. Mr. Greenspan was Chair of President Ford's Council \nof Economic Advisers. As I discussed in depth last week, in his zeal to \nfight inflation to cure the recession of 1974, Mr. Greenspan prescribed \nthe wrong medicine. Unemployment skyrocketed, and the recession got \neven worse.\n  This is how Jerry Terhorst, President Ford's press secretary, \nrecounted it:\n\n       To be blunt about it, the President has lost confidence in \n     the ability of his economic advisers to predict the economic \n     future. This fall, when he fashioned the anti-inflationary \n     package he presented Congress following the series of \n     economic summit meetings, Ford relied heavily on the \n     forecasts of his consultants, including Economic Council \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan. They assured him that rising prices \n     and production costs were the prime enemy of a healthy \n     America. He was advised that while a recession lurked \n     distantly on the horizon, it was not an imminent prospect \n     that would confront him immediately.\n\n  Well, what happened? The recession got worse, unemployment \nskyrocketed. In two months, the unemployment rate increased by 1.2 \npercent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 4 additional minutes.\n  Greenspan's prognosis of the Nation's economic ills in the 1970's did \nnot comport with what happened, the same way in the 1980's. And I \nsubmit for the Record an article that appeared in Investors Business \nDaily called ``Greenspan's Rotten Record.''\n  Let us take a look again at what happened to growth during the period \nof time of former Chairman Volcker. We see growth of 6, 3.3, 4.4. \ncoming out of the recession in the early 1980's. Now, Mr. Volcker had a \n2.5 percent growth rate average, but he had a 13 percent inflation rate \nfacing him when he came in. He brought inflation down in half and yet \nhe had still had a 2.5 percent growth during his term even while he \nbrought inflation down in half.\n  Mr. Greenspan comes in. The real growth during his period of time has \nbeen 2.2 percent. Inflation was only 4.1 percent when he came in. It \nhas come down to 3.2 percent--a very small decrease in inflation and \nyet very low growth. That is what we are talking about, the low growth \nrate. And again, it has to do with Mr. Greenspan's rationale, what his \nmindset is.\n  Last year, I believe it came out, perhaps in an unguarded moment. I \ndo not know. I will read from the hearing record so the record is \nstraight. I have told people before that Mr. Greenspan was in favor of \ngoing back on the gold standard and people tell me that is not right. \nWell, I do not know if it is right or not. I can only take Mr. \nGreenspan at his own words.\n  Last year, 1 year ago, not 20 years ago, last year, Senator Sarbanes \nsays:\n\n       All right. Now, my next question is, is it your intention \n     that the report of this hearing should be that Greenspan \n     recommends a return to the gold standard?\n       Mr. Greenspan. I've been recommending that for years. \n     There's nothing new about that.\n       Senator Sarbanes. Okay. So, you'd like that. You want to \n     reaffirm that position.\n       Mr. Greenspan. I have always held that system of price \n     stability, which would come from any form of credible type of \n     non-inflationary environment, would be very beneficial to \n     financial system.\n       Senator Sarbanes. And you think we should go on to the gold \n     standard.\n       Mr. Greenspan. I, personally, would prefer it. That would \n     probably mean that there is one vote in FOMC for that, but it \n     is mine.\n\n  Again, Mr. Greenspan would like to go back on the gold standard. I \nwould like to see how many people would stand here on the Senate floor \nand defend this and say we ought to go back to the gold standard. Maybe \na few. But that is where Mr. Greenspan is coming from.\n  Last, Mr. President, it is not just me and a few others on our side. \nI ask unanimous consent a series of quotes from business leaders on Fed \npolicy be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6573]]\n\n            Quotes From Business Leaders on the Fed Policies\n\n       ``We don't see a connection between the numbers out there \n     and what we feel in our business.

I don't know \n     if the rate of growth we could sustain without inflation is \n     3%, 3.5% or 4%, but I think we need to see if we can grow the \n     economy at a reasonable fashion.''--Tracy O'Rourke (male), \n     CEO of Varian Associates.\n       ``This is the most disappointing recovery we have ever seen \n     . . .

Mr. President, I rise today to support confirmation of \nAlan Greenspan's nomination to serve another term as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors. Although I have not always been \ncompletely agreeable with his policies, I think that, generally, he has \nstruck the proper balance in monetary policy in order to stabilize \nprices and encourage growth short-term growth. In fact, combined with \nthe President's deficit reduction program, Chairman Greenspan's \npolicies helped the Nation out of its last recession.\n  When we consider this nomination, we must realize that the most \nrelevant indicator of Chairman Greenspan's accomplishment is the \nsuccess of the economy. Because of the number of factors and variables \ninvolved in economic theory, we can stand and debate individual \narguments almost endlessly. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the \neconomy has exploded, while inflation has stabilized at its lowest rate \nin more than a decade. In fact, the combined unemployment and inflation \nrate is lower than it has been since 1968. This did not occur without \nleadership, and Chairman Greenspan and President Clinton deserve our \napplause.\n  One of the reasons for economic improvement is the recent deficit \nreduction package. The deficit is an issue I have taken very seriously \nover the years. When I came to the U.S. Senate, the first bill I \nintroduced was a constitutional balanced budget amendment, and I have \nsupported it ever since. Indeed, I believe that addressing the deficit, \nand other fiscal problems, is the only way to cure the Nation's economy \nin the long term.\n  Although I had reservations, and frankly I believe we can and should \ndo more in the area of deficit reduction, I supported the President's \n1993 budget package. This measure is among the most important fiscal \nsteps the Congress has taken in the past decade. In fact, to use \nChairman Greenspan's words, this reduction was: ``An unquestioned \nfactor in contributing to the improvement in economic activity that \noccurred thereafter.''\n  This improvement resulted in the creation of 9.7 million new jobs, \nthe vast majority of which are in the private sector. The last few \nyears have seen more construction job growth than any period since the \nearly fifties, and more auto job growth than any period since the early \nsixties. Further, the unemployment rate has dropped to 5.6 percent--far \nless than the rate during the early eighties. It is a testament to the \nimportance of a declining annual deficit and movement toward a balanced \nbudget.\n  However, due to the complexity of our economy, I do not believe that \nthe President's deficit reduction alone caused all of these \nimprovements. According to prevailing economic theory, monetary policy \nis a more potent factor in the short-term growth of employment and \ngross domestic product than fiscal policy. Therefore Alan Greenspan \ndoes deserve a certain amount of recognition for his recession \npolicies. Maybe it is a credit to Chairman Greenspan, however, that he \nhas shown restraint; he has not failed to appreciate the consequences \nof easing his monetary policy.\n  When the Federal Reserve Board decides to embrace an expansive \npolicy, the economy will grow for a while. However, a greater supply of \nmoney leads to a lesser demand, or inflation. In the long term, \nimprovements are countered by higher costs and prices, and the economy \nwill again equalize at a reduced level, with higher inflation. In this \nway, the end result is a negation of the apparent gain. Therefore,\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\nmonetary policy must strike the proper balance between expansion and \ntightening. I think Alan Greenspan has always appreciated the \nimportance of this fundamental concept, and he has acted cautiously to \nenact such a balance.\n  When the country fell into a recession in 1990, Chairman Greenspan \nengineered a response to the crisis by initiating a series of interest \nrate cuts from late 1990 to late 1991, keeping rates low through 1993. \nUnder his direction, the Fed cut the discount rate in half; this was \nthe lowest rate since 1962. In fact, real short-term interest rates \nwere near zero.\n  Chairman Greenspan said these reductions were necessary to spur \neconomic growth, and growth did follow. His judgment has thus far been \nsound.\n  However, Mr. Greenspan rightly believes that the Federal Reserve's \nmost important goal is price stability. It is perhaps this fact which \nhas most fueled his critics.\n  The harshest criticism Chairman Greenspan has endured came in 1994, \nwhen he raised interest rates seven times. Politicians and financial \nmarkets concerned about continuing growth argued that Greenspan was an \nalarmist. Critics maintained that the boon had been insufficient to \ncause any serious inflation.\n  Even if we disagree, I think we must admit that his precautions have \nproved reasonable. Although economic growth has slowed, Chairman \nGreenspan has managed to stabilize inflation at its lowest rate in more \nthan a decade. He has also lowered interest rates again to adjust for \nthis slowed economic growth.\n  I would like to add that I do understand some of my colleagues \nreservations about Greenspan's tight monetary policy. High interest \nrates have been a difficult obstacle to many Americans--individuals and \nbusinesses. In fact, they are closely tied to the Nation's housing \nmarkets. They therefore affect homeowners, and they can damage \nfinancial institutions, particularly savings and loans. They have \nseverely hurt such large businesses as Chrysler and Lockheed, and \nnotably, they can have a terrible effect on small entrepreneurs, \nespecially farmers, for whom I have a particular concern.\n  However, I think it is always important to keep things in \npersecutive.\n  We might understand Mr. Greenspan's record better if we consider his \npredecessor's efforts to reduce a staggering inflation during the early \n1980's. Success came after the imposition of a seriously unpopular, \ntight monetary policy--a policy which concerned me greatly.\n  When Paul Volcker took control of the Board in 1979, he convinced the \nFederal Open Market Committee to emphasize control of the money \nsupply's growth, and to pay less attention to interest rates. Although \nhe was ultimately successful in bringing down inflation, his policy, in \npart, caused interest rates to pass 20 percent in 1981. That was quite \na cost. It hurt homeowners and businesses across the country.\n  In fact, I became particularly concerned about the effects of these \nrates of farmers, many of whom were devastated by the overhead of high-\ninterest loans. I fought to reschedule farm loans especially to \nameliorate the pains suffered by small, family farmers.\n  But at the time, I said that the Fed should not be condemned in its \npolicy, it should be assisted by administration and Congress alike in \nseeking equitable remedies to fighting inflation. Inflationary controls \nare, after all, the Fed's most important concern. Instead of \nreactivity, I believed the Congress had to emphasize tax incentives, \nand most important, work to balance its budget.\n  This idea has not changed in 15 years, I still believe that we must \nnot be reactive. We must also remember Chairman Greenspan's tenture has \nbeen much less intense than Volcker's. Rather than raging total war on \ninflation, he has only had to act preventatively. The country is doing \nwell, and we should not condemn the Fed--nor the man--now as we should \nnot have condemned them then.\n  Instead, the Congress must work to resolve its own fiscal dilemmas. \nAs I have always believed, we, and those who follow, must work toward \nan enactment of sound policies that include, perhaps foremost, spending \nwithin our limits.\n  Further, it absolutely should be considered that, although it is \nindependent of the Congress and the President, Greenspan does not \ndictate absolutely over the Fed. Instead, he must achieve a consensus \nat the Federal Open Market Committee votes. In this regard, he has been \ncalled a genius; almost every vote during his chairmanship has been \nunanimous. Apparently Greenspan's colleagues also consider his judgment \nsound.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we should recognize Chairman \nGreenspan's successes and acknowledge that he has done some good things \nfor the American economy. His efforts contributed to an enormous \nrecovery, and he kept inflation down during the rebound, as it his most \nimportant goal.\n  Much to his credit, I think President Clinton recognizes Chairman \nGreenspan's qualities, and I think he had some good reasons to nominate \nhim to another term. Perhaps the President's wisdom has once again led \nhim to understand that moderation is the route to sound policy. He did \nnot shy away from selecting a man lauded by Presidents Bush and Reagan \nwhen he believed it was the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senate should concur with President \nClinton's finding that Chairman Greenspan has done a good job and \nconfirm his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to first say that few here have \nmore of my respect and friendship than the distinguished Senator from \nIowa. We rarely disagree. When we do, sometimes it is a fairly forceful \ndisagreement. This is not in any way to challenge some of the \nobservations that the Senator from Iowa has made about growth. I \nbelieve that more growth would be advisable, would be very helpful \nright now. But I support the nomination of Alan Greenspan to be \nChairman of the Federal Reserve in his next term because I think what \nwe have is pretty darned good when you look at the results, and we see \nindications of it every day, about how good this economy is relative to \nwhere we might have been in terms of measuring the economic growth and \ninflation at the same time.\n  Inflation is under control. It does not take much, in this former \nbusinessman's view, to trigger off a round of inflationary growth that \nwe would not like to see in this country of ours.\n  When I see in today's papers, the Washington Post: Labor shortage may \nbe slowing economy, not enough people applying for jobs, bonuses being \noffered to get people to apply for jobs. It does not say that we are \noverburdened by unemployment.\n  Any unemployment is terrible in a society. But when you compare what \nis happening in the United States to, now, the European market, we are \nalmost less than half of where they are. And inflation is very \ncarefully controlled.\n  Look at the response of what I may say are the knowledgeables, the \nstock markets. The market keeps growing. Investors think there is value \nthere yet to be realized. We have a very comfortable view, in terms of \nmortgages, in terms of money. If there is a shortage, it is because \nmuch of the money supply that is out there is being absorbed by Federal \ndebt, and we are all determined to work to reduce that.\n  But I know Alan Greenspan on a personal basis, which has little to \ndo, frankly, with whether or not I would recommend him, except to say I \nknow him well. He served on the board of my company, ADP, until he came \nto his position as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. I used to \nhear Alan Greenspan's opinions about things. We had other very \ndistinguished business people on our board--by the way, Republicans \nmore than Democrats; that is just a coincidence; I wanted it the other \nway, but it did not work that way--distinguished business people who \nwould listen carefully to Alan Greenspan's views on things, to his \nanalysis.\n  My ex-company--I hate to say that--my company sold the Greenspan \ndatabase. We used to deliver it. I was in\n\n[[Page S6575]]\n\nthe computer business, and we would deliver that database throughout \nthe country. It was such a desirable piece of information that company \nafter company, institution after institution would be there, ready to \nbuy the services.\n  The fact of the matter is, Alan Greenspan, by all measures on the \nrecord, has done a distinguished job as Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nSystem. He deserves to be continued.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I support the nomination of Alan \nGreenspan to serve his third term as Chairman, and of Alice Rivlin to \nserve her first term as Vice Chairman, of the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors.\n  In fact, it is hard to meet Alan Greenspan without being impressed \nwith him. He is a very serious man who takes his work seriously, and \nwho understands the critical importance of the office he holds.\n  Alan Greenspan has ably served our country as Chairman of the Fed \nsince 1987. And in that time he has compiled a record that, by recent \nhistorical standards, is impressive.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I have known Alan Greenspan for many years, \nand have always had a tremendous amount of respect for him. Before I \ncame to the Senate, I ran a data processing company known as ADP. Alan \nGreenspan was on our board of directors. And it was in that capacity \nthat I came to appreciate his intellect, his extensive knowledge of \nbusiness and economics, and his integrity. Inflation today is at 2.9 \npercent. Unemployment is at 5.6 percent. Not long ago, many respected \neconomists would have scoffed at the likelihood that both these figures \ncould be held down to these levels. Many assumed that unemployment and \ninflation fluctuated in an inverse relationship. Yet that has not been \ntrue in recent years, and Alan Greenspan probably deserves some credit \nfor that.\n  Mr. President, steering monetary policy is an extremely difficult job \nthat involves a delicate balancing of competing economic \nconsiderations. I cannot stand here and say that Chairman Greenspan has \nnever made a mistake. And I understand the views of some of my \ncolleagues that the Federal Reserve ought to adopt a looser, more \naggressive monetary policy.\n  But when you compare the economy's performance with the expectations \nof the pre-Greenspan era, it is hard to argue against Chairman \nGreenspan's record.\n  It is also hard to dispute that Chairman Greenspan's work has won him \nbroad respect and support in the financial community.\n  Mr. President, Alan Greenspan is one of the most thoughtful and \ndeliberate people I have ever met. He does not speak glibly. He knows \nwhat he is talking about, and he chooses his words carefully.\n  This deliberate approach has served him well as Chairman. And it has \ncontributed to a greater sense of stability and predictability in our \nfinancial markets.\n  That predictability is important if our economy is to function \neffectively.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support his nomination. And I trust they \nwill, by a very strong margin.\n  I end up asking unanimous consent that the piece in the Washington \nPost yesterday, an op-ed piece by Robert Samuelson, and the article \nrelated to employment in the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 19, 1996]\n\n                        Greenspan's Good Economy\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       Probably no government agency has recently performed better \n     than the Federal Reserve. Through short-term interest rates, \n     it influences the economy, and the results seem to speak for \n     themselves. The economy's expansion is now in its sixth year, \n     and since it started, employment has grown by 9 million jobs. \n     Annual inflation remains at about 3 percent, which is where \n     it was in 1991. Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, ought to \n     be basking in acclaim. President Clinton has renominated him \n     to another four-year term. Yet Greenspan still faces a loud \n     chorus of critics.\n       The complaint is that the Fed is so obsessed with fighting \n     inflation that it has smothered strong economic growth. ``The \n     Fed has pursued policies that have limited . . . growth to \n     levels not much more than 2 percent,'' gripes Sen. Tom Harkin \n     (D-Iowa), who has insisted on a full Senate debate on \n     Greenspan's nomination. Growth could be higher by a \n     percentage point, he says. Some economists and corporate \n     executives agree. In a decade, the extra growth would raise \n     the average American's disposable income another $2,500. What \n     should we make of this?\n       Not much. It's true that, compared with the past, the \n     economy's growth has slowed. Here are the numbers. Between \n     1960 and 1973, gross domestic product (the economy's output) \n     increased at an annual rate of 4.2 percent. Since 1973, GDP \n     growth has averaged only 2.5 percent. But it's hard to blame \n     the Federal Reserve, because long-term economic growth stems \n     from two factors--expansion in the work force and \n     improvements in productivity--that the Fed hardly influences. \n     Both have weakened.\n       Productivity (output per worker hour) grew almost 3 percent \n     a year between 1960 and 1973. Average workers produced that \n     much more--in everything from steel to air travel--each hour \n     than the year before. Since 1973, increases average slightly \n     more than one percent. No one knows what caused the drop. \n     Labor force growth has also slackened because ``baby boom'' \n     workers are no longer surging into jobs. The Fed can't offset \n     these changes. It can't create more workers or order \n     companies to be more efficient. (Indeed, it's possible that \n     statistics miss some productivity gains; if so, economic \n     growth is underestimated.)\n       Perhaps a simpler tax system, better schools and \n     streamlined regulations would improve growth, but no one \n     knows by how much--and these matters aren't the Fed's \n     responsibility. Harkin and like-minded critics also forget \n     the 1960s and 1970s, when the Fed tried to spur faster \n     economic growth. The result was a disaster: two episodes of \n     double-digit inflation (culminating in 12.3 percent inflation \n     in 1974 and 13.3 percent in 1979); two crushing recessions \n     (those of 1973-75 and 1981-82) to suppress the inflation; and \n     huge increases in interest rates and real estate speculation \n     that fostered the savings and loan crisis.\n       As a practical matter, the best the Fed can do is to nudge \n     the economy toward its production potential while resisting \n     higher inflation. Its tools for doing this are fairly crude. \n     It can change only one market interest rate--the so-called \n     Federal Funds rate, which is the rate at which banks make \n     overnight loans to each other. All other interest rates \n     (those on mortgages, car loans or corporate bonds) respond \n     only indirectly and imprecisely to Fed policies. Even so, \n     there's not much evidence that excessively high interest \n     rates have hurt economic growth.\n       The Fed Funds rate is now 5.25 percent. Assuming inflation \n     is 3 percent, the ``real rate'' is about 2.25 percent--a \n     level critics think too high. It isn't, says economist \n     William Dudley of the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs. \n     Since 1980, Dudley finds, the ``real'' Fed Funds rate has \n     averaged 3.3 percent. True, it was lower in the 1970s and, \n     indeed, was often negative (that is, the interest rate was \n     less than inflation). But it was this policy of easy credit \n     that spawned double-digit inflation.\n       Dudley also points out another flaw in the argument. If \n     interest rates were crushing, then credit-sensitive sectors \n     of the economy--business investment, car sales--would be \n     languishing. Well, they aren't. In 1996, sales of cars and \n     light trucks are running 6 percent ahead of 1995. As for \n     business investment, it has boomed. Between 1991 and 1995, \n     annual spending increased 31 percent. For computers, \n     spending jumped 183 percent; for transportation equipment, \n     it rose 44 percent.\n       Where Greenspan's Fed has succeeded best is in smoothing \n     economic growth by shifts in the Fed Funds rate. To spur \n     recovery from the 1990-91 recession, the rate was cut, to a \n     low of 3 percent in September 1992 and kept there until early \n     1994. Then the Fed began raising the rate gradually to \n     prevent a growing economy from worsening wage and price \n     inflation. By early 1995 the Fed Funds rate was up to 6 \n     percent. Since then it's been dropped three times to sustain \n     growth.\n       Even some occasional Fed critics have been impressed by the \n     success of these maneuvers. ``I think [Greenspan's] done a \n     superb job--better than I expected,'' says economist William \n     Niskanen of the Cato Institute. ``at the end of 1994, I \n     thought he was too tight and that there would be a recession \n     in the fall of 1995.'' There wasn't. Economic growth slowed \n     and then picked up.\n       Sooner or later, of course, there will be another \n     recession. The Fed isn't all-powerful or all-wise. Long \n     economic expansions generate excesses: overborrowing, \n     overinvesting, speculation, inflation. There are some signs \n     of these now. Stock prices seem to many observers, foolishly \n     high. The American Bankers Association recently reported that \n     credit card delinquencies in early 1996 were at a 15-year \n     peak. It's impossible to keep the economy expanding in a \n     simple, straight line. Still, Greenspan's performance merits \n     another term.\n       Perhaps the Fed is simply a convenient scapegoat for all \n     manner of economic anxieties. There's nothing wrong with \n     debate if it illuminates important truths. The most important \n     truth here is just the opposite of the critics' complaints. \n     It is that the temptation to spur a little more economic \n     growth at the risk of a little more inflation is self-\n     defeating. it risks higher inflation, higher interest rates \n     and a more unstable economy. The Fed has absorbed this \n     lesson; so should everyone else.\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\n\n\n                    [Washington Post, June 20, 1996]\n\n                 Labor Shortages May Be Slowing Economy\n\n                           (By John M. Berry)\n\n       Signing bonuses are nothing new for basketball players and \n     Wall Street traders. But hamburger flippers?\n       Some fast-food restaurants in St. Louis are now paying as \n     much as $250 in signing bonuses for new hires, according to \n     the latest Federal Reserve survey of regional economic \n     conditions released yesterday.\n       Companies all over the country are going to extra lengths \n     to attract workers, the Fed reports, in the latest sign that \n     the pool of unemployed workers has shrunk to the point that \n     it is limiting economic growth. Unemployment nationally has \n     hovered around 5.5 percent for the past 18 months and in more \n     than half the states this spring it is below 5 percent.\n       A Minneapolis company is offering a chance at free \n     vacations in Las Vegas for employees who recruit new hires. \n     Temporary employment agencies in Chicago say more employers \n     are snaring their workers for permanent positions. Banks in \n     Salt Lake City are having a hard time finding tellers.\n       According to the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, a \n     growing number of firms wanting to hire skilled workers have \n     stopped advertising because they got no responses. ``Perhaps \n     we should call them `discouraged employers,' '' one Minnesota \n     state official quipped.\n       In Minnesota, one of 10 states with a jobless rate of 3.9 \n     percent or less, economic development officials say that \n     businesses are looking more at whether people will be \n     available to work at a new plant than at whether the \n     company can get incentives or tax breaks to build there, \n     according to the Minneapolis Fed. ``This parallels the \n     dilemma that eastern South Dakota has faced for some time: \n     It is difficult to attract new industry when labor seems \n     short,'' the report said.\n       Many Fed officials have expressed surprise that, with the \n     unemployment rate so low, there have not been more problems \n     on the inflation front, with wages rising to attract workers. \n     But the Fed's latest survey turned up only scattered \n     instances in which tight labor markets were causing wages \n     overall to increase rapidly.\n       Economists and government policymakers aren't exactly sure \n     why labor cost haven't begun to rise more rapidly in response \n     to the nation's low unemployment rate. Some analysts say the \n     best explanation is twofold: Heightened concern among workers \n     about job security in a world of corporate downsizing has \n     made them squeamish about asking for raises. That's coupled \n     with strong resistance by employers to raise overall wages \n     because they know that in a low-inflation economy, it is \n     difficult to raise prices to cover higher costs.\n       So even though some companies are having to increase their \n     offers of starting wages to get workers, in the aggregate, \n     pay hikes are still modest by historic standards.\n       And companies aren't going begging for workers everywhere \n     in the country. Indeed, in places such as the District, New \n     York and New Jersey, a southern tier of states stretching \n     from Mississippi west through Texas to New Mexico and most \n     import, California, finding workers isn't as tough as it is \n     elsewhere. Joblessness in California, whose recovery has \n     lagged that of the rest of the nation, is 7.5 percent. Only \n     West Virginia at 7.7 percent and the District at 8.4 percent \n     have higher rates.\n       To many economists, this is a picture of a nation \n     essentially at full employment. That means that going \n     forward, the economy can grow only as fast as its capacity to \n     produce goods and services grows.\n       How fast that growth can occur is the subject of much \n     debate these days. Indeed, Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) delayed \n     the full Senate's vote to confirm Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan \n     to a third term until today so he could hold a public \n     discussion on the subject. Harkin believes the economy could \n     grow much faster if Greenspan would only lower interest and \n     stop worrying so much about inflation. ``A turtle makes \n     progress only when it sticks its neck out, even though \n     that is when it is most vulnerable,'' Harkin said in an \n     interview. He said that the Fed cannot be sure the jobless \n     rate can't be pushed down to 5 percent or 4.5 percent \n     without making inflation worse.\n       Few people in official Washington agree with Harkin, \n     though. The Clinton administration, the Congressional Budget \n     Office and many private economists all peg the economy's \n     capacity to grow at a little above 2 percent.\n       According to White House economist Martin Baily, the \n     administration's estimate of 2.3 percent a year ``is based on \n     supply-side factors,'' meaning labor supply and productivity.\n       If the economy is at full employment, additional labor is \n     largely a matter of how fast the population is growing, \n     including immigrants. When the post-World war II baby boomers \n     were entering the work force in the 1960s and 1970s, labor \n     supply was increasing roughly 2 percent a year.\n       Now it is increasing only about 1 percent a year. All other \n     things equal, that difference means the economy's capacity to \n     grow is a full percentage point lower than it used to be.\n       And gains in productivity slowed sharply after 1973 for \n     reasons economists still can't explain fully. But over the \n     past year, output per hour worked at private nonfarm \n     businesses rose 1.3 percent, exactly the pace the \n     administration foresees for coming years.\n       At a recent conference on economic growth sponsored by the \n     Boston Federal Reserve Bank, Baily said that Fed policy \n     doesn't directly affect either of these determinants of \n     growth. ``I don't think monetary policy in the United States \n     is seen as a significant restraint on economic growth in the \n     next few years,'' Baily told the conference.\n       Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve \n     Bank, said in a recent interview that in his district, where \n     the average unemployment rate is not much above 4 percent, \n     business executives aren't complaining about Fed policy.\n       The complaint Hoenig hears most frequently, he said, is, \n     ``I can't get enough of the type of help I need. I have heard \n     no one say, I could grow faster if you lowered interest \n     rates.''\n\n                            alice m. rivlin\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the nomination of \nAlice Rivlin, our current Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  Mr. President, Alice Rivlin also has enjoyed a long and distinguished \ncareer in public service. She played a major role in building the \nCongressional Budget Office, and establishing CBO as a highly respected \ninstitution in this city.\n  She has had a distinguished career as an economist and policy \nanalyst. And she has served admirably as Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  Mr. President, few objective observers would question the commitment \nof Alice Rivlin to fiscal responsibility. Her reputation as an advocate \nfor fiscal integrity has been well established for many years.\n  She also has a reputation as someone who tells the truth. Alice \nRivlin is not afraid to tell truth to power. And she is more than \nwilling to ruffle a few feathers in the process. She has done so in the \npast. And I'm sure she would continue to do so at the Federal Reserve.\n  Mr. President, Alice Rivlin is a public servant, not a politician. \nThat's the kind of person I would think all Americans should want at \nthe Federal Reserve.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Alice Rivlin's \nnomination to the Federal Reserve Board. And I hope she can be \nconfirmed by a strong, bipartisan vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in full support of the \nrenomination of Alan Greenspan to the Chairmanship of the Federal \nReserve Board. First nominated in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan, \nChairman Greenspan has reduced the consumer price index from almost 7 \npercent then to about 2.6 percent now. In fact, inflation was below 3 \npercent in 1995, for its fifth consecutive year, marking the first \nsustained period of low inflation since the Kennedy administration.\n  Alan Greenspan has been renominated for a third term as Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve because he has earned the respect of his peers with \na strong record of low inflation and economic stability. Indeed, Mr. \nGreenspan is currently leading us through a volatile transition from an \noverheated economy to one operating near capacity without inflation. To \nunderstand the importance of this transition, one must know that such a \ntransition has never been achieved in the postwar period.\n  It has been said the highest honor a man can receive is recognition \namong his peers. Chairman Greenspan has received just that:\n  Thomas Juterbock of Morgan Stanley has said, ``The market sees \nGreenspan as the last gatekeeper of rational macroeconomic policy that \nwill preclude inflation.''\n  Allan Meltzer, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a well-\nknown Fed watcher, has said, ``He's the best chairman the Fed has ever \nhad.''\n  Lawrence Lindsey, a current Fed Governor, has stated, ``If the curve \nyou're grading on is `What's attainable by mortals,' he certainly \ndeserves an A.''\n  Indeed, former Vice-Chairman of the Fed, Princeton professor, and \nClinton nominee, Allan Blinder, recently said of Greenspan's policies, \n``This is perhaps the most successful episode of monetary policy in the \nhistory of the Fed.'' In fact, Mr. Blinder voted with Chairman \nGreenspan through a long series of rate increases in 1994.\n  With such high regards, a sound record, and possibly the strongest \nand safest banking system in history, I believe the renomination of \nAlan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve is imperative to the \ncontinuity of monetary policy and certainty of financial markets.\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\n  I continue to believe the best monetary policy a country can have is \none that strives for price stability and zero inflation. Inflation is a \ntax, plain and simple. Americans are taxed too much already and should \nnot have the purchasing power of their $1 stolen from them. Hard-\nworking Americans deserve to bear the fruits of their labor, and a \nstrong, sound independent bank is essential to that goal.\n  Some claim that the Federal Reserve is not accountable to Congress. \nSome Members in the Senate have even suggested that we politicize the \nFederal Reserve Bank. I believe that would be the biggest mistake we \ncould ever make. Congress and the President cannot even agree on a \nbalanced budget deal, much less the rate of growth of monetary \naggregates or the correct Federal funds rate. Monetary policy should \nnot be subject to the whims of the political cycle.\n  Without qualification, the Federal Reserve Bank should maintain its \nindependence.\n  Mr. Greenspan has always been mindful and considerate of Congress, \nbut he has never let the political process manipulate him or the \nFederal Reserve. His expertise and strong will are needed at the \ncentral bank and we should show our appreciation of his diligent work \nby reconfirming his nomination to the Chair of the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n  I believe, Mr. President, these criticisms of the Federal Reserve are \nnothing more than an excuse not to adopt sound fiscal policies like a \nbalanced budget and a pure flat tax. These criticisms are not based on \nan understanding of macroeconomic principles. I have not heard any \ndiscussions based on the purchasing-power-parity theory, interest-rate-\nparity theory, or even the rise in commodity prices. It is clear to me \nMr. Greenspan is being made a scapegoat for individuals who will not \nadopt sound fiscal policies.\n  Lastly, I want to voice my support for the confirmation of Laurence \nMeyer as a Federal Reserve Governor. He has a sterling academic record \nas well as a demonstrated professional record as an economic forecaster \nand will have a great deal to offer the Board.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week I said that the reappointment \nof Alan Greenspan is good news for jobs and the economy. Nothing that I \nhave heard during the intervening time has changed my mind.\n  If we are truly interested in helping the American economy expand. If \nwe truly intend to lower interest rates, then we must balance the \nbudget. We must remove the Federal Government from the head of the line \nwhen it comes to borrowing money. It is that simple.\n  Being Chairman of the Federal Reserve is not an easy job. But Alan \nGreenspan has more than measured up to that job. He has been on the \nfront line fighting the results of big Government spending. It is this \nspending that drives up interest rates. It is this spending that hurts \nordinary Americans. It is this spending that is our responsibility to \nbring under control.\n  Until it is under control, it is Alan Greenspan's responsibility to \ntry to keep the economy stable. It is his responsibility to bring \nconfidence to the marketplace. It is his responsibility to keep \ninflation in check. He is doing this job well.\n  Earlier, I used agriculture as an example of the benefit of a \nbalanced Federal budget. According to studies, if the Federal budget is \nbalanced by 2002, the yearly benefit to agriculture would be $2.3 \nbillion due to interest rate reductions. Additionally, increased \nagricultural cash flow from increased economic activity would be $300 \nmillion yearly. This adds up to an increase of $2.6 billion per year \nfor the farm economy if we balance the budget. These studies are based \non Congressional Budget Office estimates that short-term interest rates \nwould decrease 1.1. percent and that long-term interest rates would \ndecline 1.7 percent.\n  This is real interest rate reduction.\n  Looking at a balanced budget from another point of view, homeowners \nwith an average 30-year home mortgage of $75,000 would have $37,000 \nover the life of the loan. This would occur with a balanced budget and \nsubsequent interest rate drop of 2 percent.\n  Or a family with a 4-year car loan of $15,000 would save $900.\n  It is clearly better to reduce interest rates through congressional \naction on a balanced budget than a regulatory action by the Federal \nReserve. The benefits will be much longer lasting.\n  In a recent article in the Institutional Investor, Federal Reserve \nGovernor Janet Yellen, a Clinton administration appointee, asks several \nquestions which go to the heart of what Alan Greenspan's opponents are \nsaying. First she asks, if productivity is really increasing to the \ndegree that growth advocates insist and current monetary policy is too \nrestrictive, why is not unemployment rising?\n  Second she asks, if unemployment is above its natural rate and the \npotential growth rate is substantially higher than real growth, why is \nnot inflation falling further? She answers these questions with this \nstatement: ``The fact that inflation has been relatively stable for the \npast two years suggests an economy operating in the neighborhood of it \npotential output.''\n  How well put.\n  I would also point out that among the Governors of the Federal \nReserve who have or are serving with Alan Greenspan there has been no \nfundamental disagreement about monetary policy. There would be \ndissention at the Fed if Mr. Greenspan's opponents had any credibility \nto their arguments at all.\n  I compliment Chairman Greenspan on his ability, in the light of the \nfiscally irresponsible Congresses of the past, to give stability to our \neconomy. We have only to look at the record number of new highs that \nare being achieved by the stock market. This is real economic growth.\n  As I said last week, if we want to encourage economic growth we have \nno farther to look than ourselves. Balancing the Federal budget will \npromote and ensure real economic growth. And balancing the budget is \nour responsibility, not that of the Federal Reserve. It is time that we \naccept that responsibility and not try to look for scapegoats.\n  Let us start by continuing our efforts to bring the budget into \nbalance and by confirming Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal \nReserve.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate will vote whether \nor not to confirm Alan Greenspan for a third term as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve's Board of Governors. I have listened to the debate \nabout his performance as Chairman, and the claims that his policies \nhave permitted annual economic growth of only 2.5 percent. Chairman \nGreenspan's critics say that his pursuit of price stability has \ncompromised the growth of the economy, and they're trying to make him \nthe scapegoat for today's slow growth.\n  My colleagues are right about one thing, slow economic growth hurts \nall Americans. It leads to stagnating incomes, fewer job opportunities \nand widespread insecurity about the future. You should hear the \ncomplaints I have been hearing from my constituents in Florida. They \nare frustrated. They do not understand why America--the greatest \ncountry in the world--a country with unlimited opportunity--is falling \nbehind. It is frustrating to me, too, because I know we can do better.\n  But I think some of my colleagues have seriously misdiagnosed the \nproblem. It is vitally important for us to understand why this \neconomy's performance is so lackluster, and what policies can help it \nreach its full potential. In my estimation, Alan Greenspan is not the \nproblem. Bad economic policies enacted by the Clinton administration \nand previous Congresses are.\n  Since 1978, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act has demanded that the Federal \nReserve simultaneously promote full employment, maximum production, and \nprice stability. In other words, the Fed is being told to try to \nfinetune the economy. The failures and problems caused by this divided \nfocus have lad many observers to conclude that an important first step \non the road to meaningful economic growth is to have the Fed \nconcentrate solely on what it can actually achieve: price stability.\n  Let me quote former Federal Reserve governor Wayne Angell, who wrote:\n\n       It is completely appropriate to give our government \n     multiple policy goals, including lowering unemployment, \n     promoting economic growth, and maintaining stable prices. All \n     of these goals contribute to the well-being of our people. \n     There is much to lose, however, in charging the Federal \n     Reserve with all these tasks.\n\n  The reason why the Fed can not achieve multiple goals is simple: it\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\nonly controls one monetary policy tool--the amount of money in the \neconomy. This ability to create money and operate through the monetary \nbase means that the Fed can control inflation. Sure, the Fed can also \nstimulate economic growth and create demand in the short run by \nprinting additional money, but such growth is not without cost. \nBecause, in the long run, printing excess money always leads to \ninflation, and thereby diminishes whatever economic gains were realized \nduring the short run.\n  The Fed can only encourage long-run economic growth if Congress \nrepeals the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. Therefore, I have introduced the \nEconomic Growth and Price Stability Act, to focus the Fed solely on \nstable prices. This bill would serve to hold down the inflation premium \npart of interest rates, so that buying a home or a car, or taking out a \nstudent loan will be more affordable.\n  But even if the Fed, and its Chairman, achieve the goal of price \nstability, that is still no guarantee that Americans will see robust \nlong-term economic growth. Do not get me wrong, price stability is \nabsolutely necessary for growth, but by no means is it sufficient. The \npresence of harmful fiscal policy can render even the most beneficial \nmonetary policy useless. That is part of the reason American families \nare feeling such anxiety today: the growth of Government is paralyzing \nthe growth of the economy. In short, the Clinton administration's \nmisguided fiscal policies have put working families in a bind.\n  Just look at how President Clinton's policies of high taxes and \nbigger Government have led to this weak economy. Let us compare growth \nunder President Clinton to historical averages, reaching back to the \nend of World War II. The results are astonishing:\n  Since Bill Clinton became President, GDP growth has only averaged 2.4 \npercent at an annual rate. Compare that to the growth rate he \ninherited: in 1992, the economy grew at a robust 3.7 percent. During \nthe entire decade before President Clinton took office, annual economic \ngrowth averaged 3.2 percent. During the last five periods of economic \nexpansion growth averaged 4.4 percent, and economists--believe it or \nnot--call today's economy an expansion. Finally, if you look at \neconomic growth rates all the way back to the end of World War II: \ngrowth has averaged 3.3 percent.\n  President Clinton and his policies have simply failed to measure up. \nIt is what some people call the Clinton growth gap or the Clinton \ncrunch--the difference between the growth America has experienced under \nthe Clinton administration and what we should reasonably have been able \nto expect, given historical trends. The Clinton growth gap has meant a \nlower standard of living for every child, every woman, and every man in \nAmerica. We can do better. We must do better.\n  We can reverse this trend by balancing the budget, lowering taxes, \ncutting regulations and generally getting Washington off the backs of \nthe American people. The key to achieving strong economic growth is our \nremarkable entrepreneurial spirit. The economy can grow faster, but \nGovernment needs to step out of the way. Bottom line, it is not the \nFederal Reserve and Chairman Greenspan who are causing today's economic \nproblems; it is the harmful economic policies of President Clinton, his \nadministration and previous Congresses.\n  Chairman Greenspan knows what needs to be done. He remains committed \nto price stability, and agrees that fighting inflation should be the \nFed's only focus. But he has been hamstrung by counterproductive fiscal \npolicies and a mandate to make the Federal Reserve all things to all \npeople. He has been asked to do the impossible, and then some people \nturn around and blame him for the economy's anemic growth rate. That's \nunfair, and it's simply wrong. President Clinton and his allies here in \nCongress cannot rationally expect to keep taxing and regulating and \nspending, while the Fed indulges them by printing more and more money \nto feed their excess.\n  Therefore, I wholeheartedly support Alan Greenspan's nomination to a \nthird term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. I encourage my \ncolleagues to stop looking for a convenient scapegoat for failed \neconomic policies he had nothing to do with. I hope you will join me in \nvoting for his renomination. And we can work together to enact \nmeaningful pro-growth economic policies that will give Americans the \nkind of robust economic growth they deserve.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague from Iowa, I had the opportunity \nlast week, as he knows, to listen to his presentation, and I think he \nis absolutely right in a couple of senses.\n  The first is that this is a very important debate. Unfortunately, \nagain, you are right in the sense that a lot of this has been discussed \non the basis of things really other than the role of the Federal \nReserve. There has been a lot of discussion about character and \npersonality. I happen to think a great deal of Chairman Greenspan, but \nthat is not the point. The real issue here is what is the role of \nmonetary policy.\n  The second point that we agree upon, at least--but it does kind of \npoint out, I think, a difficult position for the administration--is you \nand I agree completely that it is unacceptable to reach a point in this \ncountry that we somehow have to believe that 2.5 percent real growth is \nsomething we ought to be proud of. Frankly, we are not going to be able \nto provide the opportunities to future generations, to our children and \nour grandchildren if we are going to accept the notion that this \ncountry can only grow at 2.5 percent real growth.\n  What will happen to working families? What will happen to farmers? \nWhat will happen to small businesses? What will happen to our families? \nWhat will happen to our retirees? I say to my distinguished colleague \nthat I happen to be one of those individuals who, too, was affected by \nwhat happened in the 1970's.\n  I remind him that it was not just the seventies. Economies of all \ncountries have been fighting this battle against inflation ever since \nthere was the invention of money. But I remember those town meetings in \nthe early 1980's when the folks in my part of the State of Florida were \ntelling me of the destruction they experienced of their savings; that \nthey lost, in essence, one-third of everything they had set aside and \nworked for throughout their entire lives, disappeared in a matter of 3 \nor 4 years because of inflation being out of control.\n  So I think it is important, in fact, I believe that the only \nobjective of the Federal Reserve should be to maintain price stability.\n  I have heard my colleague, Senator Harkin, say that there ought to be \na balanced approach with respect to the Federal Reserve. I am going to \ngive you my interpretation of what that means to have a balanced \napproach.\n  There are those who suggest that the Congress and the administration \ncan be engaged in a series of economic policies that ought to be offset \nor balanced, if you will, by the Federal Reserve--have higher taxes, \nmore Federal spending, more Washington interference in the workplace, \nin businesses in America. The end result of that is it slows down \neconomic activity, it reduces productivity, and these same businesses \nare no longer able to produce at the level that they were prior to the \nintervention of fiscal policy.\n  So the theory is, let us have a balanced approach, let us see that \nthe Federal Reserve, in essence, offsets bad fiscal policy. What we get \nis right back to where we were in the late 1970's, which is referred to \nas ``stagflation.'' Most people would understand it as too many dollars \nchasing too few goods, and that drives up inflation.\n  So what I will say to my colleague, this is a very important debate, \nbecause we ought to be focusing in on what is the role of the Federal \nReserve, and I suggest probably in the months ahead, we will probably \nbe engaged in a debate about the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. I think it is \nwrong to give the Federal Reserve a series of objectives. It is like \nhaving two bosses, if you will, or multiple bosses.\n\n  I see that the Chair is about to announce to me that the time has \nexpired. I wonder if I can ask unanimous consent--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MACK. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains on both sides?\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. MACK. I ask unanimous consent for 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let's do 5 for both.\n  Mr. MACK. I ask unanimous consent that we both be given 5 minutes, \nfor a total of 5 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 5 minutes for both sides. \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as I was saying, I think we will get \nourselves engaged in a debate at some future time with respect to what \nis the central role of the Federal Reserve. But as I indicated a moment \nago, it is interesting to me to listen to my colleague from Iowa talk \nabout his dissatisfaction, which I happen to share, with the growth in \nthe economy.\n  I believe that, with the reassessment of the economic growth in the \nlast quarter from 2.8 percent to 2.3 percent, the growth rate during \nthe Clinton years is somewhere around 2.3, 2.4 percent. But what is \ninteresting about the debate is the fact that President Clinton, during \nhis State of the Union Address before a joint session of the Congress, \nsaid that this is the strongest economy that we have experienced in \nthree decades.\n  So, I am not real sure where the President is heading with this. If \nhe is satisfied with 2.5 percent real growth, I find that shocking, and \nI think that the workers in America, the families of America who are \ntelling me that they are extremely anxious about their future, about \nwhether jobs are going to be available to them, would reject the notion \nthat somehow or another we should be satisfied with 2.3 or 2.4 percent \nreal growth.\n  Again, I agree with the Senator from Iowa that the whole purpose of \neconomic policy is to increase the growth rate, to provide jobs, \nprovide opportunity and increase the standard of living for all \nAmericans. The question is how do we do it. Where we differ, frankly, \nis, I believe that raising taxes, adding burdens to American business, \nincreasing their costs, overregulating, Washington interference slows \ndown that economic activity and reduces opportunity. To have passed a \nseries of policies that do those things and then say on top of that we \nwant the Federal Reserve to compensate it is the worst of all worlds. \nYou slow down economic growth, you slow down production, you increase \nthe money supply and you drive inflation. That is, in my opinion, just \nthe wrong approach to take.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that in the late 1970's, one-third of \neverything that someone had worked for through their entire lives--and \nI am now talking about the retirees in the State of Florida who have \ntalked to me about this issue, who lost one-third of everything they \nhad earned throughout their entire lifetime and, I might add, a number \nof those being farmers from the Midwest who had spent their entire life \ntoiling in the field, setting aside money for the day when they might \nretire--and in a 3- or 4-year period, one-third of everything they had \nsaved disappeared.\n  So I happen to believe that the Federal Reserve is on the right \ncourse, the Federal Reserve should maintain its commitment to price \nstability, because with price stability, you have created an \nenvironment, if we put in place the right kind of fiscal policy, where \nwe can get this country moving again. We can do better, and we must do \nbetter.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  I thank my colleague from Florida. He is a good friend of mine. He is \nsomeone who has paid a lot of attention to this issue. Quite frankly, I \nagree with him on this whole issue of growth. I think we ought to have \nmore debates on how we go about it. I think it is a legitimate area of \ndebate for this Senate to engage in. I hope this debate today--in fact, \nI intend this not to be the end but the beginning of a process of \ndebating this issue further this year and going on into next year, \nbecause it is too important an issue to just sort of shove aside how we \ngo about increasing our growth.\n  The Senator from Florida is absolutely right. I agree with him. To \nsit back and say 2.5 percent growth is fine, that is condemning future \ngenerations of Americans, and our kids, to low growth, to terrible \njobs, to not being able to buy their own homes and to having a good \nquality of life. I think it condemns America to a lower place among the \nnations.\n  We do not have to accept that 2.5 percent growth. I agree with the \nSenator from Florida. It is way too low. And whether it is the \nPresident or whether it is the Fed, whether it is the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, his inner circle, or whether it is Mr. \nGreenspan and the people at the Fed saying that, they are both wrong. I \nthink we ought to think about how we can have higher growth. And I \nbelieve we can.\n  Where perhaps my friend from Florida and I begin to diverge is here. \nMy friend from Florida says that perhaps by decreasing interest rates, \nwe will drive up inflation. He refers time and time again to the \n1970's. Economist after economist, business leader after business \nleader will point to the fact that this is not the 1970's. The world \nhas changed dramatically in the last 20 years. We have a world economy \nlike we did not have 20 years ago. We have jobs offshore. We have \nproduction offshore. We have mass wholesaling and pricing in this \ncountry, that Wal-Mart experience, as I often call it, that we did not \nhave 20 years ago.\n  So the whole world has changed. The factors that led to the inflation \nin the 1970's are not there today. The economy's ability to resist \ninflation is greater. Economists point to that time and time again. \nJust as I believe we spent untold billions of dollars refighting World \nWar II during the 1950's and 1960's--I will not get into that--which \nled to some of the mistakes we made in Vietnam when that war was \npassed, I think we are spending untold billions of dollars now in taxes \non the middle class because we are fighting the inflation war of the \n1970's. But it is not there. There is no inflation there.\n  In fact, some economists will say, if you look at the U.S. economic \nhistory from World War II to the present, there really has not been \nmuch core inflation. What happened in the 1970's was energy shock. That \nis the largest factor that drove up inflation. Once we got over that we \ngot back on course again.\n  So those threats are not there now. The threats that are there now is \nwhat, again, was in the paper this morning. People talked about the \nlabor shortages, that they are bidding for jobs. Yes, in certain parts \nof the country, that is true. There was another story by the same \nwriter in the paper this morning about the ``Economy's Growth Gets \nRight Down to the Bottom Line.'' What did he point out? That more and \nmore of the growth is going to corporate profits, not to wages. What \nhas that led to, in part? This story in the New York Times this \nmorning, ``Income Disparity Between Poorest and Richest Rises.'' That \nis what it boils down to.\n  High interest rates are taxes, just as inflation is a hidden tax on \nthose who have saved. High interest rates are hidden taxes on those who \nare working today. Are our working families trying to buy a car, \neducate their kids, buy a home? It is a hidden tax on our farmers. It \nis a hidden tax on our small businesses. That is why I argue for a \nbalanced approach. We need balance between the concern for inflation \nand the need to maximize both employment and production.\n  A 1-percent increase in interest rates means the payment on the \naverage home mortgage on a house costing about $115,000 is about an \nadditional $1,000 a year. That is a tax. For the average Iowa farmer, a \n1-percent increase in interest rates is an extra $1,500 in interest \npayments every year. That is a tax. For the average Iowa restaurant, \nthe cost is $1,000 a year for a 1-percent increase in interest rates. \nThat is where we are. It is sucking the lifeblood out of our small \nbusinesses, our farmers, our working families.\n  Let us get back to fundamentals. Who likes high interest rates? Well, \nif I have the money to loan, I like high interest rates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes \nper side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But, Mr. President, if you are on the side of working \nfamilies,\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\nand small businesses that have to borrow money to expand, or on the \nside of manufacturers that need new plants and equipment, or on the \nside of farmers who need to borrow money to get ahead and to provide \nfor that growth in our economy, you need lower interest rates than what \nwe have right now.\n\n  That really is the fundamental issue we are coming down to. The \ndisparity between the rich and the poor grow. The middle class is \npaying more and more in interest rates. Check how much debt has gone up \nin our country. I mean privately held debt. People are paying too much \non interest charges. To the extent that the Fed keeps that interest \nrate high, it is an unfair tax on our people. We cannot have the kind \nof growth we need with the kind of policies at the Fed.\n  This debate has been healthy. It has nothing to do with \npersonalities, but it has a lot to do with monetary policy. As I have \nsaid before, Mr. President, the Federal Reserve System is not an entity \nunto itself. It is not a separate branch of Government. It is a \ncreature of Congress. Congress has the right, the duty, and the \nobligation, I believe, to answer the real needs of our people and to \nprovide for growth in our economy.\n  If that means we need changes at the Fed, then we ought to make those \nchanges, whether it is an individual who leads it or in the way that it \nis structured and the way that it runs. We here in Congress ought to be \nmaking those changes so it can provide for more real growth in our \neconomy.\n  I thank the President, and I thank my friend from Florida. It has \nbeen a good debate. I look forward to more of these as we go through \nthe remainder of the year.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. First, I thank the Senator for his comments. I look forward \nto the debate as well. I yield 1 minute to Senator Bennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nleft.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am interested to find out that Alan \nGreenspan and the Fed are now responsible for the disparity between the \nrich and poor, according to this morning's paper.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, there are fundamental economic laws that \nhave operated in the 1950's, the 1970's, the 1990's, and will operate \ninto the next century. The most fundamental of these is: You cannot \nrepeal the law of supply and demand. Attempts to artificially repeal \nthe law of supply and demand by artificial fiat make us feel good in \nthe short run, but they get us into trouble in the long run. The most \nsignificant thing the Fed can do is control the money supply in such a \nway as to keep prices stable so markets can operate.\n  When we try to fiddle with markets by Government fiat, we get into \nall kinds of trouble and end up paying tremendous prices for that later \non. I support Chairman Greenspan's nomination, and I support his \nstewardship at the Fed. I am proud to be a cosponsor with my friend \nfrom Florida of the bill to change the Humphrey-Hawkins Act so that the \nprimary focus of the Fed becomes price stability.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 1 minute.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I yield that minute to Senator Simon.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may address \nthe Senate for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. SIMON. To address the Senate for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MACK. Reserving the right to object, and it is not my intention \nto do so, I was going to allow the time to expire really, but I ask \nunanimous consent just for 2 minutes for myself, and then 5 minutes for \nSenator Simon, and 5 minutes for Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I had \nplanned to speak in relation to Alice Rivlin once all the time had \nexpired. If the agreement is going to extend time, then I want to be \nincluded. If time is going to be allowed to expire, I will await my \ntime and ask for unanimous consent in the due course of events. I ask \nthe Senator from Florida to decide whether he wants to go for that or \nlet me take my chances.\n  Mr. MACK. If I could add Senator Bennett for 5 minutes as well. I ask \nunanimous consent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, my friend from Utah, this \nis just to talk about Ms. Rivlin and not the Fed policy? Is the Senator \ngoing to talk about Fed policy?\n  Mr. BENNETT. No. I think we said all we need to say about Fed policy. \nI do wish to reserve my right at some point to comment about Alice \nRivlin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What is the unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. MACK. The unanimous-consent request is 2 minutes for Senator \nMack, 5 minutes for Senator Simon, 5 minutes for Senator Harkin, and 5 \nminutes for Senator Bennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMON. I do not agree with Alan Greenspan on everything, but I \nthink he has served this Nation well. I think it would be a great \nmistake to turn down his nomination. Where I differ with him is when we \ntalk about full employment. The Fed tends to believe that, in and of \nitself, is inflationary. The reality, I think, is if you have people \nworking and being productive, that can be deflationary, rather than \ninflationary.\n  But our principal problem--there are really two problems.\n  The Federal Reserve has nothing to do with either of these problems. \nIndirectly, in terms of interest, when the interest rates are down, \nthat does help, but the problem is fiscal policy. We get our deficits \ndown and interest rates will come down. The Wharton econometric model \nsays if we balance the budget, we are going to have a 3\\1/2\\ percent \nlower crime rate in this country. Otto Eckstein's old group, I forget \nthe name, says 2\\1/2\\ percent. Everybody says interest rates will be \nlower if we get the deficit down.\n  We have a very practical illustration. Mr. President, 30-year T \nbonds, January 15, 1993, 7.43 percent, and rumors are starting about a \nClinton budget; February 12, after the proposal for reduction of the \nbudget is known, interest rates go down to 7.18 percent; February 17, \nhe announced his plan--something is wrong with the dates I have here; \nit must be February 7--down to 7.07 percent; July 16, it hit 6.58 \npercent; August 6, Congress passes the legislation, and interest rates \nare down to 5.9 percent, a 1\\1/2\\ percent drop because of a change in \nfiscal policy.\n  Let me just add, it is debt, not only the Federal Government but \ncorporate debt and individual debt, too. We are just not a saving \npeople. The phrase ``no downpayment'' is almost uniquely an American \nphrase that we do not find used in other countries. Corporate debt, our \ntaxes, are structured in such a way that we encourage corporate debt. I \nhave a bill I hope someday will pass that says corporations can deduct \n80 percent on interest but 50 percent on dividends, so you encourage \nequity financing rather than debt financing. It is a wash in terms of \nthe Federal Treasury. There are ways we can reduce the fiscal problems.\n  The second problem is one I do not hear talked about here, but one \nthat the Federal Reserve has to be keenly aware of. That is, we have \nindexed a great many things. Indexation is in and of itself \ninflationary. Most nations have not indexed like we have, Social \nSecurity being the prime example. So if you have any kind of inflation, \nindexation feeds the inflation. When, in fact, we have inflation, we \nought to be cutting back on expenditures, we will be making more \nexpenditures. I do not care whether it is Alan Greenspan, Lester \nThurow, Alice Rivlin, whoever it is, if we do not deal with indexation \nand fiscal policy, we are not going to have low interest rates that we \nought to have.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I cannot think of anything that would be more \ndisconcerting to the financial markets and cause interest rates to go \nup more\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\nthan if we were to reject Alan Greenspan. I think it is important that \nwe confirm the President's appointment. I think it is the right \nappointment. I think Alan Greenspan has served this Nation well. My \nvote will be a resounding yes to confirm him.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague from Iowa, \nagain, the fundamental debate does need to take place about monetary \nand fiscal policy. This is a debate that right now, frankly, is \nsomething that really concerns me. It has been something that has \nconcerned me ever since I came to the Congress 14 years ago, that \nsomehow or another the Congress would have more control over the \nFederal Reserve. My fear is that Congress has made a mess of fiscal \npolicy. If Congress gets more involved in monetary policy, it would be \na disaster for the country. So I start with that premise.\n  Again, I make reference to what Senator Simon made reference to \nearlier, that when there was an impression that we were going to get \nour fiscal house in order, long-term interest rates, in fact, started \nto come down. It was not until the President vetoed the Balanced Budget \nAct that we saw long-term interest rates start to go up. There is a \nmajor, major role in this with respect to fiscal policy. It seems to me \nthose individuals who have for years supported more Government, higher \ntaxes, more regulation, more Washington interference, are now trying to \nsay that because the economy is growing at 2.3 percent, somehow or \nanother it is the Federal Reserve's fault. I fundamentally disagree \nwith that.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MACK. If the Senator would allow me, we have had limited time.\n  The fundamental issue underlying this debate is taking \nresponsibility. Again, I think that there are a number of individuals \nwho want to shift the blame to create Alan Greenspan as the scapegoat \nfor this economy. The reality is, the responsibility is with the \nCongress. It is what the Congress has done over the last number of \nyears--again, increasing taxes, increasing Washington's interference, \nmore regulation--that has slowed the economy down. The worst thing we \ncan do now is to put more money into the system which creates \ninflation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand I have 5 minutes. I will take 30 seconds. I \nwant to respond to my friend from Florida by saying in 1993 the \nPresident offered and we passed a deficit reduction package. It went \ninto effect October 1993. We began reducing the deficit, and the \ndeficit has been coming down ever since. The deficit is now 60 percent \nlower than when President Clinton took office.\n  What did Alan Greenspan do? He raised interest rates. I thought it \nwas supposed to be axiomatic, as we reduce the deficit, interest rates \nwill come down. They will only come down if you have a Fed chairman \nthat correctly corresponds Fed policy with monetary policy, with the \nfiscal policy of America. We have been reducing the deficit. Interest \nrates are going in the opposite direction. Please, somebody explain \nthis anomaly.\n  Last, I want to say we have 7.5 million unemployed, 1 million not \ncounted, 4 million part-time workers in America. These are people that \ncan enter the work force. We can have labor growth and we can have that \nkind of growth without increasing inflation.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of final points. \nOne I wanted to make to the Senator from Florida, he is absolutely \ncorrect about what has happened to long-term rates as the market \nassesses what might or might not happen in fiscal policy. The point I \nwanted to make, there are a whole lot of folks who are not financing \nlong term--farmers, business people, and others--and borrow from their \nbanks in short- or intermediate-term credit. Every system is charging \nhigher interest rates than they ought to because the Federal funds rate \nis above where it ought to be, by everyone's expectation, above where \nit ought to be where it has historically been, above where it ought to \nbe, given the inflation rate. And as a result, every loan for every \nfarmer and consumer bears a higher interest rate, because the \nFederal Reserve Board, as a matter of deliberate strategy, says, ``We \nwant higher interest rates on these moneys.'' Why? Because their desire \nis to slow down the American economy.\n\n  The place where we would disagree is the Senator from Florida and \nothers say if we would simply have fiscal policy in order, somehow we \nwould have a higher growth rate. There will not be a higher growth rate \nin this economy under any condition, period, as long as the Federal \nReserve Board decides they will limit growth rates to 2.2 or 2.4 \npercent. If they start getting nervous, and they start wanting to jump \nout windows because they see 3 percent growth rates, and they say, \n``Gee, our economy cannot sustain that robust rate,'' which would not \nhave been considered robust a few years ago; now it is considered a \nrate that will overheat the economy, then we will not have that rate.\n  The one thing the Fed is good at is putting the brakes on the \neconomy. The only question I ask as we conclude this debate is why do \nwe have such low expectations of this economy? Why such low \nexpectations? Why should we not expect our economy, as productivity is \nimproving, as the deficit is being reduced, why should we not have an \nexpectation of this economy to be able to grow at a reasonable rate? \nThe answer is we should. Do not sell the capability of this country \nshort. Do not sell the capability of American workers or American \nbusinesses short. Let us allow this country to have a reasonable growth \nrate which can be done without further fueling the fires of inflation.\n  I say one other thing to my friends who allege this. This is not a \ncase of some people wanting the Congress to run monetary policy. I do \nnot believe Congress ought to make monetary policy. The Federal Reserve \nBoard makes monetary policy. I happen to fundamentally disagree with \nthe kind of policies at this point that they propose and pursue. But I \nwill suggest some changes to the Federal Reserve Board. I think a \nlittle disinfectant with some sunlight would be very helpful to the \ndinosaur that meets mostly in secret, and imposes higher interest rates \non every person in America. So I will impose changes, but not those \nthat put Congress in the captain's chair on monetary policy. It is \nenormously healthy. We have not had a circumstance where we allowed \nsome in the Congress to say we must reconfirm Mr. Greenspan for a \nsecond term with no debate by unanimous consent. That is not a healthy \nthing to do. I have great respect for Mr. Greenspan and have not said \nan unkind word about him. I fundamentally disagree with his \npolicies. But I admire him as a person. I am not going to vote for him \nbecause I have disagreements with the direction of the Federal Reserve \nBoard. But it is very healthy for us to start talking a bit about what \nkind of monetary policy will give this country the opportunity to be \nthe kind of country it can be in the future with jobs and growth.\n\n  You know, there are two areas where there is almost no discussion on \nthe floor of the Senate--trade policy and monetary policy, both of \nwhich have a profound impact on the lives of ordinary Americans. Try to \ntalk about any of them and people say, you know, it is not something we \nwant to talk about.\n  This is a very healthy thing for us to do. Some say, let us get the \nGovernment out of all of this. I say that the Government had to bail \nout--to the tune of a half-trillion dollars--a savings and loan \nindustry, as all of us understand. They got involved in the junk bond \nfever of the 1980's and developed schemes by which they could park junk \nbonds at S's. Then they became nonperforming, and the American \ntaxpayers paid the costs. And you want to keep Government out of all of \nthis mess? No. It was created by those not looking over the shoulders \nof those in that industry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I will not conclude my \nthought. I hope we have another debate to talk about the twin goals of \nthis country--stable prices and full employment, and how we can work \nwith the monetary and fiscal policies to achieve those goals.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6582]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am tempted to go on with this debate, \nbut I think it has probably been exhausted sufficiently on both sides. \nI will use the time granted to me under the UC agreement to discuss \nanother issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6549-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ALICE RIVLIN\n\n  Mr. President, when Alice Rivlin came by my office for a courtesy \ncall prior to her confirmation hearing in the Banking Committee, I told \nher I would support her confirmation. When she appeared before the \nBanking Committee, I voted in favor of her confirmation.\n  I am in the habit of keeping my commitments. It is with great \npersonal sadness, then, that I take the floor to announce that I will, \nin the coming vote, cast a vote against Alice Rivlin's confirmation. I \nwant to take this time to explain why I have changed positions.\n  It is, in no way, an attack on Alice Rivlin personally, and, frankly, \nit is not even an attack on the response that she gave to Senator Bond \nin his role as subcommittee chairman on the Appropriations Committee. I \nknow he was outraged by the response he received. I have served in the \nexecutive branch, and I know that Alice Rivlin was not a free agent in \nterms of the kind of response she gave. She was under orders from the \nWhite House, and she had no choice but to follow those orders or \nresign. She chose to follow the orders.\n  She sent a letter that was completely unacceptable to Chairman Bond \nand, frankly, completely unacceptable to me. I am a member of Senator \nBond's subcommittee, and I was there when he asked the questions of the \nAdministrator of the Veterans Administration: ``How are you going to \nadminister your program when, according to the President's budget, in \nthe outyears there is not going to be any money?'' He received the \nanswer: ``I have been assured by the White House that the money will be \nthere, the budget to the contrary notwithstanding.'' Senator Bond \nrepeated the same question to the Administrator of NASA: ``How are you \ngoing to manage the program when you get to the outyears and there is \nnot any money?'' He got the same answer: ``I have been assured by the \nWhite House that the money will be there.'' Senator Bond asked the \nquestion of the Administrator of the EPA: ``How are you going to fund \nyour program when you get to the outyears and there is no money?'' She \nsaid: ``I have been assured by the White House that the money will be \nthere.''\n\n  It is very clear that this White House is playing the oldest of \nWashington's shell game, which is to give you a long-term balanced \nbudget statement and load all of the savings in the years that will \ncome to pass after you are safely out of office, with the full \nknowledge that Congress will never, ever act in the way that you are \nprojecting they will act. But you can get safely reelected and point \nback and say, ``Congress did not do what we told them.''\n  But it is even more blatant to put that kind of a budget before the \nCongress and then, at the same time, explicitly tell the managers of \nthe programs: ``Manage your programs as if those cuts will never \nhappen, because we know they will never happen.''\n  That is outrageous, Mr. President. It deserves some kind of public \nprotest. It is sufficiently outrageous that I will register that \nprotest in a way I have never registered a protest before. I will \npublicly break my word, publicly go back on a commitment. I committed \nto Alice Rivlin that I would vote for her when she called on me. I \nvoted for her within the committee. It pains me deeply to now break \nthat commitment and say that I intend to vote against her, and I will \nvote against her with the firm understanding that this has little to do \nwith Alice Rivlin and a great deal to do with the Clinton White House. \nIt has little to do with what she did when she was following orders to \nextend that kind of a response to Chairman Bond, and it has everything \nto do with the administration that gave her those orders and said: \nPretend, dissemble, camouflage, confuse, but do not tell the Congress \nthat which is blatantly obvious to everybody else, which is that this \nadministration does not intend to keep its word on the President's \nbudget.\n  So, Mr. President, perhaps it is a bit of rationalization on my part, \nbut if the President will not keep his word on his budget and has sent \nthe word directly to his administrators that they shall not keep their \nword, I think I am justified in breaking my word to Mrs. Rivlin and \ncasting this protest vote, which I will do this afternoon.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6582-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me define what I am trying to do here \nin basic terms and then outline very briefly the amendment and how it \nwill work. I want to be brief because when you are winning, it is best \nto accept the victory and not do a lot of talking about it. But let me \ndefine the problem.\n  Twenty and 30 years ago, young Americans took up the country's call \nby joining the military. What they were promised when they joined the \nmilitary is that, if they served out to retirement--20 or 30 years--\namong the benefits they would have is the ability to go into military \nmedicine in retirement and, on a space-available basis, continue the \nsame military medicine that they were accustomed to while they wore the \nuniform of the country. All over America hundreds of thousands of \nretirees are in a position today where that commitment was made 20 or \n30 years ago. Interestingly enough, it is fulfilled from the moment \nthey retire until they turn 65. But the moment they turn 65, they are \nnow being excluded from the military medical system that they were \npromised they would have available to them.\n  The incredible paradox is that they are among the few Americans who \nhave earned not one system of medical care in their retirement but two. \nThey earned access to medical care by serving 20 or 30 years in the \nuniform of the country. In the middle of their career, Congress decided \nto have them pay the Medicare payroll tax and qualify for Medicare. So \nour military retirees now find themselves in a very select group of \npeople where they have earned not one medical benefit but two.\n  What is now being done is they are being forced to opt to go on \nMedicare when many of them have grown accustomed to the military \nmedical system and want to stay in it. We have also created two classes \nof retirees--those below 65 who qualify for military medicine and those \n65 and above who lose it. At the very moment when people are turning \n65, feeling more vulnerable about their health care, they are being \nuprooted from a system that they have grown accustomed to.\n  In addition to that, there is the fundamental fairness issue, it \nseems to me. Our military retirees serve 20 or 30 years to earn their \nbenefit. We promised it to them, and now we are not living up to our \nword.\n  I submit that, if we want others to take up the cause of the country \nand to wear its uniform, it is very important that we live up to the \ncommitments that we have made to those who have served in the past.\n  The right thing to do is to give people a choice; to say to every \nmilitary retiree that when you turn 65 you can opt for the Medicare \nwhich you paid for and have Medicare reimburse your medical care \nthrough the private medical system of the country, or on a space-\navailable basis, you can continue to use military medicine as you did \nbefore you turned 65. Then an agreement should be worked out between \nMedicare and the Defense Department as to who is going to pay for this \nmedicine. My view is we should have subvention, and Medicare should \nreimburse our military hospitals. That is what I want. That is what is \nfair. That is what we promised people. We are living up to our word \nwhen we do that.\n  I have tried for the last 6 months to work out a bill to try to set \nup an experiment to prove that it does not cost more to give people the \nright to stay in military medicine, to have a test in three regions of \nthe country--the south-central United States, Pacific Northwest, and \nAlaska--where we could take States that are quite different and see \nwhether it costs more to have people stay in military medicine, if they \nchoose to, or to simply go into Medicare and be reimbursed.\n  I thought we might be able to work that out. But with the session \ngetting short, we have worked out a compromise that I believe is \ngenerally supported and is going to be accepted, I believe, on both \nsides. Our compromise will require the administration to submit, by \nSeptember 6 of this year, a detailed subvention demonstration \nimplementation plan. This will give the administration 2 months to make \nup their mind how they want to do it and still gives Congress time to \nact before we adjourn to set up the program this year. We also \nauthorize $75 million of funding, based on Congressional Budget Office \nscoring, that would be available if in fact the program does cost more \nthan conventional Medicare, which I doubt. This will allow us to move \nahead but, on the other hand, not impose on Health and Human Services \nand the Defense Department a program that they are not fully \ncomfortable with.\n\n  My objective here is not to impose a plan that I have written. My \nobjective is to simply provide equity. It seems to me that equity is \ngiving people the right to choose. My goal is that through this \namendment, which hopefully we will adopt today, we will plant the seed \nwhereby on September 6 the administration will give us a concrete \nprogram that we can adopt to begin the process of living up to the \ncommitments we made to our military retirees. In addition, we also \nmandate that by January 3 the administration present a feasibility \nstudy to allow military retirees to consume medicine in our military \nhospitals on a fee-for-service basis.\n  With the combination of these two requirements I think we are making \na major step toward living up to the commitments we gave to our \nmilitary retirees.\n  I am hopeful that we will be successful with this amendment. I think \nit is a very important amendment. My view is, when you tell people you \nare going to do something, you have an obligation to try to live up to \nit. We can do that with this amendment and with a follow up that will \nbe required from it.\n  I am delighted to know that the amendment is going to be accepted.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nTexas for offering this amendment. I think he is doing a great service \nto the people, in the military establishment especially.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. Legislation which \nwould enable Medicare eligible military retirees to enroll in the \nmilitary health care system is the issue about which I receive the most \nmail from South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\n  Military retirees and their families become very comfortable with the \nmilitary health care system during their many years of service. In many \ncases, these veterans first experience with health care as adults came \nat the hands of an Army, Navy, or Air Force physician. Their children \nwere born in military hospitals, untold numbers of colds, bouts of flu, \nbroken bones, and other medical maladies have been treated within the \nmilitary health care system.\n  Once these retired personnel reach age 65 and become eligible for \nMedicare, their status in the military system changes dramatically. \nSuddenly, through no fault of their own, they are no longer welcome \nexcept on a space-available basis. When these veterans of 20 or more \nyears of dedicated, selfless service to the Nation discover that they \nare not welcome in the military health care system, it is a terrible \nshock. When servicemembers are recruited, they are told that one of the \nbenefits of their service is health care for life. Throughout their \ncareer, when they reenlist, this benefit is reinforced by the career \ncounselors. Whether or not these statements are true or even authorized \nby the military departments, they are made. Clearly, military personnel \nbelieve that health care for life is a benefit of their service.\n  As Members of Congress, we are accustomed to reading the details of \nthe statutes. We know that there is no statuatory basis for a promise \nof health care for life if someone serves a full career in the \nmilitary. We also know that when every American reaches age 65, \nMedicare becomes the primary health care provider. All of these laws \nnotwithstanding, recruiters, career counselors, commanders, first \nsergeants, and the military support associations continue to lead \nservicemembers to believe that they can receive medical care within the \nmilitary system forever. We have a commitment to live up to the \npromises made by representatives of the Nation. This amendment goes a \nlong way toward accomplishing that goal.\n  Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the leadership, vision, and \nenergy that Senator Dole brought to the issue of Medicare subvention. \nSenator Dole clearly took the lead within the Senate to make Medicare \nsubvention a reality. If he were here today, this would be his \namendment. He would be the champion leading the effort not only in the \nSenate but in discussions with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives. I wish he could be here to share his passion for our \nveterans and to see the amendment move forward. I am sure he is \nfollowing the issue where ever he is. I am proud to have worked with \nhim to achieve the progress we have. I promise him and our veterans to \ncontinue the effort to get Medicare subvention fully implemented.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. This amendment is not the end game. I \nhad hoped that we could pass legislation which would have directed \nimplementation of a Medicare subvention demonstration within 90 days of \nenactment. Unfortunately, the details could not be worked out to the \nsatisfaction of all parties who must agree. We will get there and this \namendment moves the effort forward. I congratuate Senator Gramm again \nfor his persistence in pushing his amendment. I thank Senator Roth, \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for his cooperation and commitment \nto work with us to achieve Medicare subvention. I am confident that, \ntogether, we will pass Medicare subvention that will permit the \nSecretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nfully implement this important program. Only then will we have \nfulfilled our commitment to our retired military personnel and their \nfamilies. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment which \naddresses Medicare subvention, a key issue to the military health care \nprogram and Medicare-eligible military retirees and their families.\n  To understand why Medicare subvention is so vital to the military \nhealth care system, it is necessary to understand how Medicare-eligible \nretirees are treated under the current system. Under Medicare everyone \nover the age of 65 receives medical coverage through Medicare. \nTherefore, when military retirees reach the age of 65 they lose their \neligibility for CHAMPUS and may only use military medical facilities on \na limited space-available basis. This care is delivered on a \nnonreimbursable basis, which means that Medicare does not pay for the \nhealth care which the Department of Defense provides to Medicare-\neligible beneficiaries. The Department of Defense estimates that this \ncost exceeds $1 billion annually.\n  As defense downsizing progresses, and TRICARE, the managed care \nsupport initiative of the military health system moves toward full \nimplementation, there will be less and less space available in military \ntreatment facilities to provide care to retirees. This means that \nMedicare-eligibles will be forced out of a system which they understand \nand have come to rely on.\n  Medicare subvention would ensure Medicare-eligible military retirees \nhealth care by allowing them to enroll in TRICARE. Our military \nretirees have made great sacrifices for the defense of this Nation and \nhave dedicated many years to military service. Medicare subvention \nwould prevent military retirees and their families from being locked \nout of a system which they trust, which they understand, and which has \nbeen promised to them.\n  The amendment before us today does not provide authorization for \nMedicare subvention. It does, however display a commitment to this \nimportant initiative. While I am encouraged by the progress that has \nbeen made in this area, I also believe that it is necessary to \nincorporate Medicare subvention into an overall Medicare reform \npackage.\n  I urge your support of this support amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have cleared the Gramm amendment now \non both sides, and we are ready to vote on it. I call for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Gramm amendment \nNo. 4083?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I suggest we have a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If not there is no further debate, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4083) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a staff \nmember of Senator Kyl, Kim Wold, be granted the privilege of the floor \nthis afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6582-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6584-S6585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\nNOMINATION OF ALAN GREENSPAN, OF NEW YORK, TO BE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD \n               OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had hoped we would have more Senators \nstill on the floor so I can talk about this. While a great effort is \nbeing made by the managers of the bill on both sides, we still have a \ngood way to go on this bill, and we do not have a lot of time to get \nour work done this year.\n  I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle, if you have an amendment, \nplease come to the floor and offer it this afternoon. We have an \nagreement. We are going to go, I believe, to the Pryor amendment next. \nWhen that is completed, we would like to go to other amendments.\n  I am hearing Senators say, they are not ready, they would like to do \nit next week. We also intend to be in tomorrow. We would like to, after \nSenators talk in morning business, continue on the DOD authorization \nbill and get some amendments done.\n  Senator Daschle and I have been talking about exactly how tomorrow \nwill be handled, and we are continuing to work on an agreement with \nregard to the small business tax package and minimum wage. We are very, \nvery, very close, I think, to having an agreement, although it has been \nvery difficult to get that.\n  But my point is this: If Senators will not come and offer their \namendments during the day on Thursday, will not offer their amendments \nduring the day on Friday, we are going to be in session next Tuesday \nnight and Wednesday night and people are going to be whining about why \nwe are here.\n  Senator Daschle and I are trying to show we want to be different, to \nbe reasonable, get out before too late at night and go home and eat \nsome supper with our families, but if we do not get cooperation during \nthe daytime, it leaves us no option.\n  So I hope if Senators on both sides of the aisle have an amendment, I \ncannot imagine you are not ready now but you will be on Tuesday. Again, \nI urge Senators to do that so we can complete this bill early next \nweek, because we still have the other bills we want to consider, \nincluding the possibility of one or two appropriations bills.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Pryor is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I think under the unanimous-consent agreement reached last \nnight, I was to be recognized at this point. Mr. President, if there is \nno objection, I would like to yield 3 or 4 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska who wants to make a statement, and then also to the Senator \nfrom Idaho and the Senator from New Mexico who have an amendment that I \nunderstand will be presented and accepted perhaps by a voice vote. \nThen, if there is no objection, I hope to be recognized. I ask \nunanimous consent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n  Mr. EXON. I inquire of the Chair, what is the pending business before \nthe Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendments are \nto be laid aside so that the business of the Senator from Arkansas can \nbe considered.\n  Mr. EXON. And the underlying amendment is a Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have one amendment, No. 4052 of the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, before I make a comment with regard to the \nKyl amendment, which I have talked about previously and will be talking \nabout again at some length, if necessary, I would just like to make a \ncomment that I was rather disappointed in the votes we just had. We \njust had two controversial nominations: One, Mr. Greenspan and one, Ms. \nRivlin.\n  I was very pleased to see, although the Greenspan nomination was \ncontroversial, it had a strong bipartisan flavor of support on a vote \nof 91 to 7. Frankly, I was quite disappointed at the lack of similar \nconsideration for the other nomination that some people thought was \ncontroversial with regard to Ms. Rivlin.\n  We all know Alice Rivlin and have known her for a very, very long \ntime. Frankly, I was discouraged that the bipartisan spirit that has to \nbe part of the Federal Reserve Board was not accepted nearly as handily \nas was the Greenspan nomination.\n  Ms. Rivlin was confirmed by a vote of 57 for and 41 against. I thank \nthose few Members on the Republican side of the aisle who at least, in \nthis instance, showed the same bipartisan support that those of us on \nthis side of the aisle showed for Mr. Greenspan. Frankly, I was quite \ndisappointed and, I think, this is a point in the Senate that should be \nraised.\n  There must be sometime when we can lay partisanship aside and \nrecognize and realize that we have a two-party system that still is \ndesigned to function here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6586-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6586-S6605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4049\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Holum.\n\n       Dear Senator Exon: Special Assistant to the President for \n     Legislative Affairs, William C. Danvers, has provided you the \n     Administration's reason for opposing the Kyl-Reid amendment \n     to the FY 1997 Defense Authorization Bill.\n       As I represent the lead agency in the Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty negotiations in Geneva, I want to emphasize our \n     belief that this amendment could undermine our efforts \n     to negotiate a Treaty that would end nuclear testing for \n     all time by suggesting a possible U.S. interest in \n     resuming testing before the CTBT enters into force, that \n     does not, in fact, exist.\n\n       Since the end of President Eisenhower's tenure, the United \n     States has pursued a CTBT as the long-term goal. Now, when \n     such a treaty is in hand, we urge the members of the Senate \n     to oppose this amendment and to reaffirm our country's \n     longstanding bipartisan efforts to achieve a CTBT.\n\n  A second memorandum from the Secretary of Energy:\n\n       The nuclear weapons testing moratorium instituted by the \n     Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment has made a significant \n     contribution to the U.S. nuclear non-proliferation \n     efforts. During the duration of the moratorium, the U.S. \n     stockpile of nuclear weapons has remained safe and \n     reliable. There is no requirement to resuming testing or \n     even to plan to resume testing for safety or reliability \n     or any other purpose, at this time. The Department of \n     Energy, with the full support of the Department of \n     Defense, has embarked on an ambitious stockpile \n     stewardship program to ensure that the safety and \n     reliability of the stockpile is maintained into the \n     foreseeable future, without nuclear testing. One of the \n     elements of stockpile stewardship is maintaining the \n     readiness of the Nevada Test Site to resume testing if it \n     is in the supreme national interest of the United States \n     to do so. DOE is committed to maintaining this readiness, \n     consistent with Presidential direction. DOE has confidence \n     in the stockpile stewardship program and does not need the \n     authority that this amendment would provide.\n       President Clinton has already outlined his commitment to \n     maintain the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile \n     under the existing moratorium and under a comprehensive test \n     ban treaty. It is premature to make any statutory changes to \n     the existing moratorium legislation. Any changes should be \n     made only in the context of a negotiated and signed \n     comprehensive test ban treaty. Any changes in the current \n     statutory prohibition on underground nuclear weapons testing \n     at\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\n     this time certainly does not help the negotiation process, \n     and could very well set it back. Achieving a comprehensive \n     test ban treaty is a key to reducing the global nuclear \n     danger including proliferation of nuclear weapons and the \n     spread of nuclear terrorism.\n\n  Last, Mr. President, a letter from the National Security Council.\n  These are of the same date.\n\n       Dear Senator Exon: You have requested the Administration's \n     views on the amendment offered by Senators Kyl and Reid \n     concerning nuclear testing and the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty (CTBT). The Administration is strongly opposed to this \n     amendment.\n       We believe that the amendment could not come at a worse \n     time. The states that are negotiating in the CTBT \n     negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva \n     have set a deadline of June 28--next Friday--to complete this \n     historic treaty. The amendment could be interpreted by some \n     CD states as signaling a possible U.S. intent to conduct a \n     round of nuclear testing after the CTBT is completed but \n     before it enters into force. The Administration has no such \n     plans or intentions, nor has it requested funding for any \n     such tests. Moreover, the amendment would relax the existing \n     legislative moratorium on U.S. testing just at the time the \n     only remaining state still conducting nuclear tests, China, \n     has announced that it will joint the global moratorium in \n     September.\n       As you know, we are confident that our Science-Based \n     Stockpile Stewardship will ensure that we can meet the \n     challenge of maintaining the reliability and safety of our \n     nuclear inventory absent nuclear testing. Nonetheless, \n     because he considers this to be a supreme national interest \n     of the United States, the President has pledged that after \n     the CTBT enters into force, he would be prepared to withdraw \n     from the Treaty in the event, however unlikely, that he was \n     informed by the Secretaries of Defense and Energy that a high \n     level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear \n     weapon type critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer \n     be certified. There is concern on the part of the amendment's \n     co-sponsors that if such a problem arose after September 30 \n     but before the CTBT entered into force, current law would \n     prohibit remedial testing.\n       If that were to occur, it is important to recognize that \n     one or more years would be required to prepare for any \n     resumption of nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site. During \n     this time, we would be able to obtain the necessary funding \n     and legislative relief to carry out the necessary tests.\n       In short, the Administration believes that the Kyl-Reid \n     Amendment is not only not necessary, but it also entails a \n     genuine risk of delaying or derailing the CTBT negotiations \n     just as we may well be poised to achieve a global ban on \n     nuclear testing.\n\n  Signed by the Special Assistant to the President on Legislative \nAffairs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these three letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    United States Arms Control and\n\n\n                                           Disarmament Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1996.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that has been offered \nby myself, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Murkowski, and Senator Johnston. It deals with a very important \npart of our nuclear waste management in this country, specifically the \nwaste isolation pilot plant in Carlsbad, NM.\n  In working with all of our colleagues, our effort has been to remove \nthe unnecessary delays and bureaucratic requirements to achieve the \nmajor environmental objectives that are so critical to the State of New \nMexico, and to save taxpayers' money, while at the same time showing \nour country that we can move and act responsibly in the area of \ntransuranic waste.\n  The amendment that we have before us, that will become a part of this \npending legislation, will amend the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land \nWithdrawal Act of 1992 in several ways. It deletes obsolete language of \nthe 1992 act. Particularly important is the reference and requirements \nfor ``test phase\" activities.\n  Since the enactment of the 1992 act, the Department of Energy has \nabandoned the test phase that called for underground testing in favor \nof above ground laboratory test programs.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, is agreed to by the Department of \nEnergy and by the Environmental Protection Agency. It allows the kind \nof phase necessary to test to completion to assure all of our citizens, \nand especially the citizens of New Mexico, that this is a safe and \nsound facility.\n  Most important, along with all of this, in streamlining the process, \nit would remove duplicative regulation and save the taxpayers' dollars. \nWe hope that it will have that effect.\n  Mr. President, my amendment will clear up several unnecessary and \ndelaying bureaucratic requirements that currently exist in the Waste \nIsolation Pilot Land Withdrawal Act, Public Law 102-579, so the WIPP \nfacility can be opened. It also meets a major environmental objective \nwhile saving the taxpayer money.\n  The purpose of the WIPP is to provide for the safe disposal of \ntransuranic [TRU] radioactive and mixed wastes resulting from defense \nactivities and programs of the United States. These materials are \ncurrently stored at temporary facilities, and until WIPP is opened, \nlittle can be done to clean up and close these temporary storage sites.\n  Idaho currently stores the largest amount of TRU waste of any State \nin the Union, but Idaho is not alone. Washington, Colorado, South \nCarolina, and New Mexico also temporarily store TRU waste.\n  The agreement recently negotiated between the State of Idaho, the DOE \nand the U.S. Navy states that the TRU currently located in Idaho will \nbegin to be shipped to WIPP by April 30, 1999.\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\nThis legislation will assure this commitment is fulfilled by clearly \nstating that it is the intent of Congress that the Secretary of Energy \nwill complete all actions needed to commence emplacement of TRU waste \nat WIPP no later than November 30, 1997.\n  We cannot solve the environmental problems at sites such as the Idaho \nNational Engineering Laboratory, Rocky Flats Weapons Facility, Savannah \nRiver and others without WIPP. The reason is obvious. Without a place \nto dispose of the waste, cleanup is impossible, and without cleanup, \nfurther decommissioning can not occur.\n  The goal of this bill is simple: To deliver on Congress' longstanding \ncommitment to open WIPP by 1998.\n  This bill amends the Waste Isolation Land Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal \nAct of 1992 in several very significant ways.\n  It deletes obsolete language in the 1992 act. Of particular \nimportance is the reference and requirements for test phase activities. \nSince the enactment of the 1992 act, the Department of Energy [DOE] has \nabandoned the best phase that called for underground testing in favor \nof above ground laboratory test programs. Thus the test phase no longer \nexists as defined in the 1992 law and needs to be removed so it does \nnot complicate the ongoing WIPP process.\n  Most important, this amendment will streamline the process, remove \nduplicative regulations, save taxpayers dollars--currently the costs to \nsimply watch over WIPP exceed $20 million per month.\n  This bill does not remove EPA as the DOE regulator of the WIPP. DOE \nhas stated numerous times that it does not want to self regulate. The \nDepartment believes that having EPA as the regulator will instill \nadditional public confidence in the certification process and the \nfacility itself, once it opens.\n  I am skeptical regarding EPA. EPA has a poor record of meeting \ndeadlines. The WIPP, as a facility, is ready to operate now and is \nbasically waiting on EPA's final approval. The schedule DOE has \nestablished to meet the opening dates is an aggressive but not entirely \nworkable timetable. It is aggressive only if EPA can accomplish its \ntasks on time. Because of EPA's demonstrated inability to meet \nschedules and to avoid imposing unnecessary large financial burdens on \nthe taxpayer, there is a strong sentiment in the Congress to remove EPA \nfrom the WIPP regulatory role. Based on assurance made to me by the \nEPA, my amendment does not follow this course. However, if EPA again \nfalters, I will have to reconsider this position in future legislation.\n  Idaho and the Nation need to have the WIPP opened sooner rather than \nlater. Each day of delay is costly, nearly $1 million per day in \ntaxpayers dollars, and the potential dangers to the environment and \nhuman health resulting from the temporary storage of this waste \ncontinue.\n  It is time to act. We must, if we are to clean up sites such as \nIdaho's. We must act to dispose of this task permanently and safely for \nfuture generations. This amendment clears the way for action.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to ask permission to \nengage in a colloquy with Senator Craig, regarding his amendment to the \nWaste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act. The WIPP Land \nWithdrawal Act withdrew land near Carlsbad, NM, for construction of a \ndisposal facility for transuranic waste produced by the Department of \nEnergy. That act was reported out of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources and enacted in 1992. In addition to providing for the \nwithdrawal of the land, the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act imposed many \nsubstantive and procedural licensing requirements on the WIPP facility. \nMany of these requirements are redundant or have become moot as a \nresult of changes in the program, and should be eliminated. S. 1402, a \nbill introduced by Senators Craig and Johnston to amend the WIPP Land \nWithdrawal Act, has been referred to the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. Does Senator Craig acknowledge that this amendment addresses \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes, this amendment would alter the language of the WIPP \nLand Withdrawal Act, which is within the jurisdiction of the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Although this amendment is within the jurisdiction of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I support the \nsubstantive changes made by the amendment and understand that it is \nimportant to make these changes in a timely manner. Therefore, I will \nnot object to its inclusion in the Defense authorization legislation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I now yield to Senator Bingaman from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do support this amendment. Let me say \nthat when this bill was first introduced in the House, and in the \nSenate as well, I felt it was fatally flawed in several respects. It \ndid, in its first form, propose to eliminate the regulatory role of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. It proposed to allow nondefense \ntransuranic waste to go to WIPP, as well as defense-related transuranic \nwaste. It needed the periodic recertification requirement by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. It deleted authority by EPA to issue \ncriteria.\n  All of those problems have been solved in the amendment that is now \nabout to be voted on here in the Senate. I am very pleased to see the \nimprovements that have been made. I have been in touch with the Under \nSecretary of Energy, Thomas Grumbly, to get his comments on this \nproposed amendment which we are now getting ready to vote on. He \nindicates that he and his staff have reviewed it in detail and support \nthe amendment.\n  I have been also in touch with Mary Nichols, the Assistant \nAdministrator for Air and Radiation in the Environmental Protection \nAgency. She indicates that she is satisfied with this proposed \namendment and believes it is something that we should enact.\n  Mr. President, the foremost concern that I have had, and that I \nbelieve most Members have had, in this facility from the beginning has \nbeen whether or not we were adequately protecting the health and safety \nof our citizens as we went forward to design and develop this \nfacility. I am persuaded we are still adequately protecting that health \nand safety, even under this language. For that reason, I will support \nit.\n\n  I will make the point which needs to be crystal clear that \ntransuranic waste can only be disposed of underground at this facility \nupon completion, by the Administrator of EPA, of a certification that \nfinal disposal regulations have been complied with. That essential \nsafeguard is foremost in this amendment. I think that is very important \nfor the people of New Mexico. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Domenici from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Craig. Senator Bingaman, \nit is a pleasure to be with you here on the floor on this issue.\n  Let me start by reiterating the last comments that Senator Bingaman \nmade. What is most important to us, and what is most important to the \npeople of New Mexico, is that as this underground facility proceeds to \nthe point where it may be opened and finally be a repository, that it \nbe subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's most strict \nrequirements with reference to health and safety. As a matter of fact, \nthey must certify it before it can be opened.\n  I will read for the Record an excerpt from a letter dated May 15, \n1996, from the EPA, Mary D. Nichols, assistant administrator for Air \nand Radiation. I ask unanimous consent that the entire communication be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air and \n           Radiation,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Tom Udall,\n     Attorney General of New Mexico,\n     Santa Fe, NM.\n       Dear Mr. Udall: The purpose of this letter is to follow-up \n     on our telephone conversation of April 1, 1996, and respond \n     to your letter of April 4, 1996, regarding the Environmental \n     Protection Agency's (EPA) role in the regulation of the Waste \n     Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).\n       The Administration is presently formulating its position on \n     H.R. 1663, the ``Skeen-Schaefer Bill'' amending the WIPP Land\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\n     Withdrawal Act (Pub. L. 102-579). I appreciated hearing your \n     views about the legislation and am pleased we had the \n     opportunity to discuss these important issues. The Agency \n     believes that the amended H.R. 1663 is a sound bill and makes \n     critical improvements over its antecedent. As you are aware, \n     the Skeen Bill, as originally proposed, severely limited \n     EPA's regulatory oversight of WIPP and, we believe, did not \n     provide adequate protection of human health and the \n     environment. Mr. Schaefer's amendments retain EPA as the \n     independent regulator of the WIPP, eliminates extraneous \n     requirements, and leaves intact the provisions of the 1992 \n     WIPP Land Withdrawal Act (LWA) that require EPA to certify \n     whether the WIPP facility will comply with the disposal \n     regulations in accordance with public rule-making procedures.\n       You specifically expressed concern about the impact of the \n     proposed legislation on the WIPP certification process. In \n     particular, that review of individual chapters of the \n     Department of Energy's (DOE) compliance application by EPA \n     would require the Agency to commit to a position on the \n     sufficiency of each chapter without public input. While it is \n     true that EPA will review individual chapters prior to \n     receipt of the full application, the Agency will make no \n     determination on the adequacy of any part of the application \n     until: 1) EPA has received the full application from the \n     department; and 2) public comments have been considered. \n     In fact, the Agency has received the first of these \n     chapters and placed it in the certification docket (No. A-\n     93-02) on May 1, 1996. We will be providing written \n     comments to DOE on these chapters. The written comments \n     will also be placed in the public dockets.\n       You also raised concerns about the effect of the proposed \n     legislation on the public's opportunity to provide comment on \n     DOE's application. As in the past, EPA will continue to \n     foster an open public process. As you will note in the final \n     compliance criteria (40 CFR Part 194), EPA will hold two 120-\n     day public comment periods after it receives DOE's full \n     compliance application. The proposed legislation will not \n     affect the process established in the compliance criteria. \n     Furthermore, EPA never planned for or created any process for \n     formal public comment on the completeness of the application. \n     Therefore, since DOE is providing the Agency with individual \n     chapters prior to submission of the full application, the \n     public will have an additional opportunity to comment on, and \n     additional time to review, the individual chapters, via EPA's \n     public docket.\n       Additionally, you were concerned that the proposed H.R. \n     1663 removes the ability of the Administrator to enforce \n     compliance of the WIPP with any law, regulation or permit \n     requirement described in Sec. 9(a)(1) of the LWA. We feel \n     that EPA's ability to ensure compliance with these \n     environmental laws is not compromised by removal of this \n     provision since: 1) the environmental laws described in the \n     LWA contain their own enforcement provisions; and 2) 40 CFR \n     Part 194 imposes requirements that DOE perform remedial \n     actions if the Administrator determines WIPP to be in non-\n     compliance with the transuranic waste disposal standards.\n       Further, with regard to H.R. 1663, you expressed concern \n     about the WIPP being used as a repository for transuranic \n     wastes that did not result from a defense activity. The \n     proposed legislation does not alter the definition of \n     exposure or capacity limits of either remote- or contract-\n     handled wastes set forth in the LWA. If EPA were to certify \n     the WIPP, this provision would allow for disposal of a \n     relatively small amount of waste from a site in West Valley, \n     NY. If WIPP were capable of accepting this waste within the \n     capacity limits of the LWA, it would be imprudent to \n     needlessly spend taxpayer money for a site similar to WIPP \n     for such a small amount of transuranic waste simply \n     because the process which generated the waste was not \n     defense related.\n       Lastly, I am disappointed that you have elected to bring a \n     legal challenge against EPA's WIPP compliance criteria \n     published on February 9, 1996. The EPA considered the views \n     of all interested parties, including the comments and \n     suggestions made by your office, in deciding the contents of \n     the final criteria. As you know, EPA held two public comment \n     periods totaling 135 days, and conducted a series of public \n     hearings in New Mexico. Ultimately, the Administrator of EPA, \n     exercising her independent judgment, determined the contents \n     of the final criteria. We believe EPA's criteria are sound \n     and will effectively protect public health and the \n     environment.\n       I want to assure you that EPA will keep communication lines \n     open as it undertakes the public rulemaking proceeding to \n     certify whether the WIPP facility will comply with the final \n     disposal regulations. We recognize the importance of this \n     matter to you and all of the residents of New Mexico.\n       If you have questions regarding this letter or any other \n     concerns, please contact Frank Marcinowski of my staff at \n     (202) 233-9310.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              mary D. Nichols,\n\n                                           Assistant Administrator\n                                            for Air and Radiation.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This letter is written to the attorney general of New \nMexico in response to inquiries. ``The Agency believes that the amended \nH.R. 1663''--I will state here, for all intents and purposes, is the \nCraig amendment--``is a sound bill and makes critical improvements over \nits antecedent. As you are aware, the Skeen bill, as originally \nproposed, severely limited EPA's regulatory oversight of WIPP and, we \nbelieve, did not provide adequate protection of human health and the \nenvironment. Mr. Schaefer's amendments retain EPA as the independent \nregulator of the WIPP, eliminates extraneous requirements, and leaves \nintact the provisions of the 1992 WIPP Land Withdrawal Act (LWA) that \nrequire EPA to certify whether the WIPP facility will comply with the \ndisposal regulations in accordance with public rule-making \nprocedures.''\n  I do not think it can be any clearer that the EPA wholeheartedly \nsupports this amendment.\n  In summary, the amendment is almost identical to language agreed to \nby DOE and EPA. That agreed-upon language was reported by the House \nCommerce Committee on April 25 and was recently reported by the House \nNational Security Committee.\n  The legislation would:\n  Delete the authorization included in the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act to \nconduct tests underground at WIPP using transuranic waste.\n  The DOE decided in 1992 not to conduct such tests.\n  Require the Secretary of Energy to acquire the oil and gas leases on \nthe WIPP site unless the EPA determines the acquisition is not \nnecessary.\n  Create an incremental licensing process under which DOE will submit \nchapters of the license application one at a time, and EPA would \ncomment one at a time. The EPA would make a final, encompassing \ndecision. The EPA could request additional information from the DOE at \nany time.\n  At the suggestion of the EPA and DOE, provides that the final \ndisposal regulations for WIPP will be the radiation protection \nstandards at 40 C.F.R. 191, and not the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n  The WIPP Land Withdrawal Act required that DOE certify compliance \nwith both, a step DOE and EPA agreed would be redundant.\n  The legislation allows the DOE to use engineered barriers, natural \nbarriers, or any other measures--this last provision being a new \nprovision--to ensure WIPP complies with the final disposal regulations.\n  This allows DOE to use waste treatment, such as vitrification, to \nensure WIPP's compliance.\n  Deletes the section of the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act dealing with \nretrieval of the waste emplaced during the test phase since no waste \nwill be emplaced during a test phase.\n  States that it is the intent of Congress that the Secretary of Energy \nmake a final decision with respect to the disposal of transuranic waste \nat WIPP by November 30, 1997.\n  Provides $20 million per year to New Mexico for impact assistance \nbeginning upon enactment of this legislation.\n  The waste isolation pilot plant is a permanent disposal facility in a \nsalt bed 2,000 feet below New Mexico for transuranic waste generated in \nDOE's nuclear weapons complex.\n  Transuranic waste means waste that includes both radioactive material \nand solvents, metals, and other refuse from manufacturing.\n  The WIPP Land Withdrawal Act enacted on October 30, 1992, authorized \na 5- to 8-year test phase at WIPP during which transuranic waste could \nbe placed in WIPP and monitored.\n  Because of the nature of the waste intended for WIPP, the act also \nmade WIPP subject to two sets of regulations: radiation protection \nstandards and the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n  In 1993, DOE decided it was not necessary to conduct underground \ntests at WIPP using transuranic waste.\n  At the suggestion of DOE and EPA, this amendment makes the WIPP Land \nWithdrawal Act consistent with the current test phase at WIPP and \nremoves the redundancy of two sets of regulatory standards.\n  First, the amendment deletes those sections of the WIPP Land \nWithdrawal Act dealing with tests using transuranic waste.\n  Second, the amendment, at the suggestion of the EPA, subjects WIPP to \nthe radiation protection standards and removes the application of the \nSolid Waste Disposal Act. This is necessary to remove the confusion \nthat occurs by imposing two different sets of regulations.\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\n  Frankly, it is clear that WIPP can meet with Solid Waste Disposal \nAct, its 10,000-year radiation protection standards are going to be the \nreal challenge and the relevant regulations.\n  There are two centers of controversy in that law. First, what hurdles \ndid DOE have to overcome to use transuranic waste for tests in WIPP. \nAnd second, what information had to be revealed by those tests for a \nfinal disposal decision to be made.\n  DOE subsequently decided that tests with transuranic waste were not \nneeded.\n  These changes primarily deal with taking out those provisions of the \nlaw dealing with tests using transuranic waste.\n  The law also required WIPP to meet two different standards for the \ndisposal of waste at WIPP: radiation release standards and solid waste \nstandards.\n  DOE and EPA now agree that demonstrating compliance with both \nstandards is redundant--they agree compliance is best proven by meeting \nthe radiation release standards.\n  The original law also provided New Mexico $20 million per year \nbeginning in the first year transuranic waste was shipped to WIPP. The \nmoney was to be used for roads and other improvements.\n  Because no transuranic waste has been brought to WIPP for the tests, \nNew Mexico has lost out on $160 million that would have otherwise been \nprovided. This law starts the flow of that money immediately so New \nMexico can make the necessary road upgrades.\n  I indicate to the Senate that it is clear this waste isolation pilot \nproject, one of a kind, the first ever, can meet the requirements of \nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act. It is not that act that is cumbersome and \ndifficult to achieve, but rather the 10,000-year radiation protection \nstandards. Let me repeat: 10,000-year radiation protection standards. \nThese are the standards that are going to be in effect after this \namendment is adopted and becomes law. They are in effect now.\n  All we are suggesting is the EPA and the Department of Energy thinks \nthis is the only set of standards that we need follow and that those \nthat are found under the Solid Waste Disposal Act are redundant and not \nneeded in this case.\n  I thank all who have cooperated in getting us this far. It is time to \nget this done. This amendment has been reported out on April 25 from a \nHouse committee and was reported recently by the National Security \nCommittee in the House. It has had hearings and been looked at over and \nover by the regulatory agencies. I believe it is time to adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in favor of this amendment. It is \nvery similar to WIPP legislation introduced last year in the House. \nThat legislation was agreed to by the Department of Energy and \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and goes a long way toward breaking \ndown the regulatory log jams that are holding up this much needed \nfacility.\n  The story of WIPP is a story of false starts and needless delays. The \ndelays in opening WIPP have created a massive backlog of materials that \nare currently being stored at DOE sites throughout the country--often \nin drums and boxes--at a very high cost to the taxpayers. These wastes \nneed to be stabilized and prepared for shipment to a permanent and safe \nrepository. The WIPP facility provides a safe and permanent disposal \noption and we should move forward as rapidly as possible with its \nopening.\n  Mr. President, we need this facility. We need it now. This amendment \nwill help move this facility forward and I wholeheartedly support its \npassage.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce and support \nthe Craig-Kempthorne-Domenici-Bingaman amendment relating to the WIPP \nland withdrawal. The proposed amendment will simplify the land \nwithdrawal process in a number of important ways. For example, the \namendment will reduce the waiting period between the final \ncertification and opening of WIPP from 180 days to 30 days, improve \ninteraction between the Department of Energy and the Environmental \nProtection Agency, remove duplicative regulatory requirements, save the \ntaxpayers money, expedite the opening of WIPP, and protect the \nenvironment, health, and safety of the citizens of New Mexico. In \naddition, the amendment is similar to a legislation in the other body \nwhich is supported by the Department of Energy and the Environmental \nProtection Agency. This is a good bipartisan amendment, supported by \nthe administration, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  The WIPP facility plays an important role in our Nation's effort to \nshow its citizens that we can deal responsibly with the nuclear waste \nleft over from our victory in the cold war. The WIPP facility will \nserve as a permanent repository for transuranic waste. The waste will \nbe entombed in a salt cavern that slowly seals itself over time. I have \nvisited the WIPP facility and I met with numerous local and State \nofficials from New Mexico who strongly support this project.\n  THe WIPP facility will also allow the Federal Government to meet its \ncourt-enforceable commitment to the State of Idaho to ship transuranic \nwaste from Idaho by 1999. The proposed amendment will help ensure the \nopening of this important facility in time to meet this commitment. \nWIPP will serve as a symbol of our ability to dispose of nuclear \nmaterial in a safe and rational way.\n  I want to thank the two able Senators from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici and Senator Bingaman, for their help in drafting this \nbipartisan amendment. I also want to thank Senators Murkowski and \nJohnston, chairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee, for \ntheir support for this important amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me close by thanking all of my \ncolleagues for the cooperation and their participation in getting this \namendment to the floor. Without the help of Senator Domenici and \nSenator Bingaman, this amendment would not be here today. They are the \nhost States, but they have also been extremely diligent in assuring the \ncitizens of their State that once this is in place, it is \nenvironmentally sound and certainly protects, in all ways, their \ncitizens.\n  In my State of Idaho, the Governors' agreement is now negotiated and \ncompleted by a Federal court order. It could not go forward without \nthis amendment. Now we have this amendment in place, protecting all of \nthe environmental concerns involved, solving many of the environmental \nproblems we have in our State.\n  Let me thank my colleagues for their participation. I ask that the \namendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 4085, offered by the Senators from Idaho \nand New Mexico.\n  The amendment (No. 4085) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nArkansas is now recognized.\n\n\n                Conforming Amendment to GATT Legislation\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I will take a very few moments this \nafternoon to refresh my colleagues' memories as to why we are here \nagain to act on the GATT issue.\n  When the Congress passed the GATT legislation, we made two changes to \nU.S. patent law. First, all patents were extended from 17 to 20 years \nin length. That is the law today for all patents in every industry in \nthis country.\n  Second, we adopted a grandfather provision which permitted generic \ncompetitors in all industries to go to the market on the original 17-\nyear date if they had made a substantial investment and if they paid a \nroyalty to the patent holder.\n  But according to the U.S. Trade Representative, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the \nPatent and Trademark Office, the Congress accidentally--and I underline \n``accidentally''--omitted a conforming amendment in the GATT \nlegislation. The Congressional Record also documents our very clear \nintent to apply the GATT treaty universally without any special \nexceptions.\n  Mr. President, as a result of our error and this missing amendment, a \nsingle\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\nindustry has now been exempted from the GATT grandfather provision. \nEvery single product, every company, and every industry in this country \nabide by this law today, except for one particular industry. That is \nthe prescription drug industry.\n  The omission of this single industry has created a loophole that \nbenefits just a few drug companies, especially Glaxo Wellcome. The \nloophole, Mr. President, in the GATT legislation has given them a $2.5 \nbillion windfall. That's $5 million a day. As long as we wait and talk \nand do nothing, these few drug companies are receiving millions every \nday which are subsidized by the elderly, by the veterans and by the \nconsumers of America. Today, we have an opportunity to put this to an \nend. We could bring equity at long last to this issue.\n  Glaxo Wellcome is the largest drug firm in the world. It is today \nreceiving a lion's share of this multibillion dollar windfall through \nthe world's best-selling drug, Zantac.\n  Today, generic competitors to Zantac who have already made a \nsubstantial investment and readied their products for the market have \nbeen unintentionally denied access to the marketplace. Today, they have \nidled their factories and their workers wait for us to act. Today, the \nconsumers of America are being denied cheaper prices for their drugs \nwhich they should have received months ago.\n  The amendment that I offer today, Mr. President, on behalf of Senator \nBrown, Senator Chafee, and Senator Bryan, is simply the conforming \namendment which should have been a part of the GATT legislation. This \nis our opportunity to fix a glaring legislative mistake. In the \nprocess, we will save American consumers literally billions of dollars, \nand we will bring our country into full compliance with our treaty \nobligations.\n  Let me remind my colleagues how our friend and colleague, Senator \nPaul Simon of Illinois, recently summed up this issue. He said: ``This \nis as classic a case of public interest versus special interest as you \ncould find.''\n  Last December, we brought this amendment to the floor and \nunsuccessfully sought an up-or-down vote on it. There was an effort to \nkill the amendment with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that called \nfor a hearing in the Judiciary Committee. When we withdrew the \namendment from consideration, we promised, like General MacArthur, to \nreturn.\n  But there have been many delays and postponements in the last several \nmonths and procedural obstacles thrown up by our opponents. For some \nmysterious reason, the hearing that was promised took more than 2 whole \nmonths to schedule. A markup was promised for March. It was postponed \nthree different times for over a month.\n  Mr. President, here is the price for our opponents' delay. Here is \nthe price that American consumers are paying and putting into the \npockets of a few drug companies. As a result of our delay, a few \ncompanies have collected $990 million as a windfall. We are just 2 days \nshort of permitting this to grow into a round $1 billion windfall, a \nwindfall which continues because of a congressional mistake we have \nstill not corrected.\n  We have waited and waited and waited, while the Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing and markup. The result of all this delay is that now the \nrecord simply verifies that a costly mistake has been made which needs \ncorrection. Ambassador Mickey Kantor, then our Trade Representative, \ntestified at the hearing that our amendment ``would do nothing more \nthan fulfill our obligation to be faithful to what we had negotiated in \nthe GATT treaty.'' He confirmed that it ``would carry out the intent, \nnot only of the negotiations and what the administration intended, but \nalso what the Congress intended.''\n  When the Judiciary Committee marked up the GATT amendment, it \nregrettably ordered and reported out a fatally flawed substitute \nversion. According to a letter from the Department of Health and Human \nServices which has been distributed to each Member of the Senate, the \nFDA and the Department concluded that the Judiciary or Hatch substitute \ndoes not close the loophole. In fact, it would be virtually impossible \nfor a manufacturer to obtain FDA approval under the substitute.\n  To add insult to injury, Mr. President, the substitute version \nincludes a veritable treasure trove of patent extensions and special \nbreaks for other drug companies that are completely unrelated to the \nGATT loophole. So we have all waited endlessly, enriched a few \ncompanies and ended up with a substitute which is worse than the status \nquo.\n  I would add, Mr. President, that the committee marked up on May 2. \nThe committee has yet to file a report on the substitute version. In \nfact, the committee also has guaranteed we delay for months the \nconsideration of our amendment. Moreover, I understand the \ndistinguished committee chairman, Senator Hatch, will offer the \nsubstitute version as a second-degree amendment to our own and further \ndelay consideration.\n  Mr. President, the only compromise in the committee's work is a \ncompromise of the interests of consumers and our Nation's vital health \ncare programs--Medicaid, Defense Department and CHAMPUS, VA, Public \nHealth and Indian Health Service clinics, private health insurers, and \nthe like.\n\n  We have a very clear choice before us this afternoon. We can do the \nright thing. We can do the right thing by voting for this amendment. We \ncan do the right thing by defeating the substitute version offered as a \nsecond-degree amendment by the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  Many have asked me, Mr. President, why we are offering this amendment \non the Department of Defense authorization bill. There is a very simple \nanswer. First, this amendment would save the Department of Defense over \n$30 million. The Department of Defense has estimated that it spends \n$900 million a year on prescription drugs for our servicemen, \nservicewomen, and their families. According to estimates consistent \nwith earlier CBO estimates for Medicaid savings, our GATT amendment \nwould cut those expenditures by over $30 million.\n  Mr. President, for this reason alone, we think this is a proper place \nto bring this amendment to the attention of our colleagues with the \nintention of receiving their consideration and, hopefully, a positive \nvote.\n  I also want to summarize, if I might, Mr. President, what I think may \nbecome a second-degree amendment to the Pryor-Chafee-Brown-Bryan bill. \nFirst, the Department of Health and Human Services, as I have \nmentioned, has analyzed the substitute. They concluded that ``it does \nnot close the GATT loophole'' and includes legal requirements that are \n``nearly impossible to meet'' and ``present nearly insurmountable \nobstacles'' to fair competition.\n  Second, the substitute was originally drafted by the brand name drug \nindustry association, PHRMA. We have a copy of the PHRMA draft. As \nPHRMA wrote, the substitute ``protects the interests of PHRMA \nmembers''--not consumers, and certainly not taxpayers.\n  As a result, Mr. President, the Hatch amendment that we may be \nconsidering--which looks like a Rube Goldberg design as far as judicial \nprocedure is concerned--may be described better as a Christmas tree. It \nis a Christmas tree of special interest favors, new multimillion dollar \npatent extensions and provisions intended to overturn Federal court \ndecisions. This Christmas tree preserves the GATT loophole. It blocks \ngeneric competition. It protects the Glaxo windfall. It overturns the \nFederal courts. It guarantees endless litigation. It rewards companies \nlike Merck, Zeneca, and Wyeth with millions in special protections \nwithout giving my colleagues and I a single credible legal or policy \njustification.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Professor Leo Levin, professor emeritus of \nlaw at the University of Pennsylvania, is one of the world's leading \nexperts on the problems of cost and delay in civil litigation. I \nthought it would be interesting if we mentioned the opinions of \nProfessor Levin, the former director of the Federal Judicial Center. \nHere is what Professor Levin thinks of the Hatch substitute:\n\n       My conclusion is that, conservatively, I would expect \n     several years to elapse from the commencement of litigation \n     under the Hatch substitute until final disposition on appeal.\n  In other words, this is an ironclad guarantee to Glaxo and its \ncompatriots that they can collect their entire $2.5 billion windfall. \nIt is an ironclad guarantee that competition will be \n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\nlocked out and that windfall profits flow to the wrong parties.\n  There is also a sense-of-the-Senate provision in the Hatch substitute \nwhich purports to urge parties to litigate quickly. I am sure my \ncolleague from Utah will say this is a godsend; that it will somehow \ncompel the parties to go to court and resolve their differences quickly \nso that we can have free and orderly competition.\n  Here is what Professor Levin concluded about that particular sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution embodied in the Hatch substitute:\n\n       This is a laudable sentiment but without legal impact. In \n     short, it evidences recognition of the problem but not an \n     effective solution to the problem.\n\n  Mr. President, I could talk on and on about this issue. I do not \nthink we need to talk a lot longer about it. I would like to say that I \nwould enjoy proceeding, if we could. I would be more than happy to \nenter into an agreement on time. I have not actually sent the amendment \nto the desk. I will do so at the appropriate time. But I see my \ncolleague from Utah standing. I wonder if he has any comment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, do we have a time agreement?\n  Mr. PRYOR. We do not have a time agreement. I am more than willing to \nenter into a time agreement for a vote on our amendment to take place.\n  Mr. THURMOND. What does the Senator suggest as a time agreement?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest that we have no more than an \nhour, or perhaps even a 45-minute time agreement. I would like to \ninquire of my friend from Utah whether this is agreeable.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are agreeable to 45 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Equally divided?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I am just proposing that.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding that Senator Pryor has an \namendment. I believe the Senator from South Carolina will second degree \nthe amendment. I will agree to a 45-minute time limit divided equally \non both amendments in order to accommodate my colleague, even though I \nthink I need almost a half-hour to speak on it. But I will agree to 45 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been no unanimous consent offered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the time limit we discussed agreeable to my colleague?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would like to make two requests. One, before I agree to \nsuch a proposal, I would like to see the amendment in the second \ndegree. I think it would be only fair because the Senator from Utah has \nhad our amendment for many, many months. Second, I would like to ask, \nshould we agree to a time agreement, that I may be immediately \nrecognized should my amendment be tabled or should the second-degree \namendment prevail.\n  Mr. HATCH. I did not hear your whole sentence. Your amendment to be \nwhat?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Should the Hatch amendment be agreed to. I should phrase \nit that way.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Parliamentarian please state what the offer was?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, could we pause long enough to let him \nsend the amendment to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Arkansas wish to \nrestate the last point that he made?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to put in a unanimous consent \nrequest, that should the Hatch second-degree amendment prevail--and I \nnot get the vote on my amendment--that I might be immediately \nrecognized for an up-or-down vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. If we prevail?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would simply reoffer my amendment, and I would like to \nbe recognized for that purpose. And I ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HATCH. If we win, we win; if we lose, we lose. But we prefer to \ndo it in the routine parliamentary fashion.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, that is precisely what I seek. If I may, I \nthink we can resolve this together if I may respectfully suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative check proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask my dear friend from Arkansas to \ncorrect me if I misstate this. It is my understanding that Senator \nPryor will neither offer his amendment today, nor does he believe \nanybody else will offer a similar amendment today. We will save the \nvote for another day, but we will each make a few comments today.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, under the circumstances--and the \ncircumstances are these--I have been waiting since January to offer \nthis amendment. I think, as a Member of this body, I am entitled to \nhave a vote on this amendment. Maybe it is a tabling motion. I am not \nobjecting to that. But I think on this particular amendment and on this \nlanguage, this Senator is entitled to this body deciding, yes, we do \nwant this amendment or, no, we do not.\n  That is all I have asked for all year. It is all I am asking for now. \nIt is apparent I am not going to get that, so I am not going to send up \nan amendment at this time, and I will wait until next week or I might \nwait until next July or I might wait until next September, whenever. \nBut I am going to offer this amendment, and I hope to get a vote on it. \nI hope my colleagues will allow me to get a vote on it. I have never \nsecond degreed an amendment here in 18 years--never. In fact, I have \nnever even been tempted to. And I am not going to second degree my own \namendment. I am not going to get cute, parliamentarily speaking. I hope \nmy colleague from Utah will understand and the managers will \nunderstand, but I just do not think it is protecting of my rights now \nto offer an amendment.\n  If I may, I would like to ask unanimous consent to add a few \ncosponsors: Senator Byrd, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Leahy, all to be \noriginal cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am prepared to put this to a vote today. \nAs I understand it, if the Senator had called up his amendment, then \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina would have called up his \nsecond-degree amendment, which is certainly both legitimate under the \nrules and a common practice in the Senate whenever we have some of \nthese very sensitive, difficult matters to consider.\n  Let me say this, Mr. President. I admire my colleague from Arkansas. \nWe have been friends for years. He feels very deeply about this.\n  But there are many of us who feel very deeply about our side of the \nissue.\n  When the time comes, I will ask my colleagues to vote against the \nPryor amendment and to vote for the compromise legislation on the GATT/\nPharmaceutical patent issue that was recently adopted by a bipartisan \nvote of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I know many here are asking themselves how many times are we going to \nhave to debate this issue? And, for that matter, they are asking why we \nare considering it on an underlying bill that is, at best, only \ntangentially related to the subject matter of our amendment.\n  We considered the Pryor amendment in the Finance Committee last fall \nas part of the budget reconciliation bill, and the committee rejected \nit.\n  We considered the amendment on December 7 as an amendment to the \npartial-birth abortion ban bill, and the amendment was not adopted.\n  My colleagues attempted to offer the bill as an amendment to the \nKassebaum-Kennedy health insurance bill, and it was withdrawn.\n  In counterpoint to the efforts of Senator Pryor, the Judiciary \nCommittee held a February 27 hearing, as I promised.\n  On May 2, we held a markup, as I promised.\n  We wanted to hold the markup before then, but consideration of the \nimmigration bill took longer than anyone anticipated.\n  The point is that we held the markup, and we did it in as expedited a \nfashion as possible.\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\n  I am pleased to say that, with the support of Senators Specter and \nHeflin, we were able to forge a bipartisan compromise that was adopted \non a 10-to-7 vote.\n  We are working hard to file a report on this bill. We do not yet have \nthe CBO on-budget estimates, nor do we have their newly required off-\nbudget, unfunded mandates analysis.\n  In short, to bring the Pryor-Brown-Chafee amendment up at this time \nwould be to attempt to short-circuit the process that is well underway \nin the Judiciary Committee.\n  Senator Pryor's amendment is nothing more than an effort to engender \nsupport for an approach that the Judiciary Committee has already \nconsidered and rejected.\n  And while my preference would be to consider the Judiciary Committee \ncompromise as a freestanding measure, it is clear such will probably \nnot be the case.\n  I have been around this body long enough to know that you cannot \nalways pick the time and place for a debate. If today is the day, so be \nit.\n  I thank my colleague for accommodating me in bringing it up at this \ntime and giving me notice. I hope that in the future we can notify each \nother on this and, as always, treat each other fairly.\n  I also hope that a great majority of my colleagues will agree with me \nthat the Pryor amendment is unwarranted and that the Judiciary \nCommittee compromise that Senator Thurmond will offer should be adopted \nby the Senate.\n  Before I describe why I think the Judiciary Committee compromise is \npreferable to the Pryor amendment, I just want to recognize the fact \nthat many in this body have spent a considerable amount of time on this \nsomewhat arcane but very important subject.\n  Although I firmly disagree with Senators Brown, Pryor, and Chafee on \nthis matter, I respect each of them. They are good Senators. Frankly, I \nwould prefer working together with them rather than in opposition.\n  In fact, despite our sharp differences on this particular issue, \nSenators Pryor, Chafee, and I are working closely together on the \nFinance Committee to ensure adequate funding of community health \ncenters and rural health clinics.\n  I will miss debating David Pryor on these tough and complex \npharmaceutical issues when he retires from the Senate later this year. \nThe same is true for Hank Brown, our good friend.\n  I will also miss Senator Heflin, a great friend who has been on the \nJudiciary Committee almost as long as I have. He studied this issue \ncarefully as well. I fully agree with the observation he made at one of \nour recent Judiciary Committee hearings that the generic and innovator \nsegments of the industry have much more in common than they have in \ncontention. I was particularly pleased that Senator Heflin voted for \nthe Judiciary Committee compromise, although he voted with Senator \nPryor last December.\n  I also wish to commend especially my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, with helping to develop the Judiciary Committee \ncompromise proposal. He played a critical role in this effort. I want \neveryone to understand how much the other members of the Judiciary \nCommittee and I value his leadership in this area.\n  The issue we are debating today centers on the complex \ninterrelationship between the GATT treaty, the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act, and the Patent Code. In particular, the question is how \ncertain transition rules contained in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act \napply to pioneer pharmaceutical patents which have been extended by the \nURAA.\n  This is a tough, contentious issue. That is because there is an \ninherent tension involved in setting and adjusting the incentives that \nwill result in both the next generation of breakthrough therapies and \nin making low-cost generic equivalents available. The American people \nneed both breakthrough innovator products and lower cost generics.\n  But as former Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop has wisely \nobserved:\n\n       ``. . . we must resist the temptations of short-term \n     thinking and look at the big picture. The only way to make a \n     real difference in health care costs--and a real \n     difference in people's lives--is to find cures for AIDS, \n     cancer, Alzheimer's and . . . other diseases. The way to \n     do that is to encourage support for medical innovation.\n\n  And make no mistake that retaining incentives for biomedical research \nis exactly what the Judiciary Committee compromise does.\n  I am extremely pleased to tell my colleagues that Dr. Koop spoke to \nmy staff this morning and said that he is supportive of the Judiciary \nCommittee compromise that I am offering today.\n  Let me outline the key elements of the Judiciary Committee compromise \nproposal that I developed, working, as I have said, in close \nconsultation with Senator Specter who has a very deep interest in this \nissue.\n  This is important, to lay this out, so people realize it is not quite \nas simple as the distinguished Senator from Arkansas articulates here \non the floor today.\n  The compromise allows generic drug applications which were submitted \nto the FDA by June 8, 1995, and were found to be sufficiently complete \nso as to permit substantive review to be approved for marketing during \nthe GATT transition period.\n  As with other industries under the URAA, a court must first determine \nthat the generic drug manufacturer met the substantial investment \nrequirement.\n\n  This investment could not solely consist of expenditures related to \nthe development and submission of an abbreviated new drug application, \nor ANDA.\n  Under the Judiciary Committee compromise, the court would take into \naccount activities that were specifically related to the research, \ndevelopment, manufacture, sale, and marketing, and other activities \nundertaken in connection with the specific generic drug application.\n  The Judiciary compromise also includes a provision advocated by \nSenator Biden, to treat patents in force on June 8, 1995, as a result \nof a Hatch-Waxman restoration extension in the same manner as other \npatents with respect to URAA patent term modifications.\n  This is fair and warranted given the fact that Hatch-Waxman \nrestoration extensions are granted in partial compensation for time \nlost due to FDA regulatory review and should be considered wholly \nindependent from any URAA extension.\n  Finally, at the request of Senator Specter, the Judiciary Committee \ncontains a 2-year marketing exclusivity extension for Lodine, a \nnonsteroidal antiinflammatory product. This product was under FDA NDA \nreview for over 8 years, and presents a factual case in many respects \nsimilar to Daypro, which was recently afforded equitable relief in the \ncontinuing resolution that was passed in April.\n  In addition, the proposal contains sense-of-the-Senate language to \nurge that litigation be concluded as expeditiously as possible. In this \nregard, let me just add that Senator Specter will work with me to add \nan amendment that will help us to get there.\n  As a matter of fact, under the Judiciary Committee compromise, the \ninterest of ensuring prompt litigation is promoted by granting the \ncourts the authority to award equitable compensation from the patentee \nto the generic drug applicant in consideration for marketing time lost \ndue to litigation.\n  The message here is simple and clear: Equity is a two-way street.\n  Pioneer drug firms unjustifiably drawing out litigation will be \nplaced in substantial financial risk if it is determined by the court \nthat equity so requires compensation be paid to the generic \nmanufacturer.\n  These provisions would not apply to products whose patents would have \nexpired, including any restoration periods under the Hatch-Waxman Act, \nafter June 8, 1998. The purpose of this provision is to prohibit \nobvious gaming of the system by those who may have submitted generic \ndrug applications far in advance than would have been the case in any \nnormal commercial transaction.\n  It will be interesting to see once CBO completes its analysis of the \nFDA data whether some generic firms may have submitted applications for \nproducts whose patents expire sometime early in the next century. This \nhardly strikes me as the type of good-faith activity that seems to be \ncontemplated by the URAA transition rules.\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\n  The Judiciary Committee compromise is fair and balanced. I urge all \nof my colleagues to support it.\n  I would next like to take just a few moments to explain why I believe \nthat this approach is preferable to the Pryor amendment.\n  As I have stated on a number of occasions, I have several threshold \nconcerns about the Pryor legislation.\n  First, it undermines the incentives for biomedical research. Dr. Koop \nand other leading public health experts recognize that it is only \nthrough research that great life-saving and cost-saving medical \nadvances flow. Plain and simple, more research will be conducted under \nthe Judiciary Committee compromise than under the Pryor amendment.\n  Second, it sets a poor, first example on GATT and will act to \nencourage our trading partners to drag their feet in implementing the \nintellectual property provisions of the GATT Treaty. I know the U.S. \nTrade Representative under the Clinton administration takes a different \nview but I think former Trade Representative Bill Brock got it exactly \nright, and I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n       It will be difficult, if not impossible, for the United \n     States to force other nations to adhere to the TRIPS \n     agreement if we set this unfortunate precedent. In sum, in \n     exchange for the hope of short term savings, the Pryor \n     proposal could cost all U.S. firms and workers the enormous \n     long term gains we worked so hard to achieve in the Uruguay \n     Round. That is penny wise and pound foolish.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Third, it may subject the Federal Treasury to substantial \nfinancial liability under the takings clause of the fifth amendment. On \nthis last point, let me just say that the takings issue was discussed \nat our February hearing. I was very interested to learn that analysts \nat CBO have independently raised this issue, so I think it is a very \nreal concern. We should attempt to ensure that it is the generic drug \nmanufacturers and pioneer pharmaceutical firms, respectively, who are \nfinancially responsible for paying any court-ordered equitable \nremuneration and equitable compensation.\n  In addition to these three major policy concerns that I have just \noutlined, I also take strong exception to the manner in which Senator \nPryor has attempted to characterize this debate. There are two basic \narguments that are repeatedly advanced as justification for the Pryor \namendment.\n  The first is the uneven playing field argument. You have heard it \nmany times in this debate. Somehow only the generic drug industry has \nnot been able to take advantage of the GATT transition rules.\n  But the truth of the matter is that there are no reported cases of \nany generic product manufacturer, from any other industry reaching, or \nfor that matter even seeking to reach, the marketplace through the \ntransition rules. If adopted, the Pryor amendment would tilt the \nplaying field by creating a virtually industry-wide advantage being \ngranted to only one industry--the generic drug industry. This can \nhardly be called leveling the playing field.\n  The other major argument advanced by the proponents of the Pryor \namendment is the alleged unintentional mistake argument. It is said \nover and over again by my opponents in this debate that adopting the \nPryor amendment merely amounts to making a technical correction to \nachieve an effect that Congress intended all long.\n  I must say that on the surface this argument has a certain amount of \nappeal and is easy to understand. The trouble is that it is simply not \nthe borne out by the facts.\n  It is important for everyone in this body to understand what the \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal circuit found on intent issue last \nNovember in the Royce case. Frankly, what they found was that, with my \napologies to Gertrude Stein, ``there is no there, there.'' The court \nsaid:\n\n       The parties have not pointed to, and we have not \n     discovered, any legislative history on the intent of \n     Congress, at the time of passage of the URAA, regarding the \n     interplay between the URAA and the Hatch-Waxman Act.\n\n  There have been many attempts to create after-the-fact legislative \nhistory--and additional attempts will no doubt be fabricated in the \ncourse of our debate today. But, as with the judges on the Federal \nCircuit, I am aware of no evidence at the time of passage of the URAA \nthat dispositively resolves, or even hints at resolving, the intent \nissue in the manner now so frequently, so cavalierly, and--it must be \nstated--so misleadingly, claimed by my opponents. I know where the bald \nassertions are but where is the beef? What is this evidence?\n  Frankly, the intent argument is somewhat galling. How many times has \nthis body debated a supposed technical correction measure, like we did \nfor three hours last December, only to refer the matter back to \nCommittee for further study by a razor thin 49 to 48 vote. Technical \ncorrection, my eye.\n  I am also greatly concerned that the Pryor approach contemplates \nmarket entry prior to an opportunity for court resolution of the key \ndeterminations surrounding substantial investment and equitable \nremuneration.\n  A key principle of the Hatch-Waxman Act, and of section 154(c) of the \nURAA, is to first determine the rights of the patent holder before a \ngeneric competitor may enter the market.\n  This principle should not be casually set aside.\n  In contrast to the Pryor amendment, the Judiciary Committee \nsubstitute--consistent with the longstanding paragraph 4 certification \nprocess under the Hatch-Waxman Act and the plain language of section \n154(c)--would respect the innovator's intellectual property by first \nresolving the substantial investment and equitable remuneration issues.\n  In this regard, I must register my objection to the recent June 13 \nletter from Secretary Shalala that seems to interpret the language of \nsection 154(c)(3) as allowing the continuation of infringing activities \nwhile the courts resolve the substantial investment and equitable \nremuneration issues.\n  This interpretation would be, in my estimation, rejected by the \ncourts because it amounts to de facto compulsory licensing. The \nprotection of prior judicial review is critical.\n  One of the key reasons why our Nation endorsed the intellectual \nproperty provisions of the GATT Treaty--the so-called TRIPS \nprovisions--was to limit the ability of our trading partners to \nwrongfully devalue American intellectual property through compulsory \nlicensing provisions.\n  This June 13 administration embrace of compulsory licensing may open \nup a real can of worms and will send a horrible signal both overseas \nand to our inventor community here at home.\n  I have taken too long, I understand. Let me close by simply saying \nthat for the reasons I have given, I hope that my fellow Senators will \nagree with me that the best course is for the full Senate to adopt the \nJudiciary Committee compromise. It was hard fought and won in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  It is a fair compromise and one that will benefit the health of the \nAmerican people and the American public.\n  Last, but not least, let me just say this: As the author of the \nHatch-Waxman bill, this is a very important issue for me. This is \nsomething that I believe in or I would not be doing this.\n  I have been vilified and mistreated and my efforts mischaracterized \non this issue. I can live with that, because that has happened to me \nmany times in my political career, as well as to many others here. But \nI really resent having the issues in this matter mis-characterized in \nthe way some people have done.\n  I want to say that the generic industry, by and large, has been very \nfair to me and very decent. I personally appreciate them. I look \nforward to trying to help them in the future on issues on which they \ndeserve to have help. Unfortunately, this does not happen to be one of \nthose issues.\n  I hope our colleagues will pay attention to the things that have been \nsaid on the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the compromise \nthat the Senator from Utah and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch, has offered on the GATT pharmaceutical patent issue. I \ncommend him for his leadership on this subject--a subject that is \nfundamentally an intellectual property issue and that is clearly in the \npurview of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  This is not the first time we have had this discussion. Earlier this \nyear, the\n\n[[Page S6596]]\n\nSenator from Arkansas agreed to allow the Senate Judiciary Committee to \nconsider this issue. On February 27 and March 5, the committee held \nhearings on this issue with a balanced set of witnesses, and reported \nout a compromise bill on May 2, 1996, on a bipartisan vote of 10 to 7.\n  The Judiciary Committee bill would allow the FDA to approve a generic \ndrug for marketing prior to expiration of the GATT patent extension, \nbut only after a generic drug manufacturer complied with requirements \nspelled out in both the GATT implementing law and the generic drug \napproval process in the 1984 Hatch-Waxman law.\n  Under this compromise, generic drug manufacturers would not be \ntreated differently than any other generic manufacturer. Like other \ngeneric manufacturers, generic drug manufacturers would be required to \nprove in court that they had made a substantial investment in their \nproduct before June 8, 1995. Court determination of substantial \ninvestment and the establishment of equitable remuneration to the \npatent holder is required under the GATT implementing law prior to \ngeneric infringement of patents in all industries.\n  A generic drug company would have to make substantial investments in \npurchasing land, building a plant, or other capital investments \ncomparable to what generic companies in other industries would have to \nmake in order to qualify under the transition provision. The investment \nwould have to be more than merely the filing of an abbreviated new drug \napplication [ANDA] for regulatory approval with the FDA, although the \ngeneric company would be able to include these costs in proving their \ninvestment.\n  At the same time, this compromise provides unique protection to \ngeneric drug companies from the cost of potential delays from the court \nprocess prior to entering the market. If a generic drug company wins \nthe determination of substantial investment, the court could order the \npatent holder to compensate the generic company for the delay in \nselling their product caused by litigation.\n  What's more, Senators have heard from dozens of patient and physician \ngroups who point out that without the strong patent protections \nprovided by the law, the investments that have yielded critical, life-\nsaving drugs and biomedical products would not have been made. And \nunless that patent protection is preserved, pharmaceutical companies \nwill have no incentive to continue their vital research.\n  Indeed, Daniel Perry, executive director of the Alliance for Aging \nResearch wrote that . . .\n\n       Patent rights are the cornerstone of America's biomedical \n     research enterprise. Patents provide a critical incentive for \n     all companies, particularly pioneer pharmaceutical \n     manufacturers, to conduct ground breaking biomedical \n     research.\n\n  I would ask unanimous consent that Mr. Perry's and other letters be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is a fair and balanced compromise. The \ncommittee took into account the unique benefits generic drug \nmanufacturers receive under the FDA process. Generic drug manufacturers \nare given the use of the safety and efficacy data that is developed \nover years of research and at an average cost of $500 million by the \nbrand name pharmaceutical manufacturer. The generic drug industry, in \ncontrast, spends an average of less than $1 million on their products.\n  The cornerstone of our intellectual property system is that one \nperson or company should not be able to profit unfairly from another's \ninvestment, be it in time or money, at the expense of the original \nperson or company. This compromise protects that fundamental right, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                     May 20, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: We are concerned that the Senate may \n     soon consider legislation that would diminish the strong \n     patent terms for pharmaceuticals that resulted when Congress \n     implemented the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n     (GATT). We thank you for your leadership and efforts to \n     preserve strong intellectual property protection. It is vital \n     that all Members of Congress share your understanding of the \n     importance to our patients of strong intellectual property \n     protection, and we ask that you share our concerns with your \n     colleagues.\n       As gastroenterologists, we have seen first hand the \n     tremendous power of pharmaceutical innovation to forge \n     unparalleled advances in medical care. Prior to the discovery \n     and development of the acid-reducing medicines called H2 \n     antagonists, many patients suffering from peptic ulcer \n     disease had to endure expensive corrective surgery. Since \n     1977, when the first H2 antagonist was introduced, the \n     incidence of ulcer surgery as well as ulcer-related morbidity \n     has dropped dramatically. This decline in surgery and \n     morbidity has not only benefited our patients, but it has \n     also reduced the overall health care costs for our country \n     since drug therapy is substantially less expensive--not to \n     mention less painful--than ulcer surgery.\n       The argument in support of changing the GATT patent benefit \n     for pharmaceuticals seems to rest primarily on the potential \n     cost savings to consumers of accelerating the availability of \n     a generic version of one anti-ulcer drug. Such an argument \n     totally ignores the fact that the anti-ulcer marketplace is \n     highly competitive with a wide range of choices, including \n     generics, for patients and physicians.\n       This argument also ignores the significant cost savings to \n     consumers from advances in medical research. There are new \n     medicines available and coming to the market that can cure \n     peptic ulcer disease. The senior citizen on a fixed income \n     will save far more from the availability of medicines that \n     eradicate the cause of his/her ulcer after a few weeks of \n     therapy than from a less expensive version of a medicine they \n     must continue to take on a daily basis. Fortunately for the \n     patient, the strong patent protection on existing anti-ulcer \n     products has helped fund the research that has made these new \n     medicines possible.\n       We firmly believe that it is in the best interest of \n     patients to provide strong patent protection. The results of \n     innovative bio-medical research funded by patent protection \n     for existing products benefit patients directly. Any attempts \n     to determine the incentives to further research and \n     development is short sighted and leaves patients short \n     changed.\n           Sincerely,\n     John H.

Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: The American Association for Cancer \n     Research (AACR) respectfully requests that you vote against \n     Senator Pryor's effort to reduce patent protection for \n     pharmaceuticals.\n       The medical researchers in the AACR have devoted their \n     lives to research and innovation in the struggle to eradicate \n     cancer. In this effort, innovative pharmaceuticals and \n     biotechnology products are our most effective tools. Congress \n     steadfast support of scientific discovery and strong patent \n     protection has encouraged the investment in research and \n     development that make these medicines possible. For the sake \n     of patients everywhere, patent protection should not be \n     weakened.\n       However, Senator Pryor's legislation to reverse the patent \n     protection extended under GATT to one industry asks you to do \n     just that. This bill attempts to grant exceptions to the GATT \n     patent protections; these exceptions if adopted, have the \n     potential to encourage future attempts to further erode \n     patent protections in the United States. We are gravely \n     concerned about the precedent of singling out one industry, \n     especially one that has positioned the United States as the \n     global leader.\n       The risk of supporting this legislation would be to weaken \n     the incentives for innovation in academia, research \n     institutions, and medical research-based companies. We \n     believe that this will impede our capacity to address the \n     growing epidemic of cancer.\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\n       We urge you to use your leadership position to preserve, \n     not destroy, our national capacity to support research and \n     innovation.\n           Respectfully,\n                                          Joseph R. Bertino, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Alliance for Aging Research\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Office of the Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, the Capitol \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: It has come to my attention that, in \n     connection with a proposal sponsored by Senator David Pryor, \n     Congress is considering changes to existing patent law that \n     would erode patent protection in the United States. I ask you \n     to oppose that effort.\n       America has always sought to protect and foster innovation \n     primarily through our system of patent protection and patent-\n     term restoration. Recently, in accordance with its \n     multilateral obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related \n     Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights negotiated during the \n     Uruguay Round of GATT, Congress amended the Patent Code to \n     harmonize its provisions with international standards. As a \n     result, patent terms for certain eligible products--in all \n     industries--were extended. Under the Pryor proposal, however, \n     Congress would weaken our implementation of GATT's patent \n     provisions.\n       As the Executive Director of the Alliance for Aging \n     Research, I am concerned by any proposal that would have such \n     an effect. Patent rights are the cornerstone of America's \n     biomedical research enterprise. Patents provide a critical \n     incentive for all companies, particularly pioneer \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers, to conduct ground breaking \n     biomedical research. Patients and their physicians depend \n     upon access to the fruits of biomedical research--access \n     which can only occur if there are adequate incentives for the \n     research to be conducted in the first place. Congress cannot \n     expect the private sector to continue making high-risk \n     investments in research and development if there is no \n     assurance of strong patent protection (and if there is no \n     assurance that the United States will meet its multilateral \n     obligations to provide such protection.)\n       This is a particularly critical issue for the aging \n     Americans represented by the Alliance. Clearly, the \n     curtailment of biomedical R will lead to a downturn in a \n     rate at which biomedical innovations will become available to \n     the public. New incentives for research and innovation such \n     as those provided by GATT must be maintained. Otherwise, \n     Congress will erode the foundations of a system that has made \n     America the leader in the discovery of new medicines.\n       I urge you to cast your vote in favor of innovation and \n     research for new treatments that will benefit America's \n     elderly.\n           Best regards,\n                                                     Daniel Perry,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      The National Organization on\n\n\n                                       Fatal Alcohol Syndrome,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: It has come to my attention that, \n     through an effort by Senator Pryor, Congress is considering \n     changes to existing law that would chip away at patent \n     protections in the United States, and possibly around the \n     world. I ask you to reject that effort.\n       This nation has sought to protect and foster innovation \n     since its very beginnings, primarily through our system of \n     patent protections. Most recently, as a result of the General \n     Agreements on Tariffs and Trade, the U.S. changed its patent \n     terms to bring them in line with international standards. Yet \n     Congress is now considering weakening that agreement.\n       As a member of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome, I find that possibility very disturbing. Patients \n     afflicted with disease look to biomedical research, \n     especially research taking place in America's pharmaceutical \n     industry, for new and better treatments to restore them to \n     health. But this country's huge investments in research and \n     development cannot be maintained without the assurance of \n     strong patent protection, not only in the U.S., but also in \n     other markets around the world.\n       If Congress begins chipping away at patent protection in \n     the U.S., it begins chipping away at the foundations of a \n     system that has made this country Number One in the world in \n     the discovery of new medicines. It also begins to undermine \n     patent protection standards around the world. And it begins \n     the process of deflating the hopes of millions of patients in \n     this country who depend on medical research to find a cure.\n       Please, cast your vote in favor of innovation, and against \n     any effort to undermine patent protection in this or any \n     other country around the world.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                     Patti Munter,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      United Patients' Association\n\n\n                             for Pulmonary Hypertension, Inc.,\n\n                                                     Speedway, IN.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: I'm writing to you on behalf of \n     400-500 Americans who suffer from a very rare and very deadly \n     disease known as Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH). Until \n     recently, the best hope for long-term survival from PPH was \n     through a lung or heart/lung transplant. However, today, \n     thanks to research which dates back to the 1970's, a new drug \n     was recently approved to treat PPH which not only is \n     extending these patients' lives but is allowing them to live \n     full, active and productive lives.\n       I have learned that some generic companies are now trying \n     to change the law so that they can gain financially by \n     bringing their products to market before the patents on the \n     pioneering companies' products expire. I can attest to the \n     value that research-based companies bring to patients as a \n     result of strong patent protection, and I urge you to oppose \n     these efforts.\n       While I appreciate the cost savings that generic drugs can \n     offer in the short term, I also know that innovative new \n     therapies for complex, life-threatening diseases will come \n     only from research-based pharmaceutical companies. When it \n     comes to serving patients suffering from deadly orphan \n     diseases like PPH, it is the research-based companies that \n     give us hope.\n       Glaxo Wellcome recently received approval to market the \n     first medicine that will significantly extend the life, \n     greatly improve the quality of life, and help avoid complex, \n     risky surgery for people suffering from PPH. I know of no \n     generic drug company that would commit the millions of \n     dollars or many, many years of research to discover or \n     develop such a medicine, and it is unlikely that they will \n     ever produce a generic version for a patient population so \n     small. There are many other similar patient populations who \n     depend on the research-based companies to bring these new \n     medicines to market.\n       The purpose of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n     (GATT) was to strengthen intellectual property law around the \n     world and bring U.S. intellectual property law into \n     compliance with other industrialized countries. If the GATT \n     resulted in longer patent protection for a few medicines--all \n     of which already face competition from other therapies--that \n     in my view is a benefit for our society.\n       Our patients have experienced the direct benefits of the \n     tremendous investments that the pharmaceutical industry has \n     made in research and development. Research-based companies \n     need and deserve the incentives provided by strong \n     intellectual property protection. Please do nothing to weaken \n     them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Judith Simpson, R.N., Ed.

Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: The American Society for Tropical \n     Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) respectfully asks that you vote \n     against Senator Pryor's effort to reduce patent protection \n     for pharmaceuticals.\n       The ASTMH members have dedicated their lives to easing the \n     suffering of patients under their care and returning them to \n     health whenever possible. In this effort, modern medicines \n     are among our most effective tools. Congress' steadfast \n     support of strong patent protection has encouraged the \n     investments in research and development that make these \n     medicines possible. For the sake of patients everywhere, \n     those protections should not be weakened.\n       Yet, legislation which Senators Pryor and Chafee intend to \n     bring to the Senate floor asks you to do just that. They \n     believe that Congress should grant exceptions to the patent \n     protection provided under the General Agreement for Tariffs \n     and Trade, which could encourage future attempts to further \n     erode those protections in the U.S. It would surely encourage \n     other countries to do the same, especially those who are not \n     fully committed to implementing the patent protections \n     required under GATT.\n       Long-term, we risk weakening the incentives for innovation \n     that bring us new medicines from the labs of academia, \n     research organizations, and pharmaceutical research \n     companies. We risk losing more lives to disease that might \n     otherwise be saved.\n       We are dedicated to improving the care we provide our \n     patients. Further, our society is dedicated to the research, \n     treatment and eradication of infectious and emerging diseases \n     worldwide. We need to ensure the U.S. capacity to operate in \n     the international arena. We ask that you lend your support by \n     preserving the innovation that helps us to meet that goal. \n     Please demonstrate your support for patent protection and \n     medical innovation by voting against Senator Pryor's \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Carole A.

Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: I understand Senators Pryor and Chafee \n     are attempting to amend the Hatch-Waxman Act to eliminate \n     extensions for existing pharmaceutical patents granted by \n     GATT. I urge you not to vote for that amendment, but instead \n     to protect existing legislation that preserves incentives for \n     research and development.\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\n       As President and Chief Executive Officer of the Cystic \n     Fibrosis Foundation, I have personally witnessed the great \n     suffering endured by patients and their families in their \n     fight against cystic fibrosis. I have also witnessed how, for \n     many patients, modern medicines have brought hope, relief \n     from suffering, and even a return to health--a miracle made \n     possible by biomedical research.\n       By rewarding ingenuity and encouraging innovation, patent \n     protection makes possible the investment of hundreds of \n     millions of dollars and years of time and effort in medical \n     research, all the while with no guarantee of success. Because \n     of the discoveries born of these investments, the patients we \n     come in contact with every day benefit through saved lives \n     and improved quality of life. Our health care system benefits \n     from a reduction in the overall cost of care.\n       While we certainly support patient access to lower cost \n     treatments for disease, that short-term benefit pales if it \n     comes at the long-term expense of finding cures to life-\n     threatening illnesses. The current law governing \n     pharmaceutical patents is fair and in the long-term best \n     interest of patients.\n       On behalf of those patients who still await a cure or \n     effective treatment to alleviate their suffering, I again \n     urge you not to undercut the patent protection that underlies \n     America's best hope for new and better answers to disease.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Robert J.

I have personally \n     witnessed how, for many children and adults with autism, \n     modern medicines have brought relief from the extreme, often \n     life-threatening behavioral manifestations of autism, \n     resulting in a renewed hope to the families for a better \n     quality of life for their son or daughter. In some instances, \n     the change was dramatic enough that the entire individual's \n     life, and the lives of those family members who love them, \n     have reached a new level of hope and enthusiasm--a \n     ``miracle'' made possible by biomedical research.\n       By rewarding ingenuity and encouraging innovation, patent \n     protection makes possible the investment of hundreds of \n     millions of dollars and years of time and effort in medical \n     research * * * all the while with no guarantee of success. \n     Because of the discoveries born of these investments, the \n     patients we come in contact with every day benefit through \n     saved lives and improved quality of life. Furthermore, our \n     health care system benefits from a reduction in the overall \n     cost of care.\n       The Pryor and Chafee amendment offers a clear choice: a \n     ``NO'' vote to preserve incentives for innovation that allow \n     that research to continue, or a ``YES'' vote to undermine the \n     hope of thousands of patients who await the discovery of an \n     effective treatment for disease.\n       On behalf of those patients everywhere (including some \n     380,000 individuals with autism) who still await a cure or \n     effective treatment to alleviate their suffering, I again \n     urge you not to undercut the patent protection that underlies \n     America's best hope for new and better answers to disease and \n     life-threatening disabilities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Sandra H.

Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: I am writing you as both a \n     constituent, and as the President of the National Kidney \n     Cancer Association. Thank you for your recent vote in support \n     of the enforcement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade (GATT) provision regarding drug patents.\n       Your action will allow significant pharmaceutical research \n     to continue on numerous diseases, including kidney cancer. As \n     you may be aware, kidney cancer afflicts thousand of \n     individuals each year and at the present time, no cure exists \n     for this disease.\n       Our greatest hope for a cure is innovative pharmaceutical \n     and biotechnology products, derived from private sector \n     efforts. To find this cure, millions of dollars will have to \n     be spent. It is imperative that Congress provide steadfast \n     support for scientific discovery and strong patent protection \n     for new drugs and therapies. My view is that this new GATT \n     law will encourage further investment in research and \n     development, and make new medicines possible. This new law \n     gives hope to millions around the world, including kidney \n     cancer patients, who currently have no options.\n       I applaud your courage in opposing efforts to weaken the \n     GATT patent provisions. Keep up the important battle to \n     support research and development of new drugs. Thank you for \n     your determination and insightful leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Eugene P. Schonfeld,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Pryor amendment concerns the complex \ninterrelationship among the GATT Treaty, the Federal Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act, and the Patent Code.\n  We considered this very issue last December on the Senate floor when \nSenator Pryor attempted to have this matter attached to the bill to ban \npartial birth abortions. The Senate voted at that time to have the \nJudiciary Committee--that is the committee with proper jurisdiction--to \nconsider this important issue. The Judiciary Committee held a \ncomprehensive hearing on this matter on February 27 of this year and \nSenator Pryor testified at that time.\n  Mr. President, following the hearing in the Judiciary Committee, of \nwhich I am a member, the committee amended a proposal similar to \nSenator Pryor's amendment with a bipartisan compromise. The Judiciary \nCommittee approved the compromise. This bill will be available for \nSenate floor consideration in due course. It would be most appropriate \nto consider Senator Pryor's amendment at that time. The Department of \nDefense reauthorization bill is not--and I want to repeat, is not--the \nproper vehicle on which to debate the Pryor amendment. Unfortunately, \nwe are now having to debate this contentious intellectual property \nissue.\n  Our second-degree amendment would reflect a bipartisan compromise \nagreed upon by the Judiciary Committee. The chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, has spoken today on the practical effect of \nthis amendment which he drafted with others when this matter was before \nhis committee.\n  Mr. President, as I noted earlier, this is a very difficult and \ncomplex issue which addresses how certain transition rules contained in \nthe Uruguay Round Agreements Act apply to the pioneer pharmaceutical \npatents which have been extended by the act. The overall approach to \nthis issue is to find an appropriate balance to encourage research and \ndevelopment of breakthrough innovator drugs while making low cost \ngeneric equivalents available to the public. The Judiciary Committee \napproved one approach which many believe reaches the goal of \nencouraging research and development but also expediting their generic \nequivalents to the marketplace.\n  It would be my preference to debate the Pryor amendment when the full \nSenate turns to consideration of the bill recently approved by the \nJudiciary Committee. That would seem to me to be the appropriate time \nto consider the Pryor amendment. Yet, here we are on the Defense bill \ndebating the Pryor amendment in a compressed manner.\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\n  We should proceed on this Defense bill, which is vital to our \nnational security.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Nevada was here \nahead of me. If it is all right with him, I will just make a very brief \nstatement.\n  Mr. BRYAN. By way of response, I am always delighted to hear the \nenlightened words of my friend from Colorado, and I anxiously await his \nimportant comments to the Senate.\n  Mr. BROWN. I can only wish my wife held me in similarly high esteem. \nShe sometimes finds my talks somewhat too long.\n  Mr. President, I simply want to add a few words as cosponsor of the \nPryor amendment. We have traded it back and forth. I think the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas has made a great contribution by \nbringing this portion of our law up.\n  It is a complicated area. I would like, with the indulgence of \nMembers, just to briefly try and simplify it, if I can.\n  We have in the past followed the law. The American law was 17 years \nof exclusive protection for a patented item. Many countries in the \nworld had a law that said 20 years from the time of filing for that \npatent. So we differed from the world somewhat. When the trade pact was \napproved, which this Congress did approve, did ratify, we agreed to go \nto a system followed by most other countries; that is, 20 years from \nwhen you file it instead of 17 years from when it is approved. A modest \nchange.\n  For some items that are patented, that is, the creator has exclusive \nprotection, that meant they got a longer period of coverage than \noriginally planned, a longer period of coverage than they had when they \ncreated the product or invented it, a longer period of coverage than \nwhat they budgeted for, a longer period of coverage than what the law \nsaid. In other words, when we ratified that treaty and passed the \nimplementing language, we made a retroactive change in the law. Twenty \nyears ago, if you said, ``What is the law, what protection do I get?'' \nwe changed the law even though you relied on it.\n\n  What the GATT Treaty did and we did as a Congress was create an \nexception that said, look, if you relied on the old law and you \ninvested money in reliance on that law, you should be allowed to \ncompete with that product. So we did give people a serendipitous \nextension of the patent protection. But we said if someone is harmed by \nthat--that is, they made a substantial investment in competing with you \nunder the terms of the law--we are going to say OK for them, they have \na right to compete.\n  That is all this issue is really about. The issue is whether or not \nif you as a businessman or businesswoman made an investment in reliance \non our law to compete, whether or not you should have a chance to \ncompete.\n  The way this Congress handled that issue is they drafted a transition \nrule that said, ``Yes, if you made a substantial investment, you relied \non that law, you can compete.'' There was only one product they left \nout, and that was patented drugs. Every other patented item that this \nNation recognizes and gives exclusive protection to got the treatment, \ngot the exception, were allowed to compete if they made a substantial \ninvestment. The only one that did not get it was drugs.\n  Is there a reason to treat drugs differently? I do not think so. That \ncase certainly has not been made in deliberations. The patent \nprotection is not different in length for drugs than it is for anything \nelse in the past. That transition law treated drugs totally different \nthan anything else.\n  When we inquired about it, all the committees said, ``It's an \noversight, it's a mistake, we'll correct it.'' That is all this \namendment is. It simply treats drugs the same way we treat everybody \nelse.\n  How do I feel about it? My sense is that we ought to treat drugs like \nany other patented item. My sense is, it is only fair if someone has \nrelied on that old law--that is, made an investment, relied on the \nlaw--that you honor your obligation. It is the same as giving somebody \nyour word. It is pretty basic. It is pretty simple.\n  If I say something, and you rely on it, and you invest in reliance on \nit, I ought to keep my word to you. That is what we did for every other \npatented item. That is all this amendment does.\n  Do people who have patented drugs who get a serendipitous 20 \nadditional months, or in that range, oppose the amendment? Of course \nthey do. It is not a surprise. If somebody said, ``Here's a check for \n$100 million''--the money involved in this is big; it is not small; and \nit may well be in the billions, not millions --of course they are \ninterested in protecting that. I do not fault them. They are defending \ntheir rights.\n  But, Mr. President, our obligation goes much farther than simply \nhelping out a friend or helping out a company that got a serendipitous \ngift out of this. Our obligation, as Members of the U.S. Senate and \nMembers of Congress, goes to protecting the public.\n  There is no question that the public benefits by this amendment--no \nquestion. There is no question that this is fair because it is the same \ntreatment everybody else got. There is no question that people who \nrelied on the old law and made an investment, in my mind, deserve to be \ntreated like in every other area.\n  The question is pretty basic. Do you carve out a special gift and \nexception for a few companies that benefited by this oversight? Or do \nyou treat them the same as everybody else? Mr. President, this Congress \nought to be concerned about encouraging competition, not hiding from \nit. This Congress ought to be concerned about fair treatment.\n  It is quite true, as the distinguished Senator from Utah indicated, \nthis was considered in Judiciary. It is quite true that the Senator \nfrom Utah prevailed. I was unable to persuade the committee of the \nmerits of my position. It is quite true that that measure that he \npassed is coming out to the floor.\n  My impression, though, is a bit different than what he described with \nregard to the condition of the report that is being put together. Our \nviews on it, the views that favor this amendment, have been ready for \nsome time. Certainly we feel that we have played no part in holding up \nthe report. We have been ready to go all this time.\n  So I appreciate the Senator from Utah raising that point. Inasmuch as \nthere appears to be a misunderstanding about it, we will clear it up \nthis afternoon. Mr. President, let me also extend my thanks to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada for his kindness and indulgence. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I, again, express my \nappreciation to my colleague from Colorado for an extraordinarily clear \nand lucid explanation of what must appear to the folks at home, \nlistening to this debate on television, as a very arcane, technical, \nesoteric kind of an argument. Let me try to distill his thoughts a \nlittle further, if I may.\n  What we are talking about is money, big money, hundreds of millions \nof dollars, even billions of dollars. When that kind of money is on the \ntable, all kinds of special interests come forward and seek to protect \nthemselves. I want to comment a little bit further on that.\n  One of my colleagues raised the question as to the propriety of \nadding this amendment to a Department of Defense authorization bill. I \nthink there is a compelling argument as to why we should do so. The \nDepartment of Defense spends each year $900 million on drugs--$900 \nmillion. If the amendment authored by the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas, of which the Senator from Colorado and I and others are \ncosponsors, is adopted, we save $30 million each year. So the relevancy \nof this debate is very much appropriately addressed to a DOD \nauthorization bill.\n\n  My colleague from Colorado, I think, did an extraordinary job of \nexplaining the history, and I will not belabor that point other than to \nmake the point, as he did, this industry, the drug industry, through \ninadvertence and omission, is given separate treatment, separate, \ndistinct and special treatment, that no other industry or product in \nAmerica receives. It is that inequity that generates the interest of \nthe Senator from Arkansas and others of us to remedy and to correct \nthis.\n  Our amendment, which was debated sometime last year, had the \nendorsement of the U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\nthe Patent Office, and the FDA, and would plug this loophole. Since \nlast December, as these windfall profits have continued to accumulate, \nAmerican consumers, veterans, seniors, and others across the country \nhave continued to pay more than they should pay for certain \nprescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, the loophole is open today. We face the same issue. \nEach and every day, American consumers are paying millions of dollars \nmore than they ought to. So let me suggest, as I view my \nresponsibilities as a Member of this Chamber, it is highly appropriate \nthat we seek to correct this inequity and to provide the relief to \nwhich American consumers are entitled and to do so immediately.\n  When the loophole-closing amendment came to the Senate floor last \nfall, a vote was taken, a critical vote in which, by a margin of one \nvote, 48-49 the Senate defeated the amendment that the Senator from \nArkansas, the Senator from Colorado and others of our colleagues \noffered.\n  A compromise was reached after that vote. The Judiciary Committee \nwould review the GATT treaty problem and report back to the Senate with \nits recommendation. This was to be a good-faith effort to analyze the \nissue. It is fair to ask the question, What was the outcome of this \nreview? Well, the Judiciary Committee did report out a substitute bill \nto our GATT amendment, albeit 5 months after our amendment was voted \nupon, 5 months in which drug companies have continued to reap windfall \nprofits and 5 months that the American public have been forced to pay \nhigher drug prices than they should have, that the American taxpayer \nhas been required to pay more money for those essential programs \noffered by the Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration, and \nother agencies of the Federal Government which purchase prescription \ndrugs on behalf of the clientele which they service.\n  This substitute is called the Pharmaceutical Industry Special Equity \nAct of 1996. It has somewhat of an ironic ring to it--the \nPharmaceutical Industry Special Equity Act of 1996. Who does it \nbenefit? It benefits the drug industry in a very special way that is \ninequitable to American consumers and particularly those who are on \nfixed incomes.\n  What we are really being asked to support today, in the form of the \nsubstitute, is a bill that codifies--in my view codifies --the very \nGATT treaty mistake that our amendment seeks to correct, a bill that \ncontinues the GATT treaty loophole for such drug manufacturers as \nGlaxco-Wellcome, Inc. and its ulcer/heartburn drug Zantac, the world's \nbest selling drug, which costs twice as much as it should because of \nthis loophole that we seek to close.\n\n  More than 100 drugs are being protected from generic drug competition \nbecause of this loophole. These include the hypertension drug Capoten, \nwhich costs 40 percent more due to the loophole, and the cholesterol-\nlowering drug Mevacor, the ulcer drug Prilosec, and the antifungal \nagent drug Diflucan.\n  It is a bill that ensures that seniors across the Nation will \ncontinue to pay more than they should for prescription drugs that they \nneed and that are essential to their health, a bill that ensures \ntaxpayers will pay more than they should to provide prescription drugs \nfor the Medicaid and the veterans medical programs, a bill that creates \ntremendous legal barriers--in my view, insurmountable barriers--to the \ngeneric drug manufacturing industry to ensure that these manufacturers \ncannot bring to the marketplace lower priced prescription drugs, a bill \nthat ensures the prescription drug manufacturers continue to enjoy \ntheir $2.3 billion windfall, plus a bill that extends special patent \nextensions for two brand name drug companies, Zeneca and Wyeth Ayerst \nLaboratories, which received a 2-year patent extension for Lodine, its \nantiinflammatory medicine. What has occurred here? In my view, we have \na situation that is worse than before. Not only do some prescription \ndrug companies retain their windfall profits, they are protected from \nnearly any possibility that any generic manufacturer will be able to \ncompete against them during this extended patent term.\n\n  Generic drug manufacturers will be required to prove a substantial \ninvestment before being allowed to compete against any brand name drug. \nThe key change, however, is that this substantial investment \nrequirement is being defined much differently, to ensure the generic \nmanufacturers cannot, as a practical matter, compete against any brand-\nname drug benefiting from the extended patent period under the GATT \nTreaty.\n  Before the GATT Treaty, substantial investment was considered to be \nthose expenses and activities involved in developing a submission to \ncompete to the FDA. Under the substitute measure, substantial \ninvestment is defined much differently.\n  In addition, under the substitute bill, a generic manufacturer must \nprove not only they have a substantial investment, but also they are \nrequired to make a determination of the kind of equitable remuneration \nto the brand name manufacturer before any generic drug can be \nmanufactured.\n  Mr. President, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to recognize \nthose who are enjoying these windfall profits are not going to be eager \nto agree as to what equitable remuneration may be. In effect, we create \na lawyers' field day to debate what is, in fact, equitable \nremuneration.\n  The effect of the change is, first, it will be virtually impossible \nfor any generic manufacturer to meet the new substantial investment \nstandard. Secondly, it will mean that generic manufacturers will be \ntied up in court proving substantial investment and what is equitable \nremuneration before they can bring any generic drug to the marketplace. \nTwo obstacles, two hurdles, two barriers that, as a practical matter, \nare going to be virtually insurmountable.\n  Who is being forgotten? Who gets hurt in this change? Those Americans \nparticularly that are on a fixed income. That is primarily our senior \ncommunity. They have been paying and will continue to pay more than \nthey should for lack of a prescription drug alternative.\n  I am puzzled to think as to why anyone believes it is equitable to \nforce seniors, many on very limited incomes, to pay more for a drug \nthan they should so prescription drug manufacturers can continue to \nreap the windfall profits that this loophole has created.\n  I must say I am astonished by the provisions of this Pharmaceutical \nIndustry Special Equity Act--a misnomer, if ever there was one; a \nspecial interest provision, if there ever was. My colleagues who talk \nthe virtues of competition in the marketplace surely must find this \nsubstitute bill to be a bit beyond the pale.\n  I remind my colleagues, there is no reason to allow a limited number \nof prescription drug companies an unintended windfall profit to the \ndetriment of all Americans who depend upon prescription drugs in order \nto sustain their health. Seniors, veterans, and the most vulnerable in \nour country cannot fight the brand name pharmaceutical industry on its \nown. They deserve and need our protection from an industry that is \ntrying to codify a mistake, to perpetuate their windfall profit \nmarkets.\n  I hope my colleagues can see the loophole for the mistake it is and \nthis substitute bill for the larger mistake it would be. We should \nalways remember who is being hurt by the loophole in the State.\n  We have the ability to end this inequity now. The means to do so is \nthe amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Arkansas. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have found the current controversy to be an \nextremely complicated one as it has worked its way through the \nJudiciary Committee in trying to structure an arrangement which would \nbe fair to all sides--fair to those who have made investments in patent \npharmaceutical products and fair to those who are relying upon generic \ndrugs.\n  As has been indicated at some length, we have very substantial \ninvestments which were being made to find new pharmaceutical products, \nto cure many ailments--wonder drugs, so to speak. At the same time, \nthere is an enormously important consideration that generic drugs be \navailable to senior citizens and others who are of modest\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\nmeans, and also to help reduce the tremendous governmental costs \ninvolved with health care in America.\n  The controversy has arisen because of the ambiguity in the term \nsubstantial investment and the difficulty in defining equitable \nremuneration. It is my view that the Congress ought to define those \nterms, as opposed to leaving the matter to judicial interpretation.\n  We talk a great deal on the floor of the U.S. Senate about not having \njudges involved in legislation and about having statutory definitions \nto express the will of the Congress. This, I think, is a classic case \nwhere the Congress really ought to come to grips with the complexities \nand define what we mean by substantial investment and what we mean by \nequitable remuneration.\n  In order to try to reach a resolution of this matter, my staff and I \nhave worked for many months, including long meetings where I have \npersonally participated with representatives from both sides in an \neffort to try to structure a definition which would be fair and \nequitable. There has been a consideration that substantial investment \nwould be determined solely by the filing by the generic of the \nabbreviated new drug application (ANDA) prior to June 8 of 1995.\n  I am not persuaded that the filing of an ANDA in and of itself is \nsufficient to constitute a substantial investment. There is a \ncontention that more has to be undertaken in order to constitute the \nso-called substantial investment.\n  I have supported the amendment by Senator Hatch in the Judiciary \nCommittee with substantial reservations, waiting until the time the \nmatter reached the floor with the hope we might work out an \naccommodation among all of the parties. As I have said to the parties \nprivately and also publicly, they have a much firmer handle on the \nintricacies of these definitions than do we in the Congress. I am still \nhopeful that a compromise may be worked out.\n  What I have added to the so-called Hatch substitute is a very tight \ntime line on judicial determination as to what is a substantial \ninvestment if we cannot find a legislative definition for substantial \ninvestment, and also a provision that any losses sustained by the \ngeneric companies for the lack of sales in the interim be compensated \nby the pharmaceutical companies which have the patents.\n  Another consideration which I find to be very problematic is the fact \nthis has taken so long. As the distinguished Senator from Arkansas has \npointed out, the fact that it takes so long disadvantages the generics \nand also those who would rely upon the generic products.\n  I just had a brief conversation with my distinguished colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor, and I told him I thought it might be useful if \nwe had a colloquy on the record. We have had quite a number of \nconversations and have exchanged correspondence, and at one point \nseveral weeks ago Senator Pryor wrote me a very strong, friendly \nletter, but a strong letter in the sense of trying to resolve the \nissue. I responded the very next day because of the importance of the \nissue. I know the sincerity with which the Senator from Arkansas has \ndealt with the issue, as, candidly, have we all.\n  I think it would be useful to discuss with the Senator from Arkansas, \nthe originator of the original legislation, the content of his \nproposal, which, as I understand it, is to have a determination of \nsubstantial investment or the generic filing of the so-called ANDA \nprior to June 8, 1995.\n  As I understand it, and I put this in the form of a question to my \ncolleague from Arkansas, is it the intent of his bill that the generic, \nin order to qualify, would have to establish a substantial investment?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend from \nPennsylvania, we all recognize that the question of substantial \ninvestment in this particular issue has been of great concern to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  It is true that we have corresponded about this issue. I have \nattempted to accommodate the Senator's concern in our legislation for a \nmore precise definition of substantial investment. In fact, our \noriginal legislation included a provision which very narrowly defined \nsubstantial investment. While we, too, sought to provide guidance to \nthe courts, the provision was regrettably attacked by Glaxo and its \ncompatriots as an effort to provide special treatment to their generic \ncompetitors. To ensure that all parties understood that our amendment \nis a simple, straightforward effort to bring a rogue industry into \ncompliance with the rest of the country, we withdrew this language.\n  Mr. President, as I understand the complex GATT implementing law, the \ngeneric competitor has the burden of establishing whether it has made a \nsubstantial investment in court. This is my understanding of the \npresent law, and the present law would simply be extended in the area \nof substantial investment to the inappropriately exempted prescription \ndrug industry if my proposal is adopted.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may follow up on that, I do not \nfully understand what the Senator from Arkansas just said. Would it be \nthe obligation, then, of the generic manufacturer to show that there \nhad been compliance with the law, that there had been a substantial \ninvestment?\n  Mr. PRYOR. That is absolutely true. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act \nclearly establishes it is the obligation of the generic competitor to \nprove a substantial investment before the court. It is the court which \ndetermines whether or not a substantial investment has, in fact, been \nmade. This is true for all industries today, except for one.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, since that is the purported intent of the \nlegislation of the Senator from Arkansas, then the sale of the generic \ncould not be made until the court had determined that there was a \nsubstantial investment. It is my understanding that the substitute \nproposed by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nThurmond, in collaboration with the distinguished Senator from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, would do the same thing. The substitute would not accept \nthe filing, but would require the generic manufacturer to go to court \nand satisfy the court that there had been a substantial investment. Is \nthat not the effect of the legislation of the Senator from Utah?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I regret I must correct the Senator from \nPennsylvania. Both current law and our amendment allows for the sale of \ngeneric competitors, contemporaneous to a court determination of \nsubstantial investment. In other words, the term substantial investment \nis defined in the Pryor-Brown-Chafee-Bryan legislation in the present \nlanguage of the GATT implementing legislation, the Uruguay Round \nAgreements Act. I thank my colleague for raising a very important \npoint. We are not changing the GATT agreement on substantial investment \nin any shape, form, or fashion. In fact, by bringing this sole outlier \nindustry into compliance with the rest of the country, one might argue \nthat we are keeping even closer to the spirit and letter of our \nobligations under that agreement than is the case today.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, if the Senator from Arkansas is prepared to have a \njudicial determination as to what a substantial investment is before \nthe generic is offered for sale --I see my colleague shaking his head \nin the negative. I thought that is what the Senator from Arkansas said.\n  Mr. PRYOR. No, my friend and colleague is mistaken. The present law \nsays that a generic competitor may come onto the marketplace, even \nthough the court has not resolved the issue of whether they have made \nsubstantial investment. If, hypothetically, after the generic \ncompetitor has entered the marketplace and competed with the patent \nholder, it is then determined by the court that a substantial \ninvestment has not been made, then the court imposes damages upon the \ngeneric competitor to render the patent holder whole.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, how is that fee or compensation determined?\n  Mr. PRYOR. That compensation is determined according to the language \nof the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, the GATT implementing legislation. \nOn that point, let me reference the letter from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services about the Thurmond-Hatch substitute. This is \nthe agency which would have to implement the substitute. The letter \nstates that ``it will be nearly impossible to meet the\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\n`substantial investment' requirement'' under the substitute. Elsewhere, \nit concludes the substitute ``defines substantial investment--a matter \nthat the URAA left to the courts--and does so in a manner that would \nmake it virtually impossible for a generic drug company to meet the \nrequirement.''\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator from Arkansas would come back to my \nquestion, I am not on the Thurmond-Hatch substitute. My question is on \nthe proposal of the Senator from Arkansas; that is, if you allow the \ngeneric to enter the field without a determination by a court of what \nis a substantial investment, and then, as the Senator from Arkansas \nsaid, if there is a later determination that there has not been a \nsubstantial investment and the generic company has to pay compensation, \nhow is that compensation determined?\n  Mr. PRYOR. If I might respond to my colleague, in 35 U.S.C. 284, the \nsituation is this. If, in the extremely unlikely event that a false \nclaim of substantial investment is actually made by a generic \ncompetitor coming into the marketplace, the court may award damages in \nfull, plus interest. If for some reason the court felt particularly \nstrongly that the claim of substantial investment was false, fraudulent \nor otherwise inappropriate, it has further discretion to award treble \ndamages to the patent holder.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If my colleague will yield, I am not talking about \nfraud, I am talking simply about a conclusion that there has not been a \nsubstantial investment, and then you have a situation where the generic \nhas been selling its product. How is there a determination made as to \nwhat the damages are to the pharmaceutical company that has the patent?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would answer my colleague with reference to the law as \nit currently affects every industry but one. The court would determine \ndamages on the basis of lost sales or profits, the length of time \nexpired, and the multitude of other facts which leave the court \nuniquely suited to make such determinations on a case-by-case basis. I \nbelieve that was the compelling logic behind adoption of the GATT \nlanguage in this respect, and I feel it should be equally compelling \nfor this single, rogue industry.\n  I would again emphasize that we are not changing the GATT or URAA \nlanguage as it relates to substantial investment. We are keeping it. We \nare applying this language to the drug companies, just as it applies to \nevery other company, every other industry, and every other business \nentity in our country.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, as the Senator from Arkansas outlines, there is \ngoing to be a judicial determination, and the question is whether the \ngeneric drugs may be sold prior to the time the judicial determination \nis made, or whether the generic drugs may be sold only after the \njudicial determination is made.\n  Under the expedited procedures that I am proposing, it would be a \nvery, very prompt resolution. If the court determines that the generic \nhad a substantial investment and had been denied access to the market \nfor a period of time, then, for the period of time where the generic \nhad been denied access, there would be damages paid. Really, we are \nvery close together, as the Senator and I discussed this, with the \nessential difference being, who is going to bear the burden of proof in \nshowing substantial investment? Those facts, really, are within the \ncontrol of the generic manufacturer--after all, it is the generic \nmanufacturer who knows what the generic manufacturer has sold, and it \nseems to me that there ought to be that determination made.\n  As I listened to the Senator from Nevada earlier, I understood him to \nsay that there would be a determination of substantial investment prior \nto the entry into the market of the generic manufacturer. As I had \nlistened to the Senator from Arkansas earlier, it seemed to me that \nthat was the same contention, that there would be a determination of \nsubstantial investment prior to the entry by the generic manufacturer.\n  Mr. PRYOR. As I mentioned earlier, we are not in any way changing the \nURAA or GATT language. In fact, I look forward to the Senator from \nPennsylvania offering language or an amendment to expedite the \nconvoluted process contemplated in the substitute version. I emphasize \nagain the reservations of the Department of Health and Human Services, \nregarding both the interminable delays in litigation and the unique, \nunattainable requirements imposed on generic competitors through the \nsubstitute version's unworkable definition of substantial investment. \nAnd as Professor Levin--I might say, probably known well by the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania--of the University of Pennsylvania has concluded----\n  Mr. SPECTER. He is a good friend. He is not always necessarily right.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Professor Levin concluded that the sense-of-the-Senate \nlanguage in the Hatch substitute purporting to encourage parties to \nlitigate quickly was of little effect. I quote:\n\n       This is laudable sentiment but without legal impact. In \n     short, it evidences recognition of the problem but not an \n     effective solution.\n\n  That is from Professor Levin.\n  So my colleagues and I look forward to the Senator's contribution to \nthis issue. We have already addressed this question with him before. I \ncan say without reservation that any changes proposed in the Senate to \nexpedite litigation under the Hatch-Thurmond substitute would be \nwelcome, as it currently contemplates an entirely unworkable and \nunbalanced process intended to block competition in the marketplace.\n  So I look forward to the Senator from Pennsylvania offering that \ncontribution. I look forward to working with him. I agree that we are \nvery close to a meeting of the minds on this particular issue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I do intend to pursue the expedited \nprocedure. One of the items that I agree with the Senator from Arkansas \non is how much time has passed here. I think that his cause might be \nadvanced by accepting the burden of proof on the generic manufacturer \nand allowing this litigation to go forward with the provision for \nexpedited procedures, and then damages for any time that the generic \nmanufacturers are denied entry into the market after a substantial \ninvestment had been made, as determined in judicial proceedings, \nbecause what is happening now is that there have been lengthy \nproceedings in the Judiciary Committee. We have a very busy calendar.\n  The managers of this bill want to move ahead with the Department of \nDefense authorization bill. But having brought this matter to the \nfloor, it is an important one which merits at least this much \ndiscussion. We think that the Members could come to an agreement and \nfind some way to expedite a legislative determination, which even if \nthe burden is shifted to the generics--and they have to establish the \njudicial determination first--it may be very much more to the Senator's \nadvantage than having this matter go over from today to sometime in the \nfuture. And who knows when there will be a determination, given the \nshort year, the election year, the appropriations bills, and all of the \nwork of the Congress will have?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, let me respond. Then I am going to sit down \nbecause I am going to Little Rock in just a few minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, maybe I should save my better arguments \nfor later.\n  Mr. PRYOR. This Senator looks forward to working with him on this \nmatter. We also would like to respond by saying that we hope when the \nSenator offers an amendment or language in this field, that it will not \nbe a lawyers relief amendment, which the substitute amendment very \nclearly is in fact and in effect. It would tie up the marketplace in \nlitigation with impossible definitions and insuperable barriers for \nyears and years.\n  Speaking of expedited procedure, I have been trying since January to \nget on the floor and have a vote on this amendment--just a simple vote \nwith an hour or 30 minutes equally divided, whether up or down or to \ntable the amendment. But for some reason or another, some of my \ncolleagues on the other side, including some of my very best friends, \nhave prevented this all year.\n\n  Before we move forward and before the final vote is cast on this DOD \nauthorization bill, this Senator is going to get a vote on our \namendment. We think that it should be voted on. We think that is only \nfair. And I am going to push for a vote on this proposal on the DOD \nauthorization bill.\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania probably knows that the Department of \nDefense buys $900 million worth of prescription drugs every year for \nservicemen and servicewomen all over the world. They can save $30 \nmillion overnight by the passage of the amendment that my colleagues \nand I have proposed.\n  I hope our friend and colleague, the Senator from Pennsylvania, will \nhelp us find an expedited procedure to bring this amendment to a \nfavorable resolution by letting the Senate vote up or down on it once \nand for all.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague for the colloquy. I will try to \nhelp him find an expedited procedure. I will not suggest anything that \nwould make a lawyer rich, even though my colleague may be returning to \nthe practice of law after he finishes the distinguished service in this \nCongress. But it would be my suggestion that Senator Pryor, Senator \nHatch, Senator Thurmond, and the Members sit down and try to work it \nout, to try to get the parties in the pharmaceutical companies and the \ngenerics, where they really understand the intricacies and the facts of \nthe matter, to try to solve this off the floor, because I think that \nwould be in the best interest of the American people.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

MILITARY PERSONNEL STALKING PUNISHMENT AND \n                   PREVENTION ACT OF 1996.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Military Personnel Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act \n     of 1996''.\n       (b) In General.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting after section 2261 the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 2261A. Stalking of Members of the Armed Forces of the \n       United States\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Whoever, within the special maritime and \n     territorial jurisdiction of the United States or in the \n     course of interstate travel, with the intent to injure or \n     harass any military person, places that military person in \n     reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, \n     that military person or a member of the immediate family of \n     that military person shall be punished as provided in section \n     2261.\n       ``(b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       ``(1) the term `immediate family' has the same meaning as \n     in section 115; and\n       ``(2) the term `military person' means--\n       ``(A) any member of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     (including a member of any reserve component); and\n       ``(B) any member of the immediate family of a person \n     described in subparagraph (A).''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 2261(b) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting ``or section 2261A'' after ``this \n     section''.\n       (2) Sections 2261(b) and 2262(b) of title 18, United States \n     Code are each amended by\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\n     striking ``offender's spouse or intimate partner'' each place \n     it appears and inserting ``victim''.\n       (3) The chapter heading for chapter 110A of title 18, \n     United States Code, is amended by inserting ``AND STALKING'' \n     after ``VIOLENCE''.\n       (d) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 110A of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting after the item relating to section 2261 \n     the following new item:\n\n``2261A.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment in the second degree I send \non behalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from Texas [Mrs. \nHutchison]. The amendment in the second degree reflects legislation \nthat is badly needed by the whole of the United States. But given \ncertain parliamentary situations at this time, this amendment submitted \nby myself and Senator Hutchison is limited to military personnel and \ntheir dependents.\n  It is my judgment that the Congress has been far too slow to address \nfully the rising problems associated with the many forms of domestic \nviolence. This amendment directs the Congress' attention to one form, \ncommonly referred to as ``stalking.'' It will enable military personnel \nand their dependents and families to better deal with this tragic \nproblem, which, regrettably, is on the rise all across our land.\n  Yesterday I attended a press conference with Senator Hutchison, at \nwhich time she issued a plea concerning her bill, which is identical in \nmany forms to this bill but applicable to all women across the United \nStates--let her bill go free. It is at the desk, being held at the \ndesk. Yet, all across this great Nation of ours, women every day are in \nfear for themselves, their families, and their children.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the Senate of the United States to act. \nThe House has acted, and it is time for the Senate to act.\n  I have joined with Senator Hutchison on her bill, but we were \ninformed--and I say with respect to the managers on the other side of \nthe aisle--that the strongest objection would be issued if Senator \nHutchison and I were to raise her bill as an amendment to this military \nauthorization bill. Therefore, I, along with Senator Hutchison, have \ncarved out from her bill companion legislation which applies to \nmilitary personnel, their dependents and their families. That is what I \nhave just sent to the desk as an amendment in the second degree.\n  Military women are in some respects at greater risk than others \nbecause so often they are, on the shortest of notice, transferred to \nother States, other jurisdictions, in a matter of an hour or less, to \ntake on new responsibilities. It is imperative that they be given the \nmaximum protection against this frightful crime.\n  Further, in my State of Virginia, an integral part of the greater \nMetropolitan Washington area covering Virginia, Maryland, and District \nof Columbia, it is a matter of great ease to cross the jurisdictional \nlines between the three entities. This amendment would provide the most \nimportant protection, Mr. President, whereby if a spouse were to obtain \na restraining order in a court, that restraining order would be equally \neffective in other States and jurisdictions.\n  I want to repeat that. One of the main features of this amendment is \nto allow that individual menaced by the threat or actuality of stalking \nto get a court order and to have that court order effective equally in \nthe 49 other States and the District of Columbia.\n  I bring to the attention of the Senate an article which appeared in \nthe Washington Post just a few days ago dated June 16, 1996. The \nheadline reads ``Navy Officer, Husband Die After Shooting at Andrews \nAir Force Base.'' This incident happened right here in Maryland. I will \nread the article in part and ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, the \nentire article be printed at the end of my presentation of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n       Mr. WARNER [reading]. When military police at Andrews Air \n     Force Base received a warning early yesterday that a man was \n     on his way to the military installation to kill his wife, \n     they raced to close the gates of the base. But a short time \n     later, both husband and wife, a Navy petty officer, lay dead \n     inside their home and an Air Force police officer was \n     seriously wounded. The slain woman was identified by Air \n     Force officials as Melissa Comfort, age 28. Her husband was \n     Michael Comfort, age 34. The couple's two young daughters and \n     another adult who were inside the home for several hours \n     after Michael Comfort arrived were unharmed.\n\n  The woman had obtained, Mr. President, a court order. This amendment \nwould provide protection for persons like Petty Officer Comfort and \nmilitary personnel all over the United States, their spouses and their \ndependents. It would make it a Federal crime to stalk another person on \na military installation. Second, stalkers subject to restraining orders \nissued in any one State or the District of Columbia would be guilty of \na Federal crime if they followed their victim to another jurisdiction \nand violated the terms of the order. In both of these instances, this \namendment would enlist the resources of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation to work with local law enforcement in the investigation \nand such other actions taken by law enforcement in the prosecution of \nthe stalking cases. This amendment would be especially effective for \nmilitary personnel and their families in this greater metropolitan \narea, as I stated, because of the close proximity of the three legal \njurisdictions.\n  This extension of the enforcement mechanisms of a court order across \nState lines is the very heart of this legislation, Mr. President, \ntogether with enlisting the very able expertise of the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation.\n  This amendment is unquestionably relevant to the issues raised by the \nannual authorization bill because it is the duty of the Armed Services \nCommittee and the duty of the Senate as a whole to provide military \npersonnel every possible assistance in the prosecution of their duties \nin wearing the uniform. Protection of military personnel and their \nfamilies is a key component in maintaining a well-trained and motivated \nmilitary force. More and more women, fortunately, are joining our Armed \nForces. I mention that in the context of the fact that women are by far \nthe primary victims of this type of domestic violence. Congress must, \ntherefore, take care that our support system for which we are \nresponsible--remember, Congress is the one that is responsible for the \nsupport system of the U.S. military--is such that they can perform \ntheir duties.\n\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of S. 1729, the bill that is \ncurrently at the desk, sponsored by the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison, entitled, ``Interstate Stalking, Punishment and \nPrevention Act of 1996.'' This legislation would do even more to \nsignificantly enhance the fabric of laws designed to deter and punish \nstalking.\n  First, the measure of the Hutchison bill would make it a Federal \ncrime to stalk another person across State lines or on Federal \nproperty. The amendment I am introducing today will address those cases \ninvolving the military and their dependents. Hopefully, the Congress \nwill take up the Hutchison bill so that it is applicable to all women. \nThe value of today's procedure is that the Senate will vote on the \nWarner amendment eventually. It will vote. I predict this vote may well \nbe 100 to nothing, sending the strongest signal that this legislation, \nwhich will be adopted for military personnel and their dependents, \nshould be expeditiously adopted for all women across this land.\n  Stalkers, under both bills, covered by one State's restraining order \nwould face a Federal felony--a Federal felony --if they followed their \nvictims to another State or the District of Columbia and continued to \nperpetrate the criminal action of stalking.\n  Third, the relationships other than spouses and ex-spouses would be \ncovered by the Hutchison bill, recognizing abusive relationships can \nand do happen between persons of the opposite sex who are not married \nor divorced.\n  Mr. President, this action by the Congress is long overdue. As I \nsaid, the House has acted on a companion piece\n\n[[Page S6605]]\n\nof legislation to that being held at the desk. There is no reason, in \nmy judgment, why the Senate should not expeditiously act, as has the \nHouse of Representatives, to get this bill to the President for \nsignature as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 16, 1996]\n\n  Navy Officer, Husband Die After Shootings at Andrews Air Force Base\n\n                  (By Steve Vogel and Arthur Santana)\n\n       When military police at Andrews Air Force Base received a \n     warning early yesterday that a man was on his way to the \n     military installation to kill his wife, they raced to close \n     the gates to the base. But a short time later, both husband \n     and wife, a Navy petty officer, lay dead inside their home, \n     and an Air Force police officer was seriously wounded.\n       The slain woman was identified by Air Force officials as \n     Melissa Comfort, 28. Her husband was Michael Comfort, 34. The \n     couple's two young daughters and another adult, who were \n     inside the home for several hours after Michael Comfort \n     arrived, were unharmed, authorities said.\n       Just before 2:30 a.m., someone called 911 and reported that \n     Melissa Comfort's life was in danger. Officials have not \n     identified the caller.\n       After police dispatchers altered the base about the call, \n     military police sealed off Andrews to try to prevent Michael \n     Comfort from entering, according to Air Force officials. But \n     it is possible that he already may have been on the grounds. \n     Michael Comfort, who is not in the military, did not live \n     with his wife on the base, according to Lt. Karl Johnson, a \n     Navy spokesman, who said Michael Comfort was barred from \n     seeing his wife by a protective order.\n       ``Unfortunately, the individual got in before they locked \n     down, or he jumped the fence,'' said Mike Beeman, a base \n     spokesman. Beeman said Air Force police took action ``moments \n     after'' the warning was received.\n       Two members of Air Force Security Police were sent to check \n     on Melissa Comfort and her daughters in the town house-style \n     duplex in the 4600 block of Maple Court on the western edge \n     of the base. But upon arrival, a man fired a shotgun at the \n     officers, officials said.\n       ``One guy opened fire and then retreated inside the \n     house,'' Beeman said.\n       One of the military police officers, security Airman 1st \n     Class Michael Blagoue, was struck in the face and abdomen by \n     shotgun pellets, Johnson said. Blagoue was in stable \n     condition at the base hospital, where he was expected to stay \n     the night, officials said.\n       The military police fired back at Comfort, Johnson said. \n     ``Whether they hit the suspect, we don't know,'' Beeman said.\n       Additional gunfire was heard soon afterward from inside the \n     house.

Mr. President, most people in this city, the majority of my \ncolleagues in this Chamber included, will walk around this harried town \ntoday and breathe deeply the sultry air of summer that has settled in \nupon us, registering only the mingling of Maine Avenue fish markets, \ntour-bus fumes, and suburban barbecues.\n  I, however, nudge open my office window and am greeted by the \nfragrances of breezes that have swept across the Appalachians, up and \ndown the Alleghenies, and have gently settled into the Potomac Valley. \nMy lungs fill with the spicy scents of cool sylvan settings and the \nsweet bouquet of mountain laurel.\n  The sounds that most others hear today may be just the clacking of \nMetro trains, the clamor of commuting workers, and the roar of circling \nairline traffic.\n  But through the urban din, I hear the sounds of string bands flowing \ndown the hollows and over the hills, the rush of river rapids, and the \nlaugher of adventurous climbers, scaling Seneca Rocks.\n  Mr. President, to most, today may mark merely the beginning of \nanother long, sticky summer but to me it is a date that tugs at my \nsoul, calling me home.\n  This day is the 133rd anniversary of the birth of West Virginia, my \nbeloved home State.\n  At the time West Virginia was admitted to the Union, America was in \nthe midst of a cruel and bloody civil conflict and West Virginia \nherself was gripped by a vicious type of guerrilla warfare which saw \nbrothers and sons and neighbors and longtime friends, facing one \nanother across battle lines in mountain skirmishes.\n\n  Fortunately, at the war's end, we remained one Nation--bound more \nstrongly than before--and West Virginia, having recovered from her \ndivisive beginnings and settled comfortably into this more solid union, \nwent on to mature into a graceful, independent-minded State.\n  West Virginia is where I long to be--the land where saffron shafts of \nsunlight pierce through the early morning mists in spring; where hymns \nfrom the religious song books speak louder than guns, and the \nattendance at family reunions can still swell into the hundreds.\n  It is a land of hardworking, honest, loyal, patriotic God-fearing \npeople who care about their communities and each other. Since the \nmoment of her birth, West Virginia has undergone great change; yet, as \nI so often like to boast, she has never lost her grasp on the ``old \nvalues'' that continue to set her apart among the 50 States.\n  Today, faith resides in her hills just as surely as it did when I was \njust a boy, living in her southern coal mining communities.\n  Faith is what has kept us going when hope has been in short supply. \nBut it is hope that shapes our vision of the future and drives us to \nachieve our dreams.\n  Mr. President, today, as we celebrate West Virginia's 133d birthday, \nit is appropriate that we should reflect upon her past. But it is also \nfitting that we should take this time to measure her progress and look \ntoward her tomorrows.\n  Therefore, on her birthday, my wish for my State and her people is \nfor the availability of quality education to prepare our workforce for \nthe jobs of the future; access to adequate health care; a continuation \nof a comfortable quality of life; construction of a more modern, safer \ntransportation infrastructure; and further development of a robust \nbusiness climate; protection of her natural resources; a comfortable \nquality of life, and the preservation of those ``old values'' that will \nguide her on a successful and honorable path into the next millennium.\n  While West Virginia may adapt and modernize and enjoy the fruits of \neconomic prosperity, I hope that she will always be the sort of place \nthat fills her native sons and daughters with a longing to be home.\n  Happy birthday, West Virginia. You are always in my heart.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6605-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6605-S6606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHURCH BURNINGS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, to burn a church is to destroy more than a \nbuilding. Burning a church strikes at the\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\nsoul of a community, at it most sacred place. These fires bring terror \nand tears to communities that often have known all too much of both. \nAnd we are all diminished in spirit by the despicable doings of a hate \nfilled few.\n  Yet even from such a cowardly and vile act, great good has sprung. I \nnote that upon the publicizing of these burnings, there has been an \noutpouring of support for the beleaguered congregations, both to fund \nthe rebuilding of the churches and to assist in the apprehension of the \nperpetrators. Reconstruction of the churches has become a community \naffair, with volunteers from across the Nation.\n  Those who would burn a church should remember that to do so serves \nonly to awaken a moral imperative to speak out and act against such \nviolence. George Washington reflected the spirit of the Nation when he \nwrote in a letter to the congregation of Touro Synagogue of Newport, \nRI, that the Government of the United States ``gives to bigotry no \nsanction, to persecution no assistance.'' Today, 206 years later, \nWashington's words echo with renewed fervor across an outraged land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6605-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE DEATH OF LE MAI, VICE FOREIGN MINISTER OF VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I wish to note with regret the sudden death \nlast week of Le Mai, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Vietnam. Le Mai \nhosted me for dinner just 3 weeks ago when I was in Hanoi. I found him \nto be warm, intelligent, and above all eager to continue the process of \nimproving relations with the United States.\n  Mai's death comes at a particularly difficult time in Vietnamese \npolitics. The Communist Party is scheduled to hold a crucial party \ncongress at the end of this month, where several important decisions \nregarding the near future of the country will be made. Mai would have \nbeen a strong force pushing Vietnam toward a more open economic system. \nHe told me in Hanoi that Vietnam's biggest mistake so far was imposing \na demand economy. He argued that the laws of capitalism ``just are'' \nand that Vietnam has developed much since economic reforms were started \nin the late 1980's. He also would have been a strong force pushing his \ngovernment toward more friendly relations with the West. He recognized \nthat his country needed political, as well as economic reforms and said \nhe wanted closer relations with the United States in part to help his \nfellow countrymen better understand our system.\n  Le Mai was one of the principle architects of the normalization \nprocess between the United States and Vietnam and his dedication to \nmoving that relationship further forward was evident in our \ndiscussions. He stressed the need for the United States to have an \nactive presence in Southeast Asia, economically, politically and even \nmilitarily. He understood the lingering problems that many in both \ncountries have with the bilateral relationship because of the war, but \nargued that it was important for governments to try to forge policies \nto get past people's emotions. He recognized, too, the responsibility \nthat he and other leaders in both countries had in creating those \npolicies, telling me that ``our generation fought the war, so it is our \nduty to solve the problems'' that resulted from it.\n  His death is a loss to his country and to the ongoing process of \nimproving relations between our two countries.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Johnston, I request \nthat a member of his staff, Comdr. Paul Gonzales, a congressional \nfellow, be allowed floor privileges for the duration of debate on the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for S. 1745, \nthe Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1997. The Armed Services \nCommittee has done an outstanding job by bringing to the full Senate a \nbill that responsibly addresses this country's national security needs.\n  Fortunately, the end of the cold war has reduced the most immediate \nthreat of nuclear war. And while it is natural to feel relief that the \nstruggle against Soviet expansionism has been won, it would be naive \nand short-sighted to conclude that real threats to our Nation's \nsecurity no longer exist. The end of the cold war has uncapped a host \nof long-simmering regional conflicts around the globe. Combined with \nthe proliferation of nuclear and missile technology as well as chemical \nand biological weapons, these limited conflicts carry the potential for \nfar wider consequences. We must recognize that the world is still a \ndangerous place and that maintaining an adequate level of military \npreparedness must continue to be a national priority.\n  The fact is that funding for national defense has been on a dangerous \ndownward track for over a decade. Funding for national defense has \nfallen by 41 percent in real terms since 1985. The fiscal year 1997 \ndefense budget will be at its lowest level since the Korean war buildup \nbegan in 1950.\n  Even more alarming is the fact that military procurement has dropped \nby 71 percent over the last 10 years. The practical result is that our \nservice men and women are forced to use aging equipment which will \nincreasingly impair military readiness. The defense budget submitted by \nPresident Clinton for fiscal year 1997 would unwisely continue this \nneglect of our military hardware and would--not for the first time, I \nmight add--postpone spending for critical weapons modernization \nprograms into the future.\n  The Armed Services Committee deserves credit for crafting a \nresponsible bill that addresses the need for modernization and provides \nthe necessary resources. The $12.9 billion added by the committee to \nthe administration's defense funding request is mainly for additional \nprocurement items including one DDG-51 destroyer, four F-16 fighter \nplanes, six F/A-18's, and one C-17 cargo transport. Nearly 30 percent \nof the $12.9 billion added by the committee is for accelerated research \nand development for programs such as missile defense, the new attack \nsubmarine, and a new arsenal ship armed with cruise missiles. These \nadd-ons reflect the concerns and priorities of the military services \nthemselves.\n  While upgrading and modernizing military hardware deserves a high \npriority, so too does ensuring that our Armed Forces personnel receive \nthe benefits they deserve. The best military equipment in the world is \nof little value without the highly trained and hard-working service men \nand women on whom our national defense depends. I am therefore pleased \nthat the fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill authorizes a 3-\npercent military pay raise and a 4-percent increase in the basic \nallowance for quarters.\n  Overall, the committee proposes a reasonable level of defense \nspending in the coming fiscal year, one which I believe acknowledges \nthat defense resources are not unlimited. The committee's \nrecommendation of $267.3 billion in defense spending for fiscal year \n1997 is only $2.1 billion above the fiscal year 1996 level in nominal \nterms. Adjusted for inflation, the committee's recommended defense \nauthorization level is actually $5.6 billion below the current level of \ndefense spending in real terms.\n\n  Mr. President, the people of Maine support a strong national defense \nand they have always been ready to do their part. Maine's Bath Iron \nWorks is one of two private U.S. shipyards that build the Arleigh Burke \nclass destroyer for the Navy. I am pleased that the fiscal year 1997 \nDefense authorization bill authorizes $3.4 billion for four destroyers \nin fiscal year 1997 plus $750 million in advance procurement for one \nadditional ship in fiscal year 1998. The advanced procurement for a \nfiscal year 1998 destroyer is crucial to implementing the Navy's \nacquisition plan of building three ships per year in each of the 4 \nyears from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2001. As a result of \nthis orderly and efficient procurement\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\nplan, the price per ship will drop significantly and the Navy will \nrealize cost savings of $1 billion over the 4-year period.\n  The bill also adds $45.3 million to continue the Navy's current \nstrength of 13 active and 9 reserve squadrons of P-3 patrol aircraft. \nFour active and three reserve P-3 squadrons are based at Maine's \nBrunswick Naval Air Station, the only active military airfield in New \nEngland. These squadrons plays an important role in antisubmarine \nwarfare in the North Atlantic sealanes and in the Navy's littoral \nwarfare mission in Europe and the Mediterranean region. One of the \nactive P-3 squadrons based at Brunswick Naval Air Station in Maine is \ntargeted for decommissioning for budgetary reasons, not because there \nhas been any change in the Navy's mission. The funds authorized in this \nbill will ensure that Brunswick NAS will maintain its current level of \nfour active P-3 squadrons.\n  Mr. President, S. 1745 embodies a well-balanced approach to our \nnational defense in fiscal year 1997. It preserves our readiness to \nmeet military emergencies, it emphasizes modernization and new weapons \nprocurement, it continues research and development of promising new \ntechnologies, and it treats our military personnel fairly. Again, I \ncongratulate the Armed Services Committee on their work, and I urge \nthat the bill be adopted.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6606-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MILITARY NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from South Carolina has \nbeen working diligently, and he called a hearing. We have a number of \nvery important military nominations out of our committee. They are now \npending on the calendar. I know he has also followed that and has been \nworking diligently to try to get all of these nominations approved by \nthe end of business this evening, or certainly by tomorrow.\n  I both thank him for that, and I emphasize to all of our colleagues \nhow important it is. Many of these positions need to be filled now. We \nhave had these nominations before us for the appropriate time. We have \nlooked into them on the committee. They are very top officials that \nwill be going to various and important positions all over the world.\n  We have General Kadish, U.S. Air Force, who is one of these.\n  We have General Kross. General Kross will be going to TRANSCOM.\n  We have a number of Army nominations.\n  We have General Tilelli, to be the top military official in a very, \nvery important and volatile part of the world, Korea. He wears two \nhats, both in U.S. Army and the U.N. Command.\n  We have General Wesley Clark in the SOUTHCOM position--enormously \nimportant.\n  We have a number of U.S. Army Reserve officers: General Bergson, \nGeneral Caton, General Kropp, General O'Connell, Colonel Deloatch, to \nbe major generals; Colonel Diamond, to be brigadier general; Colonel \nGilley, Colonel Gilliam, Colonel Roan, Colonel Rossi, and Colonel \nSimmons, to be brigadier generals.\n  We have Lt. Gen. David Bramlett going to FORCEM, another very \nimportant position, commanding all of our Army forces in the United \nStates.\n  We have General Schoomaker.\n  We have a number of Marine Corps generals:\n  Brigadier General Braaten; Brigadier General DeLong; Brigadier \nGeneral Hanlon; Brigadier General Higginbotham; Brigadier General \nKaramarkovich; Brig. Gen. Jack Klimp;\n  Maj. Gen. Carol Mutter, she will become the head of manpower in the \nMarines Corps. She will also became the highest ranking female to serve \nnot only in the Marine Corps but also in the history of our military. I \nhave met her, have talked to her, and have followed her career--an \nenormously important general.\n  I will not name all of these, but I guess the first thing I would \nlike to say to my chairman, Senator Thurmond, is that I appreciate his \ndiligence in trying to get these nominations through, and I hope that \nwe will be able to get all of them through this evening.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues who may have questions about any of \nthe nominees or have any concerns about the nominees, to basically come \nto the floor and let us know and state their concerns, and let us see \nif we cannot follow them and get all of these nominations through.\n  I think it is important for them to go through. I believe, if any of \nthem do not go through, that it is very important for the leadership of \nthe Senate to schedule a debate and let us debate them. If there are \nany concerns about any of them, I think we ought to debate it, get the \nconcern out on the floor and have the Senate vote on it.\n\n  That would be my hope. I believe the Senator from South Carolina will \nshare that hope.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, these nominations have been before us \nfor quite a time. They all meet the requirements. They should be \napproved. They are needed in their respective services. I hope that we \ncould get those up as quickly as possible and get them approved.\n  There is one that is being objected to by a Senator. Maybe we can act \non the rest of them. I would like to see all of them acted on, \nincluding that one. But maybe we can act on the rest of them so they \ncan go about performing their duties.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there was a unanimous-consent request that \nwas submitted today asking that all amendments be filed today or not be \nin order. That unanimous-consent request was not agreed to. It is my \nstrong hope, though, that we will be able to have that kind of \nunanimous-consent request agreed to early next week.\n  I serve notice on our side of the aisle that we would like all \namendments filed by 4 o'clock next Tuesday afternoon. I have talked to \nthe chairman about this. I have talked to the majority leader, Senator \nLott, about this. It is certainly my intention to do everything \npossible to get that kind of unanimous-consent agreement early next \nweek.\n  So I serve notice today to all our colleagues, particularly those on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle, from my perspective, that I will do \neverything in my power to help Senator Thurmond, and the leaders on \nboth sides of the aisle, in their efforts to move this bill next week. \nThe way to do that is to have all amendments that are going to be \nconsidered on this bill in by Tuesday at 4 o'clock.\n  It is my understanding that the majority leader would like to pass \nthis bill next week, as well as the Defense appropriations bill. We \nhave gotten bogged down on nongermane amendments now. It is my hope we \ncan get back on Defense amendments, stick to those and get this bill \ndone next week.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, there is no more important legislation \nbefore this Congress than to get this Defense authorization bill \npassed. We have been pleading with the Members to come in with their \namendments. They have been delayed, delayed. Now the time has come to \nact.\n  We ask everyone who has an amendment to come forward and present \ntheir amendment by Tuesday at 4 o'clock. We are going to begin acting. \nWe would like to have the amendments all in at that time. I urge all of \nthe Members to do that, especially those on the Republican side. \nSenator Nunn has spoken about the Democratic side. He and I are working \ntogether. We are working together for the good of the country with this \nbill. It is nonpartisan.\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\n  We want to get action. We want to get results. We want to help this \nNation. To do it, we ought to pass this Defense authorization bill as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I also want to commend our able majority leader for \nall he is doing to help us get this bill passed. He was a member of \nthis committee at one time, a very stalwart, able member. I am sure he \nwill continue his commitment on this bill. We thank him very much.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for those \ncomments. I enjoyed my 8 years on the committee. I will always feel \nlike I am a part of it. As usual, I will continue to take orders and \ndirections from the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from \nGeorgia, as I have just been doing to try to find ways to move this \nbill and get some votes and also get some of the issues that really \nshould not be on this bill to be handled in some other way. I am going \nto work with the distinguished Democratic leader to make sure we do \nthat.\n\n  I, too, want to say Members should have their amendments ready. I am \nglad we are going to move on Tuesday to get that list. We have already \nnotified our Members on our hot line system today as if a unanimous-\nconsent agreement was reached, even though it was not, to get their \namendments in. We really need to press that point. I know the \nDemocratic leader is going to be working on that, too. We will work \nwith you.\n  We are determined we are going to get this bill done before there is \nany Fourth of July recess. We made a commitment to go out next Friday, \nbut we have work to do, and we are going to get it done next week, even \nif we do have to stay late at night.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I think it is well for them to understand, we are going \nto take no recess until we get this bill accomplished.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have some requests now we would like to \nwork through with the Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6607-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF KEITH R. HALL\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nendorse the nomination of Mr. Keith R. Hall to be Assistant Secretary \nof the Air Force for Space. I have known Mr. Hall since 1983, when I \nwas first appointed to serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I \ncame to know Mr. Hall particularly well during the period from 1987 to \n1990, when I served as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee. \nDuring that period, the chairman and I relied heavily on Mr. Hall for \nassessments of the arcane programmatics surrounding the President's \nbudget submissions for the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the National \nReconnaissance Office. Throughout this period, Mr. Hall demonstrated \nexceptional knowledge and expertise, unflagging energy and integrity, \nand a truly nonpartisan spirit of cooperation with myself and other \nmembers of the minority party on the committee.\n  In 1991, Mr. Hall left the Intelligence Committee to become the \nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security in \nthe Office of the Secretary of Defense. By all accounts, he served very \nably in that position, instituting new procedures to try and eliminate \npotentially wasteful duplication between national and tactical \nintelligence programs. From May 1995, until February of this year, Mr. \nHall served as the Executive Director for Intelligence Community \nAffairs. In that position, Mr. Hall was directly responsible to the \nDirector of Central Intelligence for developing the President's \nNational Foreign Intelligence Program. I think it came as no surprise \nto anyone that Secretary Deutch brought Mr. Hall with him from the \nDefense Department when he became Director of Central Intelligence.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the National Reconnaissance Office has \nbeen the target of substantial controversy in recent years as a result \nof the costs associated with its new headquarters as well as the \naccumulation of a vast excess of carry-forward funds that accumulated \nin various accounts in recent years. Inevitably, these controversies \nhave damaged the morale of the organization, notwithstanding the \nnumerous spectacular achievements of the NRO. There is no doubt in my \nmind that Mr. Hall will be forthright in all of his dealings with \nCongress; that he will ensure there is no repetition of such \ncontroversies; and that he will be able to maintain and effectively \nmanage the careful cooperation between the Intelligence Community and \nDefense Department that is necessary for the effective operation of the \nNational Reconnaissance Office.\n  Mr. Hall has earned the confidence of officials at all levels of the \nadministration and he certainly earned my confidence during his able \nservice on the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He is an \noutstanding individual and I urge my colleagues to support his \nnomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Hall's complete resume be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resume was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follow:\n\n     Keith R. Hall, Deputy Director, National Reconnaissance Office\n\n       Keith R. Hall was appointed Deputy Director, National \n     Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and Acting Director, NRO on 27 \n     February 1996. Prior to his appointment, Mr. Hall had served \n     as Executive Director for Intelligence Community Affairs, \n     assuming that position in May 1995. In this capacity he led a \n     community staff which reported directly to the Director of \n     Central Intelligence providing advice and assistance to the \n     Director in planning and executing his Community management \n     responsibilities. Mr. Hall was then principal architect and \n     co-chairman of the Intelligence Program Review Group process. \n     He was also co-chairman of the Security Policy Forum and with \n     the Vice Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, directed the study \n     group which proposed the creation of the Imagery and Mapping \n     Agency.\n       Mr. Hall has been involved in United States intelligence in \n     various capacities since 1970. He served nine years in Army \n     intelligence where he was assigned to various signals and \n     human intelligence positions, including two tours in which he \n     commanded overseas operational intelligence units. In 1979, \n     having been nominated and competitively selected as a \n     Presidential Management Intern, he resigned from the Army and \n     was appointed to the Office of Management and Budget where he \n     was the budget examiner for the Central Intelligence Agency \n     until 1983.\n       From 1983 to 1991, Mr. Hall served in a variety of \n     professional staff positions with the Senate Select Committee \n     on Intelligence, eventually serving as Deputy Staff Director. \n     In that capacity, he had primary responsibility for \n     supporting Committee members in the annual budget \n     authorization process involving all United States \n     intelligence activities. As a member of the Committee's \n     senior staff, he also played a key role in other Committee \n     activities including oversight of intelligence programs, \n     interaction with other Congressional and Executive Branch \n     elements, and review of intelligence-related legislation.\n       From 1991 until his appointment as Executive Director for \n     Intelligence Community Affairs, Mr. Hall served as the Deputy \n     Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security \n     in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. His \n     responsibilities included policy development, resource \n     management, and oversight for all Defense intelligence, \n     counterintelligence, and security activities. In this \n     capacity he served as Chairman of the National \n     Counterintelligence Policy Board and Co-Chairman of the \n     Intelligence Systems Board.\n       He received his BA in History and Political Science from \n     Alfred University and a Masters in Public Administration from \n     Clark University. Mr. Hall has received several military \n     awards and decorations; the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget Award for Professional Achievement, the \n     Central Intelligence Agency Gold Seal Medallion, and the \n     Secretary of Defense Award for Distinguished Civilian \n     Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6608-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6608-S6609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY THE UNITED STATES? HERE'S WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending June 14, the United States imported 8,400,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 400,000 barrels less than the 8,800,000 \nbarrels imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 57 percent of their needs last \nweek. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained about 45 \npercent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil \nembargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n\n[[Page S6609]]\n\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? U.S. \nproducers provide jobs for American workers. Politicians had better \nponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when \nforeign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous \ncost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 8,400,000 \nbarrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6608-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I think so often of that November evening \nlong ago, in 1972, when the television networks reported that I had won \nthe Senate race in North Carolina. It was 9:17 in the evening and I \nrecall how stunned I was.\n  I had never really anticipated that I would be the first Republican \nin history to be elected to the U.S. Senate by the people of North \nCarolina. When I got over that, I made a commitment to myself that I \nwould never fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who \nwanted to see me.\n  I have kept that commitment and it has proved enormously meaningful \nto me because I have been inspired by the estimated 60,000 young people \nwith whom I have visited during the 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  A large percentage of them are greatly concerned about the total \nFederal debt which back in February exceeded $5 trillion for the first \ntime in history. Congress created this monstrous debt which coming \ngenerations will have to pay.\n  Mr. President, the young people who visit with me almost always are \ninclined to discuss the fact that under the U.S. Constitution, no \nPresident can spend a dime of Federal money that has not first been \nauthorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate of the United \nStates.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I decided that it was important that a daily record \nbe made of the precise size of the Federal debt which, at the close of \nbusiness yesterday, Wednesday, June 19, 1996, stood at \n$5,120,985,354,306.65. On a per capita basis, the existing Federal debt \namounts to $19,316.20 for every man, woman, and child in America on a \nper capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt in the 24 hours since my report \nyesterday--which identified the total Federal debt as of close of \nbusiness on Tuesday, June 18, 1996--shows an increase of more than $2 \nbillion--$2,784,604,782.12, to be exact. That 1-day increase alone is \nenough to match the total amount needed to pay the college tuition for \neach of the 412,901 students for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6609-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF ALICE M. RIVLIN\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon, I joined 40 \nRepublicans to oppose the nomination of Alice Rivlin to the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve. I wanted to take a moment now to \nexplain my vote.\n  Let me emphasize that my vote should not reflect personally on Dr. \nRivlin. Instead, it was exclusively based upon the manner in which the \nClinton administration has not been forthcoming regarding its budget \nsubmission for fiscal year 1997.\n  As has been made clear in previous debates, in order to reach balance \nby the year 2002, the Clinton budget would require dramatic \ndiscretionary spending cuts in 2001 and 2002. These cuts would affect \nprograms across the Government, including veterans' health care, \nmedical research, and WIC.\n  Subsequent to the submission of this budget, several Cabinet \nSecretaries testified before Congress that the spending cuts required \nunder the President's budget were subject to renegotiation on a yearly \nbasis and should not be taken literally. In other words, the \nPresident's own appointees, who helped put his budget together, were \nclaiming that the policies necessitated by that budget were not going \nto be pursued.\n  As Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Dr. Rivlin has \nbeen requested to account for the conflict between the President's \nbudget and the testimony of his Cabinet Secretaries. As of this \nafternoon, however, Dr. Rivlin has been unable to provide what would be \ntermed, in my opinion, as a suitable explanation. That is why I opposed \nher nomination.\n  Before I yield the floor, Mr. President, let me make myself clear. I \nhave no misgivings about Dr. Rivlin's fitness or ability to fill the \nposition to which the President has nominated her. Instead, my vote \nreflects my dismay at Congress' inability to get a straight answer from \nthe administration about whether it stands behind its budget submission \nor not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6609-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6609-S6610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nFORMER ALABAMA SENATOR JEREMIAH DENTON AND THE DENTON AMENDMENT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, former Alabama Senator Jeremiah Denton was \nrecently honored at a luncheon and conference here on Capitol Hill for \na significant amendment he sponsored and secured passage of in 1984. \nThe event honoring Senator Denton was hosted jointly by our colleague \nSenator DeWine of Ohio and Matthew:25 Ministries in Cincinnati, which \noperates a relief program for schools, orphanages, and clinics in \nNicaragua.\n  This amendment passed as a part of the Defense authorization bill on \nOctober 19, 1984. It allowed, for the first time, the shipment of \nhumanitarian goods from non-profit groups free of charge on military \nplanes on a space-available basis. These goods include school, medical, \nand agricultural supplies and range from hospital beds to pencils.\n  Congress approved the legislation in order to resolve various legal \nquestions involved in such shipments and in order to take advantage of \nunused space on military vessels in Central America in times of crisis. \nIt has since been expanded to encompass most of the world, and to date, \nmore than 10 million pounds of goods have been shipped to needy \ncountries. In fiscal year 1995, the program was used to transport \napproximately 2 million pounds of humanitarian goods to 21 different \ncountries. It is now known widely as the Denton Amendment Program. \nSenator Denton was a member of the Armed Services Committee while in \nthe Senate.\n  Groups such as Gay Construction of Decatur, AL, have used the program \nto ship 40,000 pounds of medical and school supplies to orphans in \nAlbania. The Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi used it in March 1995 to \nsend 4,000 pounds of medical supplies and clothing to a small village \nin the Honduras.\n  Under the Denton program, the Department of Defense pays for the \nextra fuel used by its planes due to the heavier loads. The U.S. Agency \nfor International Development pays for inspection costs, which are \nusually very small, and the Department of State monitors compliance of \nshipments to be certain they are consistent with American foreign \npolicy initiatives.\n  Senator Denton was once a Navy pilot who was shot down over Vietnam \non July 18, 1965. He spent 7\\1/2\\ years as a prisoner-of-war in a camp \nin Vietnam. He first received national attention during a 1966 \ninterview his captors arranged with a Japanese television station. \nDuring this interview, he defied his captors' order to condemn American \npolicy, saying he would support the U.S. Government's position as long \nas he lived. He also blinked the word ``torture'' in Morse code into \nthe camera. The message, which was picked up by Naval intelligence \nofficers, was the first confirmation that American POW's were being \nbeaten and generally mistreated by the North Vietnamese. Senator \nDenton's ordeal was documented in his book, ``When Hell Was in \nSession,'' which was also made into a movie.\n  As a military pilot and naval aviator, he had seen the poverty that \nexisted in many countries, especially in Central America. He also knew \nthat there was often empty space on cargo flights and that pilots often \nmade ``dry runs'' in order to maintain their edge. When he put these \nfacts together, the idea for his amendment came rather easily.\n  I commend and congratulate former Senator Denton for his strong \nleadership roles in both the Armed Forces and in the U.S. Senate. I \nalso salute him for the tremendous sacrifices he made for his country \nduring the Vietnam war. The Denton Amendment Program is an outstanding \nexample of how the concern and efforts of one individual can make a \nreal difference in the world.\n\n[[Page S6610]]\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 12:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1136.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ncertain cash rent farm landlords to deduct soil and water conservation \nexpenditures; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce important tax \nlegislation to improve our Nation's soil conservation and water \nquality. This measure will extend the conservation expense income tax \ndeduction to farmers who improve soil and water conservation and rent \nthat farmland to family members on a cash basis. This legislation \nbuilds upon an existing and successful income tax provision that \napplies to similar improvements on share-crop rentals. I encourage my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this legislation and thereby endorse an \nenvironmental tax policy that uniformly encourages conservation \nimprovements on our Nation's farms.\n  Among all of our Nation's farmland, 4 out of 5 acres in the United \nStates rely on private landowners and tenants to care for the natural \nresources. Even though all farmers should be encouraged to become good \nstewards of the land, current tax policy does not provide incentives to \nhelp all private landowners and tenants to make conservation \nimprovements that are consistent with environmental policy. On the one \nhand, farm landlords operating on a share-crop basis are rewarded with \nan income tax deduction for soil and water conservation improvements. \nHowever, cash rent landlords who make the same conservation \nimprovements are denied a similar income tax deduction. My legislation \nwill eliminate this inequality.\n  Mr. President, 43 percent of our Nation's farmland is rented. Of that \nfarmland, 35 percent is rented on a share-crop basis, and 65 percent is \nrented on a cash basis. Share-crop rentals are arrangements where \nlandlords typically contribute the real estate and improvements, and \ntenants contribute the labor. Cash rentals are also arrangements where \nlandlords usually contribute the real estate and improvements. However, \nthe landlords also contribute labor since these agreements are many \ntimes within a family farm environment.\n  To further compare, share-crop landlords may deduct certain costs \npaid or incurred for the treatment or moving of earth for soil and \nwater conservation such as leveling, conditioning, grading, and \nterracing farmland. Likewise, share-crop landlords may also deduct \ncosts incurred to build and maintain drainage ditches and earthen dams. \nCash rentals, however, are not provided a tax deduction even though \nthey practice similar conservation methods. In other words, with the \nsubstance between these rentals being often the same, the tax treatment \nof conservation expenses is vastly different.\n  Mr. President, it may surprise you to know that many family farmers \nare cash rent landlords. The life cycle of a family farm is one where \naging parents gradually pass the family farm to their sons or \ndaughters. In many cases, because the children cannot initially afford \nto purchase the family farms from their parents, a parent-child \nbusiness relationship often starts out as a rental. Sometimes it is a \nshare-crop rental, other time they agree to a cash rent relationship.\n  Unfortunately, our tax and environmental policy toward these two \nrelationships remains irrational. If a landlord share-crops with a \nstranger, then that landlord can deduct conservation expenditures. \nHowever, if a widowed farm-wife cash rents farmland to her daughter and \nwatches over the grandchildren while she is in the field, the \ngrandmother cannot deduct conservation expenditures. Furthermore, a \nretired father who cash rents to his son and provides labor assistance \nduring harvest is denied a conservation tax deduction.\n  I believe that our tax policy should encourage and reward sound soil \nconservation practices regardless of the situation of the farmers. At a \nminimum, our tax policy should reward family farmers who make long term \nsoil conservation improvements to any of their farmland. In fact, these \nsound conservation practices have already aided many farmers in \nreducing our level of soil erosion. The USDA reported in its 1992 \nNatural Resources Inventory that soil erosion has decreased by 1 \nbillion tons annually. The USDA attributes one half of that decrease to \nimproved conservation efforts by farmers.

Mr. President: in compliance with paragraph \n11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources has obtained a letter from the \nCongressional Budget Office containing an estimate of the costs of S. \n1605, the Energy Policy and Conservation Amendment Act, as reported \nfrom the committee. In addition, pursuant to Public Law 104-4, the \nletter contains the opinion of the Congressional Budget Office \nregarding whether S. 1605 contains intergovernmental mandates as \ndefined in that act. I respectfully request that the opinion of the \nCongressional Budget Office be printed in the Congressional Record in \nits entirety.\n  The opinion follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC., May 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1605, the Energy \n     Policy and Conservation Act Amendment Act.\n       Enactment of S. 1605 would affect direct spending. \n     Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to the bill.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 1605.\n       2. Bill title: Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendment \n     Act.\n       3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources on April 24, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: S. 1605 would reauthorize certain \n     activities and programs at the Department of Energy (DOE) \n     through 2001. It would revise and extend the statutory \n     guidelines and requirements of the Energy Policy and \n     Conservation Act (EPCA), which outlines federal policies \n     regarding energy emergencies, energy exports, and certain \n     energy conservation initiatives. These amendments would \n     authorize DOE to lease underutilized capacity of the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to foreign governments to \n     the extent provided in appropriation acts. Other provisions \n     would remove certain restrictions on joint bidding by major \n     oil companies for leases on the Outer Continental Shelf \n     (OCS), modify various reporting and planning requirements, \n     and enable the state of Hawaii to purchase oil from the SPR \n     under certain conditions.\n       S. 1605 would authorize the appropriation of such sums as \n     may be necessary for the SPR for 1996 through 2001. It would \n     authorize specific amounts for 1996 for the State Energy \n     Conservation Program (SECP), the Institutional Conservation \n     Program (ICP), the Alternative Fuels Truck Commercial \n     Application Program, and programs under Part C of EPCA \n     (including activities supporting the International Energy \n     Agency, the Committee on Renewable Energy Commerce and Trade, \n     and the Committee on Energy Efficiency Commerce and Trade). \n     The bill also would authorize the appropriation of such sums \n     as may be necessary to implement the conservation grant and \n     alternative fuels programs for 1997 through 2001 and the Part \n     C programs for 1997 through 1999.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The following \n     table summarizes the estimated budgetary effects of S. 1605. \n     Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts for 1997 \n     through 2001, we estimate that enacting this bill would \n     result in additional discretionary spending totaling between \n     $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion over that period. CBO \n     anticipates that enacting this bill would affect direct \n     spending by reducing offsetting receipts from bonus bids for \n     OCS leases, but the impact is likely to be small for each \n     fiscal year. On average, we estimate that bonus bids would \n     fall by about $2 million a year over the 1997-2002 period.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  1996   1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS                                       \n                                                                                                                \nSpending under current law:                                                                                     \n  Budget authority \\1\\.........................................    325  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....\n  Estimated outlays............................................    279    173     57      9  .....  .....  .....\n                                                                                                                \n                                        WITHOUT ADJUSTMENT FOR INFLATION                                        \n                                                                                                                \nProposed Changes:                                                                                               \n  Estimated authorization level................................     31    291    291    291    286    286  .....\n  Estimated outlays............................................  .....    139    255    287    289    287    148\nSpending Under S. 1605:                                                                                         \n  Estimated authorization level................................    356    291    291    291    286    286  .....\n  Estimated outlays............................................    279    313    311    296    289    287    148\n                                                                                                                \n                                          WITH ADJUSTMENT FOR INFLATION                                         \n                                                                                                                \nProposed Changes:                                                                                               \n  Estimated authorization level................................     31    291    300    309    313    324  .....\n  Estimated outlays............................................  .....    139    259    300    310    318    167\nSpending Under S. 1605:                                                                                         \n  Estimated authorization level................................    356    291    300    309    313    324  .....\n  Estimated outlays............................................    279    313    316    308    310    318    167\n                                                                                                                \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING                                           \n                                                                                                                \n  Estimated budget authority...................................  .....      3      2      2      2      1      1\n  Estimated outlays............................................  .....      3      2      2      2      1      1\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1996 level is the amount actually appropriated.                                                         \n\n       The costs of this bill fall within budget functions 270 and \n     950.\n       6. Basis of estimate: Spending Subject to Appropriations. \n     The estimate of outlays for 1996 is based on amounts actually \n     appropriated for the fiscal year. In the case of the SPR \n     program, we assume that recently enacted appropriations \n     provide the necessary amounts for that program for 1996. The \n     authorizations specified in the bill for conservation grants \n     and the Part C activities exceed the enacted levels for those \n     programs by a total of $31 million. We estimate that the \n     additional authorization would not result in outlays, \n     because we assume that a supplemental appropriation would \n     not be enacted before the end of this fiscal year.\n       For future years for which authorization levels are not \n     specified, we generally projected spending based on the \n     amounts authorized by S. 1605 for 1996. For the SPR \n     facilities and operations account, we have based our 1997-\n     2001 projections on DOE's current estimate of the program's \n     requirements for 1997 because the 1996 level is inflated by \n     the one-time cost of decommissioning one of the SPR sites. \n     Starting in 1997, we project spending for the SPR at about \n     $220 million a year.\n       The table shows two alternative sets of authorization \n     levels for fiscal years 1997 through 2001: one without \n     adjustment for anticipated inflation, and a second that \n     includes an adjustment for inflation. For the purposes of \n     this estimate, we assume that future appropriations will be \n     provided before the start of each fiscal year and that \n     outlays will follow historical trends for the respective \n     programs.\n       For comparability to estimates for 1997 and beyond, the \n     table includes the $287 million gross appropriation for the \n     SPR facilities account for 1996. This SPR account received no \n     new budget authority for 1996 because the entire \n     appropriation was offset by collections of $100 million from \n     a sale of oil from one of the SPR site and by the transfer of \n     $187 million in unobligated balances from the SPR petroleum \n     acquisition account.\n       Under this bill, DOE could generate income by leasing \n     excess SPR capacity to foreign governments if such leasing is \n     approved in subsequent appropriation acts. If, for example, \n     appropriations actions were to trigger this authorization by \n     the beginning of fiscal year 1998, we estimate that the \n     annual income from such leases would total $1 million in \n     fiscal year 1999 and rise gradually to $11 million by 2002. \n     This provision of S. 1605, however, would have no direct \n     effect on offsetting receipts, because the leasing activity \n     would be contingent upon future appropriations action.\n       Direct Spending. Under current law, certain major oil \n     companies are restricted from bidding jointly for new leases \n     on the Outer Continental Shelf. CBO expects that allowing \n     such companies to begin bidding jointly on OCS leases would \n     likely reduce the number of bids submitted for OCS lease \n     sales. On average, we expect that this would lower offsetting \n     receipts from bonuses by about $2 million per year over the \n     1997-2002 period. This estimate is based on information from \n     the Minerals Management Service regarding the most recent OCS \n     lease sale. The effect of the bill's provision on industry \n     competition in future sales could vary, but we expect that \n     the likely impact on bonus bids would be small in any year \n     because relatively few winning bids in each sale are the \n     result of direct competition between companies that are \n     currently barred from submitting joint bids.\n       7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 \n     sets up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting \n     direct spending or receipts through 1998. CBO estimates that \n     the OCS provisions in S. 1605 would result in a reduction in \n     offsetting receipts from bonus bids, as shown in the \n     following table.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            1996       1997       1998  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in outlays......................          0          3          2\nChange in receipts.....................

Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal \n     governments: S. 1605 contains no intergovernmental mandates \n     as defined in Public Law 104-4 and would impose no direct \n     costs on state, local, or tribal governments. The bill would \n     extend the authorization for grants to states and localities \n     for energy conservation programs. It would also benefit the \n     state of Hawaii by guaranteeing that it would be allowed to \n     purchase oil from the SPR during a drawdown of the reserve.\n       S. 1605 would authorize appropriations totaling $56 million \n     for fiscal year 1996 and such sums as may be necessary for \n     fiscal years 1997-2001 for the SECP and ICP programs. In \n     contrast, $26 million was appropriated for 1996 for a program \n     that would consolidate these two programs and provide grants \n     to states. For the purposes of this estimate, we assume that \n     the states would not receive the additional $30 million \n     authorized by the bill, because it is unlikely that a \n     supplemental appropriation would be enacted before the end of \n     the fiscal year.\n       Under current law, states must match these grant funds at \n     different rates. Based on\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\n     information provided by DOE, CBO estimates that states would \n     be required to provide matching funds of approximately $5 \n     million in fiscal year 1996. CBO has no basis for \n     estimating the matching requirement in future years.\n       9. Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would \n     impose a new private sector mandate as defined in Public Law \n     104-4. It would eliminate an existing limit on the Secretary \n     of Energy's authority to require an importer or refiner of \n     petroleum products to maintain readily available inventories \n     of petroleum products in the Industrial Petroleum Reserve. \n     The existing authority has not been used and CBO estimates \n     that the Secretary would not use the expanded authority \n     granted by S. 1605. Thus, we estimate that the mandate would \n     impose no additional costs on the private sector.\n       10. Previous CBO estimate: On April 22, 1996, CBO \n     transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 2596, a bill to \n     reauthorize the Energy Policy Conservation Act through 1999, \n     and for other purposes, as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on Commerce on March 13, 1996. Differences between \n     that estimate and the estimate for S. 1605 result from \n     differences in the two bills. In particular, the two bills \n     authorize spending for different years, and, in some cases, \n     for different programs and amounts.\n       11.

In addition, pursuant to Public Law 104-4, the letter \ncontains the opinion of the Congressional Budget Office regarding \nwhether S. 1888 contains intergovernmental mandates as defined in that \nAct.

Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed S. 1888, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n     Amendments of 1996, as ordered reported by the Senate \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on June 19, 1996. \n     CBO estimates that enacting the bill would have no \n     significant impact on the federal budget. Enacting S. 1888 \n     would not affect direct spending or receipts. Therefore, pay-\n     as-you-go procedures would not apply to the bill.\n       S. 1888 would postpone the expiration of the provisions in \n     the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) related to \n     energy emergencies from June 30, 1996, to September 30, 1996. \n     This extension would authorize the Department of Energy (DOE) \n     to continue to operate the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \n     participate in the International Energy Agency, and conduct \n     related activities through the end of fiscal year 1996. \n     Because funds have already been appropriated for these \n     programs for all of fiscal year 1996, CBO estimates that \n     enacting this will would not have any significant impact on \n     the federal budget. Federal spending over the next three \n     months would be affected by the bill only in the event that \n     an energy emergency necessitates additional DOE expenditures \n     for actions authorized by EPCA.\n       S. 1888 does not contain any intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined in Public Law. 104-4.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.

Mr. President, this is a proud moment for me \nand the citizens of the State as we celebrate the 133d birthday of our \nbeautiful home.\n  On June 20, 1863, West Virginia gained its independence from Virginia \nin the midst of the Civil War. Since that time when the Nation's \nbrotherhood was severed, West Virginia became the 35th State to enter \nthe Union and has remained a strong and vital part of this country.\n  Known as the Mountain State, West Virginia is proud of its existence. \nIts beauty is evident as its rolling hills cover the land and its \nrivers and lakes surround the valleys. It is a place full of distinct \nculture and crafts. From the northern panhandle to the eastern \npanhandle extending down to the border of Kentucky, West Virginia \noffers some of the Nation's finest workers, industries, and businesses. \nWe continue to welcome new corporate members to our West Virginia \nfamily, including most recently Toyota. Each year more visitors come \nfrom all over to go skiing, hiking, whitewater rafting, and do many \nother activities that are first rate in West Virginia. No matter what \nthe season, West Virginia is a beautiful place to live and visit, loved \nthroughout the world.\n  I could continue forever about what this fine State has to offer and \ncontribute to its people, its visitors, and this country. For the past \n133 years, West Virginians have been loyal to the Union and to the \nState because they are proud of who they are and what they have become. \nLet us all come together to celebrate this fine day and this wonderful \nState we call West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6625-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO MSGR. THOMAS KEYS ON THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS ORDINATION \n                       AS A ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nfounder of the National Scrip Center, Msgr. Tom Keys, on the 25th \nanniversary of his ordination as a Roman Catholic priest. Monsignor \nKeys founded the National Scrip Center in 1986 to help save a Catholic \nhigh school that was facing a quarter of a million dollars worth of \ndebt. The National Scrip Center provides an innovative gift certificate \nprogram to help schools and nonprofit organizations generate revenues \nfor their programs.\n  Monsignor Keys has given numerous nonprofit organizations across the \ncountry opportunities to expand and succeed through the money they \nraise from scrip. Since 1986, Monsignor Keys' Scrip Center has grown \nsteadily and now helps over 5,000 organizations across the country. I \ncongratulate Monsignor Keys for all his hard work over the years in \nestablishing scrip which has become a vital program for so many \nnonprofit groups. His entrepreneurial spirit has brought community \nnonprofit groups and businesses together in a remarkable show of unity. \nHe is a role model for all of us to follow.\n  The National Scrip Center's education, training and fundraising \nsupport services have helped a network of 5,700 neighborhood Catholic, \nJewish and Protestant private, parochial, and public schools and \nnonprofit affiliates in more than 30 States.\n  Under Monsignor Keys' leadership, the center empowers nonprofits to \nhelp themselves generate operating funds. One of his primary goals is \nto provide children and young people with opportunities for affordable \nquality education. The Scrip Center was first started at the St. \nVincent's Parish in Petaluma, CA. Now, the national center is a network \nof nonprofits raising money for important causes, provides a customer \nservice department, software for marketing and accounting purposes and \nother services.\n  I congratulate Monsignor Keys for his vision and determination. The \nNational Scrip Center is a remarkable symbol of his 25 years of \ndedication to his community as a Roman Catholic priest. I am proud of \nhis efforts and commend his inspiration to nonprofit organizations \nacross the country. He has touched so many lives in the process. Best \nwishes to Monsignor Keys on his 25th anniversary as a spiritual leader, \nand I wish him continued prosperity, happiness, and blessings as the \nscrip network of nonprofit organizations continues to grow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6625-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6625-S6626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SHELLY LIST\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to the \nlate Shelly List, a novelist, television writer, and journalist of \ngreat distinction, whose work was not only commercially successful, but \nalso highly regarded by critics and other artists.\n  Shelly List was probably best known to Americans as the producer of \nthe successful and pioneering television\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\ndramatic series ``Cagney and Lacey.'' One episode she wrote was \nnominated for a Humanitas Prize, given for humanizing achievement in \ntelevision writing.\n  Other television writing credited to Shelly List, who worked closely \nwith her husband and coproducer Jonathan Estrin, was honored by the \nWriters Guild of America and earned the Ace Award for Distinguished \nWriting. The critical acclaim for her work goes on and on.\n  Shelly List was a humanitarian and community activist, as well. She \nserved on the board of Operation USA, which delivered medical supplies \nto disaster areas across the globe and she risked her life on trips to \nwar-torn areas.

Mr. President, a press conference was held \nyesterday, which included, among other persons, Congressman Tony Hall; \nthe head of AID, Brian Atwood; and Julia Taft, the head of Interaction. \nAlso present were Rudy von Bernuth, executive director of the Council \nof Voluntary Agencies, and David Beckman, president of Bread for the \nWorld.\n  The press conference called attention to the abysmal record of the \nUnited States compared to other nations in our response to world \nhunger. For example, France, with only 60 million people, compared to \nour 250 million people, has provided more foreign economic assistance \nthan the United States. And we have a gross national product--national \nincome--that is 5\\1/2\\ times that of France.\n  Japan, Germany, and France are all ahead of us in absolute dollars \ngiven, when once we were by far the leading country.\n  Not only that, but in terms of the percentage of our national income, \nwe are behind every Western European country, Australia, New Zealand, \nand Japan. Denmark provides almost 1 percent compared to our one-tenth \nof 1 percent. Ahead of us are Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, France, \nCanada, Belgium, Luxembourg, Australia, Switzerland, Austria, Finland, \nGermany, United Kingdom, Japan, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, New Zealand, \nand Italy.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the transcript of the news \nconference and the article in the Washington Post by Thomas Lippman.\n  The material follows:\n\n                    U.S. Loses Rank in Global Giving\n\n                         (By Thomas W. Lippman)\n\n       The United States, once the world leader in aid to \n     developing nations, has dropped to fourth in the amount of \n     money it spends on such aid and is a distant last among donor \n     nations in the percentage of economic output devoted to \n     foreign aid, according to new figures released yesterday.\n       Japan, France and Germany contributed more money to Third \n     World development last year than the United States did. \n     America fell to fourth place from second, behind Japan, in \n     1994.\n       The United States also was last among the 21 nations in the \n     Development Assistance Committee of the Paris-based \n     Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development in the \n     share of national output devoted to Third World assistance, \n     OECD reports.\n       Among the countries that contributed more of their gross \n     national product were Portugal, Ireland and New Zealand, \n     negligible economic powers by comparison with the United \n     States, which has by far the world's biggest economy.\n       The OECD figures were trumpeted at a news conference \n     yesterday by Clinton administration foreign aid director J. \n     Brian Atwood and spokesmen for nongovernmental groups \n     supportive of foreign aid. They used the figures to argue \n     that U.S. aid has fallen too far and that this country is \n     abdicating its global responsibilities.\n       ``Our foreign assistance program accounts for less than 1 \n     percent of our national [federal government] budget, about \n     $34 per taxpaying family,'' Atwood said. ``That's not \n     generous. We should feel ashamed. We are failing to fulfill \n     our responsibilities as a world power. More importantly, we \n     are failing our own national interests and we're failing our \n     own national values.''\n       Atwood's Agency for International Development has been hit \n     especially hard by budget cuts imposed by the Republican-\n     controlled Congress, where many members are hostile to most \n     forms of foreign aid. This morning, Atwood said, AID will \n     begin laying off 200 workers, including veterans with years \n     of experience in the field and foreign language skills, \n     because ``we do not have the budget to sustain their \n     employment.''\n       Atwood and his allies--including Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) \n     and Julia Taft, president of the Interaction umbrella \n     organization of volunteer groups--made the same argument they \n     have been making for the past year and half: that it is \n     penny-wise but pound foolish for Congress to beef up defense \n     spending but cut development assistance that could make \n     military interventions unnecessary.\n       ``Many members of Congress, especially the newer ones, they \n     express a deep hostility toward foreign aid,'' Hall said. \n     ``Many elected officials lack the vision and the leadership \n     to make it clear to their voters that the eradication of \n     poverty is in the best interest of everyone, both rich and \n     poor countries.''\n       Congress has not been moved by such arguments. Funds for \n     development and humanitarian assistance--not including \n     military aid--were cut from $8.4 billion in fiscal 1995 to $7 \n     billion this year and are scheduled to decrease a bit more \n     next year--even as the House voted earlier this month to \n     spend $11 billion more on defense than the administration \n     requested.\n       Using slightly different categories, the OECD credited the \n     United States with $7.3 billion in development aid in 1995. \n     Japan gave $15.5 billion, France $8.44 billion and Germany \n     $7.5 billion. The U.S. figure was one-tenth of 1 percent of \n     GNP, lowest in the contributors' group. The highest was \n     Denmark, at just under 1 percent of GNP.\n       The role of U.S. assistance in the developing world was \n     narrowed by the heavy concentration of funds going to Israel \n     and Egypt: $2.05 billion of the $7.3 billion was earmarked \n     for those two Middle East nations.\n       Supporters of foreign aid complain that Americans in \n     general, and many members of Congress, believe foreign aid is \n     a big-ticket item in the U.S. budget that can be slashed to \n     cut the deficit. The reality, Taft said, is that this \n     represents ``widespread misunderstanding about how little \n     money really goes to foreign aid.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\n               [From the Federal Document Clearing House]\n\n              Transcript of News Conference, June 17, 1996\n\n      (Speakers list: J.

Thank you very much, Julia, and thank you for your \n     leadership and that of Interaction, a group of American non-\n     governmental organizations who do humanitarian and \n     development work. We're pleased that the NGOs that are \n     members of Interaction are partners in delivering assistance \n     to people around the world.\n       We have a table at the front here full of leaders; David, \n     Rudy, Tony Hall. All, in their own way, have really been \n     leaders in this effort. We're here today to discuss some \n     rather dismal statistics. This is a very sad week for the \n     American foreign assistance program. The Development \n     Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development has this morning in Paris \n     released its 1995 statistics for official development \n     assistance.\n       The United States has now fallen behind Japan, France and \n     Germany in total aid volume. Our volume has dropped by one-\n     third and we continue to rank last among donor nations as a \n     percentage of our gross national product, as Julia indicated. \n     Tomorrow, USAID will begin a reduction of its workforce. The \n     first of 200 letters will be distributed to our American \n     staff informing them that we do not have the budget to \n     sustain their employment. This comes on the heels of reducing \n     the USAID workforce from 11,500 to 8,700. This is the second \n     largest reduction in the U.S. government.\n       The services of outstanding development professionals will \n     be lost to the U.S. government, possibly forever. So, at the \n     moment when global development problems are mounting, the \n     United States is severely damaging its institutional capacity \n     to respond. At the same time, the overall contribution of the \n     industrial nations to development has fallen another 10 \n     percent. This is a reduction of 18 percent in the last two \n     calendar years.\n       International organizations, the United Nations and the \n     international financial institutions, led by the World Bank, \n     are being undermined just as the world faces major real \n     development problems. Eight hundred million people, mostly \n     children, are malnourished. Food shortages in many areas \n     of the developing world have become acute. Insurance \n     companies are paying out record amounts for weather-\n     related damages due to global warming. Millions of \n     families have no access to family planning services, which \n     is causing millions of unwanted pregnancies, maternal \n     deaths and abortions.\n       Nation-states are failing in greater numbers than ever due \n     to political, economic, environmental and demographic \n     pressures, unleashing a tide of refugees and displaced \n     persons. These problems will only get worse as the world's \n     population grows by one billion people each decade.\n       These new people can either be consumers, or they can be \n     the wards of the world's rich countries.\n       That's the choice that we face today. We Americans think of \n     ourselves as generous people. We respond when there is a \n     humanitarian crisis. But the time is over for measuring our \n     generosity simply by our response to disasters.\n       As Julia mentioned, we're the richest nation on earth. Our \n     economy produces $6 trillion a year in goods and services. \n     Yet our foreign assistance program accounts for less than one \n     percent of our national budget, about $34 per taxpaying \n     family.\n       That's not generous. We should feel ashamed. We are failing \n     to fulfill our responsibilities as a world power. More \n     importantly, we are failing our own national interests and \n     we're failing our own national values.\n       I think it's time to wake up and realize that we will not \n     balance our budget without sustained growth in the global \n     economy. We will not balance our budget if the developing \n     world continues to produce failed states that disrupt the \n     global economy. We need to make the investments in \n     development assistance that will preserve our children's \n     health, standard of living, and safety.\n       If we continue to ignore this responsibility, the world \n     will see increasing chaos, and our generation will be \n     condemned for its short-sightedness. Thank you.\n       Julia Taft. Thank you, Brian. Congressman Hall?\n       Hall. Thank you, Julia and Brian and David, Rudy. Ladies \n     and gentlemen and friends, today's report--pardon me--really \n     comes at an historic moment. This is a time of enormous \n     opportunities for peace and prosperity. Russia had just held \n     its second election on a record of more economic reform and \n     more trade.\n       But it's also a time of terrible suffering in countries all \n     over the world. There's well over 23 humanitarian crises that \n     are going on right now. And it's a time of internal chaos \n     that faces other countries where peace technically \n     prevails, such as in Bosnia.\n       The clearest message in today's report is that while the \n     quality of aid is improving, the quantity of financial \n     resources is slipping dramatically.\n       Two more reports offer a troubling picture of the future. \n     Four out of every five dollars that next year's foreign \n     appropriation bill cuts are in the programs that target the \n     world's poorest people. It does try to maintain the current \n     commitment to UNICEF and childhood survival programs, but \n     otherwise falls short of even last year's miserly \n     contribution.\n       The agriculture appropriation bill ignores the sobering \n     fact that wheat and corn prices have doubled, and that prices \n     for other commodities are near all-time highs. This means \n     significantly less food will reach the mouths of hungry \n     children and others next year.\n       And this is something that really hasn't been focused on. \n     The appropriation bill, the agriculture bill that we passed \n     last year--or I'm sorry, last week--is the lowest percentage \n     of tonnage that I can remember, probably the lowest \n     percentage of tonnage going to hungry people since the start \n     of the program. And it's been cut in half since 1993.\n       This is doubly shortsighted because the grain we are not \n     providing is grown by American farmers.\n       Many members of Congress, especially the newer ones, they \n     express a deep hostility towards foreign aid. Many elected \n     officials lack the vision and the leadership to make it clear \n     to their voters that the eradication of poverty is in the \n     best interest of everyone, both rich and poor countries.\n       The story doesn't end here, though, and, like the spirits \n     of Christmas past and present and future, these trends do not \n     seal our fate. I believe there is a different spirit in our \n     nation, and that this is the spirit that should guide us to a \n     different future. I believe that people are willing to help \n     people help themselves, and there is no shortage of support \n     for food aid and microenterprise programs, and popularly-\n     supported programs that do just that.\n       Both government programs and NGOs need seed money and \n     nurturing. I believe that people stand ready to help \n     children, especially, and the millions of refugees of wars \n     and weather disasters. Poll after poll supports this \n     readiness, and my own constituents affirm it to me every time \n     I go home. I believe my constituents are proud of the fact \n     that I work on these programs.\n       As a matter of fact--I've said this to you before, and I \n     can't say enough times--and that a recent poll showed that it \n     was a very wide, very wide poll from the standpoint it had \n     tremendous diversity across the country that people believed \n     that hunger and poverty issues are as important as balancing \n     the budget and health care issues.\n       There is a consensus emerging among governments, NGOs, \n     churches, and people who are guided by their conscience that \n     we know how to fight hunger and poverty, and that we can beat \n     it if we work together. Despite the critics, there is ample \n     evidence to support the consensus. Some 20 years ago, the \n     world banded together and they wiped out smallpox, and we \n     won. And we are very close to eliminating polio.\n       Winning that battle will mean that American families will \n     save the quarter billion dollars spent each year on polio \n     vaccines. It will mean that the dozen American children who \n     actually catch polio from the vaccine each year won't \n     anymore. And it will mean that we will save the lives of the \n     thousands of children crippled or killed by polio each year.\n       In the past 50 years, we have helped raise literacy by a \n     third, cut infant mortality in half, and increase life \n     expectancy from 44 to 62 years. The United States cannot \n     afford to ignore any region or segment of a population, \n     however poor. We are too connected, we are too attuned to the \n     other people we watch on television every night, we're too \n     vulnerable to diseases that begin continents away, and too \n     enriched by exports to nations whose people achieve a healthy \n     standard of living.\n       Interaction and development initiatives deserve a special \n     commendation for their Relief of Aid Report. It is hard \n     evidence that the quality of aid is improving, and it is a \n     clear call to action for developed countries to focus more \n     resources on hunger and poverty.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the United States should become a \nhumanitarian leader once again instead of dragging our feet. And in the \nlong run our failure to do the generous and right thing will cost our \npeople both in security terms and in economic terms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6626-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6627-S6628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MAKING MAJORITY APPOINTMENTS TO COMMITTEES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate will be in session tomorrow for morning business only. I had \nhoped that we would be able to get some more amendments considered on \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill, but we were having \ndifficulty getting Senators to be available to offer amendments, plus, \nthere were other considerations involved. So we will only have the \nmorning business. There will be no rollcall votes then during the day \non Friday. The Senate will then reconvene on Monday, and following the \nperiod of morning business, we will resume the campaign finance bill \nconsideration. There will be no rollcall votes during Monday's session \nof the Senate so that we can have this debate.\n  A cloture motion was filed on the campaign finance bill today, with \nthat cloture vote order to occur at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday. As a reminder \nto all Senators, first-degree amendments must be filed by 2 p.m. on \nMonday, and second-degree amendments by 12:30 on Tuesday. The Senate \nwill resume the Department of Defense authorization bill next week. \nTherefore, Senators should anticipate a busy week with rollcall votes \nthroughout each session.\n  As I indicated earlier, we have not made enough progress on this \nbill, and if we have to go into the night next week, we will just have \nto do that. I had hoped not to have to do that, but we have to find a \nway to get the work completed. We will have to look at that option. Of \ncourse, we will discuss that with the bill managers, and certainly with \nthe Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/20/senate-section/article/S6630-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
