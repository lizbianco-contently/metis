Mr. President, during my campaign for reelection in 1994, \na number of Indiana papers published articles describing the fourth-\nterm jinx that had afflicted Indiana Senators and speculating whether I \nwould be fortunate enough to overcome that jinx. Although five of my \npredecessors had each won three Senate elections, all of them had been \ndefeated in their fourth race. Some of the most prominent and \naccomplished names in Indiana politics, including James Watson, Homer \nCapehart, Vance Hartke, and Birch Bayh had fallen victim to the fourth-\nterm jinx.\n  The independent-minded voters of Indiana have never been shy about \nexpressing their dissatisfaction with an incumbent. In fact, the \naverage length of service among all Indiana Senators is just a little \nmore than 8 years. Five Hoosier Senators held office less than a year. \nThe shortest Senate service was that of Charles William Cathcart, who \nserved less than 2 months of an unexpired term. Only 10 of the 43 \nHoosier Senators served more than 2 terms.\n  One reporter--Mary Dieter, who covers Indiana politics for the \nLouisville Courier-Journal--added a twist to the fourth-term jinx \nstory. She noted that even if I broke the jinx, I would not become the \nlongest serving Indiana Senator upon being sworn in. That distinction \nwould still belong to Daniel Wolsey Voorhees, who had served more than \na year of an unexpired term before winning three of his own. He served \nin this body from November 1877 until March 1897.\n  As a consequence of Voorhees' long tenure, not until today has this \nSenator passed the previous record for length of service by a Senator \nfrom Indiana. This day marks my 7,059th in office, passing the 7,058-\nday record set by Voorhees.\n  I am enormously grateful to the people of Indiana for granting me the \nopportunity to serve them; to my family for supporting my endeavors in \npublic service; and to all my past and present colleagues in the Senate \nwho have made my service here so rewarding and enjoyable.\n  I would like to commemorate this occasion by paying homage to the \nimportant record of Hoosier service to the U.S. Senate. I regret that \nlegislative history is a topic that rarely receives adequate attention, \neither in our schools or during deliberations in this body. So often \nour work in the Senate would improve with a greater understanding of \nthe history that lies behind us and of our role as stewards of an \ninstitution that will survive long after all of us are gone.\n  I have attempted in a small way to resist the erosion of Hoosier \nSenate history by asking my summer interns during the last few years to \nresearch Indiana Senators. Invariably my interns are surprised and \nbemused by the\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\nparallels between our present legislative labors and the actions of \nlong forgotten Senators. One wrote after researching the life of the \nvenerable Oliver P. Morton: ``One of the greatest Hoosiers of all time \nhas been forgotten. Let us recall him and learn from his experiences.''\n\n\n                             Frontier Years\n\n  Mr. President, although few Hoosiers have had long Senate careers, \nmany of my predecessors made indelible contributions to the Nation. \nCuriously, only 16 of the 43 Indiana Senators--37 percent--were born \nwithin the State: 10 were born in neighboring Ohio; 4 were born in New \nYork; 2 each were born in Pennsylvania and Virginia; 2 were born in \nforeign lands; and the remaining 8 came from assorted Eastern States.\n  No Indiana Senator has ever been born west of the Mississippi River. \nFor my Indiana Senate predecessors, the trek westward stopped at the \nWabash River. In Indiana they found land that brought abundance, the \nconfluence of great waterways, and a brand of frontier politics that \nproved irresistible to many young lawyers, farmers, and businessmen \nseeking to make names for themselves.\n\n\n                              James Noble\n\n  Ironically, one of Indiana's original Senators, James Noble, might \nhave set an insurmountable record of service had he not died at the \nyoung age of 45. Elected by the Indiana Legislature in 1816 as a \nDemocratic-Republican, he took office 5 days before his 31st birthday. \nHe died during his third term on February 26, 1831. Noble's 14 years of \nservice in the Senate would stand as a Hoosier record for three \ndecades.\n  Noble was a prominent lawyer who had played a central role in \nIndiana's constitutional convention and was a natural choice for \nappointment to the Senate by the Indiana Legislature. In the Senate he \nwas a leading advocate for using Federal funds to improve the Nation's \nroads and waterways, and he was instrumental in securing appropriations \nto extend the Cumberland Road westward from the town of Wheeling, in \nVirginia at that time. He argued against the view held by some of his \ncontemporaries that Federal spending on infrastructure improvements was \nunconstitutional. For Noble, building roads and waterways to bind the \nStates together was a vital activity of the Federal Government.\n  Noble and other early Hoosier Senators had been settlers of the \nIndiana Territory and had weathered the rigors of frontier life. \nBefitting a frontier Senator, Noble always insisted on traveling to and \nfrom Washington on horseback, rather than by stagecoach.\n  Several Hoosier Senators participated in military campaigns against \nTecumsah's Shawnees and other Indian tribes. Noble served as a colonel \nin the Indiana militia. Senator Waller Taylor, who was Indiana's other \noriginal Senator, served as Gen. William Henry Harrison's aide-de-camp \nduring the War of 1812. Senator Robert Hanna, who replaced Noble, was a \ngeneral in the Indiana militia.\n\n\n                              John Tipton\n\n  But the Hoosier Senator who epitomized the rugged life in a frontier \nState was John Tipton, an unschooled Tennessee native, who served in \nthe Senate from 1832 to 1839. Tipton's father was killed by Indians \nwhen the boy was just 7 years old. By the time he crossed the Ohio \nRiver into Indiana at the age of 21, Tipton was already the breadwinner \nof his household. He settled his mother and siblings in Harrison \nCounty, where he earned a living as a gunsmith and farmhand.\n  Tipton served under General Harrison during the Tippecanoe campaign, \nrising to the rank of brigadier general. After his military service, \nTipton would become a justice of the peace, sheriff of Harrison County, \nIndian agent, and State legislator. He helped select the site for a new \nState capital that would become Indianapolis. He also did an official \nsurvey of the Indiana border with Illinois. Tipton strenuously but \nunsuccessfully maintained that a port on Lake Michigan called Chicago \nrightfully belonged within Indiana's borders.\n  As Senator, Tipton continued to focus on frontier issues. He served \non the Military Affairs and Indian Affairs Committees. Later in his \nterm, he became chairman of the Committee on Roads and Canals, taking \nover from fellow-Hoosier William Hendricks. Like his predecessors in \nthe Senate, Tipton fought for appropriations to build roads connecting \nIndiana with the East.\n\n  As these roads were built and the Ohio River and Great Lakes were \ndeveloped, the frontier pushed westward. By the 1840's, Indiana had \ndeveloped from a frontier State into a burgeoning crossroads of \ncommerce and travel. With this transformation, the men representing \nIndiana in the Senate tended to be better educated and more motivated \nby national political ambitions than their pioneer predecessors.\n\n\n                            Edward Hannegan\n\n  Senator Edward Hannegan, who served in this body from 1843 to 1849 \nprovides a good example. He was a renowned orator who sought \nunsuccessfully the Democratic nomination for President in 1852. The \nlegendary Daniel Webster said of him: ``Had Hannegan entered Congress \nbefore I entered it I fear I never should have been known for my \neloquence.''\n  Hannegan's mix of rhetorical fire and elegance was demonstrated on \none occasion when he took to the Senate floor to denounce President \nPolk for his offer to Great Britain to set the northern border of the \nOregon Territory at the 49th parallel. Hannegan was a leading proponent \nof the expansionist view that was represented by the battlecry: ``54, \n40, or fight.'' Said Hannegan of Polk:\n\n       So long as one human eye remains to linger on the page of \n     history, the story of his abasement will be read, sending him \n     and his name together to an infamy so profound, a damnation \n     so deep, that the hand of resurrection will never drag him \n     forth. . . . James K. Polk has spoken words of falsehood with \n     the tongue of a serpent.\n\n\n                          Political Turbulence\n\n  In any event, Mr. President, Indiana's position as a crossroads of \nthe Nation was not limited to commerce and travel. Up to the present \nday it also has been a crossroads for American subcultures, economic \nforces, and political ideas. In his 1981 bestseller ``The Nine Nations \nof North America'', Joel Garreau conceptually divided the North \nAmerican Continent into nine subregions according to their economic, \nsocial, and cultural identity. It is not surprising that Garreau placed \nIndianapolis at the very intersection of three of these regions: the \nindustrial Midwest centered on the Great Lakes, the broad grain growing \nregion of the plains, and the South.\n  As a result, through much of its history, the cauldron of Indiana \npolitics has been characterized by its swirling unpredictability. \nViewed from a broad historical perspective, political parties in \nIndiana have never been able to dominate the landscape for long before \nthey were toppled by their rivals. For example, only one time since \n1863 has the seat that I hold been passed between members of the same \nparty. In the entire history of Indiana, the two Hoosier Senate seats \nhave never been occupied by members of the same party for longer than \n16 consecutive years.\n  The most turbulent time in Indiana politics was the Civil War era. In \nmany counties, residents had considerable sympathy for the southern \ncause, while other Hoosiers were ardent abolitionists. Democrats who \nopposed the war and supported the South were known as ``Copperheads.'' \nAnother group of Democrats opposed abolition, but wished to hold the \nUnion together. Before the war, these Constitutional-Union Democrats \nbacked political concessions to the South in the hope of preserving the \nUnion without war. When war began, however, many Constitutional-Union \nDemocrats reluctantly supported the northern war effort.\n\n\n                              jesse bright\n\n  Throughout the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction, at least one \nof the two Hoosier seats was occupied by a Democratic Senator with \nsympathies for the southern point of view. In 1862, one of these \nSenators, Jesse Bright of Madison, became the only Senator from a \nnonslave State to be expelled by the Senate for supporting the \nrebellion. The expulsion was all the more notable because Bright had \nserved as President pro tempore from 1854 to 1856 and again in 1860. \nThe catalyst for the expulsion was a letter from Bright to his friend \nJefferson Davis written on March 1, 1861--more than a month before the \nattack on Fort Sumter. The letter introduced another friend, Mr. Thomas \nLincoln, formerly of Madison, IN, to Davis.\n  It read:\n\n\n[[Page S4451]]\n\n\n       My Dear Sir: Allow me to introduce to your acquaintance my \n     friend, Thomas B. Lincoln, of Texas. He visits your capital \n     mainly to dispose of what he regards [as] a great improvement \n     in fire-arms. I recommend him to your favorable consideration \n     as a gentleman of the first respectability, and reliable in \n     every respect.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                     Jesse Bright.\n\n  The discovery of the letter late in 1861 provided an opening to \nRepublican Senators seeking to expel Bright for his southern leanings. \nThe Senator not only voted against many wartime provisions, he owned \nslaves and a plantation in Kentucky.\n  On December 16, 1861, Senator Morton Wilkinson of Minnesota \nintroduced a resolution to expel Bright. Wilkinson contended that the \nletter and Bright's addressing of Davis as ``His Excellency Jefferson \nDavis, President of the Confederation of States'' amounted to a \nrecognition of the legitimacy of the secession of Southern States. \nBright responded that in the days before the war began, many leaders in \nthe North continued friendly correspondence with acquaintances in the \nSouth and that his method of addressing Davis was nothing more than the \npolite use of a title.\n  Although the Judiciary Committee recommended against expulsion, the \nSenate debate ran strongly against Bright. He was harshly denounced by \nIndiana's Republican Senator Henry S. Lane and by future President, \nAndrew Johnson of Tennessee. On February 5, with the Senate Gallery \nfilled with onlookers, the Senate expelled Bright by a vote of 32 to \n14. His Senate career came to an end 1 month short of 17 years. Since \nthe Indiana Legislature was under the control of the Democratic Party \nin 1862 when Bright would have been up for reelection, his expulsion \ndenied him an almost certain fourth term.\n\n\n                            Oliver P. Morton\n\n  During the Civil War, Indiana was administered by Gov. Oliver P. \nMorton, the spiritual leader of the Indiana Republican Party. Morton \nwent on to become one of the most important Senators of the era of \nReconstruction and a national spokesman for the Republican Party. His \nlikeness can be viewed today a few hundred feet away in Statuary Hall.\n  Originally a Democrat, Morton broke with his party in 1854 over the \nKansas-Nebraska Act. His views on the slavery question developed in \nmuch the same manner as those of Abraham Lincoln. Beginning in the late \n1850's, he was an outspoken critic of slavery. In one 1860 speech he \ndenounced it as ``a moral, social, and political evil * * * a curse to \nany people, a foe to progress, the enemy of education and intelligence, \nand an element of social and political weakness.'' Like Lincoln, \nhowever, Morton carefully avoided advocating outright abolition, \ninstead focusing on stopping the extension of slavery. But after the \nSouth seceded and the fighting began, Morton was a key ally of Lincoln \nin prosecuting the war and supporting the Emancipation Proclamation.\n  Within a week of Lincoln's call for troops on April 15, 1861, Morton \nhad organized 12,000 Hoosier recruits--a number three times Indiana's \nquota. Over the course of the war, Governor Morton continued to be one \nof the most effective troop organizers for the Union. Indiana \ncontributed more than 200,000 soldiers to the Union war effort; all but \n17,000 of these were volunteers. Morton was revered by Hoosier troops \nbecause he used State funds to ensure that Indiana's soldiers were well \nclothed and equipped and to care for the widows and orphans of fallen \nHoosiers. Like Lincoln, Morton was not timid about using the power at \nhis disposal. He declared martial law in parts of southern Indiana to \nquell subversive activities by Copperhead groups. When the State ran \nlow on funds, Morton bypassed the Democratic legislature, financing the \nwar effort by borrowing from private bankers and soliciting \ncontributions from citizens and businesses.\n\n  In 1867 Morton began 10 years of service in the Senate. In 1865 he \nhad suffered an apparent stroke that left him partially paralyzed. \nDespite his infirmity, he was a vigorous debater and party organizer \nwho reveled in the political combat of the Senate. He became chairman \nof the Manufactures Committee and the Privileges and Elections \nCommittee. He also served on the Foreign Affairs and Military Affairs \nCommittees.\n  But the central issue during Morton's time in the Senate was, of \ncourse, Reconstruction. Though he had supported Lincoln's magnanimous \ngestures toward the South immediately after the war, Morton gradually \nbecame convinced that an uncompromising and complete reconstruction of \nthe South was necessary. He led the fight for passage and ratification \nof the 15th amendment which granted blacks the right to vote. To gain \nratification by the necessary three-fourths of the States, he proposed \na floor amendment requiring several Southern States to ratify the 15th \namendment as a condition for reclaiming their seats in Congress. His \nhardball tactics ultimately prevailed, but they brought accusations \nthat he was overly vindictive toward the South. To these charges, he \nreplied: ``I want peace in the South. I want it as earnestly as any man \ncan, but I want peace in the South on correct principles. I am not \nwilling to purchase peace by conceding that they were right and we were \nwrong.''\n  Morton died in 1877 before the end of his second term. With his \npassing, his seat fell into Democratic hands for almost 20 years. For \nit was the long-serving Daniel Voorhees who was appointed by the \nDemocratic-controlled legislature to replace Morton.\n\n\n                            Daniel Voorhees\n\n  Voorhees, who was known as the Tall Sycamore of the Wabash was a \nprominent Terre Haute lawyer who shared Jesse Bright's sympathy for the \nSouth and Edward Hannegan's passionate speaking style. During the \nentirety of the Civil War, Voorhees served in the House of \nRepresentatives where he frequently criticized President Lincoln. As a \nfervent believer in States rights, he saw the North's prosecution of \nthe war as unconstitutional. After Lincoln issued the Emancipation \nProclamation Voorhees declared:\n\n       Ten days before he issued it he said that he had not the \n     power to promulgate such a document and that it would do no \n     good if he did. In that he was right for once. But I suppose \n     he gave way to pressure. Yes, pressure. He was pressed. By \n     whom? By Horace Greeley, that political harlot, who appeared \n     in a praying attitude in behalf of 20 millions of people.\n\n  Lincoln's reelection in 1864 was a great disappointment to Voorhees, \nwho hoped that the President's defeat would allow for a compromise that \nwould reestablish both the Union and the rights of States to make their \nown decisions on slavery. After the war, Voorhees adopted a softer view \nof Lincoln because of the President's intentions to implement a \nmagnanimous reconstruction program.\n  As a Senator, Voorhees was a prominent forefather of the populist \nmovement headed by William Jennings Bryan at the end of the century. \nVoorhees devoted much energy to defending the agrarian interests of the \nMidwest and South. He opposed protectionist tariffs designed to benefit \neastern manufacturers, and he advocated a liberal monetary policy that \nwould expand currency to benefit farmers. He denounced the U.S. \nfinancial system as ``an organized crime against the laboring, tax-\npaying men and women of the United States.''\n  In 1893, Voorhees became chairman of the powerful Finance Committee. \nThat year, a major financial panic caused President Cleveland to call a \nspecial session of Congress to consider the repeal of the mildly \ninflationary Sherman Silver Purchase Act. To pass the repeal, he needed \nthe support of Voorhees. The issue divided Democrats, many of whom, \nlike Voorhees, strongly supported silver purchases. But Voorhees set \naside his natural inclinations to help the President from his party \nrespond to the financial panic. Voorhees considered passage of the \nrepeal of the Silver Purchase Act his greatest legislative \naccomplishment, although the measure actually did little to remedy the \ncountry's financial crisis.\n\n\n                      Hoosiers in National Office\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Vorhees had the distinction of defeating a \nfuture President--Benjamin Harrison--in his first Senate election and \nbeing unseated by a future Vice President--Charles Fairbanks--in his \nlast. In fact, the late 18th and early 19th centuries saw Indiana \nbecome a frequent supplier of candidates for national office. \nCircumstances had positioned Indiana to play a leading role in national \npolitics. Indiana had grown to become the seventh largest State in the \nUnion by the\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\n1870's, and it had become a swing State where party control changed \nfrom election to election. Both parties, therefore, had strong \nincentives to put Hoosiers on their national tickets.\n  Of the 20 individuals who served as either President or Vice \nPresident between 1870 and 1920, five were Hoosiers. Only New York, \nwith six, placed more individuals in Executive Offices during this \nperiod. Each of these Hoosiers was connected to the Senate, either as a \nformer Member or in performing their Vice Presidential duties as \npresiding officer.\n\n\n                            Schuyler Colfax\n\n  This succession of Hoosiers was begun by the unfortunate Schuyler \nColfax, who was President Grant's first Vice President from 1869 to \n1873. Colfax, whom Lincoln described as a ``friendly rascal,'' never \nheld a seat in the Senate. His political career was brought to a close \nby revelations that he had participated in a financial scandal that \noccurred during his earlier tenure as Speaker of the House. He avoided \nimpeachment proceedings largely because the scandal was not revealed \nuntil his Vice Presidential term was about to expire.\n\n\n                            Thomas Hendricks\n\n  Thomas Hendricks, a Democrat and lawyer from Shelbyville, IN, became \nthe second Hoosier Vice President, and the first to serve a previous \nterm in the Senate. He was elected by the Indiana Legislature in 1863 \nto the term that could have been the expelled Jesse Bright's fourth. In \nthe Senate, Hendricks was a sharp critic of President Lincoln. He voted \nfor appropriations to pay for troops, weapons, and supplies, but he \nopposed the Emancipation Proclamation, the draft, and the 13th, 14th, \nand 15th amendments. Hendricks lost his seat after just one term when \nthe Indiana Legislature fell into GOP hands in 1869.\n  In 1876, after a term as Governor, Hendricks got his first shot at \nthe Vice Presidency when he ran on the Democratic ticket with ill-fated \nPresidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden. In the most controversial \nPresidential election in American history, Tilden and Hendricks \nseemingly had won the election by a 203 to 166 count in the electoral \ncollege and by 260,000 popular votes. The Democrats were denied \nvictory, however, when Republicans disputed the results of voting in \nseveral Southern States. An election commission that favored the \nRepublicans ruled in favor of the GOP Presidential candidate Rutherford \nB. Hayes.\n  Hendricks again was the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee in 1884. \nThis time he was successful, as the Democratic ticket headed by Grover \nCleveland came out on top for the first time since before the Civil \nWar. As Vice President, Hendricks would preside over only a 1-month \nsession of the Senate before his death in November 1885.\n  Hendricks' untimely death left the country without a Vice President, \nPresident pro tempore, or Speaker of the House for the second time in \nthe decade. Under the 1792 Succession Act, this was the line of \nsuccession in the event of the President's death. No other official was \nmentioned. Had Cleveland died before Congress convened later in the \nyear, the country would have been left temporarily without a President.\n  Hendricks' death prompted Congress to pass a revision of the \nSuccession Act in 1886. It removed the President pro tempore and the \nSpeaker of the House from the line of succession and substituted the \nPresident's Cabinet officers in the order the departments were created \nbeginning with the Secretary of State. In 1947 at President Truman's \nurging, Congress again revised the succession order, returning the \nSpeaker and the President pro tempore to the line, but reversing their \norder so the Speaker ranked second behind the Vice President and \nthe President pro tempore ranked third, followed by the Cabinet \nSecretaries.\n\n\n                           Benjamin Harrison\n\n  Indianapolis Republican Benjamin Harrison, who would become our 23d \nPresident, also had the good fortune to gain experience in the Senate. \nHe served in this body from 1881 until 1887. During that time he \nchaired the Committee on Territories and was a strong advocate for \nprotecting and expanding the pensions of Civil War veterans. Harrison \nwas turned out of his Senate seat after only one term by a newly \nelected Democratic State legislature.\n  Nevertheless, Harrison retained his national prominence and defeated \nPresident Cleveland in the 1888 Presidential election, despite losing \nthe popular vote. Harrison's narrow victory in New York brought him \nthat State's 36 electoral votes and a 233 to 168 triumph in the \nelectoral college.\n  As President, Harrison implemented much of his economic program, \nincluding a high tariff. He signed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, \nwhile resisting the far more inflationary proposal for free coinage of \nsilver that was supported by Daniel Voorhees. In a rematch of the 1888 \nelection, Grover Cleveland easily defeated Harrison, who would return \nto his law practice in Indianapolis.\n\n\n                           Charles Fairbanks\n\n  Another Indianapolis Republican, Charles Fairbanks, served in the \nSenate before attaining the vice presidency. A close friend and staunch \nally of President McKinley, Fairbanks' Senate tenure ran from 1897 \nuntil 1905. Fairbanks was under consideration for the 1900 GOP Vice \nPresidential nomination, but he took his name out of contention. He \nplanned to run for President in 1904 when McKinley's second term \nexpired, and he believed that the Senate offered a better position from \nwhich to seek the GOP Presidential nomination. After all, no Vice \nPresident since Martin Van Buren had been elected to succeed his \nPresident.\n  This turned out to be a colossal miscalculation. In September 1901, \nFairbanks was cut off from a possible Presidential run by the tragedy \nof President McKinley's assassination. Vice President Theodore \nRoosevelt was elevated to the Presidency, ensuring that he would be the \nRepublican nominee in 1904. Fairbanks had to settle for the Republican \nVice Presidential nomination on the ticket with Roosevelt. This time he \ndid not pass up the opportunity, and he became Vice President in 1905 \nafter the GOP ticket swept to victory.\n  Fairbanks attempted to gather support for the GOP Presidential \nnomination in 1908, but Roosevelt's endorsement of William Howard Taft \nagain blocked the Hoosier's path to the White House. Once more in 1916, \nFairbanks was a candidate for Vice President on the ticket with Charles \nEvans Hughes. But they were defeated by incumbents Woodrow Wilson and \nHoosier Thomas Marshall.\n\n\n                            Thomas Marshall\n\n  Marshall never served in the Senate, but he presided over this body \nfor 8 years as Vice President from 1913 until 1921. He was the first \nVice President to serve two full terms since Daniel Tompkins had done \nso under James Monroe.\n  During his time of presiding over the Senate, Marshall gained a \nreputation for his dry Hoosier wit. After listening to a long speech by \nSenator Joseph Bristow of Kansas on the needs of the country, Marshall \nremarked in a voice audible to many in the Chamber: ``What this country \nneeds is a really good five-cent cigar.'' This line was widely reported \nin newspapers and became his most famous utterance. Marshall would \nfrequently poke fun at his own role as Vice President. He told a story \nof two brothers: ``One ran away to sea; the other was elected Vice \nPresident. And nothing was ever heard of either of them again.''\n  Ironically, though Marshall was considered a good Vice President, his \nmost notable action perhaps was something that he did not do. After \nPresident Wilson suffered a stroke in October 1919, many leaders \nadvised him to assume the Presidency while Wilson was incapacitated. At \nthe time, however, there was no provision in the Constitution governing \nthis situation. Marshall refused to replace the President, fearing that \nit would divide the country and create a precedent that could be used \nmischievously against future presidents. With the ratification of the \n25th amendment in 1967, which was sponsored by Senator Birch Bayh of \nIndiana, the Constitution provided a legal procedure for dealing with \nthe difficult situation of an incapacitated President.\n\n\n                            The New Century\n\n  Mr. President, just as Marshall's decision affected the future of the \nVice Presidency, several Hoosier Senators deeply affected the \noperations and customs of the Senate during the early 20th century.\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\n                            Albert Beveridge\n\n  One such Senator was Albert J. Beveridge of Indianapolis. Beveridge \nbegan his service in March 1899 at the age of 36. He had never held a \npolitical office prior to his election to the Senate. He served two \nterms, gaining a reputation for his energy and intelligence, as well as \nhis ambition.\n  Beveridge is the patron saint of freshman Senators seeking to resist \nthe constraints of the Senate's seniority system. In his excellent \ncollection of addresses on the history of the Senate, Senator Robert \nByrd of West Virginia offers an enlightening account of Beveridge's \nvigorous, but largely unsuccessful efforts to secure desired committee \nassignments as a freshman.\n  Beveridge ventured across the sea for a 6-month trip to the \nPhilippines, China, and Japan after his election by the Indiana \nLegislature in January 1899. Upon returning to Indiana in September of \nthat year, he was praised in the press for investigating an important \nissue firsthand. Up to this point, Senators had rarely ventured \noverseas on factfinding trips. When he traveled to Washington, DC, \nlater in the year for the opening of the congressional session, he was \nsummoned to the White House to brief President McKinley on his \nobservations.\n  Believing that his experience in the Philippines had made him the \npreeminent expert on the newly acquired islands, Beveridge campaigned \nto be appointed chairman of the Senate Committee on the Philippines. He \nalso sought a seat on Henry Cabot Lodge's powerful Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Among other steps, Beveridge visited Gov. Theodore Roosevelt \nin New York, who recommended him to Lodge. But Beveridge would be \ngranted neither the Philippines chairmanship nor a seat on Foreign \nRelations. Lodge wrote back to Roosevelt explaining: ``Beveridge is a \nvery bright fellow, well informed and sound in his views. I like him \nvery much, but he arrived here with a very imperfect idea of the rights \nof seniority in the Senate, and with a large idea of what he ought to \nhave.'' Beveridge had to settle for an ordinary seat on the Philippines \nCommittee.\n  In March 1900, freshman Beveridge again scandalized the Senate by \ndelivering his second major floor speech just 3 months into his first \nsession. For many of his senior colleagues, Beveridge was flouting the \nunwritten Senate rules governing the behavior of new members. In \nresponse to this transgression against his elders, Beveridge was the \nrecipient the next day of a subtle but stinging parody of his speech by \nSenator Edmund W. Pettus of Mississippi. According to a report in the \nNew York Times the performance caused Senators to roar in laughter at \nthe expense of Beveridge.\n  Beveridge survived and learned from his hazing. Though still \nboisterous and aggressive for a freshman, he focused his attention on \ncommittee work, eventually becoming chairman of the Committee on \nTerritories and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  During his time in the Senate, Beveridge's political philosophy \ntransformed from the standard conservatism of his party to \nprogressivism. Beveridge became a leader of the nationwide progressive \nmovement and worked to construct a foundation for progressive \nlegislation such as the first National Child Labor Law, the Meat \nInspection Act, and the Pure Food and Drug Act. This shift toward \nprogressivism, however, weakened his support among Republicans and \ncontributed to his defeat for re-election to a third term in 1910.\n  On April 8, 1913, the 17th amendment was ratified, forever \ntransforming the nature of Senate elections. The amendment transferred \nthe power to choose Senators from the State legislatures to popular \nelections.\n\n\n                            Benjamin Shively\n\n  In Indiana, Senator Benjamin Shively's election was at the heart of \nthe debate over the amendment. In 1908 as Democrat State legislators \nmet to choose their nominee, Shively was matched against John W. Kern. \nKern was the favorite among the people of Indiana, but Shively \nprevailed by two votes in a secret ballot. Since the Democrats \ncontrolled the State legislature, Shively was elected Senator.\n  Given the closeness of the balloting, State legislators were asked by \nreporters and constituents to reveal their votes. When informal tallies \nof the legislators' announced votes had Kern winning by as many as \neight votes, it was clear that many State legislators were lying about \nhow they had voted. This fueled public cynicism in Indiana with the \nmethod of electing Senators and helped build support in the State for \nratification of the 17th amendment.\n  In 1914, after the amendment had been ratified, Shively demonstrated \nthat he did have popular support. He became the first Indiana Senator \nto be elected by popular vote, a distinction of which he was enormously \nproud. Shively also became chairman of the important Pensions \nCommittee. Unfortunately, he did not survive his second term, dying in \n1916 after serving only a year.\n\n\n                               John Kern\n\n  Shively's rival in 1908, John Kern, went on to place his own \nextraordinary mark on the Senate. He defeated Albert Beveridge in the \n1910 Senate election, the last Senate race held before ratification of \nthe 17th amendment. But it was the 1912 election that brought Kern to \nSenate prominence.\n  That election resulted in a sweeping victory for the Democratic \nParty. With Teddy Roosevelt's Bull Moose candidacy splitting \nRepublicans, Woodrow Wilson rolled to victory. Democrats strengthened \nan already huge majority in the House, and seized control of the Senate \nfor the first time in 18 years.\n  The majority party's prospects for enacting its legislative program \nrested, as they so often do, on the Senate. Democrats held just a 51 to \n44 seat majority. Up to that time Senate party caucuses had chosen \ntheir leader largely on the basis of seniority. In 1913, however, \nDemocrats broke with this practice in an effort to make the most of \ntheir legislative opportunities. They decided that their caucus leader \nshould be the Senator who would be the most effective legislative \nleader.\n  The man they chose by unanimous vote was John Kern, who had been \nelected to the Senate 2 years before in 1910. Thus a freshman, with \njust 2 years of Senate experience, was entrusted with shepherding one \nof the most ambitious legislative plans in American history through the \nSenate. Kern was no political neophyte. He was a respected politician \nwho had been the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee in 1908 on the \nticket with William Jennings Bryan.\n  Historians often regard Kern as the first modern majority leader, \nalthough he did not formally have that title. Kern established numerous \nprecedents during his 4 years as the head of the Democratic caucus. He \nconferred closely with the administration on its program, frequently \nvisiting Wilson at the White House to discuss strategy. He demanded \nparty unity and employed threats, compromises, and personal entreaties \nto achieve it. He established the post of Democratic whip to assist him \nin maintaining discipline. He also used the prerogative to grant \ncommittee assignments as an enforcement mechanism. In his 4 years as \ncaucus leader, Kern's energy and organization failed only once to \ndeliver Senate passage of a major Presidential legislative initiative. \nThis was Wilson's ship purchase bill, that was blocked by a 1915 \nfilibuster.\n  Despite Kern's power in the Senate and his close relationship with \nPresident Wilson, he was defeated by Republican Harry S. New in the \n1916 election. New garnered 51 percent of the vote to Kern's 49 \npercent. Wilson won his re-election bid but lost Indiana by an even \nnarrower margin to Charles Evans Hughes.\n\n\n                              James Watson\n\n  In 1929, another Hoosier was chosen to be majority leader. That year \nSenate Republicans elected, James Eli Watson, who served as majority \nleader during the 4 years of Herbert Hoover's Presidency. Watson began \nhis Senate career when he was elected to complete the unexpired term of \nSenator Benjamin Shively in 1916. He was reelected in 1920 and 1926.\n  Watson had been one of President Hoover's major rivals for the GOP \nPresidential nomination in 1928. As a result, they did not develop the \nclose working relationship that had existed between Wilson and Kern. As \nRepublican leader, Watson's primary tactic was to build majorities \nthrough careful compromises. Like Kern, Watson's status in the Senate \ndid not insulate him from electoral defeat back home. He\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\nlost his quest for a fourth Senate election victory when he was turned \nout of office by the national Democratic landslide of 1932.\n\n\n                             Sherman Minton\n\n  Like John Kern, Sherman Minton played a prominent role in the Senate, \ndespite serving only one term. Elected as a Democrat in 1934, Minton \nwas an ardent New Dealer and loyal Senate ally of President Franklin \nRoosevelt. In January 1937 Majority Leader Joseph T. Robinson named \nMinton to the new position of assistant Democratic whip. Minton, who \nwas an aggressive legislator, relished this responsibility. Two years \nlater, Minton was promoted to majority whip.\n  Minton had the bad luck of running for reelection in 1940. That year \nhis Republican opponent, Raymond Willis of Angola, IN, got a big boost \nfrom the presence of Hoosier favorite son Wendell Willkie at the top of \nthe ticket. Minton's support for the 1940 Selective Service Act and \nother defense preparations also cost him votes. Willis defeated Minton \nby a narrow 25,000-vote margin.\n  During his career in public service, Minton had the distinction of \nserving in all three branches of the Federal Government. After Minton's \nSenate defeat, Roosevelt brought him to the White House as an \nadministrative assistant to the President. Roosevelt used him primarily \nas his liaison with Congress.\n  In May 1941, however, Roosevelt appointed Minton to the Seventh \nCircuit U.S. Court of Appeals. He served there until President Harry \nTruman appointed him to the Supreme Court in 1949. Minton spent 7 years \non the High Court until illness forced his retirement in 1956. A number \nof former Senators have served on the Supreme Court during its history, \nincluding James Francis Byrnes and Hugo Black. Since Minton's \nappointment in 1949, however, no former Senator has been appointed to \nthe High Court.\n\n\n                               Modern Era\n\n  Since the end of World War II, seven individuals have been elected to \nthe Senate by the people of Indiana. Several of my colleagues served in \nCongress with William Jenner and Homer Capehart, two Republicans whose \ncareers significantly impacted my early political development in \nIndiana. And, of course, many of my colleagues had close and productive \nassociations with the three distinguished former Hoosier Senators who \noften visit with us: Birch Bayh, Vance Hartke, and Dan Quayle.\n  Hopefully, those of us who have served Indiana in the Senate during \nrecent years have upheld the tradition of achievement established by \nour Hoosier predecessors. It may be premature to make historical \njudgments on the most recent seven Hoosier Senators, and I will resist \nthe temptation to do so.\n  Our Nation and our world have changed profoundly since James Noble \nand Waller Taylor came to the Senate in 1816. Noble's horseback \njourneys to Washington, DC, are said to have taken him about 17 days. \nToday we can travel to Indiana in less than 2 hours. Indiana's \npopulation has grown from about 150,000 in 1820 to almost 6 million \npeople today.\n  As our world has become more complex, so has our job here in the \nSenate. We have more constituents, more Members, more issues, more \nbills, more staff, and more floor votes than our early predecessors \ncould likely have imagined. The 7 most recent Hoosier Senators have \ncast more floor votes than the previous 36 Hoosier Senators combined. \nThe second session of the 14th Congress--the 1st in which Indiana was \nrepresented --lasted just 92 days. Today the Senate is in session \nalmost year round.\n  But even as this body has grown and developed, the fundamentals of \nbeing a good legislator have always remained the same. Down through \nhistory, this has been an institution that has depended on honesty, \ncivility, hard work, thoughtfulness, an understanding of the people we \nrepresent, and a willingness to stand on conviction. When these \nelements have been present, the Senate has succeeded.\n  Mr. President, I would encourage each of my colleagues, if they have \nnot done so, to explore the service of their Senatorial ancestors from \ntheir own States. Inevitably they will find both triumphs and \ntragedies; heroic acts and embarrassing mistakes. But as I have \nsurveyed the unbroken line that stretches from Waller Taylor and James \nNoble to Senator Dan Coats and myself, I have gained an even stronger \nappreciation of the character of my State and the performance of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo tables relating to Indiana Senators.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Indiana Senators: Dates of Service\n\n       James Noble--Dec. 11, 1816-Feb. 26, 1831.\n       Waller Taylor--Dec. 11, 1816-Mar. 3, 1825.\n       William Hendricks--Mar. 4, 1825-Mar. 3, 1837.\n       Robert Hanna--Aug. 19, 1831-Jan. 3, 1832.\n       John Tipton--Jan. 4, 1832-Mar. 3, 1839.\n       Oliver Smith--Mar. 4, 1837-Mar. 3, 1843.\n       Albert White--Mar. 4, 1839-Mar. 3, 1845.\n       Edward Hannegan--Mar. 4, 1843-Mar. 3, 1849.\n       Jesse Bright--Mar. 4, 1845-Feb. 5, 1862.\n       James Whitcomb--Mar. 4, 1849-Oct. 4, 1852.\n       Charles Cathcart--Nov. 23, 1852-Jan. 11, 1853.\n       John Pettit--Jan. 11, 1853-Mar. 3, 1855.\n       Graham Fitch--Feb. 4, 1857-Mar. 3, 1861.\n       Henry Lane--Mar. 4, 1861-Mar. 3, 1867.\n       Joseph Wright--Feb. 24, 1862-Jan. 14, 1863.\n       David Turpie--Jan. 14, 1863-Mar. 3, 1863.\n       Thomas Hendricks--Mar. 4, 1863-Mar. 3, 1869.\n       Oliver Morton--Mar. 4, 1867-Nov. 1, 1877.\n       Daniel Pratt--Mar. 4, 1869-Mar. 3, 1875.\n       Joseph McDonald--Mar. 4, 1875-Mar. 3, 1881.\n       Daniel Voorhees--Nov. 6, 1877-Mar. 3, 1897.\n       Benjamin Harrison--Mar. 4, 1881-Mar. 3, 1887.\n       David Turpie--Mar. 4, 1887-Mar. 3, 1899.\n       Charles Fairbanks--Mar. 4, 1897-Mar. 3, 1905.\n       Albert Beveridge--Mar. 4, 1899-Mar. 3, 1911.\n       James Hemenway--Mar. 4, 1905-Mar. 3, 1909.\n       Benjamin Shively--Mar. 4, 1909-Mar. 14, 1916.\n       John Kern--Mar. 4, 1911-Mar. 3, 1917.\n       Thomas Taggart--Mar. 20, 1916-Nov. 7, 1916.\n       James Watson--Nov. 8, 1916-Mar. 3, 1933.\n       Harry New--Mar. 4, 1917-Mar. 3, 1923.\n       Samuel Ralston--Mar. 4, 1923-Oct. 14, 1925.\n       Arthur Robinson--Oct. 20, 1925-Jan. 2, 1935.\n       Fredrick Van Nuys--Mar. 4, 1933-Jan. 25, 1944.\n       Sherman Minton--Jan. 3, 1935-Jan. 2, 1941.\n       Raymond Willis--Jan. 3, 1941-Jan. 2, 1947.\n       Samuel Jackson--Jan. 28, 1944-Nov. 13, 1944.\n       William Jenner--Nov. 14, 1944-Jan. 2, 1945.\n       Homer Capehart--Jan. 3, 1945-Jan. 2, 1963.\n       William Jenner--Jan. 3, 1947-Jan. 2, 1959.\n       Vance Hartke--Jan. 3, 1959-Jan. 2, 1977.\n       Birch Bayh--Jan. 3, 1963-Jan. 2, 1981.\n       Richard Lugar--Jan. 3, 1977-\n       Dan Quayle--Jan. 3, 1981-Jan. 2, 1989.\n       Daniel Coats--Jan. 3, 1989-\n       Indiana Senators: Length of Service\n       1.

Mr. President, Henry Clay, one of the most eloquent men to \nserve in the U.S. Senate, once said, ``Of all the properties which \nbelong to honorable men, not one is so highly prized as character.''\n  I know I speak for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in saying \nthat Senator Richard Lugar is truly a man of character. And I join \ntoday in saluting Senator Lugar as he becomes the longest serving \nSenator in Indiana history.\n  Today marks Senator Lugar's 7,059th day in this Chamber. They have \nbeen days spent making a difference in nearly every issue that has come \nbefore this body, including agriculture, trade, the budget, foreign \npolicy, and nuclear security.\n  As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar played \na key role in bringing freedom to the Philippines. And as chairman of \nthe Agriculture Committee, he produced legislation which will bring \nfreedom to America's farmers.\n  Dick Lugar's service to his State and his country are not limited to \nthe time he has served in the Senate.\n  It was Naval Officer Lugar who prepared intelligence briefings for \nthe Chief of Naval Operations and President Eisenhower.\n  It was Mayor Lugar who led the city of Indianapolis for 8 years, \nearning a reputation as one of the Nation's most innovative and \nsuccessful mayors.\n  And it is husband and father Dick Lugar who stands as a role model \nfor countless young Americans.\n  Mr. President, over the last few years, Senator Lugar has asked \nsummer interns in his Washington office to research an Indiana Senator \nof their choice.\n  I am confident that in decades yet to come, when young Indiana \nstudents research those who have served their State, they will conclude \nthat not only did Richard Lugar set a standard in terms of longevity, \nhe also set a standard in terms of integrity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4455-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING SENATOR RICHARD LUGAR\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Richard Lugar, on his remarkable achievement and \nextraordinary service to the people of Indiana. He has had the \nprivilege of representing Hoosiers in the U.S. Senate longer than any \nother Senator in Indiana history. His tenure has been distinguished and \nwell deserved.\n  In Indiana, we are proud of Dick Lugar and his leadership. Both in \nthe Senate and on the campaign trail, he has consistently raised issues \nour Nation cannot afford to ignore. His thoughtful and skillful \napproach to policy has made our Nation safer and America's influence in \nthe world more secure.\n  We are proud of his long record of accomplishments: fighting for \nfreedom in the Philippines, enhancing the world's nuclear security, \nworking for American farmers.\n  But Dick Lugar brings more to the Senate than his skills as a \nlegislator. His politics are informed by character. Dick Lugar \nunderstands that values count and that principle is worth defending. He \nrepresents the bet of Hoosier values--honesty, integrity, \ndetermination.\n  On behalf of the people of Indiana, I thank Richard Lugar for his \nservice to our State and to our Nation. It is my privilege to serve \nwith them in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4455-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I thank the \nranking member, Senator Kennedy. I think we are in a position, now, to \nperhaps conclude this measure, at least on the so-called Simpson \namendment, today.\n  We had some 156 amendments proposed a day ago. We are down to about \n30 today. Some are known in the trade as place holders--pot holders or \nwhatever might be appropriate, some of them. Nevertheless we will \nproceed today. The debate will take its most important turn, and that \nis the issue of verification; that is the issue of the birth \ncertificate and the driver's license, changes that were made yesterday \nand adopted unanimously by voice vote in this Chamber. We will deal \nwith that issue.\n  But one thing has to be clearly said because I am absolutely startled \nat some of the misinformation that one hears in the well from the \nproponents and opponents of various aspects of immigration reform. It \nwas said yesterday, by a colleague unnamed because I have the greatest \nrespect for this person, that tomorrow to be prepared to be sure that \nwe do not put any burden on employers by making employers ask an \nemployee for documents.\n  That has been on the books since 1986. I could not believe my ears. \nSomeone else was listening to it with great attention. I hope we at \nleast are beyond that point. Today the American employer has to ask \ntheir employee, the person seeking a job, new hire, for documentation. \nThere are 29 documents to establish either worker authorization or \nidentification. And then, also, an I-9 form which has been required \nsince that date, too. In other words, yes, you do have to furnish a \ndocument to an employer, a one-page form indicating that you are a \ncitizen of the United States of America or authorized to work. That has \nbeen on the books, now, for nearly 10 years. If we cannot get any \nfurther in the debate than that, then someone is seriously distorting a \nnational issue. Not only that, but someone is feeding them enough to \nsee that it remains distorted.\n  So when we are going to hear the argument the employer should not be \nthe watchdog of the world, what this bill does is take the heat off of \nthe employer. Instead of digging around through 29 documents they are \ngoing to have to look at 6. If the pilot program works, and we find it \nis doing well, and is authentic and accurate, then the I-9 form is not \ngoing to be required. That is part of this.\n  Then yesterday you took the real burden off of the employer, and I \nthink it was a very apt move. We said, now, that if the employers are \nin good faith\n\n[[Page S4456]]\n\nin asking for documents and so on, and have no intention to \ndiscriminate, that they are not going to be heavily fined, or receive \nother penalties. That was a great advantage to the employer.\n\n  So I hope the staffs, if there are any watching this procedure, do \nnot simply load the cannon for their principal, as we are called by our \nstaff--and other things we are called by our staff--principals, that \nthey load the cannon not to come over here and tell us what is going to \nhappen to employers having to ask for identity, having to prove the \nperson in front of them is a citizen or authorized to work, unless you \nwant to get rid of employer sanctions and get rid of the I-9. Those \nthings have been on the books for almost 10 years.\n  With that, I hope that is a starting point we take judicial notice \nthereof.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my friend and colleague has stated \nabsolutely accurately what the current state of the law is. For those \nwho have questions about it, all they have to do is look at the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, section 274, that spells out the \nrequirements of employment in the United States. I will not take the \ntime to go through that at this particular moment, but for those who \ndoubt or question any of the points the Senator has made, it is spelled \nout very clearly in section 274(a).\n  That is why we have the I-9 list, which is the list, A, B, and C. \nThis is the part of the problem which we hope will be remedied with the \nSimpson proposal, and that is there will be just the six cards. You \nhave list A, you can show one of these items, because under the law you \nhave to have identity and employment eligibility. You can have one of \nthe 10 items on A. Or you can have an item listed on B and an item \nlisted on C, in order to conform with the current law. As has been \npointed out both in the hearings as well as in the consideration and \nthe presentation of this legislation, and the consideration of the \nJudiciary Committee, the result is that there is so much mischief that \nis created with the reproduction and counterfeit of these particular \ncards that they have become almost meaningless as a standard by which \nan employer is able to make a judgment as to the legitimacy of the \napplicant in order to ensure that Americans are going to get the jobs. \nAlso it makes complex the problems of discrimination, which we talked \nabout yesterday.\n  It is to address this issue that other provisions in the Simpson \nproposal--the six cards have been developed as have other procedures \nwhich have been outlined. But if there is any question in the minds of \nany of our colleagues, there is the requirement at the present time, \nspecified in law, to show various documents as a condition of \nemployment. That exists, as the Senator said, today. And any \nrepresentation that we are somehow, or this bill somehow is altering \nthat or changing that or doing anything else but improving that process \nin the system is really a distortion of what is in the bill and a \ndistortion of what is intended by the proposal before the Senate. So I \nwill welcome the opportunity to join with my colleague on this issue.\n\n  It has been mentioned, as we are awaiting our friend and colleague \nfrom Vermont, who is going to present an amendment, that what we have \nnow is really the first important and significant effort to try to deal \nwith these breeder documents, moving through the birth certificate, \nhopefully on tamper-proof paper. Hopefully that will begin a long \nprocess of helping and assisting develop a system that will move us as \nmuch as we possibly can toward a counterfeit-free system, not only in \nterms of the cards but also in terms of the information that is going \nto be put on those cards.\n  We hear many of our colleagues talk about: Let us just get the cards \nout there. But unless you are going to be serious about looking at the \nbackup, you are not really going to be serious about developing a \nsystem. That is what this legislation does. It goes back to the roots, \nto try to develop the authoritative and definitive birth certificate \nand to ensure the paper and other possible opportunities for \ncounterfeiting will be effectively eliminated, or reduced dramatically. \nThen the development of these tamperproof cards; then the other \nprovisions which are included in here, and that is the pilot programs \nto try to find out how we can move toward greater truth in verification \nthat the person who is presenting it is really the person it has been \nissued to, and other matters. But that is really the heart of this \nprogram.\n  Frankly, if we cut away at any of those, then I think we seriously \nundermine an important opportunity to make meaningful progress on the \nwhole issue of limiting the illegal immigration flow. As we all know, \nthe magnet is jobs. As long as that magnet is out there, there is going \nto be a very substantial flow, in spite of what I think are the beefed-\nup efforts of the border patrol and other steps which have been taken.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin has asked for time in morning business. I will yield for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, just briefly, before we go back on to \nthe important business at hand, the immigration bill, I just want to \ncall to the attention of the body an article today in the Washington \nPost entitled ``Campaign Finance Proposal Drawing Opposition From \nDiverse Group.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 1, 1996]\n\n    Campaign Finance Proposal Drawing Opposition From Diverse Group\n\n                            (By Ruth Marcus)\n\n       An unusual alliance of unions, businesses, and liberal and \n     conservative groups is trying to defeat campaign finance \n     legislation that would abolish political action committees \n     and impose other restrictions on election spending.\n       The informal coalition, which met for the second time \n     yesterday, includes groups that usually find themselves on \n     opposite sides of legislative and ideological battles: unions \n     including the AFL-CIO, National Education Association and \n     National Association of Letter Carriers, and the National \n     Association of Business Political Action Committees (NABPAC), \n     which represents 120 business and trade association PACs.\n       Also among the 30 organizations at the meeting were \n     conservative groups such as the Cato Institute, Conservative \n     Caucus and Americans for Tax Reform; liberal groups such as \n     EMILY's List, the women's political action committee; and \n     others, including U.S. Term Limits, the National Women's \n     Political Caucus, the National Association of Broadcasters \n     and the American Dental Association.\n       Yesterday's meeting, at AFL-CIO headquarters here, was \n     organized by Curtis Gans of the Committee for the Study of \n     the American Electorate, a nonpartisan organization that \n     studies voter turnout. Gans opposes the campaign finance \n     proposal pending in Congress.\n       ``The unifying principle is essentially that the approaches \n     that have been pushed by Common Cause and Public Citizen are \n     wrong . . . and their answers to the problems are wrong,'' \n     Gans said, referring to two of the leading groups pushing the \n     campaign finance legislation.\n       He said the groups that met yesterday were ``unanimous'' \n     about the need to do ``public education'' activities to \n     counter a debate that Gans said ``has essentially been \n     dominated by the Common Cause position.'' But the diverse \n     assemblage was unable even to agree to Gans's draft joint \n     statement about the issue.\n       Common Cause president Ann McBride said the meeting showed \n     ``labor and business . . . coming together and agreeing on \n     the one thing that they can agree on, which is maintaining \n     the status quo and their ability to use money to buy outcomes \n     on Capitol Hill.''\n       The meeting reflects a stepped-up effort by foes of the \n     proposal. NABPAC has launched a print and radio advertising \n     campaign here and in districts of members who support the \n     bill. The ads target individual lawmakers by name.\n       ``Legislation sponsored by Rep. David Minge . . . will make \n     it harder for average\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\n     Americans to contribute to campaigns and to run for office,'' \n     said a newspaper ad that ran in the Minnesota Democrat's \n     district. ``The next time you see Rep. David Minge ask him \n     this simple question: Why do you want more millionaires in \n     Congress?''\n       NABPAC also is encouraging its members to cut off \n     contributions to lawmakers who support the bill, and last \n     month sent a memorandum to members of Congress enclosing \n     copies of its ads. ``The plans are to aggressively market \n     this in other appropriate areas of the country,'' NABPAC \n     executive vice president Steven F. Stockmeyer said in the \n     memo.\n       Three sponsors of the campaign finance bill in the House, \n     Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.) \n     and Linda A. Smith (R-Wash.), fired back at NABPAC in a \n     letter to its members last week, calling the memorandum a \n     ``thinly veiled threat to keep members from co-sponsoring'' \n     the legislation.\n       ``[I]ntimidating members into staying off of the bill by \n     either subtly or blatantly threatening to withhold campaign \n     contributions is disgraceful and justifies why our \n     legislation is needed,'' they wrote. ``Frankly, these efforts \n     simply inspire us further to try to end the system of \n     checkbook lobbying in Washington.''\n       But Shays said yesterday that ``some members are [scared] \n     because they don't want to be the enemy of these groups.'' A \n     Common Cause study released last week found that NABPAC \n     members gave $106 million to current members of Congress from \n     1985 to 1995.\n       In addition to abolishing PACs, the campaign finance bill, \n     sponsored in the Senate by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), \n     Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) and Fred D. Thompson (R-Tenn.), \n     would set voluntary state-by-state spending limits and, for \n     those who agree to the limits, require television stations to \n     offer 30 minutes of free time in evening hours and cut rates \n     for other advertising before primary and general elections.\n       Critics contend that abolishing PACs would diminish the \n     ability of average citizens to join together to have their \n     voices head and would increase the influence of wealthy \n     citizens.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, what this article is about is a reaction \nto the effort that Senator McCain and I and others have been preparing \nto try to change our Nation's campaign financing system. There are \nthose who have indicated that the effort will go nowhere because it is \nalready too late in the 104th Congress, and that it is just going to go \nthe way of all other campaign finance reform efforts in the past.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, this article gives me heart. It is eloquent \ntestimony to the reason why we have got to have campaign finance reform \nin this country and why we need it now. What happened yesterday was, \naccording to the article, an unusual alliance of unions, businesses, \nand liberal-conservative groups trying to defeat campaign finance \nlegislation that would abolish political action committees and other \nrestrictions on election spending, got together, all together, to try \nto kill the McCain-Feingold bill. It included groups such as the AFL-\nCIO, the NEA, National Association of Letter Carriers, the National \nAssociation of Business Political Action Committees, Cato Institute, \nConservative Caucus, Americans for Tax Reform, EMILY's List--you name \nit--National Association of Broadcasters, the American Dental \nAssociation. This was a gathering of all the special interests in \nWashington, even before we have had the bill come up, saying, ``Let's \nkill it before it has a chance to live.''\n  The reason it gives me heart, Mr. President, really, there are two \nreasons. First of all, if this bill is not going anywhere, what are \nthey worried about? Why are they coming together, as they so \ninfrequently do, to kill a piece of legislation that is the first \nbipartisan effort in 10 years in this body to try to do something about \nthe outrageous amount of money that is spent on campaigns and the \noutrageous influence that this community, Washington, has on the entire \npolitical process in this country?\n  I recall when I ran for the U.S. Senate, I might talk to somebody \nfrom the labor community or to an independent banker, and they would \nsay, ``Gee, we think you are a pretty good candidate, but first I have \nto check with Washington to see if I can support you.'' That is how the \ncurrent system works. You have to check in with Washington first. I \nthink that gives way too much power to this town and way too much power \nto these special interests that want to kill campaign finance reform in \nthis Congress.\n  It gives me heart that there is concern. It also gives me heart that \nthey are drawing attention to the fact. In fact, this article is \neloquent testimony to what is really going on in this country. There is \ntoo much money in this town; there is too much money in these \nelections. What they are trying to do, Ann McBride of Common Cause \npointed out, is to preserve the status quo, the meeting of labor and \nbusiness coming together and agreeing on the one thing they can agree \non, which is maintaining the status quo and their ability to use money \nto buy outcomes on Capitol Hill.\n  What our bipartisan effort is about is returning the power back to \nthe people in their own home States, to let them have more influence \nover elections than the special interests that run this town. We will \njoin this issue on the floor, and we will fight these special interests \nhead on, regardless of their new coalitions.\n  Mr. President, I simply indicate we are prepared, as I did a couple \nof days ago along with other Senators, we are prepared to offer this as \nan amendment to a bill in the near future, or if the leadership sees it \nthis way, to bring this up as separate legislation. The time is drawing \nnear for campaign finance reform.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4456-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4457-S4509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IMMIGRATION CONTROL AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3780 to Amendment No. 3743\n\n    (Purpose: To provide minimum safeguards in expedited exclusion \nprocedure to prevent returning bona fide refugees to their persecutors)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nmyself, the distinguished Presiding Officer, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], and the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry].\n  I offer this amendment to the provisions in the bill that I believe \ngut our asylum law. This is not just my opinion but is the opinion of \nat editorial boards from newspapers that normally do not agree with \neach other.\n  Let me first refer to the editorial in The Washington Times \nyesterday. It says:\n\n       In their rush to pass an anti-terrorism bill, lawmakers \n     perhaps unwillingly and unnecessarily restricted the present \n     rights of persons seeking asylum in this country to escape \n     political or religious persecution in their own countries. \n     Such persons used to get a hearing before an immigration \n     judge. Now they can be sent home without a hearing or \n     judicial review. Lawmakers should restore procedural \n     protections for asylum-seekers.\n\n  Then the Washington Post, in another editorial today, speaks of the \nantiterrorism law being revisited and says, again, that this amendment \nshould be supported.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record those two \neditorials.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 30, 1996]\n\n                  Immigrants And Other Ordinary People\n\n       The story goes that Texas Sen. Phil Gramm was attending a \n     National Republican Senatorial Committee meeting with \n     political supporters a few years ago when a woman rose and \n     asked an awkward question. ``Sen. Gramm,'' she said, ``why do \n     all the people here talk funny?'' As it happened, about 80 \n     percent of those supporters were first-generation Americans--\n     immigrants--and Mr. Gramm says you could hear the collective \n     gulp from the room about 100 miles away. His answer? ``Ma'am, \n     'cause this is America.''\n       He elaborated on that answer in memorable remarks to the \n     Senate last week. ``If we ever get to the point where we do \n     not have a few citizens who talk funny, if we ever get to the \n     point where we do not have a new infusion of energy and a new \n     spark to the American dream, then the American dream is going \n     to start to die. It is not going to fade, and it is not going \n     to die on my watch in the U.S. Senate.''\n       No doubt in part because of his emotional speech, the \n     Senate last week defeated legislation that would have \n     effectively limited immigration. But the chamber is not done \n     with this issue. If you want to see just how far some \n     lawmakers would go to restrict people who, as Mr. Gramm puts \n     it, talk funny, then consider some of the immigration \n     legislation up for a vote as early as this week.\n       Perhaps the most controversial issue involves so-called \n     demonstration projects intended to test the use of \n     verification systems for workers in this country. The idea is \n     that if the government could just figure out how to keep \n     illegal immigrants from working then fewer would come here in \n     the first place. Presto, no more illegal immigration.\n       This editorial page has said from the beginning of this \n     debate that it sees nothing wrong with a person's coming here \n     to work. As the quotable Mr. Gramm put the matter the other \n     day, ``We have room in America for people who come with their \n     sleeves rolled up, ready to go to work. But we do not have \n     room for people who come with their hand out.'' Exactly \n     right.\n       Laying the groundwork for a national identification system, \n     as the demonstration projects do, sets a terrible precedent. \n     What has this country come to that it would require aspiring \n     workers to get permission from the government before they can \n     roll up their sleeves and get to work? Work is not an \n     entitlement to be disbursed by the politically powerful for \n     the benefit of the politically favored. Nor is it something \n     to be trusted to some distant federal worker.\n       Even if one assumes the government can manage a national ID \n     system, how is it going to match the ID with the worker? With \n     fingerprints? With blood and tissue samples?\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\n     That's the sort of treatment ordinarily reserved for \n     criminals, not mere workers.\n       There's one other thing to keep in mind when senators take \n     up immigration reform. In their rush to pass an anti-\n     terrorism bill, lawmakers perhaps unwittingly and \n     unnecessarily restricted the present rights of persons \n     seeking asylum in this country to escape political or \n     religious persecution in their own countries. Such persons \n     used to get a hearing before an immigration judge. Now they \n     can be sent home without a hearing or judicial review. \n     Lawmakers should restore procedural protections for asylum-\n     seekers.\n       There's room here for workers. There's room here for people \n     who genuinely need asylum. ``America is not a great and \n     powerful country because the most brilliant and talented \n     people in the world came to live here,'' said Mr. Gramm. \n     ``America is a great and powerful country because it was here \n     that ordinary people like you and me have had more \n     opportunity and more freedom than any other people who have \n     ever lived on the face of the Earth. And with that \n     opportunity and with that freedom, ordinary people like us \n     have been able to do extraordinary things.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 1, 1996]\n\n                      The Terrorism Law Revisited\n\n       Think back about 10 days to the celebratory pictures of the \n     president signing the terrorism bill. That measure, deeply \n     flawed by provisions restricting habeas corpus, allowing the \n     use of secret evidence at deportation proceedings and \n     providing for summary exclusion of asylum-seekers, was hailed \n     as a vital bulwark protecting Americans against international \n     terrorists. In the rush to pass that legislation by April 19, \n     the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, scant \n     attention was paid to Sen. Patrick Leahy, who pointed out \n     some of these flaws. But this week, when the Vermont Democrat \n     seeks to use the pending immigration bill to repeal one of \n     them, the administration is on his side.\n       Every year, thousands of individuals arrive in this country \n     seeking asylum from persecution. Until recently, this process \n     was subject to a lot of abuse. Claimants were admitted, given \n     a work permit and released with the understanding that they \n     would show up some time in the distant future (there were \n     terrible backlogs then) for a hearing. Most of them simply \n     disappeared into the general population and were never heard \n     from again. But the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     (INS) instituted reforms early in 1994--streamlining \n     procedures, withholding work permits and keeping many \n     claimants in custody until their hearings--which have reduced \n     the problem substantially. The system now in place works \n     well, and both the Justice Department and the INS say there \n     is no need for change.\n       But in the rush ``to combat terrorism'' Congress passed, \n     and the president signed, new restrictions that create a \n     presumption that anyone seeking asylum who enters with false \n     documents, or has traveled through other countries to get \n     here, does not have a valid claim. In these cases, the \n     claimant would have to make his case to an immigration \n     officer on site, without any guarantee that he can be \n     represented by a lawyer or even have an interpreter. If he \n     does not persuade this official, he can be returned to his \n     own country summarily without further hearing before an \n     immigration judge or review by the Board of Immigration \n     Appeals.\n       It is fair to suspect anyone who enters the country with a \n     false passport, or who has left a place of safety in Western \n     Europe, for example, to ask for asylum here. But suspicions \n     need to be proved. It should surprise no one that persecuted \n     people might not be able to apply for passports in their own \n     countries, or might have to use a false name to get out. And \n     a two-hour layover in Germany or France on a long flight to \n     freedom shouldn't disqualify an applicant for asylum. Sen. \n     Leahy's effort, which has the backing of the people charged \n     with enforcing the immigration laws, should be supported.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Now, we should be clear what the provisions of the bill do \nand what they and our amendment do not concern. These are not \nprovisions that cover alien terrorists. It is safe to say that there is \nnot a single Member of this body who wants to allow alien terrorists \ninto our midst. That is not a partisan issue; every single Member of \nthis body is against terrorists. We can accept that as a point of fact.\n  There are a number of other provisions in the antiterrorism law that \nthe President signed last week that cover the exclusion of those \naffiliated with foreign terrorist organizations. They forbid the grant \nof asylum to alien terrorists.\n  We are not seeking to defend alien smuggling or false documentation \nused for that purpose. That is already a crime. Senators DeWine, \nHatfield, Kerry, and I totally agree on that.\n  But we know that there are some circumstances and there are some \noppressive regimes in the world from which escape may well entail the \nuse of false papers. We want to make sure that we do not create \nbarriers to true refugees and those deserving asylum, and prevent them \nfrom making an application for asylum.\n  Let me give an example, using first a hypothetical and then go to \nsome real examples. You are in a country with an oppressive regime. You \nare in a country where you are being persecuted for your religious \nbeliefs or your political beliefs. In fact, you may even face death for \nyour religious beliefs or your belief in democracy. You know that the \narm of that government is out to get you. These are not cases of just \nparanoia; they may already have gone and killed members of your family \nfor similar beliefs. You look at the one great beacon of freedom: the \nUnited States of America. You figure, ``How do I get there?''\n  Now, you are facing the possibility of a death penalty for your \nreligious beliefs. Do you think you could walk down to the government \nthat is out to kill you for those religious beliefs and say, ``Could I \nplease have a passport? Here is my name and address. And, by the way, I \nwant to book passage, I want a visa and I want to go directly to the \nUnited States.''\n  We all know what would happen in a case like that. The realty of the \nsituation is that people in those circumstances are probably going to \nget a forged or a false passport. They are not going to go on a flight \nthat will go directly to the United States because that is something \nthe government may be watching. They are going to go to another \ncountry--maybe a neighboring country, maybe two or three countries--and \nthen make it to the United States.\n  Under the immigration law that is before us, once they got here, \nbecause they used false passports and went through other countries, \nthey are probably going to be summarily sent back. Summarily being sent \nback is in an equal amount of time to the summary execution or \nimprisonment that they face when they arrive back in their home \ncountry.\n  Now, let us be realistic. The Justice Department does not want these \nprovisions and has not requested them. They were not recommended by the \nJordan Commission. The Department has told us that they want a type of \nstandby authority in case of immigration emergency, similar to what I \nhave proposed in this amendment.\n  Think of some of the history of this country. Fidel Castro's daughter \ncame to this country and was granted asylum, for appropriate reasons, \nand, of course, with great political fanfare. But Fidel Castro's \ndaughter did not fly directly to the United States with a passport \nbearing her name. She took a false passport, she went to Spain, and \nthen came here. Under this new law, we would likely have said, ``Sorry, \nyou are out.''\n  The most recent and famous example of why we must not adopt the \nsummary exclusion provisions of this bill is, of course, the case of \nFauziya Kasinga and her flight from Togo to avoid female genital \nmutilation. We first talked about that case here in the Senate a couple \nof weeks ago.\n  There have been two extremely positive developments since then. \nFirst, the INS filed a brief with the Board of Immigration Appeals, \narguing--I believe for the first time--that the fear of female genital \nmutilation should present a sufficient cause to seek asylum in the \nUnited States.\n  I do not think there should have been any question about this. If \nthere is any doubt, we should amend this bill or law without hesitation \nto ensure that flight from such practices are covered by our asylum \npolicies, as the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] has already suggested.\n  Second, last Thursday, April 25, after more than a year in detention \nunder conditions that subjected her to unnecessary hardship, Ms. \nKasinga was finally released by INS to await determination by the Board \non her asylum application.\n  Her case was first reported on the front page of the April 15 New \nYork Times by Celia Dugger. Both she and her newspaper deserve a great \ndeal of credit for bringing this to our attention.\n  Ms. Kasinga has sought for 2 years to find sanctuary in this country, \nonly to be detained, tear-gassed, beaten, isolated and abused.\n  Well, now we all realize how bad this is. It is something that should \noutrage men and women alike. I believe it does\n\n[[Page S4460]]\n\noutrage men and women in this country.\n  Unfortunately, one thing has not changed yet, that is the provision I \nam seeking to amend in this bill. The provisions in the bill would \nstill summarily exclude Ms. Kasinga, and others like her, from ever \nmaking an asylum claim. She traveled through Germany on a false British \npassport in order to escape mutilation in Togo. Under the bill before \nus, she would be subjected to summary exclusion at the border without \njudicial review.\n  In fact, does anybody in this body believe that an immigration \nofficer at her point of entry would, as a matter of first impression, \nhave agreed with her claim that fear of female genital mutilation was a \nproper ground to seek asylum?\n  We should, instead, restore protections in our laws to protect her \nability to get a fair opportunity to be heard.\n  On April 19, Anthony Lewis wrote a column for the New York Times that \ncaptured the essence of this issue. In his column, he notes, ``The \nasylum provisions effectively impose the absurd presumption that anyone \nwho flees a country without proper papers is not a genuine refugee.'' \nAs Mr. Lewis puts it, ``Political asylum is one saving grace in a world \nof too much political brutality. Why should Americans want to undermine \nthe asylum concept?'' Indeed.\n  This is what has always distinguished the United States in our 200 \nyears of constitutional history--200 years as a Nation protecting \ndemocracy and individual freedoms and rights more than any other \ncountry in existence. No wonder people seek asylum in the United \nStates. No wonder people facing religious persecution, or political \npersecution, or physical persecution, look to the United States, \nknowing that we are the symbol of freedom. But that symbol would be \ntarnished if we were to close our doors.\n  Mr. President, in Mr. Lewis' column, he wrote: ``The Senate will in \nfact have another chance to consider the issue when it takes up the \nimmigration bill.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Lewis' column be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 19, 1996]\n\n                           Slamming the Door\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       Boston.--The case of 19-year-old Fauzlya Kasinga, who says \n     she fled her native Togo to avoid the rite of female genital \n     mutilation, has aroused much sympathy. She arrived at Newark \n     Airport in 1994, told officials she was using someone else's \n     passport, sought asylum, was turned down and has been held in \n     prison ever since. The Board of Immigration Appeals will hear \n     her appeal on May 2.\n       But in future we are not likely to know about desperate \n     people like Ms. Kasinga. If their pleas for asylum are turned \n     down by a low-level U.S. immigration officer, they will not \n     be allowed to appeal--and review by the courts will be \n     barred. They will be sent back at once to the land where they \n     face persecution.\n       This extraordinary change in our law is part of the \n     counter-terrorism bill awaiting President Clinton's \n     signature. It is not directed at terrorists. It applies to \n     anyone seeking asylum who arrives here with false documents \n     or none--the situation of many people fleeing persecution.\n       The issue raised in Fauzlya Kasinga's case, female genital \n     mutilation, is an important one: Does that cruel practice \n     come within the grounds for asylum? But the new summary \n     process of exclusion will affect many more people seeking \n     asylum for traditional reasons: the man fleeing a Nigerian \n     Government that executed his political colleagues, for \n     example, or the Vietnamese who escaped from a re-education \n     camp.\n       The asylum provisions effectively impose the absurd \n     presumption that anyone who flees a country without proper \n     papers is not a genuine refugee. By that test Fidel Castro's \n     daughter was not a true refugee because she fled Cuba with a \n     false passport. Nor were Jews who fled the Nazis without \n     papers.\n       Political refugees are not the only losers. The bill \n     trashes the American tradition of courts as the arbiters of \n     law and guarantors of freedom. I have seen a good deal of \n     nastiness in the work of Congress over the years, but I do \n     not remember such detailed and gratuitous cruelty.\n       The bill gives virtually final authority to immigration \n     officers at 300 ports of entry to this country. Each is \n     directed to interview people seeking asylum and exclude them \n     if he finds that they do not have ``a credible fear of \n     persection.'' That phrase is unknown to international law.\n       The officer's summary decision is subject only to \n     ``Immediate review by a supervisory office at the port.'' The \n     bill prohibits further administrative review, and it says, \n     ``no court shall have jurisdiction'' to review summary \n     denials of asylum or to hear any challenge to the new \n     process. (Our present system for handling asylum applications \n     works efficiently, so there is no administrative need for \n     change.)\n       Stripping away the protection of the courts may be the most \n     alarming feature of the legislation. It is reminiscent of the \n     period after the Civil War, when a Congress bent on punishing \n     the South took away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to \n     consider cases that radical Republicans thought the Court \n     would decide against their desires.\n       Political asylum is one saving grace in a world of too much \n     political brutality. Why should Americans want to undermine \n     the asylum concept? And why should a bill supposedly aimed at \n     terrorists be used as a vehicle to keep the victims of \n     official terrorism from finding refuge?\n       Why should senators as decent as Orrin Hatch, chairman of \n     the Judiciary Committee, stand still for such harshness? The \n     asylum restrictions originated in the House and were kept in \n     the bill by conferees, so the Senate was presented with a \n     fait accompli. A motion by Senator Patrick Leahy to send the \n     terrorism bill back to conference on that issue failed, 61 to \n     38.\n       President Clinton has been so eager for an anti-terrorism \n     bill that he is not likely to veto this one, over the asylum \n     sections any more than over the gutting of habeas corpus. But \n     he could call on Congress to reconsider the attack on \n     political asylum.\n       The Senate will in fact have another chance to consider the \n     issue when it takes up the immigration bill, which has in it \n     a similar provision for summary exclusion of asylum-seekers. \n     On reflection, Senator Hatch and other's should see the \n     threat to victims of persecution and to our tradition of law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have an editorial by the New York Times, \nentitled, ``Not So Harsh on Refugees.'' I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 22, 1996]\n\n                        Not So Harsh on Refugees\n\n       The ordeal of a young woman from Togo who came to America \n     to avoid the practice of female genital mutilation should \n     give members of Congress pause before they approve any \n     further limitations on the rights of refugees seeking \n     sanctuary in the United States. As detailed last week by \n     Celia Dugger of The Times, Fauziya Kasinga was detained for \n     months before she obtained a hearing, and she was strip-\n     searched and held with convicted criminals. Shamefully, the \n     anti-terrorism bill just passed by Congress and immigration \n     bills still pending could subject many more refugees to \n     similar treatment.\n       Ms. Kasinga's case involves female genital mutilation, a \n     common practice in some two dozen African nations that \n     involves cutting off portions of a young woman's genitals, \n     often without anesthesia.\n       Ms. Kasinga fled Togo in 1994 to avoid mutilation after \n     losing her status as a member of a privileged family. Her \n     determination to avoid the practice could have subjected her \n     to harsh treatment had she stayed, or if she is forced to \n     return home. She may have a reasonable claim for asylum on \n     the basis of membership in a social group vulnerable to \n     persecution in her homeland.\n       But when Ms. Kasinga landed at Newark Airport in December \n     1994, seeking asylum with a phony passport, she was \n     immediately detained. Under the law, people who have credible \n     claims for asylum and family members already living in the \n     United States can be released, pending a hearing. Ms. Kasinga \n     has a cousin in the Washington area, but she was kept in \n     custody anyway. After being held for months at a New Jersey \n     detention center, Ms. Kasinga was transferred to a \n     Pennsylvania prison and housed with convicted criminals.\n       Ms. Kasinga fared no better in court, where an immigration \n     judge denied her claim. The Board of Immigration Appeals will \n     hear her case in May.\n       If some members of Congress had their way, Ms. Kasinga \n     would have been returned to Togo long ago. Under an \n     immigration bill passed by the House, but now held up in the \n     Senate, anyone attempting to enter the country without proper \n     documents would only be entitled to a one-hour interview with \n     an asylum officer. Denial of an asylum claim would be subject \n     to review by a supervisor, but not by any other \n     administrative or judicial body. These provisions, similar to \n     ones in the anti-terrorism bill, would deny a fair hearing to \n     many asylum seekers.\n       The House immigration bill also calls for detention of any \n     asylum seeker who is awaiting a hearing, even when a credible \n     claim has been presented. That could subject more would-be \n     refugees to the harsh treatment suffered by Ms. Kasinga.\n       Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont plans to offer an \n     amendment that would not only override the harsh exclusion \n     provisions in the immigration bill but also supersede the \n     same provisions in the anti-terrorism bill. Congress should \n     follow his lead.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is hard to think of a time when you find the New York \nTimes, the Washington Post, and the Washington Times all agreeing on an\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\nissue. But this is, as I said before, not an issue of political \nideology, it is an issue of simple justice. It is an issue that reflect \nwhat is best in this country, what is the best in us as Americans.\n  In fact, it would be hard to think of a better example of how \nunworkable this provision is--the one in the bill that we seek to \ncorrect--than a woman who joined me at a press conference yesterday. \nTwo years ago, she fled Peru. She had been horribly treated and \nthreatened by rebel guerrillas there. She came to this country without \nproper documents. She was able to convince an immigration judge after \nan opportunity for a fair hearing that she would suffer persecution if \nshe returned home.\n  Yesterday, I asked her to tell about her experience. Less than two \nsentences into her story, as the memories of what she had put up with 2 \nyears ago played back, she broke down crying. Her case has been very \nwell-documented. She was able to establish a basis for asylum. But now, \n2 years later, the memories are so strong that, emotionally, she was \nunable to talk with us about it.\n  Can you imagine if the provisions in this bill had been the law and \nshe got to the border, and an INS officer said, ``Quick, tell me why \nyou should stay here. What is going on? Why should you stay here?'' \nThis woman, who was unable to talk about it 2 years later after having \nbeen granted asylum, what would she have done, how would she have \nestablished her case? The answer would have been, ``Well, obviously, \nyou are not establishing the necessary criteria. You did not come here \nwith a proper passport, so you are going back. Come back when you get a \nproper passport.'' What would she have gone back to?\n  Fortunately, instead of being sent back summarily to the hands of her \nabusers, she had a chance to be heard before a judge.\n  Mr. President, I am sure there are others who wish to speak. I will \nhave more to say about this.\n  Mr. President, I withhold my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, there is no one I enjoy and regard more \nhighly than my friend from Vermont. He and I have, fortunately, been on \nthe same side of more issues than ever on opposite sides. I find him a \nfast and true friend whom I enjoy very, very much. When he speaks, he \nspeaks with genuine clarity and authenticity about something in which \nhe deeply believes.\n  Let me be so very clear here. We are, as the Senator from Vermont \nsaid, not talking about an antiterrorism bill. There was an amendment \non the antiterrorism bill which passed the Senate by a vote of 61 to 38 \nwhich is, in many cases, quite similar to this measure. It had to do \nwith exclusion and summary proceedings. We are not speaking of that. \nWhat we are talking about is the bill itself, and Senator Leahy is \nintending to strike--we are not talking about female genital \nmutilation, we are not talking about terrorism; we are talking about \nthe immigration laws of the United States. The bill as it stands before \nyou has section 131, which is a new ground for exclusion of aliens, for \naliens using documents fraudulently. That would be stricken by the \nSenator's amendment. There is a section 132 which is a limitation on \nwithholding of deportation relief for aliens excludable for using \ndocuments fraudulently. There is a provision for summary exclusion. \nThat would substitute a similar procedure for only situations which \nwould be described as an extraordinary migration situation and not for \nother circumstances of the bill.\n  So, I speak against the amendment for these reasons. The committee's \nbill provision, which is in the version we are addressing now on the \nnew ground of exclusion relating to document fraud, on summary \nexclusion, and on asylum applications, three things there--new ground, \nsummary exclusion, and asylum application by those who have attempted \nto enter the U.S. with fraudulent documents--will greatly reduce the \nability of aliens to unlawfully enter this country and then remain here \nfor years through use, or misuse, of various administrative and \njudicial proceedings and appeals. It is almost what we would refer to \nas an overuse of due process.\n  These people in the past--this is what we are trying to correct--\noften receive more due process than a U.S. citizen receives. For \nexample, the provisions relating to asylum and withholding of \ndeportation will help the United States deal promptly and fairly with a \nvery common scenario. Here is the scenario. For every example that \ntouches our hearts--and this floor is filled with stories that touch \nour hearts; we will hear many of them today--for each one I get to tell \nanother one. Here is a story that will not touch your heart.\n\n  A young person with no obligation to family, or anything else, who \nhas decided to take off from his country to seek the promised land, and \nthat is us--here is the common scenario used by those who would abuse \nthe compassion of the American people. This is why the American people \nsuffer compassion fatique. This is what gives rise to proposition \n187's. This is what gives rise to the continual polls saying 70 to 80 \npercent of these people should be excluded and so on--not excluded, but \nindeed that we should do something with both illegal and legal \nimmigration.\n  The scenario is this: The young person with no family, no spouse over \nthere in the country they are leaving, no children, no parents perhaps, \nmaybe an orphan, whatever--they board the plane with documents. Then \nthey give them back to the smuggler on the plane who is with them, or \nelse flush them down the toilet of the aircraft. Some have eaten them. \nThen they come to the United States, and at the U.S. port of entry they \nclaim asylum.\n  Many of us saw this so dramatically in the ``60 Minutes'' \npresentation. We are going to talk about dramatic things, where the \nalien without the document said the magic words. The magic words in any \nlanguage, or their own, is, ``I want asylum. I want to claim asylum,'' \njust as the smuggler instructed him or her to say. You need to know \nonly one word when you are there, ``asylum.'' The program of ``60 \nMinutes'' ended with the alien going forward out of the door of JFK, \nsuitcase in hand with a rolling cart to disappear into America probably \nnever to be heard from again because he is certainly going to tear up \nany notice to appear at some future time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. If I could finish my remarks, I would--I yield for a \nquestion. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. One question: Is it not under the new procedures, when \nthey ask for asylum, would they not be held in detention until a \npreliminary determination has been made about false documents?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, much of this is being relieved by the \nsimple procedure of detention facilities. When those detention \nfacilities are available--and we have provided significantly more money \nfor detention facilities--we find that these things are going to be \nglimmering in more cases. But I wanted to cite it indeed.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize that the bill provides very \nclearly an opportunity for every single person, every single person \nwithout documents, or with fraudulent documents--please hear this--\nfraudulent documents or proper documents allow every person to seek \nasylum. A specially trained asylum officer will hear his or her case. \nThis is the key. I want my friend from Vermont to share with me in the \ndebate as we do this, which he will in fairness. A specially trained \nasylum officer will hear his or her case, and if the alien is found to \nhave a ``credible fear of persecution,'' he or she will be provided a \nfull--full--asylum hearing. However, if he or she does not have such a \ncredible claim, he or she will be subject to the summary exclusion \nprocedures as will all persons who enter without documents or with \nfraudulent documents.\n\n  There is discussion about persons not being permitted to apply for \nasylum if they do not travel directly from the country in which they \nallegedly have a fear of persecution. This is always a difficult \nsituation because we find people who will leave the country where they \nare being persecuted legitimately, or, if they are just simply using an \ninappropriate way to get here, they will go to one, or two, or three \nother countries all of which might be democracies, all of which would \nbe free countries, all of which would be giving the precious refuge of \na refugee or an aslyee. The only difference between a refugee and an \naslyee is a refugee is\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\nover in the home country and an aslyee is here. They are absolutely the \nsame. But the term is used ``aslyee'' when they are here, and \n``refugee'' when they are there.\n  So the United States cannot be expected to provide asylum. I am not \ntalking about asylum. I am talking about people who are fleeing \npersecution or have a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, \nreligion, national origin, or membership in a social or political \norganization. That is an aslyee. That is a refugee. That is the \ndefinition under the law of the United States of America and the United \nNations. We will always provide asylum.\n  There are some great asylee-receiving countries in the world. Two of \nthem have completely revised their asylum laws because of the absolute \ngimmickry that is taking place. One is my native land, my original \nnative land, Holland, the most open country in the world, a country \nthat gave solace and comfort to fleeing Jews 500 years ago and to those \nfleeing Nazi Germany. They have now changed their asylum laws the same \nas we are doing in order to avoid gimmickry. The other country is \nGermany. After the war, the horror of the war, and the imprint of the \nNazis upon the German people, who were appalled--I believe this because \nI lived among them for 2 years--appalled at the Nazi regime, real \nGermans are appalled by that.\n  They realized that, because of what they had done during the war, \nthey made the broadest, most extensive asylum laws in the world because \nthey had to; people were watching them after the war. And being the \nmost generous country, they have had now to simply shut down the \nprocess because of gimmickry.\n  So it is important to know that those who come from a safe country \nwhere they could have obtained asylum--normally someone who is fleeing, \nI mean fleeing in terror of their lives, with the dogs and the soldiers \nand the arms coming at them--they stop where it is safe to do so, not \nselect or choose leaving one or more safe countries in order to enter \nthe United States or another country for which he or she has a personal \npreference. And the ultimate personal preference is always the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. President, I do want to point out, however, that the Attorney \nGeneral will have the discretion to waive, under my proposal, under \nextraordinary circumstances this requirement of direct travel to the \nUnited States.\n  I wish to conclude by saying a few words about the summary exclusion \nprocedure in general. The present system is vulnerable to mass \nmigration and other extraordinary situations and to persons who exploit \nthe numerous levels of administrative and judicial review to stay in \nthis country for years even though they have surreptitiously entered or \nsought to enter this country or have presented themselves for \ninspection with fraudulent documents or no documents and such \nindividuals have no grounds for being in the United States of America \nexcept the possibility of asylum.\n  The bill's summary exclusion procedures provide a method for the \nAttorney General to significantly reduce this problem while still \ngiving aliens a reasonable opportunity to seek asylum or withholding of \ndeportation because of a fear of persecution for race, religion or one \nof the statutory or treaty grounds. And subject to the credible fear \nasylum procedure I have already described, an immigration officer can \norder an alien who has entered without documents or with fraudulent \ndocuments to be removed from the United States without bringing the \nalien before the immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals. \nOnly limited judicial review would be available. It would be limited to \na habeas corpus proceeding devoted to no more than three issues:\n  First, Whether the individual is an alien or if he or she claims to \nbe a U.S. citizen;\n  Second, Whether the individual was in fact specially excluded;\n  Third, Whether the individual has proven that he or she is a lawful \npermanent resident.\n\n  The court could order no relief other than the full exclusion \nhearings.\n  Finally, let me conclude, at least for this moment, and I hope we \nwill continue toward a result here. We are talking here of immigration, \nand certainly there has been a reference to female genital mutilation. \nThat is a very serious issue. I certainly concur totally as to the \nhorror of that, and who could not? Certainly any compassionate person \ncould not.\n  My colleague from Nevada, Senator Harry Reid, noted that Canada had \nmade female genital mutilation a ground of asylum 3 years ago and had \nonly two persons apply since that time. My information from the \nCanadian Embassy is a bit different, and I hope my colleagues will hear \nthis. All of us admit that this is a hideous, barbaric thing. I \nunderstand, first, that this mutilation is not by itself grounds for a \ngrant of asylum. This is our Canadian neighbors. But it is merely one \nof several factors to be considered in determining whether the \napplicant qualifies under the definition of a refugee.\n  Second--I think we must hear this--I understand that as victims of \nmutilation have come to Canada, they have brought their relatives along \nwith them, or the relatives at least followed later. In any case, the \nresult now has been that the practice of female genital mutilation has \nbecome a growing legal and criminal problem in Canada. It has now been \nimported into Canada, and one or more Provinces plan to make it a \ncriminal offense. Police currently have to prosecute it under the \nassault statute, I say to my friend from Vermont, who has been a \nprosecutor, as I have, on the lower levels.\n  In other words, we have a situation where Canada has found that the \nvictims end up being joined by the perpetrators. That fact suggests as \nwell that we may be dealing here with a cultural practice--and that is \nexactly what we are dealing with, ladies and gentlemen, a cultural \npractice--and perhaps not a practice of official government-sanctioned \npersecution. This is going to be a real debate in the coming times \nbecause we in this body talk continually about respect of other \ncultures--cultures of the native American in my State, cultures of \nother ethnic groups, cultures of Hispanic-Americans, cultures of \nAfrican-Americans.\n  The best practice is not to create some per se ground of asylum but \ndo just as we do in all asylum and refugee determinations, and that is \nconsider each one of them on a case-by-case basis. That is what we must \ndo.\n  So, again, we get into these situations by our remarkable strength \nand our remarkable weakness, which is our compassion, and then we get \nthe blend of emotion, fear, guilt, and racism and blend that in, and we \ndo erratic things in immigration reform, or we would not be doing what \nwe are doing in these last days. The reason this is so difficult, you \nwill be on one side or the other and you say: ``How can we do this? Why \ncan't we do this? How can this be? How did I vote this way? How can I \nget out of this thicket? ''\n\n  The reason is, you are going to stay right in it because this is \nabout America. It is about America, and America is a very complex \nplace, thank God. We still have one thing that binds us, or several--a \ncommon flag, a common language, and a public culture. When we break it \nall down into individual cultures, Balkanize these great States that \nwere fought so hard for in this Chamber to unite and to unite in the \ngreat melting pot, we do a disservice.\n  We are about to pass what many in this body will describe as a tough \nillegal immigration bill, and it will be, and it will pass, whatever \nform it is. Win or lose your amendments, forget it. It is an \naccomplishment that we will proudly reflect to our constituents. But \nremember this: We take in more asylees than all the rest of the \ncountries on Earth, total. We take in more refugees than all the rest \nof the countries on Earth, total. We take in more immigrants than all \nthe rest of the countries on Earth, total, period.\n  Finally--you have all heard that a thousand times--and it is very \nimportant to someone listening, wherever these words fall, this bill \nexplicitly provides that this special exclusion procedure does not \napply if the alien has a credible fear of persecution on one of the \nrequired grounds--race, religion, membership in national organization, \nand so on. Therefore, nearly the entire argument of the Senator from \nVermont, my friend, vests on the inadequacy of the procedure provided \nin the bill to determine whether an alien has a credible fear of \npersecution--that is\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\nthe intent of the Senator from Vermont, saying it is inadequate.\n  Let me read the standard that would be used by the specially trained \nasylum officers to determine whether an applicant for asylum has a \ncredible fear of persecution and therefore should receive a full--\nfull--asylum hearing and not be subject to the special exclusion. I \ncite the language in section 193 on page 173 of the bill, lines 6 \nthrough 14, saying:\n\n       As used in this section, the term ``credible fear of \n     persecution'' means that (A) there is a substantial \n     likelihood--\n\n  ``Substantial likelihood'' that is,\n\n     that the statements made by the alien in support of the \n     alien's claim are true, and (B) there is a significant \n     possibility in light of such statements and of country \n     conditions--\n\n  Which will be determined by the State Department,\n\n     that the alien could establish eligibility as a refugee \n     within the meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A).\n\n  That is what this bill provides. It is not some swift or harsh \nprovision. And this bill does not gut our asylum laws. The bill's \nprovisions bring some sense and effectiveness to our asylum laws. These \nare laws that have been effectively gimmicked over the years because \n400,000 backlogged asylum cases can well attest to that.\n  As my friend from Vermont says, if a person is fleeing for his life \nbecause of religious beliefs and must use forged papers and travel \nthrough several countries to get here under the bill that person will \nbe summarily sent back--it is not so. If such a person arrives under \nthe provisions of the bill he or she would get a hearing before a \nspecially trained asylum officer. And if he or she had a credible fear \nof persecution, and there was a substantial likelihood the facts are \ntrue, as I have just cited, he or she will be permitted to remain in \nthe United States and have a full asylum hearing when he or she is \nprepared and ready, with counsel.\n  So, I yield at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I just want to make sure my colleagues \nunderstand the Senator from Wyoming and I have a longstanding \nfriendship and affection and respect for each other, but we do look at \nthis somewhat differently.\n  To begin with, regarding the vote on the anti-terrorism bill, while \nthe issue may appear similar, the procedural situation was much \ndifferent. There my motion would have required a recommitting of the \nwhole conference report, a great burden to overcome.\n  As a matter of fact, I had a number of Senators come up to me and \nsay, ``Why do you not do this on the immigration bill? We will have a \nlot easier time voting for you on the immigration bill.'' Well, God \nbless you all, you will now have a chance to vote with me on the \nimmigration bill.\n  In addition, that motion did not include the creation of authority \nfor the Attorney General to declare a special migration situation of \nimmigration emergency. The amendment I offer today includes such \nprovisions.\n  Further, when we talk about the people coming in with false passports \nfleeing persecution, they do not get a hearing under the bill. They get \nan interview. They get an interview by whoever is there at the border, \nand they can get kicked out right then and there. It is cruel, it is \nfundamentally unfair to a traumatized and fatigued refugee, who would \nbe allowed no assistance and no interpreter, to treat them so \nsummarily.\n  The kind of screening process provided in the bill will mean an \ninvestment of enormous resources for a special screening that we do not \nneed. We would be requiring extra resources to do an ineffectual job.\n  In 1995, for example, after our asylum processes were reformed, we \nhad only 3,287 asylum seekers who arrived without valid documents. They \ncould be handled through the normal process. They do not have to be \nbounced out following some truncated and confusing interview. As we \nhave heard, these people have faced such traumatic experiences. They \nare not likely to be prepared to respond when hit with that first, all \nimportant interview.\n  We reformed, in 1994 and 1995, our asylum processes. The Justice \nDepartment can handle it very well under my amendment.\n  Do not confuse illegal immigrants with refugees.\n  This bill would establish summary exclusion procedures for refugees \nseeking to claim asylum. It would give low-level immigration officers \nunprecedented authority to deport refugees without allowing them a fair \nopportunity to establish valid claims. These provisions should not even \nbe in this bill, if it is intended to focus on the problems of illegal \nimmigration. Refugees who seek asylum in the United States are not \ncausing problems for America and Americans. They come to us for refuge. \nThey come to us for protection. They come to us for what America \npromises in constitutional freedoms and protections. We should not turn \nthem back, and turn our back on them or destroy our country's \nreputation for protecting human rights.\n  Look at the Washington Times editorial, look at the Washington Post \neditorial, look at the New York Times editorial. They express the \nfeelings of so many in this country.\n  Think about a person who talked before a press conference here on \nCapitol Hill yesterday, Alan Baban, who was held 16 months in \ndetention.\n  He is a Kurdish national who had been in prison for over a year in \nIraq. He was tortured, both because of his Kurdish nationality and his \npolitical involvement with an organization committed to securing \npolitical freedom for Kurds. His body has the scars of that ordeal. At \none point in his captivity he bribed a guard and he escaped. His \nfamily's possessions were seized by the Iraqis.\n  Finally, in November 1994, he and his mother, who had been hiding for \nclose to 3 years, used false documents to get out and arrived in the \nUnited States.\n  Most of us know what terrible treatment the Kurds have had at the \nhands of the Iraqis. But somehow the immigration inspector at the \nairport did not believe Alan and did not think that he had established \na credible claim of persecution. So Alan was placed in detention, in \nprison, in the United States. A year later, without a translator to \nhelp him, he was denied political asylum.\n  After 16 months in detention, when his true story came out, an \nimmigration judge finally granted him asylum. Yesterday, he thanked the \nUnited States for finally listening to him and letting him out.\n  This is one of a number of examples of refugees who were initially \nruled not to have satisfied a credible fear standard but who after a \nhearing were able to prove a claim for asylum.\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts is seeking time.\n  Before I yield the floor, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays \non my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I just might ask the distinguished manager, \nam I correct in my understanding, as we offer these various amendments \nthey will then be set aside for others so there will be a series of \nvotes? Is that correct?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, at least this amendment and the next \namendment of Senator Abraham and Senator Feingold will come up at a \ntime around the hour of 2 o'clock. We will stack votes on these two, or \nothers we might have problems on, including, perhaps, that of Senator \nBradley, who is here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just before that vote will we follow the \nusual thing where each side has a minute or so?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. We will put that in the unanimous-consent request, that \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a moment because the \nSenator from Vermont has made the presentation and made it exceedingly \nwell, which he did in our judiciary markup as well.\n  What I want to do is just take a moment of the Senate's time to \ndescribe the conditions that we were facing a number of years ago, and \nwhere we are on the issues of asylum today, because I think it reaches \nthe core of the Leahy amendment. There is no question that, as he \noutlined, there are people who come here with a well-founded fear of \npersecution. They come here, few of\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\nthem with papers, many of them without any papers, for the obvious \nreasons they are in terror and have been persecuted by the existing \nregime. That is an important group, but I will come back to the numbers \nin just a moment.\n  But there is no question that large numbers of people came here \nrequesting asylum for one reason: they wanted jobs. As Senator Simpson \nhas correctly stated, the process and procedure was that people would \ncome in and declare they wanted asylum. The first thing that happened \nwas they got a green card, went out and got lost in society. There was \nvery, very significant abuse of that whole process. But that has \nchanged dramatically in the last year.\n  By and large, we ought to be looking at what the current condition \nis, not what the conditions were 1 year ago, 2 years ago, 3 years ago \nwhen we had all the significant abuses in the asylum system. The \nprincipal abuses for the asylum system, as in the whole issue of \nillegal immigration, were jobs. People saw this as an opportunity to \ncome to the United States, say ``asylum,'' get that green card and then \ngo to work. Instead of running across the Rio Grande or trying to come \non in across another border, that was one of the ways that they came in \nhere.\n  That whole spigot, in terms of the jobs, has been closed down by the \nINS because they no longer provide the green card so that these people \ncan go out to work, and second, they are held in detention.\n  We have to ask ourselves whether we are going to be satisfied with a \ncounselor, as well trained as they are, making the final judgment about \na well-founded fear of persecution. I can remember it was not long ago \nwhen we had a number of Soviet Jews who came through Rome and were \nbeing evaluated as to whether they were real or refugees coming into \nthe United States. There were a series of counselors out there. All had \nbeen trained, all seeing these various refugees, refuseniks, people who \nhad been persecuted in the Soviet Union. At the end of the day, one \ngroup let in 60 percent and another group let in 20 percent. We had \nhearings on that. So you find diversity.\n  What we are talking about are the limited numbers which we are faced \nwith now. In 1994, we had 122,000 asylum claims and we completed \n60,000. In 1995, we had 126,000 claims and we completed 53,000. We have \nseen this dramatic change that has taken place with asylum claims--\ndramatic, dramatic change. Out of the 53,000, there are approximately \n6,000 that actually receive asylum. Mr. President, 6,000 in this \ncountry, 6,000 that are actually granted asylum.\n  These are individuals who have gone through not just the airplane \nride across and flushed their ID cards down the toilet or ate their ID \ncards, these are 6,000 people who have a well-founded fear and have \ngone through the process. It seems to me that those individuals whose \nlives have been a struggle, as we define them, to try to develop \ndemocratic institutions, democratic ideals, democratic values, \ndemocratic priorities in their countries so that their countries will \nmove toward the kind of value system in the broad terms of respect for \ndemocracy and individual rights and freedoms are real heroes in many, \nmany instances. We have recognized that over the long history of this \ncountry.\n\n  So I think the amendment of the Senator from Vermont makes a great \ndeal of sense. I think the opposition, quite frankly, is directed \ntoward a condition which no longer exists because of the excellent work \nof the INS in addressing it. Asylum claims declined 57 percent as \nproductivity doubled in 1995. That is in this last year. They are \ncontinuing to make progress.\n  We ought to be sensitive to this issue of individuals who have gone \nthrough the harshness and the brutality of these foreign regimes. We \ncannot pick up the newspaper without being reminded of them. In so many \ninstances, these individuals, who really do deserve asylum, deserve to \nbe able to receive that in our country, approximately 6,000. I have \nvery serious fears that that kind of sensitivity to the real needs of \nindividuals who have been struggling for democratic ideals will not be \nas respected as it has been if we adopt the proposed recommendations.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I also rise in support of the Leahy \namendment. Senator Simpson is correct that for a period, we went \nthrough this where people just memorized three or four words in the \nEnglish language, ``I seek asylum.''\n  When his bill was first introduced, I was inclined to believe some \nadditional strengthening language was needed. But I was visited by the \nINS people. I have to say Commissioner Doris Meissner just has made a \nterrific impression on all of us. She really knows her stuff, is very \nconscientious, and is very able.\n  This morning's Washington Post has a story, ``Russia Bars Jewish \nAgency,'' and the Russian Ambassador to Israel said he thinks it was \njust a bureaucratic slipup. But then you get to the inside pages and \nread the story that out in the boondocks in Russia there are some anti-\nJewish activities taking place. I hope it is just temporary and \nisolated.\n  We do not know what is going to happen. I think that the Leahy \namendment is one that moves us in the right direction. I think the \ngraph that Senator Kennedy has shown us shows fairly dramatic \nimprovement in the situation. I hope the Leahy amendment will be \naccepted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Washington Post article to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 1, 1996]\n\n   Russia Bars Jewish Agency--Ban Could Hamper Immigration to Israel\n\n                          (By Barton Gellman)\n\n       Jerusalem, April 30.--The Jewish Agency, a quasi-\n     governmental body that has brought 630,000 Jewish immigrants \n     to Israel from the former Soviet Union since 1989, announced \n     tonight that Russian authorities have revoked its \n     accreditation and notified local jurisdictions that the \n     agency no longer is authorized to function in Russia.\n       There was no clear indication of Russia's intentions and no \n     explanation from Moscow. But the potential stakes were seen \n     in Israel as high.\n       Russian immigration has changed the face of Israel, adding \n     nearly one-fifth to its Jewish population and infusing the \n     state with one of the world's most productive flows of human \n     capital. Before the thaw that accompanied the Soviet Union's \n     final days, the Moscow government's sharp restrictions on \n     emigration--and ill-treatment of Jewish ``refuseniks'' who \n     could not leave--were a major source of friction with the \n     West.\n       An estimated 1.4 million Jews remain in the former Soviet \n     Union, 600,000 of them in Russia, and Israel had projected \n     until now that they would continue to make new homes in \n     Israel at last year's rate of 65,000 for several years to \n     come. Officials here have observed no slowdown in Russia's \n     distribution of exit visas, and they do not foresee a return \n     to Russia's old bans on emigration itself, but they said most \n     Russian Jews could not readily leave without the practical \n     and financial assistance of the Jewish Agency.\n       Israeli officials said they were uncertain of the origins \n     of the present impasse, and the Russian ambassador here \n     qualified it as a bureaucratic slipup. But Israelis voiced \n     two theories about what is happening.\n       One focused on the growing nationalist cast of a Russian \n     election campaign that is threatening to unseat President \n     Boris Yeltsin. The second looked to bilateral tensions and \n     the bitterness of the new foreign minister, Yevgeny Primakov, \n     at Israeli moves to keep Russia far from its desired role at \n     the center of Middle East diplomacy.\n       A third explanation--mere misunderstanding--prevailed at \n     first when the Jewish Agency lost its legal accreditation on \n     April 4, which effectively terminated its right to operate \n     offices, hold meetings and stage other activities in Russia. \n     Agency officials treated it as a slipped formality and \n     discouraged Israeli reporters from writing about the change.\n       Other signs--including closure of the agency's Birobidjan \n     and Makhachkale offices in the Russian hinterland, a Justice \n     Ministry notice to local authorities about the loss of \n     accreditation and an increase in vandalism directed at agency \n     properties--began to convince them otherwise as the month \n     wore on.\n       Avraham Burg, the agency's chairman, decided to make public \n     his protests after police and local government officials \n     descended on a Jewish Agency gathering today in Pyatigorsk, \n     an important regional emigration center in the northern \n     Caucasus, and ordered the meeting to break up. Three Israeli \n     representatives of the agency were asked to leave town.\n       ``If this is just a bureaucratic stupidity, I will be \n     happy,'' Burg said in an interview, ``and if it is something \n     else, we shall be ready in the international arena with the \n     Jewish voice, Jewish pressure.''\n       ``We are working in the former Soviet Union under two \n     assumptions,'' he added.\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\n     ``The first one is that the right of the ancient Jewish \n     people to repatriation is a given, and the second one is that \n     the constitutional, basic, elementary right of family \n     reunification is [Russia's] passport to the free world. \n     Without this you are not a Western modern country.''\n       Burg said he had summoned the Russian ambassador to Israel, \n     Alexander Bovin, for what became a sharp meeting last week. \n     Burg said the ambassador assured him that the difficulty was \n     merely technical.\n       Neither Bovin nor any other Russian diplomats here, nor \n     officials in Moscow, could be reached for comment tonight.\n       Burg and Prime Minister Shimon Peres agreed to take the \n     position that there can be no link between the agency's \n     travails in Russia and any bilateral disputes between the \n     Moscow and Jerusalem governments on the grounds that it \n     affects the human rights of individual Jews and the broader \n     interests of the world Jewish community. Foreign Ministry \n     officials said tonight that they would play no role in \n     protesting the change in Russian policy, and Burg planned to \n     fly to New York Wednesday to confer with American Jewish \n     leaders on possibly bringing pressure to bear in Moscow.\n       Alla Levy, chief of the Jewish Agency's efforts in the \n     former Soviet Union and a 1970 immigrant, said today's \n     crackdown in Pyatigorsk was especially sensitive because that \n     city is one of 10 from which Russian Jews fly directly to \n     Israel.\n       Several irritants trouble Israeli-Russian relations, and \n     Primakov rebuffed a meeting request last month from Foreign \n     Minister Ehud Barak. A specialist in the Arab world, Primakov \n     is seen as resenting the combined efforts of Israel and the \n     United States to squeeze Moscow out of its place as co-\n     sponsor of regional peace talks.\n       Israel acknowledges, in addition, that it has been slow to \n     transfer legal rights to Russia from the former Soviet \n     Union's valuable land holdings in Jerusalem. Additional \n     frictions arose at Israel's treatment of Russian visitors at \n     passport control points after police found evidence that \n     Russian organized crime had made inroads here.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, thank you very much. I rise today in \nstrong support of this amendment. Our amendment would, in our view, \ngreatly improve this section of the bill dealing with asylum. Frankly, \nthis section does need improvement. It really creates a summary \nexclusion, a summary exclusion that would keep out of America some of \nthe worthiest of all asylum seekers.\n  Further, it sets a legal standard that is both unprecedented and \nexcessive for people who are the most in need, for people who are truly \nfleeing persecution, and it puts what for some people is a life-or-\ndeath decision in the hands of the INS bureaucrats.\n  As has been pointed out by my colleagues from Illinois and \nMassachusetts, there really is not the problem today that we may have \nseen 2, 3, 4 years ago. Today, the asylum system works pretty well, and \nwe do not need this change, we do not need this summary exclusion. It \nis not worth the price that we are going to pay.\n  It is clear that several years ago, the asylum system was, in fact, \nbroken. Under the old system, people could get a work authorization \nsimply by applying for asylum, and this, obviously, became a magnet, \neven for those who had absolutely no realistic claim for asylum.\n  But the INS changed its rules in 1994, and it stopped automatically \nawarding work permits to those filing for asylum. Instead, it began to \nrequire an adjudication of the asylum claim before it awarded work \nauthorization.\n  It also began resolving asylum claims within 180 days. The results \nare very, very significant.\n  According to the INS, in 1994, before the new rules were put in \nplace, 123,000 people claimed asylum.\n  In 1995 however, after the new rules were established, only 53,000 \npeople even applied for asylum. That is a 57-percent decline in those \npeople who even apply for asylum, a 57-percent decrease in 1 year.\n  Also, the INS reports that it is now completing 84 percent of the new \ncases within 60 days of filing, and 98 percent--virtually all new \ncases--within 180 days of filing. That is why the administration, the \nINS, say that they did not need this provision.\n  Second point, Mr. President. The most worthy cases for asylum would \nbe excluded if we impose this new summary exclusion procedure. Among \nthose excluded would be cases of victims of politically motivated \ntorture and rape, the very people who are most likely--most likely--to \nuse false documents to flee from the country of their torture. These \nare the people who would be hurt the most, frankly, by this summary \nexclusion.\n  Let us talk about these individuals. We have already heard about the \nyoung woman who was seen in the press the last few days from Togo. But \nlet me use two other examples. These are real world cases. These are \ncases where, if the law, as it is currently written in this bill, if \nthis change does in fact go into effect, these people never would have \ngotten into this country. They would have been excluded by an INS \nbureaucrat and sent back to their country in that 1-hour determination \nthat we have talked about.\n  A real example. First, a student in Sudan was beaten and given \nelectric shocks by Government torturers for the crime of engaging in a \npeaceful protest against the Government. He escaped to the United \nStates without a passport. He was placed in detention because an INS \nbureaucrat concluded he did not have the credible fear of persecution \nstandard that we have heard about. However, on judicial review, this \nindividual was granted asylum.\n  So under the procedure that is contained in the bill, under that \nprocedure, the new procedure that we are trying to take out, under the \nnew procedure, it never would have gone beyond the INS bureaucrat. This \nstudent from Sudan would have been sent back to Sudan. There would have \nbeen no opportunity for this person to have a hearing on the matter \nbeyond an initial 1-hour hearing from the bureaucrat where the \nbureaucrat made the decision, ``Send him home.''\n  Second example. A man from India--this is a true case--was imprisoned \nand tortured by the Government because of his religious beliefs. His \nfamily's home was bombed. Fearing for his life, he fled to the United \nStates, where INS bureaucrats verbally abused him, and denied him food \nand water until the next day. They said his fear was not credible. This \ncase on judicial review was changed. He was granted asylum. Again, \nunder the provisions of this bill, without our amendment, this person \nnever would have gotten to the judicial review, would have been sent \nback by the determination made by the bureaucrat.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that is too heavy a price to pay. I think it \nis very clear that we do not need to change the law in this area.\n  I think America, Mr. President, stands for something better than \nthat. We have historically held out the lamp of freedom to the world. \nWe are different than other countries. We have held out a lamp that is \nlit by the flames of justice, not by bureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Members of the Senate, whether watching on \nTV or sitting in the Chamber, think back to stories you have heard--we \nhave all heard stories--about people who have fled persecution, and \nwhether that was in Nazi Germany, or more recent examples. How often \ndid that person who fled persecution have to have a forged document? \nHow often did that person go to great pains to obtain a forged document \nto flee the country? How often did that person have to have another \ncountry of immediate destination before they ended up in the country \nthat they wanted to end up in? How many by necessity had to have that \nthird country there?\n  Each one of us can remember these stories. I remember, as a very \nyoung boy, listening to a story told by a friend of my father, who fled \nNazi Germany. Although some of the details have left me over the 40-\nsome years since I heard this story, I can still remember parts of it, \nand how difficult it was and what great risks he took to get out of \nNazi Germany, to get out of Nazi Germany with documents that clearly \nwere fake. I think we need to keep this in mind, Mr. President, when we \ndecide what to do in regard to this amendment.\n  My friend from Wyoming talks about compassion fatigue. I understand \nthat. I get it. That is why, quite frankly, we have made changes. There \nare major changes in this bill. That is why the INS has made very, very \nsignificant changes in the last several years to speed up the process, \nto make sure that they weed out these cases that do not have merit. \nThat system is working.\n  But I would just say that as we look at this amendment, I would ask \nmy colleagues to keep this in mind, that in\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\nan immigration bill, more than in any other bill that we pass on the \nfloor, more than any other bill that we debate, we do define who we are \nas a country. I think we should be different.\n  I understand the argument that Holland does it one way or Germany \ndoes it another way. That is fine. I understand the argument. But I \nthink, quite frankly, we have to do it our way. We have to do it in a \nway that is consistent with our tradition. One of the great traditions \nof this country is that we have been a beacon of hope, and of light, as \nRonald Reagan would say. We have been the country where people could \ncome to when they were persecuted.\n  If you look at our history and our immigration policy, our best \ndays--our best days--have been when we reached out and said, ``Yes. We \nare this country that is different.'' The few times in our history when \nwe have turned our back on people who are persecuted--and there are \nexamples of this; the Nazi Germany situation, the few times we have \ndone that--we have lived to regret it. And we have been sorry for it.\n  So, yes, I understand compassion fatigue. But we are, in a sense, in \nthis bill defining who we are as a people and redefining that. I think \nthe amendment that has been offered by my friend from Vermont is \nentirely consistent with that great tradition of this country. Thank \nyou, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong \nsupport for the Leahy-DeWine amendment, which preserves critical due \nprocess rights for refugees arriving in the United States after fleeing \npersecution in their countries of origin. While the United States must \ncontrol its borders and ensure that its hospitality is never abused, it \nmust also live up to its finest traditions as a land of freedom and \nrefuge for the oppressed.\n  Our country is built on the rule of law, and must preserve and \nprotect that legacy for all. This amendment would ensure that those \nfleeing oppression have a fair opportunity to present their cases and \nhave them studied and reviewed by appropriate officials. Many genuine \nrefugees are forced to come to the United States with false documents \nand then apply for asylum. In fact, an argument could be made that the \nmore dangerous their situation, the more urgent it is that they come to \napply for asylum, and the more likely that they will not have access to \ngovernment travel documents from the government which is persecuting \nthem. It is just these most needy people who will suffer most directly \nfrom the summary exclusion measures which this amendment seeks to \nmodify.\n  With adoption of this amendment, the United States will remain able \nto ensure that those with valid, deserving cases for asylum will \ncontinue to be able to apply for asylum in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be set aside for a few moments so Senator Bradley can go \nforward with an amendment. I do not think it will take a great deal of \ntime. So if Senator Bradley will go forward, and then Senator Hatch \ncould speak on this bill, and then I have a few more remarks on the \npending amendment. I ask unanimous consent that it be set aside at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3790 To Amendment No. 3743\n\n   (Purpose: To establish an Office for the Enforcement of Employer \n                               Sanctions)\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3790.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3790 to amendment No. 3743.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 47 of the amendment, strike line 1 and all that \n     follows through line 21 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ENFORCEMENT OF EMPLOYER SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Establishment of New Office.--There shall be in the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department of \n     Justice an Office for the Enforcement of Employer Sanctions \n     (in this section referred to as the ``Office'').\n       (b) Functions.--The functions of the Office established \n     under subsection (a) shall be--\n       (1) to investigate and prosecute violations of section \n     274A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1324a(a)); and\n       (2) to educate employers on the requirements of the law and \n     in other ways as necessary to prevent employment \n     discrimination.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Attorney General $100,000,000 to \n     carry out the functions of the Office established under \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, this amendment is a second-degree \namendment to the one proposed by the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming. The amendment will improve the Federal Government's ability to \ndeter illegal immigration by enhancing the enforcement of our existing \nlaws. In particular, this amendment would create a separate office \nwithin the INS to ensure that our employer sanction laws are \neffectively and fairly enforced. The fact is that employment is the \nsingle most important enticement that brings illegal immigrants to our \nshores.\n  If we want to address seriously the illegal immigration problem in \nthis country, we must address ourselves to the root of that problem, \nwhich is the jobs.\n  In 1986 we started down the right track with the Immigration Reform \nControl Act, better known as the Simpson-Mazzoli Act. In that bill we \nenacted, after considerable debate, employer sanctions which imposed \ncivil penalties on employers of illegal aliens and criminal penalties \nfor pattern or practice violations.\n  We put very tough teeth in the law--up to a $10,000 fine, up to 3 \nyears in jail. Those provisions are strong and, if enforced adequately, \nwould deter the hiring of illegal aliens.\n\n  This bill makes important headway in improving these laws. However, \none critical element is missing: These laws, those that we passed in \n1986, are not being adequately enforced.\n  I have heard many in the Chamber complain that employer sanction laws \nare not working and perhaps should be eliminated. I agree that they are \nnot working as well as they could be working, but the problem is not \nwith the law. The problem is with the implementation of the law. The \nINS' ineffective implementation of these laws has been noticed time and \nagain by independent observers, including the Jordan Commission and the \nOffice of the Inspector General.\n  For example, the Jordan Commission found that employer sanctions are \naccorded a low priority by the INS. The INS' own data bear that out. \nBetween 1989 and 1995, the number of INS investigations of employer \nsanction violations dropped by more than 50 percent.\n  Let me repeat that: From 1989 to 1995, the number of investigations \nby the INS of employer sanctions dropped by more than 50 percent. The \nGAO found that the number of agents assigned to the workplace \nenforcement dropped more than half between 1989 and 1994.\n  Overall, financial resources allocated to the enforcement of employer \nsanctions also has declined significantly. While the INS is now \nincreasing the number of workplace agents and resources directed toward \nthe enforcement of employer sanctions, projections indicate that the \nINS will only employ, after these improvements are made, only employ \nabout 708 workplace agents in 1996. Mr. President, 708 agents to cover \na nation with 6.5 million employers--this contrasts sharply with the \nover 5,000 Border Patrol agents that the INS projects in 1996.\n  This disparity is notable given that according to the INS' own \nestimates, their own estimates, about half of all illegal immigrants do \nnot cross the border illegally but overstay their visas.\n  Let me repeat that: Half of all illegal immigrants in this country \nare not sneaking across the border in the middle of the night but they \nare people that come into this country on a visitor's visa and \noverstay. They are people who come in on a visitor's visa,\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\nthen get a job illegally. They are here in the workplace taking jobs \naway from Americans.\n  The law says an employer who hires an illegal immigrant who overstays \non his visitor's visa, for example, is subject to fine and possible \nimprisonment. Yet, nobody is going after these employers. There is not \nenough enforcement.\n\n  Furthermore, the INS is failing to conduct investigations \neffectively. Like the Jordan Commission's report a year earlier, a \nSeptember 1995 inspector general audit found numerous problems with the \nINS conduct of its employer sanctions investigations. The inspector \ngeneral specifically found that ``the INS is sending a signal to the \nbusiness community that it does not take seriously its enforcement \nresponsibilities in the area of employer sanctions.'' Those are the \nwords of the inspector general that the INS is not seriously pursuing \nemployer sanctions.\n  The problem is more, however, than numbers and authorizations. This \nbill provides much needed authorization for additional investigators \navailable for the INS to use for employer sanctions. That is good. It \ndoes not go far enough because those investigators are not necessarily \ngoing to be directed toward employer sanction enforcement.\n  Moreover, these investigators are likely to continue to be wasted on \nless important and less effective enforcement efforts. That certainly \nis the case if past practice is any indication.\n  New investigators could deal with the part of the INS problems in \nthis area, but only if they are used appropriately. As the critique of \nthe Jordan Commission, the inspector general, and others have \nindicated, the problem is more than resources; it is more than simply a \nfew more agents. Consequently, our solution must provide more than \nresources.\n  Mr. President, what is needed is a separate office for the \nenforcement of employer sanctions that will focus its activities on the \nmost serious problem, which is employers hiring illegals, not having \nanyone go after them, as well as address the problems of employers \ndiscriminating on the basis of national origin. It is clear that a \nfundamental change is needed in the INS bureaucracy to make these laws \nwork.\n  The amendment I am suggesting specifically addresses this problem by \nchanging the task force provided by section 120(b) of the bill to an \noffice for enforcement of employer sanctions and authorizing it for \n$100 million, the figure contained in the 1986 Immigration Act. The \noffice will have two primary functions: to investigate and prosecute \nemployer sanction violations, and to educate employers on the \nrequirement of the law in order to prevent unlawful employment \ndiscrimination.\n  I think this amendment corrects the weaknesses in the existing \nbureaucracy. It will separate and dedicate necessary resources to the \nenforcement of employer sanctions so that it will be accorded the \npriority that it deserves. Of equal importance, the creation of a \nseparate office within the INS will tell employers that the INS is now \nserious about enforcing the employer sanctions provision, that it has \nthe budget and the manpower to investigate and follow up leads on the \nworst violations of these laws. As well, it will send a strong message \nto the INS that it needs to improve its enforcement activities.\n\n  I think it is also important to point out that this amendment does \nnot add new sanctions or increase the burden on employers. It does not \nadd one single form to the mountain of paperwork they must already fill \nout when they hire a new legal worker. It just asks that existing law \nbe adequately enforced.\n  Finally, and of equal importance, it will require better education of \nemployers to prevent discrimination.\n  In short, this amendment goes to the source of the illegal \nimmigration problem in this country--the job magnet--by improving our \nmechanism for seriously working to eliminate that employment magnet, \nwith adequate enforcement directed toward the problem, with no excuses, \nand with results required.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I think my old friend, Senator Bradley \nfrom New Jersey, has put his finger right down on one of the most \ncritical issues in dealing with the problem of illegal immigration, \nwhich is the magnet of jobs, employment, which draws illegals to this \ncountry.\n  This amendment would establish an office within the INS, as I \nunderstand it, specifically staffed and mandated to perform both of the \nfunctions that are essential to the success of any employer sanction \nprovisions.\n  That is, the office would both educate employers about the law and \ntheir responsibilities to prevent unlawful discrimination, and would \ninvestigate and prosecute those employers who knowingly hire illegal \naliens. I think that we cannot claim to be serious about dealing with \nthe problems of illegal immigration unless we are serious about dealing \nwith those who knowingly hire illegals. So long as they can get the \njobs they seek, illegal aliens will continue to regard this country as \nthe land of opportunity, and some will refer to it almost as the land \nof slave labor as they come here as illegals and remain in that status. \nThat is why it is important that we remove illegal persons from our \nsociety or else make them legal.\n  So we already have a special counsel for the prevention of \ndiscrimination against aliens. That is already on the books. I did not \nlike that when it went in, but it is on the books. Surely, it would be \nappropriate to have an office of employer sanctions to deal with the \nsingle-most important element. As Barbara Jordan's Commission put it, \n``Shifting priorities and reduced funding have hamstrung some of those \nprovisions.''\n  As I understand it, this does not create a new Justice Department \nagency to enforce employer sanctions. It creates a new office within \nthe INS. But there is a funding level increase. That is correct. \nOriginally, that was not so, but it is so now, is that correct?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. This provision would not disrupt the balance between \nemployer sanctions and antidiscrimination. I will have to, if I may, \nset the amendment aside because several wish to speak on that \namendment. I personally do not have grave reservations about it, but \nothers do.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3780\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I ask that the amendment be set aside and that we go \nback to the Leahy amendment, and then we go to Senator Abraham to lay \ndown his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me just come to a little review of \nthe amendment of Senator Leahy. The Senator from Vermont spoke of the \nalien who was so traumatized that he or she cannot speak about it at \nentry, and so they would not be in a position to immediately show a \ncredible fear and, thereby, attain a full asylum hearing.\n  The Senator certainly goes to the hardest case. If the Senator's \namendment was precisely directed only to that possibility, it would be \nappropriate. But the Senator's amendment goes far beyond that. It would \nsimply gut the reforms proposed in the bill to deal with the large \nnumber of aliens. What we are trying to get at is aliens who enter \nwithout inspection, or with fraudulent documents, and those who board a \nplane with documents, then dispose of them, and upon entry fraudulently \nclaim asylum.\n  I think we are still having a bit of distortion, not from the \nSenators from Vermont or Ohio, but when someone says that they will not \nbe interviewed by ``the guy at the border,'' that is simply not true. \nThis provision will only be administered by specially trained asylum \nofficers with translators. There will be translators. There always are \ntranslators of any language, subject to review by a superior, another \ntrained asylum officer. These are not low-level immigration officers. \nThis is not correct. These are highly trained individuals.\n  I remind our colleagues of one other item that has sprung from the \ndebate. Our laws and treaties prevent our Government from returning any \nperson to any country where their life or freedom may be in danger. \nThat is the law of the United States. It is the law of the United \nNations. It is the sacred law. It is called nonrefoulment: You cannot \nreturn a person to a country where their life or freedom may be in \ndanger. That is not done. We do not do it, and that is the law of the \nUnited States. That is the law of the United Nations.\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\n No matter if a person can establish credible fear or not, the person \nwill not be returned to certain imprisonment and danger. That will not \nchange under any provisions of this bill.\n  Finally, I hope that we recognize that 70 percent--I hope these \nfigures can be heard--of all asylum applicants in fiscal year 1995 came \nfrom three countries. El Salvador, 72,000, which, at last look, was a \ndemocracy. They had worked through tremendous civil war to get where it \nis a democracy. We gave their people an extended program called \n``extended voluntary departure'' a few years ago. Guatemala, 22,900; \nand 9,300 from Mexico. So out of a total of 149,500 applicants, they \nare the countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico.\n\n  While there may be problems in those countries, they are not highly \nrepressive countries. At least our Government does not find them such. \nThere is turmoil in Guatemala, killings in Guatemala. There are \nkillings in the United States--an awful lot of them. They are, however, \nknown as leading sources of illegal immigration.\n  What you are seeing is, when you have a country that is your leading \nsource of illegal immigration, they are picking them up, and they have \nbeen here 2, 3 years, and they say, ``I am seeking asylum'' because \nthey know that these procedures are interminable. That is what we are \ntrying to get at. We are not after the person from Iraq, or the Kurd, \nor those people. We are after the people gimmicking the system. For \nevery one that you can point to with passion and drama, you can point \nto a hundred who are gimmicking the system. This is what the people of \nAmerica are appalled at, that we will not deal with the issue.\n  There is a balance to be struck between granting asylum to those who \nare qualified and preventing this country's traditional hospitality \nbeing taken advantage of in a most extraordinary way. Remember, when \nyou have 9,304 cases from Mexico--and a case can be more than one \nperson--how many of those asylum claimants from Mexico were granted \nasylum? There were 55--55 out of 9,304. If that is not gimmickry of the \nsystem, I am missing something. It means that one-seventh of our asylum \napplicants, even under the new provisions, are almost guaranteed to be \nbogus or fraudulent. I hope that our colleagues will hear that as we go \nto the eventual vote on that.\n  Of the first four major countries of asylum cases--Guatemala, Mexico, \nChina, and India--the final approval rate is 2 percent--2 percent of \nthese people that we have heard these poignant, powerful stories about. \nAnd 98 percent of them are fake or bogus. So if we hear the 1 and \nforget the 100, we are making a mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. If the distinguished Senator from Wyoming will yield, I \nwonder if we can get some time agreement on the amendment that I \noffered. I know a couple other Senators would like to speak. Is that \npossible?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I do not think I am prepared to do that \nuntil the two people that have indicated they wish to debate come over. \nWhen I get in touch with them, and I will get back to you, perhaps we \nwill get a half hour or an hour. I will work toward that, with the \napproval of Senator Kennedy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3752 to Amendment No. 3743\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Mack, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n     Lieberman, and Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3752 to amendment No. 3743.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike sections 111-115 and 118.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nNickles be added as a cosponsor for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the amendment I proposed is cosponsored, \nin addition to myself, by Senators Feingold, DeWine, Lott, Mack, \nLieberman, Inhofe, and Nickles.\n  Mr. President, our amendment does basically two things. First, it \nwould strike sections 111 through 115 of the bill, which would \ncurrently begin to implement a national identification system.\n  Second, the amendment would strike a related provision, section 118 \nof the bill, which would require State driver's licenses and birth \ncertificates to conform to new Federal regulations and standards.\n  Mr. President, I intend to devote at least my opening statement here \ntoday to the first Senate provisions that we seek to strike with this \namendment, those which pertain to the national identification system. \nSenator DeWine, while in addition to commenting on those sections, will \nbe speaking in more specific terms about the driver's license and birth \ncertificate provisions.\n  I recognize that we are not under a time agreement and that it will \nbe the option of the Presiding Officer in terms of floor debate. But we \nhope Senator DeWine will have an opportunity following my remarks to be \nrecognized soon so that he may comment on that portion of the bill \nwhich he has particularly been focused on.\n  That said, Mr. President, let me just begin by making it clear that \nthose of us proposing this amendment consider the hiring of illegal \naliens to be a wrong thing. We think wrongful hirings, no matter how \nthey might be brought about, are not appropriate. We are not bringing \nthis amendment to in any way condone, or encourage, or stimulate \nwrongful hirings of people who are not in this country under proper \ndocumentation.\n  The question is, how do we best address that problem, and how do we \ndo it in the least intrusive fashion? Already this bill contains a \nvariety of provisions which will have, I think, a marked impact on \naddressing the problem. In the bill we already increase substantially \nthe number of Border Patrol employees, people patrolling the borders to \nprevent illegal aliens from entering the country.\n  Mr. President, in the bill we already addressed a very serious \nproblem alluded to by the Senator from New Jersey, people who overstay \ntheir visas, and constitute some 50 percent of the illegal alien \npopulation by for the first time imposing sharp, stiff penalties on \nthose who violate the visa rules. In addition, as we dealt with on \nnumerous occasions yesterday, Mr. President, we have attempted to \naddress the issue of access to public assistance for noncitizens, and \nparticularly for illegal aliens, as a way of discouraging some who may \nhave come to this country, or who might consider doing so for purposes \nof accessing our social service programs.\n  In addition, under the bill, we have dramatically, I think, moved to \ntry to expedite the deportation of criminal aliens, a very substantial \npart of our current alien community, and by definition, in the case of \nthose who have committed serious offenses, individuals who are \ndeportable, and thus no longer appropriate to be in the country.\n  I believe these steps, combined with other provisions in the \nlegislation, move us a long way down the road toward addressing the \nconcerns we have about the wrongful hiring of illegal aliens. I think \nwe need to understand the provisions that pertain to verification, \nwhich, at least in this Senator's judgment, are a very obvious example \nof a highly intrusive approach that will not have much of an effect on \nthe problems that we confront.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, what we confront in this country is less, in \nmy judgment, of a case of an innocent employer who has been somehow \ndeceived, or baffled by a clever alien. We have largely confronted a \nsituation in which some form of complicity takes place between \nemployers who are looking for ways to hire less expensive labor, and \nillegal aliens who have no choice in terms of the options available to \nthem. So what we find is intent on the part of the employer, and, \nobviously, a willingness on the part of the illegal alien to be an \nemployee.\n  This identification system is not going to do very much to address \nthat problem because no matter what type of identification document is \nused, whether it is a birth certificate, a driver's license, an ID \ncard, a Social Security card, or anything else, at least in my \njudgment, it is not going to matter\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\nif the employer's objective is to hire a lower priced employee who \nhappens to be an illegal alien because, whatever the system is, it will \nbe circumvented intentionally to accomplish the objective of trimming \ndown on overhead.\n  As a consequence, to a large extent, the system, no matter how \neffectively it is perfected, is not going to really have much impact on \nthe large part of the problem we confront with regard to the hiring of \nillegal aliens. In my judgment, that makes the cost of this program \ngreatly disproportionate to any potential benefit it might have in \nterms of reducing the population of illegal aliens who are improperly \nemployed.\n  I also say in my opening today that we have taken, I think, with the \namendment, with the provisions of the bill that were sustained \nyesterday in the vote with respect to providing employers with a shield \nagainst discrimination cases, a further tool that will allow employers \nwho are innocent to take the steps necessary to avoid hiring \nunintentionally people who are meant to be hired under the current \nlaws.\n  That is the backdrop, Mr. President. We have big Government, an \nexpansive Government, an intrusive Government solution being brought to \nbear in a circumstance where I do not think it is going to do much \ngood. For that reason, I think the verification system is headed in the \nwrong direction.\n  This approach is flawed, and it is, in my judgment, overextensive in \nthe way it is structured in the bill right now without any definition \nas to the dimensions that such pilot programs are envisioned in the \nbill might encompass, it has the potential to be a very, very large \nprogram. What is the region? And how advanced are all regions in an \nentire quarter of the country? The bill does not specify how large the \npilot programs might be.\n  So for those reasons we believe that the verification part of this \nlegislation is unnecessary and should be struck.\n  Let me talk more specifically about why the costs are going to be \ngreater than the benefits under the program.\n  First, Mr. President, even though this is a potential pilot program, \nit seems to me, it is impossible to effectively run a pilot program of \nthis type unless a national database is collected. That national \ndatabase check is going to be a very extensive step in the direction of \na national identification system.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, it seems to me, given the enormous \ndownstroke cost of developing that kind of system, that there will be \nan enormous amount of pressure on us to continue building the system \ninto a national system in the very near future. Indeed, that is the \ndirection that the sponsors of the legislation in both the House and \nSenate had originally envisioned. But the bottom line in terms of the \ncosts of the program really falls on three categories of U.S. citizens \nthat we need to focus on today.\n  First, it is extremely unfair and costly to honest employers. Any \nkind of system that involves verifying new employees prior to hiring \nthem in the fashion that is suggested here will be costly. The employer \nmust phone a 1-800 number in Washington, or someplace else to determine \nwhether an individual's name is in the database, or the person who is \nthe employer must develop some type of, or require some type of, \ncomputer interface system, whatever it might be. These are additional \nbusiness costs that will fall hard--especially hard--on small \nbusinesses at a time when I think this Congress at least in its \nrhetoric has been talking about trying to make the burdensome costs on \nsmall business less cumbersome.\n  In addition, there will be a very disproportionately costly burden on \nthose types of small businesses that have a high turnover of employees. \nAnd there are a number of them in virtually every one of our States, \nwhether it is the small fast food restaurant, or whether it is the \nseasonal type of small business. The list is endless of those kinds of \nbusinesses which have huge amounts of turnover in terms of their \nemployee ranks. For each of those under a verification system we are \nadding additional costs and additional burdens that must be borne \nregardless of the circumstances.\n  But really, Mr. President, this is an unfunded mandate on these small \nbusinesses, on businesses in general, on employers in general, whoever \nthey might be. And, in my judgment, it sets a very bad precedent \nbecause it would be for the first time the case that we would require \npeople to affirmatively seek permission to hire an employee.\n  To me, Mr. President, that is a gigantic step in the direction of big \ngovernment that we should not take. I do not think we want to subject \nemployers, no matter how, or how many employees they have, to this new-\nfound responsibility to affirmatively seek permission to hire \nemployees.\n  Again, though, the people who will pay these costs and suffer these \nburdens are going to be the honest employers.\n  Those who are dishonest, those who would hire illegal aliens \nknowingly will not engage in any of these expenses, will not undertake \nany of these steps because, obviously, their intent is to circumvent \nthe law, whatever it might be. They are doing it today. They will do it \nwhatever the system is that we come up with.\n  So what we are talking about in short is a very costly, very \ncumbersome, very burdensome new responsibility on employers in this \ncountry that will disproportionately fall on the shoulders of those \nemployers who are playing by the rules instead of those who are \nbreaking them. As I say, Mr. President, it will, for the first time, \nrequire employers to affirmatively seek permission to hire employees, \nseek that permission from Washington.\n  However, it is not just the employers who will suffer through a \nsystem of verification as set forth in the legislation; it is also the \nworkers, the employees, U.S. citizens who will now be subjected to a \nverification system that, in my judgment, cannot be perfected \naccurately enough to avoid massive problems, dislocations and unhappy \nresults for countless American citizens.\n  As I have said, there is no way such a system can really be effective \nunless there is, first, a national database. Such a national database, \nno matter how accurately constructed, is bound to be riddled with \nerrors. Indeed, some of the very small projects the INS has already \nlaunched have been discovered to have error rates, in terms of names in \nthe database, as high as 28 percent.\n  Now, I hope that we could do better than 28 percent, but let us just \nconsider if the database had an error margin of 1 percent and let us \nalso consider that that was a national program. That would be 600,000 \nhirings per year that would be basically derailed due to error rates in \nthe database.\n  The project, of course, is not a national program to begin with, but \n1 percent of any sizable regional project is going to mean that U.S. \ncitizens who are entitled to be hired will not be hired and be placed \nin limbo because of this experimental program.\n  Again, though, Mr. President, this is not going to be a problem in \nthe case of illegal aliens hired by employers who knowingly choose to \ndo so because they will not be subjected to this verification process.\n  If we were to have this margin of error, if we were to even have a \nsmall handful of American citizens denied employment under these \nprovisions, we would set in motion what I think would be an \nextraordinarily costly process for those employers and employees so \naffected.\n\n  Is it right to impose a system that would in fact mean that U.S. \ncitizens or legal permanent residents who are entitled to work would be \npotentially put on hold for weeks to months while the system's database \nis corrected? I think that is wrong. I think it is the wrong direction \nto go. Anybody who has dealt with computer databases knows the \npotential for error in these types of systems. In my judgment, to \ninvite that kind of high cost on the employees and employers of this \ncountry would be a huge mistake.\n  So those are the first two issues to consider, the first two. The \nvictims are the honest, play-by-the-rules employers and employees or \npotential employees who want to play by the rules. They are going to be \nthe victims. They are going to pay a high cost.\n  So, too, Mr. President, will the taxpayers pay a high cost for this, \nin effect, unfunded mandate, because just building the database capable \nof handling any kind of sizable regional project will cost hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. The question is, is it going to produce the \nresults that are being suggested? I would say no.\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\n  As I have indicated already, those who want to circumvent a system \nwill circumvent this system, and they will do so intentionally. \nMeanwhile, the taxpayers will be footing a very substantial bill for a \nsystem that can be easily avoided by those employers and illegal alien \nemployees who wish to do so.\n  I intend to speak further on this amendment this morning, but let me \njust summarize my initial comments. I believe we should strike these \nverification procedures. I believe that the cost of imposing these \nprograms even on a trial basis is going to be excessive. I feel as if \nit leads us in the direction of big Government, big Government \nexpansion and the imposition of costly Federal regulations and burdens, \nespecially on small businesses that they do not need at this time.\n  I believe that the tough standards we have placed in the bill to deal \nwith illegal aliens, combined with some of the other relief that has \nbeen granted to employers to try to ferret out those who should not be \nemployed, are the sorts of safeguards that will have the least \nintrusive effect on those who play by the rules. The costs of this \nverification system, in my judgment, far outweigh any potential \nbenefits. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support our effort \nto strike these provisions.\n  At this point, as I said, Mr. President, I realize we are not on a \ntime agreement to yield time, but I know the Senator from Ohio would \nlike to speak to another part of this, so I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair. I rise today to support this \namendment.\n  The Senator from Michigan has discussed very eloquently the problems \nthat we see with the employer verification section of the bill. I am \ngoing to talk in a moment about a related problem, a problem that we \nsee in the part of the bill that will require for the first time, in \nessence, a national birth certificate, a national driver's license.\n  Before we discuss these parts of the bill, however, let me start by \ncongratulating my colleague from Wyoming. He said something about an \nhour ago on this floor that is absolutely correct. We are going to pass \nan illegal immigration bill, and after we have had our way with the \namendments, one way or the other, we are going to pass a bill. It is \ngoing to be a good bill, and it is going to be a real tribute to his \nwork over the years and his work on this particular bill.\n  Make no mistake about it: This bill has very, very strong provisions, \nstrong provisions that are targeted directly at the problem of illegal \nimmigration. The bill that the Senator reported from the subcommittee, \nbecause of his great work and the other members of the subcommittee, is \na strong bill targeted at illegal immigration, targeted at those who \nbreak the law. The bill that the committee reported out is a good bill \nas well. There are, however, several provisions in this bill--and this \namendment deals with these provisions--we believe, frankly, are \nmisguided and that are targeted and will have the undue burden not on \nthe lawbreakers but we believe will have an undue burden, unfair burden \non the other law-abiding citizens in this country. Let me discuss these \nat this point.\n  My colleague from Michigan has talked about the employer verification \nsystem. What is now in the bill is a pilot project. I am going to \ndiscuss this at greater length later on in this debate, but let me \nstate at this point my experience in this area comes from a different \nbut related field, and that is the area of criminal record systems. I \nstarted my career as a county prosecutor, and I became involved in the \nproblem with the criminal record system. In fact, I discussed this at \nlength with the current occupant of the chair.\n  I have seen, as other Members have, how difficult it is to bring our \ncriminal record system up to date, to make sure that it is accurate. We \nhave spent hundreds of millions of dollars in this country to try to \nbring our criminal record system up to snuff so that when a police \nofficer or parole officer or the judge setting bond makes a life and \ndeath decision--that is what it is many times--about whether to turn \nsomeone out or not turn them out, they have good, reliable \ninformation. We have improved our system and we are getting it better, \nbut we still have a long, long way to go.\n\n  If, when the stakes are so high in the criminal system, and that is a \nfinite system--we are dealing with a relatively small number of \npeople--if we have such a difficult time getting it right in that \nsystem, can you imagine how difficult it is going to be for us to \ncreate an entirely new database, a much, much larger database? How many \nmillions are we going to have to spend to do that and what are the \nchances we are going to get it right, and get it right in a short \nperiod of time? So I support the comments of my colleague from Michigan \nin regard to this national database, in regard to this national \nverification system.\n  Let me now turn to another part of this bill, a part that is \naddressed also by this same amendment we are now debating. This section \nhas to do with the creation, for the first time, of a federally \nprescribed birth certificate and the creation for the first time of a \nfederally prescribed driver's license.\n  Under the bill as currently written, on the floor now, all birth \ncertificates and all driver's licenses would have to meet Federal \nstandards. For the first time in our history, Washington, this \nCongress, would tell States how they produce documents to identify \ntheir own citizens. Let me read, if I could, directly from the law, or \nthe bill as it has been introduced and as it is in front of us today. \nThen in a moment I am going to have a chart, but let me read from the \nbill. My colleagues who are in the Chamber, my colleagues who are in \ntheir offices watching on TV, I ask them to listen to the words because \nI think, frankly, they are going to be very surprised.\n\n       No Federal agency, including but not limited to the Social \n     Security Administration and the Department of State and no \n     State agency that issues driver's licenses or identification \n     documents may accept for any official purpose a copy of a \n     birth certificate as defined in paragraph 5 unless it is \n     issued by a State or local authorized custodian of records \n     and it conforms to standards prescribed in paragraph B.\n\n  Paragraph B, then, basically is the Federal prescribed standards. The \nbureaucracy will issue those regulations. Again, we are saying no \nFederal agency could issue this, and ``No State agency that issues \ndriver's licenses or identification documents may accept for any \nofficial purpose.'' Those are the key words.\n  Let me turn to what I consider to be the first problem connected with \nthis language. It is a States rights issue. We hear a lot of discussion \non this floor about States rights. This seems to be the time and the \nyear when we are trying to return power to the local jurisdictions, \nreturn power to the people. It is ironic that the language of this bill \nas it is currently written goes in just the opposite direction. \nAlthough we oftentimes talk about the 10th amendment, I cannot think of \na more clear violation of the 10th amendment than the language that we \nhave in front of us today. This is the language that pertains directly \nto the States.\n\n       . . . no State agency that issues driver's licenses or \n     identification documents, may accept for any official purpose \n     a copy of a birth certificate . . . unless it is issued by a \n     State or local government registrar and it conforms to \n     standards . . . promulgated by the Federal agency designated \n     by the President. . . .\n\n  Listen to the language, ``No State agency that issues driver's \nlicenses or identification documents, may accept for any official \npurpose. * * * '' We are telling a State in one of the basic functions \nof government, one of their oldest functions, the issuance of birth \ncertificates, and other functions we rely on States to do, issuing \ndriver's licenses, we are turning to them and saying you cannot accept \ndocuments except as prescribed by the Federal Government. We are \ntelling that agency, we are telling that State, what they can and \ncannot accept. This, I think, is going in the wrong direction.\n  I am not a constitutional scholar but I think it has clear problems \nwith the 10th amendment if anything has any problems with the 10th \namendment. You tell the State what they can accept and what they cannot \naccept for their own purposes.\n  Let me move, if I could, to another problem that I see with this \nprovision. The second problem, I will call it sort of a nonmonetary \nproblem, the nonmonetary cost. This bill as currently\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\nwritten, going to the national driver's license, going to a national \nbirth certificate, is going to cause a tremendous amount of anguish and \ntremendous amount of inconvenience for the American people. It is the \nAmerican people who are abiding by the law who are really going to be \npunished by this. This is, in essence, what the bill says. It says to \nthe approximately 260-some million Americans, each presumably who has a \nbirth certificate somewhere, that your birth certificate is still \nvalid, it is still valid, you just cannot use it for anything, or \nalmost anything. If you want to use that birth certificate, you have to \nget a new one. You have to get a new one that conforms to what the \nbureaucracy has said the new birth certificate must conform to.\n  Your old birth certificate is no good. You can keep it at home, you \ncan keep it stored in your closet or wherever you have it, that is OK, \nit is still valid, but if you want to use it to get a passport or you \nwant to use it for any purpose, you cannot do that. You have to go back \nand get a new birth certificate.\n\n  What am I talking about in the real world where we all live and our \nconstituents live? Let me give three examples, real world examples of \ninconvenience and problems that this is going to cause. Every year, \nmillions of Americans get married and many of them change their names. \nTo have a name change legally accepted by Social Security--this is the \nlaw today--today, to have a name change legally accepted by Social \nSecurity or by the IRS, today you must show a marriage certificate plus \nbirth certificate. That is the law today.\n  This amendment will not change that. But here is how it will affect \nit. If this bill becomes law, the birth certificate you currently have \nis no good and you will not be able to use it for this purpose. You are \ngoing to have to go back to your origin, the place of your birth. You \nare going to have to do as Mary and Joseph did, you are going to have \nto go back to where you came from, where you were born, or at least you \nare going to have to do this by mail, or in some way contact that \ncounty where you were born, because the birth certificate they gave \nyour parents 20 years ago, 25 years ago, you cannot use that anymore, \nbecause that is what this bill says. They are going to have to issue \nyou a new one and you are going to have to go back and get that new \nbirth certificate. I think that is going to be a shock to many people \nwhen they decide they want to get married.\n  June is historically the most popular month, we are told, for \nweddings. My wife Fran and I were married in June so I guess we are \naverage, with a number of million other Americans. If this bill passes, \nI do not think it is too much to say that June will not only be known \nas the month of weddings, people getting married, it will also be the \nmonth where people will have to stand in line, because that is really \nwhat people are going to have to do. It is one more step back to get a \nnew birth certificate for them. How many people get married each year? \nI do not know, but each one of these people will be affected.\n  Let me give a second example. What happens when you turn 16 years of \nage? You ask any teenager. They will tell you that in most States at \nleast they get the opportunity to try to get a driver's license. How \nmany of us have had that experience, gone down with their child or, if \nwe remember that long ago, ourselves, trying to get a driver's license? \nHow many people had to stand in line? I do not think it is unique to my \nexperience, or the experience of my friends. You go and stand in line \nand it takes a while. Imagine your constituent or my constituent, our \nfamily members going down with our child at the age of 16, standing in \nline at the DMV. We get to the head of the line. You have a birth \ncertificate. And the clerk looks at you and says, ``Sorry.'' You say, \n``What's wrong? I have this birth certificate.''\n  They say, ``No, we are sorry. This is not one of the new federally \nprescribed birth certificates. This was issued 16 years ago. This \ndoesn't conform. It doesn't work. The Federal law says we cannot accept \nthat birth certificate.''\n\n  You then leave and either go back to the place your child was born or \nwrite to the place your child was born and you get that birth \ncertificate.\n  We live in a very mobile society. I always relate things to my own \nexperience. In the case of our children, that means we would have to go \nback to Hamilton, OH; we would have to go back, for one of them, to \nLima, OH; one to Springfield, OH; one to Springfield, VA, a couple to \nXenia, OH. You would have to go back in each case to where that child \nwas born and go back to the health department or whatever the issuing \nagency was of the State to get that birth certificate.\n  Once you got the birth certificate, you then have to get in line at \nthe DMV. That is how it is going to work in the real world. Let me give \none more example.\n  When people turn 65 in this country, they have an opportunity to \nreceive Social Security and they have the opportunity to get Medicare. \nOne of the things you have to do, obviously, is prove your age. How \nmany people, Mr. President, who turn 65 in 1996, live in the same \ncounty they lived in when they were born? I suspect not too many.\n  How shocked they are going to be when they go in to Social Security \nand they present a birth certificate and Social Security says, ``Sorry. \nYeah, you waited in line for half an hour; sorry, we can't take this \nbirth certificate.''\n  ``Why not? I have had this certificate for 65 years.''\n  ``No, Congress passed a law 2, 3 years ago. You can't use this birth \ncertificate anymore. You have to go get a new one.''\n  Imagine the complaints we are going to get in regard to that.\n  Getting married, turning 16 and getting a driver's license, wanting \nto go on Social Security--these are just three examples of how this is \ngoing to work in the real world.\n  I think it is important to remember that this is an attempt to deal \nwith a problem not created by the people who we are, in essence, \npunishing by this language, not created by the teenager or his or her \nparents who turned 16, not created by the senior citizen who turned 65 \nand wants Social Security.\n  How many times are we going to have people call us saying, ``I \ncertainly hope you didn't vote for that bill, Senator.'' ``I certainly \nhope, Congressman, you didn't vote for that bill.''\n  Let me turn to another cost, because this is a costly thing, and we \nwill talk just for a moment about the costs incurred in the whole \nreissuing of birth certificates. You can just imagine how many million \nnew birth certificates are going to have to be issued. Somebody has to \npay for that.\n\n  It is true the CBO has said this does not come under the new law we \npassed, because under that law, you have to be up to $50 million of \nunfunded mandates per year before it is labeled an unfunded mandate. \nBut that does not mean it is not an unfunded mandate, nor does it mean \nit is not a cost to local or State government. Nor does it mean it is \nnot going to be a cost to citizens. Let me go through a little bit on \nthe cost.\n  If you look at the language in the bill, the idea behind the language \nis very good, and that is to get birth certificates that are tamper-\nfree. We took the opportunity to contact printers and to talk to them \nto find out, under the language of this bill, what a State would have \nto do.\n  Although there is discretion left to the bureaucracy in how this is \ngoing to be implemented and the States are going to have some option \nabout how it is done, the printers we talked to said there is anywhere \nfrom 10 to 18 to 20 different safety features that one would expect to \nbe included in this new birth certificate.\n  Let me just read some of the things that they are talking about. I am \nnot going to bore everyone with the details. We have two pages worth of \ndifferent types of things:\n  Thermochromic ink--colored ink which is sensitive to heat created by \nhuman touch or frictional abrasion. When activated, the ink will \ndisappear or change to another color.\n  Abrasion ink--a white transparent ink which is difficult to see, but \nwill fluoresce under ultraviolet light exposure.\n  Chemical voids--incorporated into the paper must be images that will \nexhibit a hidden multilingual void message that appears when \nalterations are attempted with chemical ink eradicators, bleach or \nhypochlorites.\n  A fourth example: Copy ban and void pantograph.\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n  A fifth example: Fluorescent ink.\n  A sixth example: High-resolution latent images.\n  A seventh example: Secure lock.\n  And on and on and on. This is not something, as I say, that is brain \nsurgery. It is not something that cannot be done. It is something that \nclearly can be done. But let no one think this is not going to cost \nmillions and millions of dollars, and someone is going to pay for it.\n  The American people are going to pay for it one way or the other. \nThey are going to pay for it if the local government eats up the cost \nor absorbs the cost, and that is going to be what we like to refer to \nas an unfunded mandate.\n\n  If they pass it on to the consumer, to the couple who just got \nmarried, or the 16-year-old who gets his driver's license, or they pass \nit on to the 65-year-old who wants Social Security, that is going to be \na tax. It will be a hidden tax. The cost is going to be there, and it \nis going to be millions and millions of dollars.\n  As my colleague from Michigan pointed out, all these changes, all \nthis burden, all this inconvenience, all these violations of the States \nrights is being done, really, to go after the problem of illegal aliens \nand the people, really, who are hiring them.\n  We have talked--it is difficult to get accurate statistics on this--\nwe talked to INS, we talked to the people who are experts in the field, \nand I think it is a common opinion that the majority of illegal aliens \nwho are illegally hired are hired by people who know it. They know it.\n  This portion of this bill is not going to solve that problem at all. \nSo, again, we narrow it down. We are doing an awful lot. We are doing \nall these things to correct only a portion of the problem.\n  Let me conclude by simply stating, again, this is a good bill. No one \nshould think that there are not tough provisions in this bill. If a \nbill like this had been brought to the Senate floor 2 years ago, 4 \nyears ago, 8 years ago, it probably would not have had any chance. I \nthink I heard my colleague from Wyoming say something very similar to \nthat.\n  It is a strong bill. It is a very strong bill without this what I \nconsider to be a horrible infringement on people's rights. What we \nintend to do, or try to do, with this amendment is to take out these \nsections, these sections that are going to impact 260 million, 270 \nmillion Americans and punish them to try to get at this problem. We do \nnot think it is going to work. We think it is going to be very \nintrusive, and we point out also that the bill, without these \nprovisions, is, in fact, a very, very strong bill, and it is a bill \nthat every Member in this Chamber can go home and be proud of and can \nsay, ``We have taken very tough measures to deal with illegal \nimmigration.''\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Abraham-Feingold \namendment. Let me not mince words. This amendment, in my view, is a \nbill killer, it is a bill gutter, it decimates the foundation of \nemployer sanctions. It will provide, if it passes, a bill that is \ngutless, toothless, aged, and will not work.\n  We must make employer sanctions work. And let me tell you why. The \nreason why is, take my State, California. We have 2 million people in \nCalifornia illegally. How do these people survive? They survive one of \ntwo ways--they either get on benefits through fraudulent documents or \nthey work. How do they work? With employer sanctions, an employer is \nnot supposed to give them jobs.\n  My opponents would have you believe that every employer wants to \nbreak the law, that every employer is going to hire people simply \nbecause they know them. I can tell you from the State that has the \nlargest number of illegal immigrants in the Nation--40 percent of \nthem--that is not the case.\n  Employer sanctions can only be effective if there is some method of \nverification. The Simpson-Kennedy language is a pilot to ask the INS to \nsee how we can verify information that employers receive. Let me show \nyou graphically why it is important that we do so. The birth \ncertificate, which Senator Simpson has pointed out correctly, is the \nmost counterfeited document in the United States. Let me show you why. \nLet me show you a few forms for birth certificates.\n  This is one from the State of Illinois. It is a fraudulent document \nthat has not been printed upon.\n  This is a second one from the State of Illinois. There are literally \ntens of thousands of different kinds of birth certificates in the \nUnited States. This is a form from somewhere in Texas.\n  So the birth certificate is easy. These papers are duplicated in the \nright color, that of Austin, TX, then they are put out wholesale. They \nare then laminated, as you see here. And no one can tell the \ndifference.\n  Same thing goes here. This is a forged copy of a record of marriage, \na marriage certificate.\n  This is another from Cook County, IL, a forged copy of a marriage \ncertificate.\n  This is another one, a forged copy of a marriage certificate.\n  This is a forged GED application. I mean, if I am interviewing \nsomeone and this application is filled out, and they say this is \ntestimony to the fact that they have gotten an equivalency degree in \nthis country--and, look, there is the official seal and here are my \ngrades on it--who am I to say it is not true? I would have no way of \nknowing.\n  Here is a forged divorce certificate. If this were handed to me as an \nemployer I would have no way of knowing.\n  Here is a trade school diploma that is forged. If this were handed to \nme, I would have no way of knowing.\n  Here is an achievement test certificate for high school from the \nState of Indiana. If this were handed to me as an employer, when I \nasked the question, ``are you qualified to work in this country?'' how \nwould I know? I would not.\n  Here is another forged divorce certificate. If this were handed to \nme, I would not know. Why would I not? Because the industry is very \nsophisticated.\n  Here are some of the preliminary forgeries, the basic paper from \nwhich these forgeries are done. How easily it is replicated.\n  Here is the back of a green card before it is finished. How easy it \nis replicated.\n  Let me show you what the final result is. This is a forged green \ncard. The names are blotted out. This is a real green card. Who can \ntell the difference? No one. These are the backs. Who can tell the \ndifference? No one.\n  This is a forged green card. Who can tell the difference?\n  This is forged--and look at them, look at the numbers. These are all \nperfect forgeries, every single one of these. These exist by the \nmillions. They are made in less than 20 minutes. And they cost anywhere \nfrom $25 to $150. Anyone can get them. How is an employer supposed to \nknow? You cannot know without some way of verifying the authenticity of \nthe document which is submitted to you.\n  What the Simpson-Kennedy test pilot does is ask INS to see what can \nbe done so that the documents can be verified by an employer. The bill \nnarrows the list of documents down to six. So at least some of the \nconfusion can be avoided there.\n  It is not fair to anybody to have a system that exists in a bogus \nform more frequently than it exists in a real form. How does a birth \ncertificate mean anything to anybody for any official purpose if it is \ncounterfeited by the tens of millions in this country? How does a green \ncard mean anything? How does a divorce certificate mean anything if it \nis counterfeited and you cannot verify it?\n  These are the real problems with which this bill attempts to deal. If \nthis amendment is successful, you might as well junk employer \nsanctions, you might as well say, ``We're going to permit people to \ncontinue to submit bogus documents.''\n  Remember, somebody here illegally has only two choices--one, they \nearn a living, secondly, they go on public support. Unless they have \nsomebody very well to do in this country who can take care of them--and \nI would submit to you that that is a remote possibility--those are the \nonly two chances. So the only way they can exist or stay--and right now \nit is very attractive to come to this country illegally because it is \nso easy to obtain these counterfeit documents.\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\n  That is the reality. That is why we have on the Southwest border \n5,000 people crossing every single day, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, because they can go to Alvarado \nStreet in Los Angeles, and they can purchase these documents on the \nstreet within 20 minutes. Our system of verification is nonexistent, \nand they know that. Therefore, if they submit a counterfeit document to \nan employer, the employer has little choice other than to accept it or \nask for more documents. Then if the employer asks for more documents, \nthe employer very often is sued.\n  So it is a very, very tenuous, real-life experience out there. This \nbill makes a very modest attempt--where in committee, it became a test \npilot. The language, which I think it was a Kennedy amendment, was \nalready a compromise. Many of us on the committee wanted an absolute \nverification system, put into affect right away. That did not pass in \ncommittee.\n  So the compromise was a pilot. Then the results of the pilot would be \nbrought back to Congress. Now we see an attempt to get rid of the \npilot. If you get rid of a pilot, what is left? What is left is that we \nmake ourselves into hypocrites, in my opinion, because we create a \nsystem that cannot function.\n  What we are seeing today is an employer verification method that does \nnot function. It does not function because you cannot verify fraudulent \ndocuments, and because fraudulent documents abound.\n  I must say that I think it is very possible to verify. We live in an \ninformation age. Hundreds of data bases now exist in both public and \nprivate sectors, data bases for national credit cards, for health \ninsurance companies, credit rating bureaus. Technology is, in fact, \nadvancing so rapidly that the ability to create these data bases and \nensure their accuracy is enhanced dramatically every year.\n  Why, then, does the Senate of the United States not want the U.S. \nGovernment to use a computer data base to try to find a better way to \nhelp employers verify worker eligibility? I really believe that many of \nthe issues raised by opponents to this provision--that it is \nbureaucratic, that it is prone to errors, that it is unworkable, that \nit is too intrusive--are simply unfounded.\n  In fact, the provision was specifically written, as I understand, to \nalleviate such concerns, by defining clear limits on the use of the \nsystem, establishing strict penalties for the misuse of information, \nand requiring congressional approval before any national system goes \ninto effect. What are the authors of this amendment so afraid of? Any \nnational pilot system would come back to this body for approval prior \nto its being put in place.\n  The legislation also imposes some limits. It limits the use of \ndocuments. Documents must be resistant to counterfeiting and tampering. \nThe system will not require a national identification card for any \nreason other than the verification of eligibility for employment or \nreceipt of public benefits. There is no one card. Those who use, I \nthink, as a ruse to defeat this pilot project, I hear out there, \n``Well, Senator Feinstein, you are calling for a national ID. That \nviolates all our civil rights.'' To that I have to say, ``There is no \nnational ID anywhere in the legislation before this body''. None. It is \na red herring. It is a guise. It is a dupe. It is a ruse, simply to \nstrike a mortal blow at the system.\n  I have a very hard time because California is so impacted by illegal \nimmigration. For 3 years we have said we must enforce our border, we \nmust improve customs, we must be able to really put a lid on the \nnumbers because the numbers are so large. I have come to the conclusion \nthat within the scope of possible immigration legislation, we are stuck \nwith an existing system. That existing system is employer sanctions. \nTherefore, why not try to make them work? The already compromised \nverification system--just a pilot, which allows the INS to work it out, \nand bring it back to this body and let us say yea or nay to it--is \nsimply a modest attempt to get some meaning into this legislation.\n  Let me say what I honest to God believe is the truth. If we cannot \neffect sound, just and moderate controls, the people of America will \nrise to stop all immigration. I am as sure of that as I am that I am \nstanding here now, because where the grievances exist, they exist in \nlarge number. Where the fraud exists, it exists in large numbers. Where \nit exists, wholesale industries develop around it. It is \nextraordinarily important, in my opinion, that this amendment be \ndefeated.\n  Let me talk for a moment about discrimination because I just met with \na group of California legislators who wanted to know how this works. \nOne of the big areas they raised was discrimination. As I understand \nthe system, it must have safeguards to prevent discrimination in \nemployment or public assistance. The way it would do that is through a \nselective use of the system or a refusal of employment opportunities or \nassistance because of a perceived likelihood that additional \nverification will be needed. The legislation contains civil and \ncriminal remedies for unlawful disclosure of information. Disclosure of \ninformation for any reasons not authorized in the bill will be a \nmisdemeanor with a fine of not more than $5,000. Unauthorized \ndisclosure of information is grounds for civil action. The legislation \nalso contains employer safeguards, that employers shall not be guilty \nof employing an unauthorized alien if the employer followed the \nprocedures required by the system and the alien was verified by the \nsystem as eligible for employment.\n  In my view, the Simpson-Kennedy test pilot makes sense. I have a very \nhard time understanding why anyone would oppose it because it is the \nonly way we can make employer sanctions work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the case for ensuring that birth \ncertificates are going to be printed on paper to reduce the possibility \nof counterfeit has been made here. I want to speak to that issue \nbecause it has been addressed by some saying this is ultimately the \nresponsibility of the State, and the Federal Government does not really \nhave any role in this area.\n  Mr. President, sometime we will have to decide whether States will \nhave their own independent immigration policies or whether we will have \na national immigration policy. It really gets down to that. I have my \ndifferences with some of the provisions in this bill. One that I think \nthe case has been made, and I know it will be made again in just a few \nmoments by the Senator from Wyoming, is that if we do not deal in an \nimportant way with ensuring that we will have birth certificates which \nare going to be, effectively, even printed on paper that cannot be \nduplicated and other safeguards, really, this whole effort ought to be \nunderstood for what it is.\n  That is, basically, a sham. It will be a sham not only with regard to \nimmigration, but it will be a sham on all of the programs that we \ntalked about yesterday in terms of the public programs because \nindividuals will be going out and getting the birth certificates and \ngetting citizen documents to prove they are American citizens and then \ndrawing down on the public programs.\n  We spent hours yesterday saying which programs we are going to \npermit, even for illegals to be able to benefit from, or which ones we \nwill be able to permit legals to be eligible for, and we went through \nthe whole process of deeming. If you go out there and are able to get \nthe birth certificates and falsify those, you will be able to \ndemonstrate you are a senior citizen and you will be able to draw down \non all of those programs. This reaches the heart of the whole question \nof illegal immigrants. It reaches the whole question of protecting \nAmerican workers. It reaches the whole issue of protecting employers. \nIt reaches the issue about protecting the American taxpayers.\n  Let me give a few examples of what we are looking at across the \ncountry. Some States have open birth record laws. In these States, \nanyone who can identify a birth record can get a copy of it. The birth \ncertificates are treated as public property. In some States--for \nexample, in the State of Ohio, you can walk into the registry of vital \nstatistics in Ohio, an open record State, and ask for, in this \ninstance, Senator DeWine's birth certificate. The registry would have \nto give it to me, no questions asked. I could walk into the registry in \nWisconsin and get Senator Feingold's birth certificate just as easily. \nSome States even let you have a copy through the mail. Once I have a\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\ncopy of one of their birth certificates, I could take it, for example, \ndown to the Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles and get an Ohio driver's \nlicense with Senator DeWine's birth date and address, but my picture \ninstead of his. I now have two employer identification documents to \nestablish an eligibility to work in the United States and also to be \nable to be eligible for public programs.\n\n  Mr. President, with all that we are doing in terms of tamperproof \nprograms, and all that we are doing in terms of setting up additional \nagencies and investigators and protections for American workers, and \nall of the resources that we are providing down at the border, when you \nrecognize that half of the people that will be coming in and will be \nillegals came here legally, and they will have an opportunity to take \nadvantage of these kinds of gaping holes in our system, then the rest \nof the bill--with all due respect, we can put hundreds of thousands of \nguards down on the border, but if they are able to come in, as half of \nthem do, on various visas and be able to run through that process that \nanybody can achieve in a day or day and a half and circumvent all of \nthat, then I must say, Mr. President, we are not really being serious \nabout this issue.\n  We can all say, well, our local--I know the arguments and I have \nheard the arguments. There is a lot of truth in much of what is said in \nthe arguments. But we have to, at some time--and I hope it is now--\nrecognize that we are going to have to at least set certain kinds of \nstandards and let the States do whatever they want to do within those \nstandards. They have to print it on paper that is as resistantproof to \ntampering as we can scientifically make it. They can set this up, and \nthey can do it whatever way they want to do it. But there are minimum \nkinds of standards to try to reach the basic integrity of the birth \ncertificates that are going to be necessary. That has been pointed out. \nThat is the breeder document. That is where all of this really starts. \nIt is easily circumvented. We can build all the other kinds of houses \nof cards on top of trying to do something about illegal aliens, and \nunless we are going to reach down and deal with this basic document, we \nare really not fulfilling, I think, our responsibility to the American \npeople with a bill that is really worthy of its name, because we are \nleaving these gaping holes.\n  I could go into other things, but I will not take the time because \nothers want to speak. I will go through other kinds of illustrations \nthat are taking place today. We know what the problem is. You have, as \nSenator DeWine said, the fraudulent documents that are all being \nduplicated fraudulently down at the border when we might be able to do \nsomething about tamperproof elements. But unless we are going to deal \nwith the breeder document, which is the birth certificate, we are \nreally not going to be able to get a handle not only on illegal \nimmigration, but also on protecting the taxpayers, because people will \nbe able to use the birth certificate to demonstrate that they are a \ncitizen and then draw down on the various programs. That, I think, \nreally makes a sham of a great deal of what is being attempted at this \ntime.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Abraham-Feingold amendment to strike the worker \nverification proposal from this bill.\n  It has been said many times already in the past, and today on the \nfloor, that we cannot effectively combat illegal immigration without \nhaving a national worker verification proposal. It has been said that \nthe employer sanction laws implemented in the 1986 act have been \nlargely ineffective due to the absence of such a verification system.\n  As we all know, Mr. President, there are two major channels of \nillegal immigration. The first is composed of those who cross our \nborders illegally, without visas and without inspection. Roughly \n300,000 such individuals enter and remain in our country unlawfully \neach year.\n  This, as we all know and agree, is unquestionably a serious problem \nalong our southwestern border. This Congress does have a responsibility \nto provide additional resources to the U.S. Border Patrol and other \nenforcement agencies to prevent such individuals from crossing the \nborder in the first place. So I strongly support the provisions in S. \n1664 that provide additional border guards and enforcement personnel.\n  Mr. President, the second part of the equation, though, which \nrepresents up to one-half of the illegal immigration problem, is the \nproblem known as visa overstayers. These are people who enter our \ncountry legally, usually on a tourist or student visa, and then remain \nin the United States unlawfully only after the visa has expired.\n  But despite this phenomenon, representing up to 50 percent--50 \npercent--of our illegal immigration problem, there was not a single \nprovision in the original committee legislation to address this \nproblem--not a single word about half of the whole illegal immigration \nproblem.\n  Instead, the bill supporters proposed a massive, new national worker \nverification system, complete with uniform Federal identification \ndocuments. So, rather than targeting the individuals who break our laws \nand are here illegally, the premise of that proposal was to ensure that \nthe identity of every worker in America--U.S. citizens, legal permanent \nresidents, and so on--had to be verified by a Government agency in \nWashington, DC.\n  Mr. President, we are going to hear extensive debate about whether or \nnot what is in this bill is actually going to work, and I will comment \non that in a few minutes. But I think we first need to ask the question \nof whether this, in any way, is an appropriate response to the illegal \nimmigration problem.\n  According to INS figures, less than 2 percent of the U.S. population \nis here illegally. Mr. President, do we really want to require 98 \npercent of Americans to have their identities verified by the Federal \nGovernment every time they apply for a job or public assistance?\n  Think about what this means to every employer in this country, Mr. \nPresident. Every employer would have to live under such a system if it \nwas fully implemented. Suppose a dairy farmer in rural Wisconsin, or \nperhaps rural New Hampshire, wants to hire a part-time employee. Should \nthat farmer have to get permission from a Washington bureaucrat before \nhe hires the worker? How is the verification check to be completed? If \nit ends up being an electronic system, does that mean the farmer is \ngoing to have to spend $2,000 or $3,000 on a new computer and another \n$1,000 on the required software to be able to interface with a computer \nsomewhere in Washington, DC--all so he can hire just one part-time \nemployee on his farm in Wisconsin or New Hampshire?\n  Mr. President, if fully implemented, this, obviously, is not a \nmeasured response to the illegal immigration problem. It suggests that \nthe way to find a needle in a haystack is to set the haystack on fire.\n  It is not as if we are moving to a national verification system as a \nlast resort. Just in the past few years has the administration begun to \ntake seriously the task of patrolling our Nation's borders. Experiments \nsuch as Operation Hold the Line in El Paso, and Operation Gatekeeper in \nSan Diego, have demonstrated that there is a way to prevent \nundocumented persons from entering the United States.\n\n  Moreover, we have never tried to attack the visa overstayer problem. \nAgain, that is the problem that constitutes nearly one-half of the \nillegal problem. No one has ever proposed such targeted reforms--until \nnow.\n  Our amendment contains provisions that impose tough new penalties on \npersons who overstay their visas by withholding future visas from \npersons who violate the terms of their agreements.\n  In addition, anybody who applies for a legal visa must submit certain \ninformation to the INS that will allow the INS to track such persons \nand determine who is here lawfully and who is here unlawfully.\n  These bold reforms should be given an opportunity to work. Let us \ngive them a try before we commit ourselves to experimenting with a \ncostly and burdensome national verification system.\n  Moreover, Mr. President--and, of course, I acknowledge that during \nthe committee's work, this was turned into\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\nmore of a pilot program approach. Nonetheless, the so-called pilot \nprograms contained in this legislation are riddled with problems. Let \nus be honest. We would not be having these so-called pilot programs if \nthe eventual goal was not to have a national verification system up and \nrunning in the near future. Why would we do them if that was not the \nultimate objective? Indeed, in addition to the pilot programs, this \nbill, as reported out of the Judiciary Committee, requires the \nPresident to develop just such a plan for a national system and submit \nit to Congress.\n  We also know there are going to be numerous errors in the system. As \nthe Senator from Michigan has pointed out, one Federal data base that \nis to be used with this system currently has an error rate of over 20 \npercent.\n  So we know that millions and millions of Americans will be wrongfully \ndenied employment and Government assistance due to bureaucratic errors.\n  Now the sponsors of the provision will tell you that the system is \nonly supposed to have an error rate of 1 percent. But read the bill. \nThe bill clearly states that the system should have an objective of an \nerror rate of less than 1 percent. It could have an error rate of 5, \n10, or 20 percent and it would be perfectly OK under this bill.\n  But perhaps nothing is as troubling to me about this proposal as the \nfact that it puts us squarely on the road to having some sort of \nnational ID card.\n  Now I know that the very words ``ID card'' ruffles the feathers of \nthe sponsors of this provision. And I know that they have crafted this \nlanguage very carefully so there is not an actual identification \ndocument created by this language.\n  But even many of the congressional supporters of a national \nverification system have pointed out that this proposal will not work \nwithout some sort of national identification document. Why? Because any \njob applicant can hand an employer a legitimate ID card that has, for \nexample, been stolen or doctored.\n  The employer will run the card through the system and it will check \nout. But the card does not belong to the individual, so that individual \nhas just fraudulently obtained a job or received welfare assistance.\n  That is exactly what is likely to happen if this bill becomes law.\n  Well, Mr. President, is there any way to prevent this sort of fraud \nfrom happening? One solution has been suggested. Let me quote Frank \nRicchiazzi who is the assistant director of the California department \nof motor vehicles.\n  In testimony before the Judiciary Committee last May, Mr. Ricchiazzi \nsaid the following:\n\n       All the databases and communication systems in the world \n     fill not prevent the clever and resourceful individual from \n     assuming multiple identities with quality fraudulent \n     documents. What is needed is the ability to tie the documents \n     back to a unique physiological identifier commonly referred \n     to as biometric technology (retinal scan, fingerprint, hand \n     print, voice print, etc).\n\n  So fingerprinting every person in America is one suggested solution \nto this problem.\n  Now this approach may sound a little farfetched, but my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle may be surprised that the original committee \nbill required every birth certificate and driver's license in America \nto be adorned with a fingerprint.\n  This is not totally far-fetched. It is what we had to consider in the \nfirst place in committee.\n  And it is my understanding that even with the last-minute changes \nmade yesterday to the birth certificate requirements, the bill \ncontinues to allow Federal agencies to preempt the authority of the \nStates by requiring State agencies to follow federally mandated \nregulations with respect to the composition and issuance of their birth \ncertificates and drivers license.\n  The bill's supporters claim that the fingerprint requirements have \nbeen removed from the legislation. But again, read the bill. The \nlegislation before us allows the administration to determine what sort \nof safety and tamper-proof features every State's driver's licenses \nmust have.\n  We are going to put something in this Congress to say you cannot use \nit for something else.\n  So if the Department of Transportation decides to require the State \nof Wisconsin to begin collecting and processing fingerprints of all \ndriver's license applicants, the State of Wisconsin would be forced to \ncomply under this legislation with the national fingerprint mandate.\n  That is why this provision, even with the recent modifications, \ncontinues to be opposed by the National Association of Counties and the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures.\n  The bill's supporters will also say that the legislation clearly \nprohibits any identification documents required for the verification \nsystem to also be required for other purposes.\n  Mr. President, that is not much of a guarantee. In fact, it is no \nguarantee and on the contrary, by establishing such federally mandated \nidentification documents we open the door for these documents and the \nverification system to be used in the future for a variety of purposes \nthat could be completely different from what we intended, and something \nthat none of us would support.\n  At first, Mr. President, Members of Congress may propose that people \npresent these documents and go through the verification process for \nvery legitimate purposes. Maybe they will say, ``Well, we have to use \nthese ID's or documents to board an airplane; maybe we will be required \nto use them to adopt a child; maybe it will be required if you want to \nenlist in the Armed Forces.''\n  And pretty soon, the verification process and identification \ndocuments will be required for so many purposes that it just might be a \ngood idea to carry the I.D. document around in your wallet.\n  Does that sound farfetched Mr. President? It should not, because I \njust described the Social Security card--a card that was originally \nintended for one purpose and is now required for so many purposes that \nmost people carry it around in their wallets or pocketbooks. And Social \nSecurity numbers are used for numerous identification purposes from the \nnumber on your driver's license to assessing computer networks.\n  I know, Mr. President, that the Senator from Wyoming will claim that \nthe bill specifically prohibits the verification system from being used \nfor other purposes.\n  But nothing in this legislation, including the so-called privacy \nprotections, can prevent a future Congress from passing a law to \nrequire these identification documents and the verification system to \nserve different purposes than originally intended.\n  That is precisely why Senators should not be misled into believing \nthat the pilot projects contained in this legislation are harmless and \nwill have no effect on their constituents.\n  The pilot programs are not intended to merely provide a testing \nground. If the pilot programs are just meant to provide us with test \nresults, why does the bill specifically require the President to \ndevelop and submit to Congress a plan for expanding the pilot projects \ninto a nationwide worker verification system?\n  That is the goal of the verification proposal contained in the \nlegislation and Senators should not be misled into believing that these \nare harmless pilot programs that are not going to affect their \nconstituents and are going to somehow magically disappear in a few \nyears.\n  Mr. President, the number and range of groups and organizations \nsupporting the Abraham-Feingold amendment is quite astounding. It is a \ncoalition of the left, represented by the ACLU, the National Council of \nLa Raza and the American Jewish Committee, and the right, represented \nby the NFIB, the National Restaurant Association and the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, as well as some 30 other national organizations \nrepresenting business, labor, ethnic and religious organizations which \nall support the Abraham-Feingold amendment.\n  Why do they do this? Because they know it is critical that we abandon \nthis rather heavyhanded, costly approach to combating illegal \nimmigration and instead focus on true reform that focuses on the \nindividuals who break the law, and not those who abide by them.\n  So I very much commend my friends from Michigan and Ohio, and others, \nin their efforts in fighting this intrusive proposal.\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a listing of the organizations \nsupporting the Abraham-Feingold amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Organizations Supporting Abraham-Feingold\n\n       National Federation of Independent Business.\n       National Council of La Raza.\n       National Restaurant Association.\n       American Civil Liberties Union.\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       American Bar Association.\n       Americans For Tax Reform.\n       United States Catholic Conference.\n       Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       National Retail Federation.\n       American Jewish Committee.\n       Associated Builders and Contractors.\n       Associated General Contractors.\n       National Asian-Pacific American Legal Consortium.\n       Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       International Mass Retail Association.\n       Cato Institute.\n       Service Employees International Union.\n       Asian-Pacific American Labor Alliance.\n       National Association of Beverage Retailers.\n       UNITE (Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile \n     Employees).\n       National Association of Convenience Stores.\n       League of United Latin-American Citizens.\n       Food Marketing Institute.\n       Hispanic National Bar Association.\n       Food Distributors International.\n       The College and University Personnel Association.\n       American Hotel and Motel Association.\n       International Association of Amusement Parks and \n     Attractions.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment.\n  Let me differ with my friend from Wisconsin who is one of the finest \nMembers of this body. It was a great day for the Senate when Russ \nFeingold was elected to serve here.\n  When he says this amendment increases penalties for those who come in \nlegally and overstay, this amendment does nothing of the sort. This \namendment does one thing and one thing only, and that is to weaken \nenforcement of illegal immigration.\n  What the bill does--not this amendment--on those who overstay \nlegally, anyone who overstays more than 60 days cannot apply for coming \nback in again legally for 3 or 5 years. We hire more investigators. You \nhave to apply for a visa to the original consular office where you made \nthe original application.\n  Three things I do not think anyone can question. No. 1 is the thing \nthat Senator Simpson has stressed over and over again, and that is the \nattraction for illegal immigration is the magnet of a job. I do not \nthink anyone seriously questions that. No. 2 is that we have massive \nfraud that assists people who are here illegally. I do not think anyone \nquestions that. No. 3 is the GAO report shows that we have a serious \nproblem with discrimination particularly against Hispanics and Asian-\nAmericans or people who speak with an accent, maybe a Polish accent or \nwhatever the accent might be because there is a reluctance on the part \nof employers to hire them.\n  Unless we have some method of a voluntary identification, that \ndiscrimination is going to continue. So, in line with the \nrecommendations of the Jordan Commission, pilot programs have been \nsuggested. No pilot program can be followed through by a Clinton \nadministration or a Dole administration or anyone else without \ncongressional action. So there is that safeguard here.\n  I think this is essential. If this amendment is adopted, frankly, you \njust defang the whole bill. It is a toothless venture. You are trying \nto eat steak without teeth. I hope to never try that. I hope the \nPresiding Officer never has to try that. You have to have teeth in this \nif we are going to do anything about illegal immigration.\n  There are provisions in this bill that I do not like. I was defeated \nlast night on an amendment, and I am probably going to be defeated \ntoday on a couple of amendments that I think make a great deal of \nsense. I think in some ways the bill is too harsh. But it is essential \nthat we take a look at this.\n  Let me just add--and I know you should not make appeals on the basis \nof personalities--this whole issue of immigration is one of these \ncyclical things. Right now there is a lot of interest, but for a while \nthere was very little interest. There were just three of us who served \non that subcommittee, the smallest subcommittee in the Senate, because \nthere was not that much interest--Alan Simpson, Ted Kennedy, and Paul \nSimon. I was the very junior member both in terms of service and in \nterms of knowledge.\n\n  I say to my colleagues who may be listening or their staffs who may \nbe listening, whenever Alan Simpson and Ted Kennedy say this is a bad \namendment in the field of immigration, I think you ought to listen \nvery, very carefully. They know this area. Complicated as it is, they \nknow this area well. We have a problem with illegal immigration, and \nyou cannot deal with this problem unless you deal with the magnet that \nemployers have, the area of fraud, and I also think the area of \ndiscrimination. There is no way of solving this without having some \npilot programs.\n  We could launch something without having a pilot program. I think \nthat would be unwise. It seems to me this is a prudent approach that \nreally makes sense, and with all due respect to my friend from \nMichigan, I think this amendment should be defeated.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I think we have had an interesting debate. We probably \nwill have a little bit more. There is no time agreement here. But there \nare some serious distortions presented to us, and that is always vexing \nbecause obviously persons are listening to those distortions and taking \nthem to heart.\n  I have been in this business for 17 years, and that is not to say it \nhas been a joyful experience, but it was much more a pleasure when \nSenator Paul Simon joined this ragged subcommittee consisting of \nSenator Ted Kennedy and myself because no one else would take on the \nissue. So for several years it was just a little three-member \nsubcommittee--Senator Kennedy, myself, and Senator Simon--because \nothers would come up to us in the course of the entire year of work \nsaying, ``When you get busy on doing something about illegal \nimmigration, you let me know and I will help you.''\n  Unfortunately, nobody does help because there are so many cross-\ncurrents. I have never seen more--I am not talking about the Senate. I \nam talking about outside the Senate. I have seen groups hop into the \nsack with other groups they would not even talk to 10 years ago. I have \nseen some of the most egregious pandering and prostituting of ideals \noutside this beltway that I have ever seen, people who are cynical, \ncynical in the extreme with what they are doing on this issue, some \nof the think tanks cynical to the extreme. I am not, please hear me, \ntalking about a single person in this arena. I have the deepest respect \nfor Senator Spencer Abraham. I helped campaign for him in Michigan and \nwould do it again in an instant. I have high regard for Senator Michael \nDeWine. I helped campaign for him in Ohio, and I would do it instantly. \nSenator Feingold I have come to know, a spirited legislator of the old \nschool--doing your homework. So that is not the issue.\n\n  But you are missing everything we are trying to do. Somebody is \nmissing the entire thing, and Senator Simon has expressed it \nbeautifully: You cannot do the things that are in this bill unless you \nhave at least an attempt to find out what verification systems we will \nuse in the United States.\n  The present stature of the bill simply says that we will have \nverification projects or processes of these following options. If I had \nmy way, I would make them requirements, and I would say it is required \nthat these following pilot projects take place in the next years. That \nis what we should be doing. Then none of them go into effect, or not \none of them goes into effect, until we have another vote.\n  That is what is in this bill. There is nothing in here that has to do \nwith national ID or all the sinister activity that you can ever \ndiscuss--Americans on the slippery slope, a tragedy of employers having \nto seek permission to hire people. They already do. It is almost as if \none were speaking into a vacuum.\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\n  I know what it is. It comes from the fact when you are in it this \nlong, you understand the nuances. That is not a cocky statement, I can \nassure you. But, boy, I tell you, when I first started the business, I \nwould say, ``You can't do that.'' Then 2 years later I said, ``You have \nto do that.''\n  That is where this one is. When I am up at Harvard teaching, I shall \nthink of you all, and I will reflect. In a year or two--and I hope you \nare all here for many years--you are going to say, ``I didn't know \nthat's what we did,'' because if this amendment passes, you will have \ntaken away everything from this bill. The rest of it, as Senator Paul \nSimon says, is like eating steak without teeth. You cannot do it with \nwhat you have put in this bill. If you think you have solved the \nproblems of illegal immigration by the Border Patrol--put 20,000 of \nthem down there--if you think you are going to solve it by this or that \nand all the things that are in this bill, forget it, because over half \nthe people come here legally. You will not even touch them unless, ah, \nwith the new Border Patrol we will give them the power to now go up and \nask visa overstayers if they are visa overstayers. How is that one for \ndiscrimination in America? You are going to go up to people who look \nforeign under this provision, when we have nothing else that gives us \nany power or authority to do anything, and find out whether people are \nvisa overstayers. I assume they will most likely be people who look \nforeign. So, remember, that one will take place.\n\n  It is a curious thing that the people and the institutions who want \nto do the most to hammer illegal, undocumented persons will give us the \nleast hammer. I do not understand that and I would like to have that \nexplained to me in the course of the debate. How you can come to \nsubcommittee and full committee and the floor and add layer upon layer \nof things which have to do with tightening the screws on illegal, \nundocumented people--and that is what you have done, and that may \nassuage all guilt, it may take care of all pain--but, then to take \nevery bit, every tiny crumb left of how to do something about illegal \nundocumented persons in the United States, and that is to allow some \nkind, some kind of more counterfeit-resistant, more verifiable, \nidentifiable--whether it is through the phone system with a slide-\nthrough or some kind of revised Social Security card or something--and \nthen to go home and tell our people that, here in the United States of \nAmerica, we finally did something about illegal immigration? And a year \nfrom now or 2 years from now you find out you could not get it done \nbecause you did not take the final step, which was minuscule, and that \nwas to do something about the breeder document that Senator Feinstein \ndescribed so powerfully--you did not do anything with that document, \ndid not do a thing with it.\n  You did not do a thing with the most stupefying thing that happens in \nAmerica, where you look at the obituary list, and if you are between 20 \nand 40 years old you really look at that. You find out who died and \nthen you go get their birth certificate--and between the years of 20 \nand 30 and 40, that is when most of this happens--and then off they go \nwith the new birth certificate and into the stream they go, into the \nstream they go with a Social Security card, and into the stream with a \ndriver's license, and into the stream of the public support system.\n  We are talking about the cost of a system to set that up? The cost to \nAmerica, by what is happening to the welfare systems, the cost of what \nis happening to America with the hemorrhaging of California and \nIllinois and Florida, hemorrhaging--absolutely hemorrhaging, and we are \nnot going to do anything about it? We are going to talk about the cost \nof a system? If this system costs $10 billion, it would be worth it, \nbecause we are losing $20, $30, $40 billion, with people who gimmick \nthe housing programs, gimmick the welfare program, gimmick the \nemployers. That is where we are. It is absolutely startling to me that \nthose who want to do the most will allow us to do the least.\n  Let me just address a couple of old canards that just have to be \naddressed. In this league you are supposed to be as patient as you can. \nBut I am always reminded of that great phrase in Rudyard Kipling's \n``If.'' Read it. You want to read ``If.'' Read it every 5 years of your \nlife because it will change.\n\n     If you can keep your head when all about you\n     Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\n     If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n     But make allowance for their doubting too;\n     If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n     Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,\n     Or being hated, don't give way to hating,\n     And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     If you can fill the unforgiving minute\n     With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,\n     Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,\n     And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son.\n\n  But there is one part in it that is marvelous. It says:\n\n     If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken\n     Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\n\n  And that is what I have seen outside, in this beltway, ``twisted by \nknaves to make a trap for fools.'' I am not referring to a single \nperson in this Chamber. I am referring to people who I know out there. \nI know the groups. I know them well. I have seen them in action.\n  So, let us look at the stuff that has floated through here with \nregard to the national ID card. In an April 11 ``Dear Colleague'' \nletter you were all told that:\n\n       Americans should not have to receive permission from the \n     Federal Government to work and support their families, nor \n     should U.S. employers need permission from the Federal \n     Government to hire their fellow citizens. But ill-conceived \n     measures in the illegal immigration bill to be taken up on \n     the Senate floor during the week of April 15 will do just \n     that.\n\n  And we have heard similar claims here on the floor today. I do not \nknow whether this outrageous statement reflects willful distortion or \nsomething more bizarre, because, first, it is already unlawful under \nsection 274(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1324(a) \nfor any person or entity to knowingly employ illegal aliens, or to hire \nwithout complying with the requirements of an ``employment verification \nsystem.'' That is the law. And that is described in that section.\n  Most important, neither current law nor the proposals in S. 1664 \nrequire citizens or lawful permanent residents to obtain any form of \npermission from the Federal Government to work: None. Nor is there any \nrequirement that U.S. employers obtain ``permission'' to employ such \npersons. In the present context, the word permission connotes a form of \nconsent that can be withheld, at least partly on the basis of \ndiscretion.\n\n  In fact, there is not, under current law, and there would not be \nunder any pilot project authorized under the bill or any system \nactually implemented in accordance with the provisions of this bill, \nafter the required implementing legislation, that would give any legal \nauthority to withhold verification except on the basis that an \nindividual is not a citizen, lawful, permanent resident, or alien \nauthorized to work.\n  Indeed, the bill includes as an explicit prohibition, a requirement \nthat verification may not be withheld except on that basis. That was to \nprotect the employer. We did not do that for any other reason but to \nprotect the employer.\n  In that same letter you were informed that the verification \nprovisions of the bill are ``more than merely a pilot program. It is a \nnew system that can cover the entire United States and last for up to 7 \nyears at the discretion of the President.''\n  In fact--fact, section 112 of the bill authorized the President to \nconduct ``several local or regional demonstration projects.'' Are you \ngoing to let California just sink? Are you going to let California just \nsink and float off into the ocean? That is what you are doing if you do \nnot allow them at least to do something; a pilot program. What about \nTexas? Are you just going to let it sink? What about Illinois? What \nabout Florida? You cannot get there.\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\n  So we provided several local or regional demonstration projects. That \nthis does not authorize at all what the authors of this letter assert, \nit will be made ever clearer as we finish up our work on this bill.\n  I had an amendment. We will see what happens with that. The word \n``regional'' will be defined as an area more than an entire State, or \nvarious configurations. That would make it clear that the system \ncovering nearly the United States of America, the entire Nation, would \nnot be authorized. No one ever intended that. But the letter also \nasserts that the bill ``does not replace the I-9 form but is added on \ntop of the existing system.''\n  The bill does not say that. The bill provides that if the Attorney \nGeneral determines that a pilot project satisfies accuracy and other \ncriteria, then requirements of the pilot project will take the place of \nthe requirements of current law, including the I-9 form.\n  Furthermore, those are things that seem to escape us. We are trying \nto assure that employers will not have to comply with the requirements \nof both current law and pilot projects, pilot projects where their \nparticipation is mandatory. In addition, this same letter states, \n``Error rates are a serious problem.'' The letter refers to an estimate \nby the Social Security Administration that in 20 percent of the cases \nhandled, it will not be able to identify an individual's employment \neligibility ``on the first attempt.''\n  Hear that, ``the first attempt.'' I am not familiar with the details \nof the estimate, but there are three responses that come to mind \nimmediately.\n  First, in the INS' pilot project, if verification is not obtained \nelectronically and the very first time, an additional, nearly \ninstantaneous, electronic attempt is made--instantaneous--using \nalternative databases or names. In the vast majority of cases, \nverification of persons actually authorized to work is obtained in a \nvery few seconds.\n  Obviously, the whole point is to not verify certain individuals. \nIllegal aliens will not be verified. A handful of cases then require a \nvisit to an INS office. To our knowledge, every one of those cases was \nresolved without significant delay, and remember that this is a pilot \nproject and not a fully developed system.\n  Second, if there is something wrong with the data base of the Social \nSecurity Administration, it should be fixed, but we will not have to \nworry about that because we do not deal with that issue either. We \ncannot do anything with the Social Security card, to make it as secure \nas the new $100 bill. We cannot seem to do that, and it will not bother \nus because we are already told that Social Security will be broke in \nthe year 2029 and will begin to go broke in the year 2012. But we do \nnot deal with that one at all. That one will be one for all of you to \ndeal with.\n\n  Third, the whole point of the pilot project is to develop a workable \nsystem, I say to my colleagues. We are not trying to do a number on our \nfellow Americans. We do not have a workable system right now, and you \nhelped correct some of that yesterday, and I appreciate that. Well \ndone. You protected the employer from a heavy fine or penalty just by \nasking for another document. That was good work; I think good work.\n  We do not have a workable system. We do not know all the problems on \nthe surface as these projects are conducted, but if the development \nprocess is not begun, if something as milk soup in consistency as the \npresent part of the bill, which is the Kennedy-Simpson verification \nprocess, which is all optional, if we cannot even start that, we will \nnever have a workable system, at least in the years to come.\n  The letter also states that, ``Employers who break the rules will \ncontinue breaking the rules while legitimate business owners must \nconfront new levels of bureaucracy.''\n  Most employers try to comply with the current law. They work hard to \ndo that. They work hard not to hire illegal aliens. However, the \ncurrent verification system, with which they are required to comply, is \nnot reliable because of fraudulent documents.\n  I am going to show it one more time. There is no such thing in our \nline of work as repetition. There it is. Anybody can get one and when \nyou get one, you can begin to do things that to the Cato Institute \nwould be repugnant, because when you get one of these, you can go down \nand get welfare. You can get welfare, you can access other programs, \nyou can do this and you can even vote in some jurisdictions with that \nkind of a card.\n  What are you going to do about that? Well, we have something in there \nabout that, about forgery and about this and about that. We handle \nthat. You will not handle it until you go to a pilot program to figure \nout what you are going to do with this kind of gimmickry, and then \nevery time I read a report or paper from some of these opinion-filled \nbrilliants off campus here, I am always stunned by the fact that they \nsay what are we going to do, what are we going to do about people who \nabuse the welfare system, what are we going to do about people who come \nhere pregnant and have a child in the United States of America and then \ngive birth to a U.S. citizen? What are we going to do about people who \ndenied a mother or father the opportunity to receive a welfare benefit \nbecause the county and the State had expended it all? It is all gone, \nmillions are gone down the rat hole because of fake documents.\n\n  So what you have here without reliable documents is you have hundreds \nof thousands of illegal aliens employed by such employer. Employers can \nbe punished if they fail to employ someone because they suspect a \nperson is illegal if such person has documents that ``reasonably appear \non their face to be genuine.'' At least we protected the employer a bit \nyesterday. Right now employers can be fined by simply asking for \nanother form of document.\n  Now the letter asserts, finally, ``The system will lead to a national \nID card. A number of congressional advocates of this system have \nadmitted that the system will not work without a biometrically encoded \nidentification card.'' I am quoting. ``Establishing this far-reaching \nprogram sets us on a dangerous path toward identity papers and other \nobjectionable elements incompatible with a free society.''\n  I also saw an article during the days of this issue coming before the \nAmerican public where it was even suggested that we were looking into \nthe examination of bodily fluids. There is a debate and there is a \nthing of give and take and there is a thing such as honesty, but bodily \nfluids was never anything ever mentioned by any ``congressional \nadvocate'' that I have ever met.\n  This is an especially blatant--blatant--example of the misleading \nnature of so many of the statements in these letters.\n  First, the assertion that there is a national ID card, but then the \nstatement about congressional advocates does not refer to a national ID \ncard, and I am one of those trained ``congressional advocates'' who has \nopposed national ID cards for all of the 17 years I have been involved \nin this issue, period.\n  I put it in every bill. Anybody who can read and write has found it \nin there and ignored it. I am tired of that one. You do not have to \ntake all the guff in this place, and that is not a personal reference. \nI have heard that one, too. I am talking about lying.\n  I have put in every bill I ever did that this would not be a national \nID card, and that it would be used only at the time of new hire, and it \nwould be only presented at that time or at the time of receiving \nwelfare benefits, that it would not be carried on the person, that it \nwould not be used for law enforcement. That is in every single bill I \nhave ever done, period.\n\n  The card that I believe is probably necessary is the one already used \nfor ID purposes by most Americans, and especially in California, the \nState that takes all the lumps while we give all the advice. That is \nthe driver's license or some kind of a State-issued identification \ncard. But, ladies and gentlemen, what do you think this is? This is a \nState-issued identification card. That is what this is. That is why I \nfavor the bill's required improvements in these State documents.\n  The reference to ``biometrically encoded'' is pure demagogery. \n``Biometric'' merely refers to information relating to physical \ncharacteristics that are unique to an individual making it easier to \ndetermine if a card is being used by an impostor. That is what \n``biometric'' is. Look it up. A photograph is a common example. A \nfingerprint is another.\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\n  Use of the ominous term ``encoding,'' I guess, just appears as a \ntotally gratuitous crack or shot. Is a photograph on a card encoded on \nthat card? I guess it is, if you want to be stern about it. You will \nhave to ask the authors what they mean, if they mean anything at all, \nby the use of that term, except inflammatory language.\n  With respect to the ``dangerous path'' statement, it is an indication \nof something I have noticed about many of the opponents of any improved \nverification system. I have found, in the 17 years of my work in this \narea, and especially with the Congressman from California, who is \ntougher than anybody ever in this Chamber--he is no longer a Member, \nbut I had the highest respect for him; he was tough--but he displayed a \nfundamental distrust of the Government to do what it would do, \nfundamental distrust of our people, fundamental distrust of our \npolitical system. That has to be the root of this, a fundamental \ndistrust of what we are doing. For, as I said many years ago, ``There's \nno slippery slope toward some loss of liberty, only a long descending \nstairway. Each step downward has to be allowed by the American people \nand their leaders.'' That will never happen.\n  The claim is also made that the system ``imposes costly new burdens \non States and localities.'' CBO estimates the cost of all of the birth \ncertificate and driver's license improvements required by section 118 \nof the bill, as modified by the floor amendment which was adopted \nwithout objection yesterday--how curious, a floor amendment of mine to \nget all of the snarls and the bumps out of an amendment that had \nobjection in the committee, and I then made these specific corrections \nto satisfy most of my colleagues, and it passed here by a voice vote \nwithout objection. That will be stricken by this amendment.\n\n  This motion to strike will take the work product that was done, with \nall of us in here and their staffs, and junk it, gone, history. You can \ndo that. You may do that. If that happens, life will go on, the Sun \nwill rise in the east, and it will be a joyous day on the morrow.\n  But let us be real. What I did with the phase-in of the driver's \nlicense requirements is going to cost now $10 to $20 million, spread \nover 6 years. I have seen estimates of the losses to the American \npeople because of the use of fraudulent ID's. That is in the billions \nand billions and billions of dollars, ladies and gentlemen. That is \nwhat is happening. Not to mention voter fraud, terrorism, and other \ncrimes that often involve document fraud.\n  One other one we have to put to bed, at least pull the covers up, and \nthen go on anywhere you wish to go with this. I have to respond to a \nwild charge that has been made before. You try not to respond to all \nthis stuff, but finally you just kind of get a belly full of it. The \nheated rhetoric which has been flying about the Chamber--threatening \nand stern--is totally untrue. That was about the pilot program in Santa \nAna, CA.\n  My colleagues have heard the bill will create a massive, time-\nconsuming, error-prone, error-riddled bureaucracy. They have heard \naccusations that we are racing, with no brakes, toward a national ID \ncard that will be ``riddled with mistakes'' and will be ``dangerous to \nour own workers.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to extinguish this fiery, heated rhetoric \nwith the cold splash of hard fact. Once my colleagues hear the truth, \nmaybe they will be better able to sort out some of the rest of it, and \nthe American people will finally hear the truth. I believe we will no \nlonger have to deal with some of the old canards which are in vogue and \nhave been in vogue for weeks here, because currently under the \nauthority of the 1986 immigration bill, the INS is conducting a pilot \nproject on an employment verification system. I hope no one here will \ntry to stop it, but you never know. It is working. You might want to go \nscotch it before it goes too far. It is just like the pilot projects \nauthorized by this bill.\n  Let me tell you what has happened so that you can hear it. Over 230 \nemployers in Santa Ana, CA--230 employers--have volunteered to \nparticipate in this INS project, volunteered.\n  After the hiring of a new worker, the employer fills out an I-9 form \nand checks the worker's documents. Everybody is doing that in the \nUnited States, so if you hear any more argument about what we are \nputting on the employers to find out if the people in front of them are \nauthorized to work in the United States of America, are citizens, do \nnot think that I put it in this bill. It has been in the law for nearly \n10 years.\n\n  So this is just like every other employer in the United States. It is \na requirement of current law. It is a total distortion of fact and \nreality to say that we are going to ask something more of an employer \nto either get ``permission to hire,'' or to ``clear it'' when he had \nnot had to clear it before.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, they have been doing it for 10 years, every \nsingle day while we go about our work here. The I-9 is asked for, and \npeople do it every single day. Some were offended when it first began. \n``Why should I do that?'' I have a provision, if you are a U.S. \ncitizen, you need do nothing more than a test that you are a U.S. \ncitizen. That would take care of that. But we will not get the \nopportunity, likely, to get to that.\n  So let us at least start with what is there. We have a requirement in \ncurrent law which requires the employer to ask the potential employee \nin front of him for documents. He is asked to ask for 29 different ones \nunder the previous legislation, the present law--worker authorization \nID--and then to make a tragic mistake, with no intent to discriminate, \nand ask for another one, and get a fine or the clink. So we corrected \nthat. I hope we will keep that.\n  But remember now, in this pilot program, if the new hire is not a \nU.S. citizen, the employer then begins the verification process. Using \na computer the employer transmits the alien registration number or the \n``A'' number on an employee's green card to the INS. This happens after \nthe employee has been hired. Please remember that. It happens after the \nemployee has been hired. The majority of the time the employer's \nrequest is answered in 90 seconds. All of the inquiries are answered \nwithin 48 hours by the INS.\n  Here is where this fake figure comes in. For 17 percent of the newly \nhired workers--or maybe it is 20; I have heard both, about 1,100 \nworkers; this was newly hired, about 1,100 workers--the INS was unable \nto confirm that they were legally authorized to work, ladies and \ngentlemen. So all of those individuals then were given 30 days to set \nup an appointment with a specific INS officer in a special office set \nup to correct possible mistakes in the INS data base.\n  Guess how many--I hope my colleagues will hear this--guess how many \nof these 1,100 individuals actually came to the INS? Mr. President, \n22--22--of them came to the INS. Of these 22 people, only 17 were \nactually authorized to work in the United States. Their troubles were \nresolved within the day--within the day. The other five people who \nshowed up were not authorized to work in the United States. I guess you \nhave to assume that the other 1,000 people or so who never showed up to \nthe INS were not authorized to work, either.\n\n  What about the 17-percent error rate, or 20 percent, that some \nopponents have spoken about? Is it the number of illegal aliens who \nwere denied jobs by the INS pilot program? Is that it? Look at the \nstatistics, the real statistics. The current INS pilot project is more \nthan 99 percent accurate. In the few cases where mistakes were made, \nthey were fixed promptly. In no case did any legal permanent resident \nof the United States lose a job due to this system--not one, nor any \nU.S. citizen.\n  Let me repeat myself because this is one of the most important facts \nmy colleagues should remember: No one has ever lost a job due to faulty \ndata in the INS pilot program. The system is used only after a new \nemployee had been hired.\n  No one will ever be denied a job under this system. The horror \nstories which opponents have bandied about are completely and utterly \nwithout basis and fact. They are fears and illusions summoned up from \nthe vapors to scare the wits out of the American people.\n  My colleagues should also know that the employers who participate in \nthis verification pilot program think it is great stuff. They do not \nconsider it a burden. They believe it to be a great help. I share with \nmy colleagues' comments of those who use the system and try to look \naskance at the blather of\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\nthe business lobbyists. When I make these remarks, I am not speaking of \npeople in this Chamber, but those groups I know so well. I know them \nwell. So they look askance at this blather of the business lobbies \nwhose sole job is to vigorously oppose all legislation which impacts \nbusiness.\n  Here is what these employers say about the INS pilot program. ``I \nlove this system,'' says Virginia Valadez, the human resources officer \nfor GT Bicycles. ``Now I don't have to be responsible for whether or \nnot these people are legal. I don't have to be the watchdog.''\n  Comments of the California Restaurant Association: ``Some means of \nverifying Government documents is vital to the integrity of the \nemployment system. We desperately need a reliable, convenient means for \nemployers to verify the authenticity of the documents that the \nGovernment itself requires. I can assure you the restaurant industry \nwill participate eagerly.'' It will be the first time in my memory--the \nrestaurant groups, when I started this business, were the most \nresistant, and they feel this would be extremely helpful.\n\n  Says their publication, describing the fledgling pilot verification \nprogram, ``Bring offers of ready volunteer to our offices.'' The \ntestimony of Robert Davis, the president of St. John Knits Co., before \nthe select committee of the California Assembly, after describing the \nwidespread availability of this stuff and the great difficulty that \nputs on the law-abiding employer says, ``To a business that wants to \ncomply and build a stable labor force, this is a major concern. \nEconomic loss from hiring, training and loss of output from the removal \nof a forged document worker can be severe.'' He said, now he can \n``invest with confidence in the training of the individual, and plan \nfor a long-term permanent work force.'' He believes in it. He has seen \nit work. ``As a businessman * * * it is exciting and reassuring'' and \nhas had dramatic success.\n  There they are. The current program only tests individual or \nnoncitizens in order to get a job. The illegal alien only has to claim \nto be a U.S. citizen, present a driver's license, Social Security card, \nand those are the things we will find out. How do they avoid the \nverification process? What do they do? Find out.\n  Others say we should try and call in--there has been a toll-free \nnumber called 1-800-BIG-BROTHER. They must have forgotten the one \ncalled 1-800-END-FRAUD. That is an 800 number, too, that you want to \npipe into that next time you are grappling with 1-800-END-FRAUD or BIG-\nBROTHER and find out whether it will be cost effective, find out what \nwe will do, see what is up in this country, do the testing we need to \ndo, trust a Congress 6 years in the future having to cast another vote \nto do it right. If you do not get started, you will never get it \nstarted.\n  Obviously, I hope my colleagues will oppose the Abraham amendment and \nwill acknowledge that some of the apocalyptic cries that come from out \nthere, from the beltway, are truly without foundation and reality or \nfact. Remember, this is a pilot project that you are seeking to strike, \nwith all the inevitable problems that a pilot project to a new system \nwill involve, but if we do not even try to work out the bugs through \npilot projects, we will never have a workable system. That will be, \nthen, truly a hazing of the American public. They thought we got the \njob done, but we failed--and failed totally--in that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I similarly acknowledge the efforts of \nSenator Simpson both with respect to the broad subject of immigration \npolicy over the last 17 years and, more specifically, his hard work on \nthe bill before the Senate on illegal immigration.\n  The positions which I have advocated on a number of the issues that \nare part of this bill, in some cases, have been this opposition to his \nposition, and, in some cases, they have been on the same side. They \nhave always been advocated with great respect for his efforts here.\n  I must say I sympathize with his feelings about some of the rhetoric \nwhich those outside of this Chamber have launched during the past \ncouple of months as we have dealt with this issue before both the \ncommittee and here on the floor. I, too, have been the target of many \nrather unusual, strange, and exaggerated charges, as well as \ncomplaints. In my State of Michigan, in fact, groups who oppose some of \nthe views I have on this issue have even launched paid media campaigns \ncritiquing my activities here in the U.S. Senate on these issues. I am \nboth an admirer of Senator Simpson's efforts and a sympathizer with the \nrole he finds himself thrust into when he chose to become involved in \nhighly important issues that touch a large number of Americans.\n  I comment now and finish on the comments I made earlier with respect \nto the implications of this verification system on the American people. \nWe have been told as a starting point that the bill, without this pilot \nprogram, would be gutless, it would be toothless and, in various other \nways, be a bill unworthy of us here. I cannot help, when we talk about \nexaggerated rhetoric, be a little shocked and surprised at those \nallegations, because I consider the bill as it currently stands, even \nif it did not have these pilot programs, an extraordinary piece of \nlegislation that will combat many of the problems this country has with \nillegal immigration, and combat them squarely, head on, effectively, \nwhether it is increasing the border patrols, whether it is cracking \ndown on and ensuring the deportation of alien criminals, whether it is \nin partially penalizing the visa overstayers who make up such a large \npercentage of the illegal alien population, or whether it is sharply \nreducing the availability of public assistance programs to illegal \naliens. All of these, I think, combined, will play a very effective \nrole in dramatically reducing the illegal immigration problems we \nconfront.\n  Equally, I think, we will see that the provisions in the legislation \nwhich protect employers, particularly small employers, from charges of \ndiscrimination, in cases where no intent to discriminate exists, are \ngoing to, likewise, allow us to address the problem of individuals who \nare legal aliens securing employment in this country and do so, I \nthink, with great effectiveness.\n  (Mr. BROWN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Does that make this pilot program that we are talking \nabout, this identification verification program, the linchpin in this \nlegislation? Is the absence of that going to make this toothless, Mr. \nPresident? I do not think so. Quite the contrary. I think, if anything, \nit will burden the bill and burden American citizens--taxpayers, \nemployers, and employees--with an excessive amount of redtape, \nbureaucracy, and big Government intrusion that is not going to \nhandsomely pay off in terms of the benefits it produces.\n  Let me just talk about some of those costs once again. First of all, \nthis approach is the kind of big Government bureaucracy approach that I \nthink most of us in this Congress have been arguing we find too \ndominant already in the American economy. Do we really want to have \nanother bureaucracy, another effort here to try to create hoops for \nbusinesses to jump through as they make employment decisions, or for \nU.S. citizens, who are entitled to be employed, to jump through in \norder to secure employment?\n  Clearly, it is going to be a costly venture and a costly one both in \nterms of bureaucratic redtape as well as in taxpayer dollars. I was \nglad to hear the term ``$10 billion'' used as a possibility of the cost \ninvolved here. I do not know what the total costs are going to be. No \none, in fact, on the floor knows that. But it is certainly conceivable \nthat it will be great. Just as far as we are aware to this point, the \nassembling of this database is going to be in the hundreds of millions \nof dollars. The Social Security Administration has said that a national \nprogram would be $3 to $6 billion, and then it would have to be \nsustained.\n  Mr. President, that is thousands of dollars per illegal immigrant in \nthe country just to build this system, if that is what we would end up \ndoing. I do not think that is exactly the kind of cost-benefit approach \nwe want to take. Let us not just talk about the burdened taxpayers; let \nus talk about the burden to business, and particularly to small \nbusiness.\n  We can debate the terminology, we can talk about whether it is \nseeking\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\npermission or some other way to describe what would be called for under \nthis type of an approach. But it certainly would be an additional step \nin the process, and it certainly would require, in some way, \ncommunicating with someone in a bureaucracy run by the Federal \nGovernment somewhere in America to determine whether or not \nverification indeed has occurred.\n  We have never, in my judgment, Mr. President, ever placed that level \nof burden on employers in this country. It is a costly burden, \npotentially a very costly burden, for small businesses, and \nparticularly for those small businesses that have a large turnover of \nemployees.\n\n  In addition, it is a burden on the employees themselves. Again, we \nhave one pilot program in Santa Ana, CA, carefully monitored by the \nINS, who are presumably pulling out all the stops to try to minimize \ndelays on a database. So there are 22 cases out of 1,000--1, 2, 3 \npercent. Extrapolate that to the entire country or a large region, as \nis contemplated by the pilot program, and we are talking about \nthousands of American citizens who will be, in one way or another, \ndenied initial hiring because the verification system database is not \nable to run at 100 percent.\n  While it may be the case that when a program is highly localized in a \nsingle city, with INS monitoring, the 22 people can get relatively \nquickly into the correct category, I do not think such a quick \nturnaround will be possible if the program is indeed larger, whether it \nis larger in terms of a full State or a region that goes beyond one \nState, or certainly if it was a national program.\n  We have had other similar kinds of things happen, Mr. President. \nWhenever databases are involved, there could be interminable delays. \nThe Social Security Administration encounters this quite often, and it \ntakes days to months to correct errors. I do not think that is the way \nto deal with the illegal immigration problem in America--by creating \nproblems for people who are citizens who are entitled to work, rather \nthan cracking down on those who are not entitled to work.\n  Let us not overlook the acquisition costs of the documents that will \nbe required in order to effectuate this type of system if it goes \nbeyond a very small project. The acquisition costs were so, I think, \naccurately and movingly laid out by the Senator from Ohio earlier. \nImagine what we will encounter from our constituents if they determine \nor learn that we have moved us in a direction where new birth \ncertificates are required, whether it is for passports, weddings, or \nanything else. Imagine what we will encounter if when young people go \nto get their driver's license, now living in a wholly different State \nor part of the country, find out that our law here today, in attempting \nto crack down on illegal immigration, has thwarted that effort, forcing \nthem to incur additional costs in order to get their first license.\n  These are significant costs--costs not borne by the people who are \nbreaking the rules, but by the people who are playing by the rules.\n  I do not believe, Mr. President, that we should attempt to solve the \nillegal immigration problem by bringing huge burdens on people who are \nplaying it straight. I am sympathetic to the problems raised with \nrespect to people who live in States such as California. I understand \nthat they have different circumstances than we might have in my State, \nor yours. But to basically impose upon the entire country ultimately \nor, in the short-term, full States or regions the kinds of burdens that \nare contemplated by this type of verification system, it just seems to \nme, Mr. President, that is not a cost-benefit analysis that works out \nfavorably for the American people.\n  Now, Mr. President, the real issue that we should focus on, in \naddition to costs, are benefits, because that is the calculus. I think \nit is important for everyone who is considering how they feel about \nthis issue to think about the degree to which such a program as is \nbeing contemplated here can possibly work. Will the forgery stop, Mr. \nPresident? Will it really mean that there is not the capability of \ncircumventing the new system that might be developed? Do we really \nbelieve that a system can be made perfect? Do we really think that on \nAlvarado Street in Los Angeles, or in any other city where there might \nbe this type of forgery, in a couple of years, if not sooner, somebody \nnot will come up with a system that breaks the code, that somehow \npenetrates the new security that is developed as part of these pilot \nprograms? I am very skeptical, Mr. President.\n  But, also, let us not lose sight of the fact that, even separate from \nthe ability to develop a foolproof system, we have the problem that \nmany, if not an overwhelming percentage, of the employer problems we \nhave are intentional. So let us ask ourselves this: If there is an \nemployer who knowingly or intentionally intends to hire someone who is \nan illegal alien, are they even going to participate in the \nverification system? I do not think so. I do not think so, Mr. \nPresident.\n  So while the people who play by the rules are incurring the \nadditional costs of setting up the kinds of systems that will be \nrequired to interface with the database in Washington, the ones who \nwould shun the rules today will shun the rules tomorrow. As a \nconsequence, the issue of whether or not there is a job magnet will not \nbe very effectively addressed by this type of an approach, because as \nlong as there are people willing to work around the rules, there will \nbe an audience of people who will think they can come to the country \nillegally and get jobs with those who basically eschew the \nresponsibilities as employers of following the rules today.\n  So there we bring ourselves to the final balance. On the one hand, \nmassive costs, taxpayer costs, putting this kind of program together. \nWhether it is a national database, regional database, State database, \nit is going to be costly--costs for the small businesses, in \nparticular, but for the employers of America, who have to develop \nwhatever system it is to comply with and interface with the database; \nand then costs in terms of actually doing such compliance; costs to the \nemployees themselves, who will be required to go through the additional \nstep, and especially to those who, because of a database mistake, do \nnot initially get hired and have to go through the additional \nbureaucratic red tape to get back into the system; costs to all who \nwill need either birth certificates and driver's licenses and find out \nthat because of what we have done, they now have to get a new one. \nThose are the costs on one side.\n  On the other side, as I say, the benefits, in my judgment, are \nsubstantially less than that which has been suggested earlier, because \nI think it will ultimately still be possible to find a way around the \nsystem. For those who want to find a way around the system on the \nemployer side, a verification system will only make a very minimal \nimpact. For that reason, I think we do not need this step in the \ndirection of more big Government. I think we should strike the \nverification system and the driver's license and birth certificate \nprovisions of the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I again rise in support of the amendment.\n  I would like to return, if I could, to the issue of the birth \ncertificate because I think it is so revolutionary what we would do if \nwe actually passed this bill as it is written and if we turn this \namendment down. As I pointed out earlier, we are saying to 270 million \nAmericans that your birth certificates are still valid. You just cannot \nuse them for anything. If you really want to use them in the \ntraditional way in which we use birth certificates today, you have to \ngo back to the county where you were born or contact that county. You \nhave to get a new birth certificate under the prescription of the \nFederal Government. For the first time, we have a federally prescribed \nbirth certificate. We have a federally prescribed driver's license. In \nessence, they are not even ``grandfathered in,'' to use the term we use \nmany times. You will have to get a new one if you want to use it.\n  A 16-year-old who just wants to get his or her driver's license, we \nare going to say, ``No, you cannot use that birth certificate that your \nparents have held onto for 16 years. You have to get a new one.'' We \nare going to say the same thing to someone who wants to get married. \nYou have to go back to contact that county where you were\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\nborn 20, 30, or 40 years ago to get that birth certificate. You have to \nbe reissued a new form. We will have to say to someone 65 years of age \nwho wants to get Social Security, or Medicare, ``Sorry.'' You come into \nthe Social Security Administration and you think you are going to get \nyour check next month. You sign up, doing what you are supposed to be \ndoing. We will say to them, ``No, you have to go back and get a new \nbirth certificate,'' a birth certificate that was issued initially 65 \nyears before that. I think that is an undue burden. I think it is a \nterrible burden.\n  I would like to talk now for a moment about another aspect of this, \nand that is those who argue in favor of requiring this national birth \ncertificate--nationally prescribed birth certificate. To those who \nargue that it is worth it, we are going to help solve the illegal \nimmigration problem--and I know they are well intentioned when they say \nthis--and it is worth it to require the people we represent to do all \nof this, I would argue, walk through this with me and see if at the end \nyou still think that a birth certificate--this new tamperproof birth \ncertificate--is really going to solve very many problems, because it is \nbased upon the premise that the person who gets this new tamperproof \nbirth certificate is in fact the person they purport to be. That, I \nthink, is a leap in logic which may not necessarily be true.\n\n  My colleague from Wyoming has consistently--and I respectfully say \nthat he has been at this for 17 or 18 years. He refers to the birth \ncertificate as the ``breeder document.'' This is the real problem: We \nhave to get at the birth certificate. The difficulty with that is that \nunder the laws of many States and the way it operates in many States, \nthat breeder document may be a second-generation document or a third-\ngeneration document.\n  Let me take my home State of Ohio. Ohio is what might be referred to \nas an open State. It is not the only State that follows this procedure. \nThere are many other States that follow this as well. All you need to \ndo in Ohio to get a birth certificate is to stop in at the county \nhealth department office. You put down your $7, and you get a copy of \nyour birth certificate. Not only can you get a copy of your birth \ncertificate, Mr. President, but you can get a copy of anybody's birth \ncertificate. It is a public document. It is a public record. So I can \ngo into Ohio and get a birth certificate for anybody if they were born \nin that county.\n  What is the protection here? You can issue the finest document in the \nworld, with all the bells and whistles on it in the world; you can \nspend all of the money you want to make it tamperproof, but if the \nperson who walks in and gets that document is not that person, what \ngood have you done? So in States like Ohio that have this open system, \nopen record system, what good does it do? There is absolutely no good \nat all.\n  There are other States that probably are more restrictive, but I \nwould say even in those States that are more restrictive, unless we are \nwilling to impose burdens on American citizens that no one in this \nChamber will impose, unless we are willing to say to the 65-year-old \nwho wants to get Social Security who now lives in South Carolina and \nwas born in Ohio that you have to personally go back to Cleveland, OH, \nor Cincinnati where you were born to get your birth certificate, unless \nwe are willing to say that, how in the world do you protect the \nintegrity of that birth certificate? How in the world do you do it by \nmail?\n  Let us take it a step further. Let us assume the State even has some \nvery restrictive ways in which they will issue a birth certificate. \nWhat is the use of being able to demonstrate who you are, whether it is \na driver's license, if you have a driver's license such as Senator \nSimpson has over there--I heard him tell the story of how cheap it was \nto get that driver's license. It is a great story. It illustrates a lot \nof the problems that we have. Then you go to get the breeder document, \nand you can go circular. Even if you have a restrictive State, not like \nOhio and other States where you can get anybody's birth certificate, \nwhat in the world good does it do to have all these bells and whistles \non these birth certificates?\n\n  We will spend a ton of money. We will violate States' rights because \nwe are going to tell the States what they can accept and what they \ncannot accept for official State business, all in the name of trying to \nsolve this problem. I would submit it is not going to solve it at all. \nIn fact, again, it is not too much of a leap of the imagination to \nthink it may create more problems. Why? Because now you are going to \nhave this routine of millions of people every year having to go back \nthrough when they turn 16 and want their driver's license and want \ntheir Medicare card, or when they want to get married; millions of \npeople have to go back to the origin county of their birth to get a \nbirth certificate. These will be issued en mass.\n  It seems to me that you do not have to be too smart if you are a \nperson who wants to violate the system. If you are a person who wants \nto game the system, as the Senator from Wyoming said very eloquently, \nthere are people who are doing it, and it is a problem. But now you do \nnot have to be too bright to be able to figure out how to start working \nthat system and how to get out of some of these counties, particularly \nin States that are open for birth certificates, this breeder document. \nOnly now it is going to be a breeder document that is going to be \nsuperior. You are going to be in the situation where you, as an \nimposter, are going to have a better document than the person who is \nactually that person.\n  Mike DeWine can go in; I could figure out how to game the system. I \ncould get someone's birth certificate if I was close in age to that \nperson. It might be able to pass. It might be able to work. I have a \ngreat birth certificate. If I took it to the Chair and he was the \nemployer, he would say, ``That's it, a new birth certificate, it has to \nbe right.'' And if the next day the real person came in and they had \ntheir old birth certificate, the old, moldy birth certificate that had \nbeen in their closet or in their attic, or had been in the desk for a \nnumber years, you would say, ``Well, that is not as good. I have to \ntake the other one.''\n  So I think when you work this out--it all sounds great in theory--it \njust will not work. If you look at how the government really works at \nthe county level, if you look at how health departments issue these \ncertificates that really work, if you take into consideration the fact \nthat an open State can get anybody's birth certificate, this just does \nnot make any sense.\n\n  Let me turn to another point. I think my friend from Wyoming has been \ntoo modest. This is a good bill. He has made it a good bill. He has had \n17 years of experience at looking at things that we need to do. There \nis a consistent list of things that we have done. I say ``we''--``he'' \nhas done. This is the legal immigration bill passed by the \nsubcommittee, a portion of it. These are the things each one of us \nthink relates to a specific problem of dealing with illegal aliens.\n  I reduced it to a chart form because I do not want anyone in this \nChamber to think that if this amendment is accepted--which I certainly \nhope it will be--that there is nothing left in the bill to deal with \nillegal aliens. This is a tough bill. The Senator has done a great job. \nHe has taken his years of experience in the subcommittee, along with \nmembers of the subcommittee, and he did a great job.\n  Look at what the subcommittee did:\n  Increased Border Patrol, INS investigators, wiretaps for alien, \nsmuggling, and document fraud;\n  RICO for alien smuggling and document fraud;\n  Increased asset forfeiture for alien smuggling and document fraud;\n  5. Doubled fines for document fraud;\n  Next, faster deportation of illegal aliens;\n  And finally, faster deportation of immigrants convicted of crimes.\n  That was the bill coming out of the subcommittee. It is a bill that I \nthink I have heard my friend say would have been hard to get through on \nthe Senate floor even as recently as a couple of years ago. But it is \ntough and it is good.\n  Then the bill went to the full committee, and the full committee even \nupped the ante. The full committee added additional things. This is \nwhat the full committee did.\n  ``Bill Made Tougher in Committee.''\n  Increased penalties for visa overstayers.\n  Let me stop with that for a minute because that is a problem. My \nfriend\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\nfrom Wyoming has identified this as a problem. These are people who \noverstay. They are people who come here legally--they are not legal \nimmigrants, but they are people who come here legally. They are \nstudents. For any number of reasons they are here, but then they stay. \nThat is a problem. This provision put in by the full committee deals \nwith that--increased penalties for visa overstayers.\n  Next: More investigators for visa overstayers;\n  Next: Eliminate additional judicial review of deportations;\n  No bail for criminal aliens;\n  Three-tier fence along the border;\n  Next: Expand detention facilities by 9,000 beds;\n  And finally: Increase Border Patrol by 1,000 agents.\n  All of those provisions are in this bill. So it is a bill that is a \nstrong bill, and no one, no one should be ashamed of voting for this \nbill. No one should feel they cannot go home and be able to say, ``We \npassed a very, very tough bill.''\n  Let me turn, as I said I would earlier, to the issue of a national \nverification system.\n  I understand that this is a pilot project. Again, I only bring to the \nfloor my own experience. Each one of us brings our own experience. I \nthink that is the great thing about the Congress and the Senate. We do \nhave varied backgrounds. My background has been, at least in part, in \nlaw enforcement as a county prosecuting attorney.\n  One of the things that shocked me 20 years ago is when I found what \nkind of state our criminal records were in. What am I talking about \nwhen I am talking about criminal records? I am talking about basically \nthe same type of thing here, only I am talking about a finite group of \nindividuals, criminals.\n  It is important for the police officer who comes up behind a car to \nbe able to determine who is in that car, if that person has a record, \nto be able to determine if that person is wanted, or at least if that \ncar is a stolen car. When someone is apprehended, then it is important \nto be able to determine whether that person is wanted, whether they \nhave had a criminal record in the past. The same way for a judge who \nlooks down at arraignment. He is on his 52d person, or she is on her \n52d person, the judge is, and is trying to determine what the bond is. \nIt is important, when they glance at that record, the record be \ncomplete; that they know 3 years ago this person committed a rape, or \nthey know that 4 years ago this person fled the jurisdiction. All of \nthat is important, and police officers deal with this every day and \nhave to rely on this information to make life and death decisions.\n  I was shocked a number of years ago to find that this system is not \nentirely accurate. That is a kind way of putting it. When I became \nLieutenant Governor in Ohio, we had as one of our goals to try to \nupgrade the criminal records system so police officers would know who \nthey were dealing with. We found that only 5 percent of the criminal \nrecords in the State of Ohio were totally accurate--only 5 percent. \nThat is not unusual. That is not unusual.\n  In all the discussion about the Brady bill, we got into the whole \nissue of the accuracy of criminal records. We found that there are \nvery, very few States that could put in an instant check system because \nof the high inaccuracy level.\n  Now, after having spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to \nupgrade a criminal record system that we depend on to make life and \ndeath decisions, how in the world do we expect to, overnight, re-create \na national data base system for employment, a system that, by \ndefinition, is going to have to be a lot bigger?\n  Now, people could say: ``Well, you are talking about a pilot project, \nSenator. Isn't that what you are talking about?''\n  ``Yes.''\n  Yes, we are talking about a pilot project, but I have been thinking \nabout this, and I cannot come up with any way you can have a pilot \nproject that really works and is really accurate and really protects \nemployees or potential employees unless you have a national system. We \ncannot build walls around States. We cannot build walls around \ncommunities. People go back and forth. You have to create a national \nsystem, even if you are only using it in four or five pilot projects, \nand so we will have to build a national system. We will have to build a \nnational system that is not going to be error prone. Anyone who has had \nany experience with the criminal system in this country, who really has \nlooked at it, I think is going to be hard pressed to be able to make a \ngood argument that this new system we are going to create is not going \nto cause serious, serious problems as well as be extremely expensive.\n\n  I know there are some of my colleagues who want to talk some more on \nthis bill, but I just believe this amendment makes eminent sense. It is \na good bill without it. It is a great bill. It does a lot. The Senator \nfrom Wyoming is to be commended for the work he has done. But unless we \ntake out these provisions, unless this amendment passes, I think we are \nall going to be very sorry, and I think we are going to have a lot of \nexplaining to do to our constituents when that 16-year-old wants to get \nhis or her driver's license and they find out, no, that birth \ncertificate is not any good; the 65-year-old finds out, no, my birth \ncertificate is not any good anymore; I have to go back and get a new \none, or when someone wants to get married and they find out their birth \ncertificate is not any good either. I think that is a very serious \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Wyoming standing. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I wish to review the \nsituation. We have a Leahy amendment, on which, I believe, if anyone \nwishes to address that, we are ready to close that debate. There is no \ntime agreement here, but I think that is ready to be closed. I think \nSenator Hatch has a statement and maybe will enter that in the Record. \nSenator Bradley has an amendment, and there were several who said they \nwished to speak on that. I have not had any further word from anyone on \nthat. There is no time agreement on it. Then the Abraham amendment, \nwhich now goes to Senator Kyl for his time. I have really nothing much \nfurther on any of those three.\n  So, again, if we are going to go on, maybe we could lock in a time \nagreement to be sure that we let our colleagues know there will at \nleast be three votes on these three amendments.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I shall be quite brief. If the ranking \nmajority and minority members wish to discuss a time agreement, that \nwould be fine, or perhaps while I am speaking they could do it, but I \nwill not speak more than 15 minutes for sure.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The discussion \nthat my colleague from Ohio has just engaged in primarily relating to \nthe issue of the birth certificate, I will leave to Senator Simpson. I \nshould rather respond to arguments primarily made earlier by the \nSenator from Michigan and, to some extent, the Senator from Ohio \nrelating to the problem of verification of employment status.\n  I wish to go back in time to set this issue in proper context. In \n1990, 6 years ago, the Congress increased the limit on legal \nimmigration to the country by 37 percent because we thought the laws \nthat imposed serious sanctions for hiring illegal immigrants would have \nthe effect of reducing that illegal immigrant population; that making \nit harder to employ illegal immigrants would in effect remove that \nmagnet--employment--that was drawing many people across the border, \nparticularly from Mexico.\n  Unfortunately, it has not worked out that way because the system just \nhas not worked very well. Unfortunately, between 300,000 and 400,000 \nillegal immigrants are now entering the United States every year, many \nof them people seeking these job opportunities. In fact, in my own \nState, the INS estimates that about 10 percent of the State's work \nforce is made up of illegal immigrants.\n  I hope Members of the Senate believe that it should not be acceptable \nto have so many illegal immigrants taking jobs here in the United \nStates. The question, then, is what we do about it. We have a system \nthat is not working, and we need to do something about it.\n\n[[Page S4484]]\n\n  That is what the bill attempts to deal with. We started out with a \nbill that dealt with it in a much more effective way. But in order to \ncompromise and get more support over the weeks and months, many changes \nwere made, to the point, now, that it is really a very modest approach. \nThis is a very modest change we are seeking, to try to find out how to \nstrengthen this verification process so not so many illegal immigrants \nare working in the United States. This is clearly the focus of the \neffort, to reduce the effect of the magnet of employment.\n  It has been illegal to hire illegal aliens for 10 years now. So I \nthink the first thing you have to do is ask what is not working and \nwhat can we do about it? The Jordan commission, which has been referred \nto many times in this debate, studied this problem as much as any, and \nit came up with several recommendations. What the Jordan commission and \nmany other immigration experts have concluded is that the best way to \nreduce the number of illegal aliens working in our country today is to \nimplement some kind of an easy-to-use, reliable employment verification \nsystem. In fact, the Jordan commission reported that current employer \nsanction laws cannot be effective without a system for verifying the \nwork eligibility of employees.\n  So, if the current system is not effective in weeding out those \nindividuals who are here illegally and, as the Jordan commission and \nothers have said, we have to find a way to develop a workable system, \nwhat is the next step? You do some research. You try to do some pilot \nprojects, some experiments, some demonstration projects, as they are \nsometimes called, to find out what will work the best. That is what the \ncommittee did. It adopted a verification provision which authorizes a \nseries of pilot projects. We are not changing the law. We are not \nimposing a system. We are certainly not imposing a national system. We \nare simply authorizing the Attorney General to experiment with some \npilot projects over a short period of time, 4 years, to determine what \nwill work, what is the most effective way for employers to verify that \nthe person they have hired is legally authorized to work. That is very \nstraightforward.\n  These projects are intended to assist both the employer and, frankly, \nthe person seeking employment. Because, if an individual seeks \nemployment and, frankly, looks like me, there probably are not going to \nbe too many questions asked. But, in my own State of Arizona, we have a \nvery large Hispanic population. There are a lot of people who seek \nemployment in which the employer is basically in a dilemma, in a catch-\n22 situation. If he asks too many questions of that individual, perhaps \nbecause he or she looks Hispanic, speaks with a Spanish accent, that \nemployer can be charged with discrimination. But if the employer does \nnot ask enough questions to verify the legal status of the employee, he \ncan be charged with violating our immigration laws for hiring somebody \nwho is not legally authorized to work here.\n\n  As Senator Simpson and others have said, the system we have tried to \ndevise to verify the working status, or legal status, of the individual \nfor work purposes is not working because it relies on a series of \ndocuments, all of which are easy to forge. Therefore, you end up with a \nsituation where it is virtually impossible for the employer to really \nknow whether the individual is entitled to work or not.\n  The employer fills out what is called an I-9 form to verify the \neligibility of each person hired. But, as I said, that system is open \nto great fraud and abuse. So one of the purposes of the verification \nsystem is, obviously, to make the law work. Another purpose is to make \nit easier for the employer to verify the legal status of the \nindividual. Another purpose is to protect the individual seeking \nemployment.\n  I want to make it very clear that the bill specifically prohibits the \nestablishment of any national ID card. What many of us believe, \nideally, is there is no card at all. Let us take the Social Security \nnumber. You are frequently asked to give your Social Security number, \nbut you do not necessarily have to have a card with you that identifies \nyou as an individual for other purposes. On those few occasions in your \nlife, hopefully few for most of us, where you are applying for a job, \nyou give the Social Security number. Perhaps one of the pilot projects \nis a 1-800 number that the employer can dial up and punch in the \nnumbers of the Social Security number and get information back that the \nindividual who he has just hired is, in fact, legal.\n  In any event, we are not talking about a national ID card here, and \nthe debate should not be confused with that prospect. Moreover, the \nemployee verification would only be used after an individual was hired, \nso you do not run into problems of discrimination here. Perhaps most \nimportant--and I really view this as a deficiency in the bill, not \nsomething to brag about, but it certainly answers one of the objections \nof my opponents--is that these pilot projects would not in and of \nthemselves establish any new verification system for the country. The \nCongress would have to actually act, would have to pass a law \nimplementing a verification system before it ever took effect. So there \nwould be plenty of opportunity for those who oppose this, once a pilot \nproject had established some good ideas here, to pick those ideas apart \nif they do not like them. Basically what they are arguing against is \nsomething that has not even been created yet. They are saying we cannot \nimagine a system that would work well and therefore we should not even \ntry to find one.\n\n  As one of my colleagues said, it is impossible to have a foolproof \nsystem. That is the last argument, except for the ad hominem argument, \nthat is made in a debate when you do not have a good answer. It makes \nperfection the enemy of the good. There is only one perfect thing in \nthis universe and that is He Who made the universe. None of us is \nperfect. None of our laws is perfect. No system we can devise is \nperfect. Nothing is foolproof. Nothing is even tamperproof for people \nwho are not fools but are very clever individuals.\n  But we can try to do something to enforce a law that, 10 years ago, \neveryone thought was still a good law and none of the opponents of this \nverification system is trying to repeal. They are, in effect, willing \nto allow a law on the books they know cannot be enforced. Nothing \ndetracts more from a society than keeping laws on the books that \neveryone knows are not being enforced. It breeds an attitude against \nthe law, and, after all, the law is the underpinning of the country. We \nare a nation of laws.\n  If we willingly, knowingly, allow a lot of laws to be on the books \nthat everybody ignores because we know they do not work, it makes them \nunimportant, in effect. It make the purpose behind them unimportant. I \nsubmit we are not seriously doing our job if we simply argue against \ntrying to improve a law with nothing to substitute to make it better. \nThere are no concrete, positive suggestions here, no constructive \ncriticism. It is all negative criticism. You cannot make a perfect, \nfoolproof system, they say.\n  Nobody is saying we can. But we can sure make it a lot better than it \nis. We cannot make a foolproof system along the border either, but that \ndoes not keep us from trying. Almost everyone here is going to support \ntraining 1,000 new agents to put on the border and in our cities every \nyear for the next 7 years; to build fences, to build lights, to do all \nthe other things to try to keep the border more secure than it is. It \nwill never be totally secure, but we do not give up. We try to seek new \nways of protecting that border. In fact, we have some pilot projects in \nthis bill to experiment with different kinds of fencing and different \nkinds of lighting and roads, to see what works the best to secure the \nborder.\n  Why can we not have some pilot projects to experiment, to see what \nare the best ways of verifying the legal status of people for \nemployment purposes--and welfare benefits, I might add? It is a false \nargument, to make perfection the enemy of the good.\n  All this bill does is allow us to try some new things to see if they \nwill work. Now what is wrong with that, Mr. President?\n  I also heard an argument that it is going to cost the employers. \nAbsolutely false. First of all, we made it very clear that the pilot \nprojects cannot cost the employers anything and, secondly, one of the \nreasons we are trying to develop a new verification system is to \ndecrease the cost of compliance. It is not easy to comply with the\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\nfilling out of these I-9 forms. I know, I talked to a lot of employers \nwho do it. It is a hassle. It will be much easier and less costly for \nthem if we can implement a truly effective verification system.\n  In the end, Mr. President, as I said, the verification system that is \ncontemplated in this legislation is really a very minimal effort. It is \na pilot project only. There is no assurance, as the original bill \nprovided, that a nationwide system will ever be implemented. Such a \nsystem would only arise if we concluded that there are some really good \nideas that come out of this pilot project, presumably with a majority \nof the House and Senate agreeing to implement that verification system \nwith legislation.\n  As I said, this can really only be called a beginning, but it is an \nimportant first step, and I think that the verification provisions of \nthis bill, minimal as they are, should not be eliminated as the \nopponents suggest, but rather should be retained.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to strike \nthese important provisions from the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we have had a good debate and \ndiscussion on this amendment. Let me just summarize very briefly the \nreasons that I believe that the existing provisions are so important if \nwe are serious about dealing with the problems of illegal immigration.\n  First of all, there have been comments by those who are supporting \nstriking these various provisions that utilize an old technique that we \nknow of around here and many of us have seen many times, and that is, \nmisstate what is in the bill and then differ with it. Misstate what is \nin the bill and then differ with it.\n  That is true with those who have suggested that we are moving toward \na national identity card. It is also true of those who say we do not \nwant a new kind of national system that is going to be governing in the \nrural areas or urban areas of this country; that it somehow is going to \nbe national.\n  Mr. President, at the present time, we know, as it says in the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, to hire for employment in the United \nStates an individual, complying with the requirements of the subsection \n(B), and subsection (B) is spelled out in such a way as to require \neveryone in the United States of America, whether they are in Maine, \nWisconsin, Florida, Massachusetts, Texas or California, to fill out \nthis particular form, the I-9 form. That is a national requirement in \nexistence at the present time.\n  Do we understand that that is already in existence? And behind that, \nwith the other requirements in terms of the identification of the \nindividual, you have a list of acceptable documents.\n  The purpose and the thrust of this particular amendment in the first \ninstance, on the question of the birth certificate, is to make sure \nthat documents that are going to have to be required and be supplied \nare going to be accurate.\n  Why is that important? It is important, first of all, if we are \nserious about doing something about illegal immigration. If we are not \ngoing to do that, then the magnet attraction of jobs in the United \nStates is going to continue to invite people from all over the world to \ncome to the United States.\n  We can build fences and fences and fences and hire border guards and \nborder guards and border guards, but we have seen what happened in \nVietnam when we had those various fences out and mine fields and every \nkind of lighting facility. People still were able to bore through to \nwhere they wanted to go if they had a sufficient interest in doing so.\n\n  No. 1, we have a national program at the present time.\n  No. 2, everyone who wants to work and every employer in this country \nis required to fill this out.\n  The thrust of the Simpson proposal is to get at the question of \nensuring that the documents that are going to be provided to that \nemployer are going to be legitimate and that we are going to make \nsubstantial improvements with the problems of fraud in the making of \nthose documents, as well illustrated by the Senator from California. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  One of the provisions says that we are going to have to try and make \nsure that we are going to have birth certificates put on tamperproof \npaper. We hear how the world is coming down because we are going to \nhave that requirement.\n  Let us look at what the legislation says on birth certificates:\n  The standards described in this paragraph are set forth in the \nregulations on page 38, and it says on line 13:\n\n       (i) certification by the agency issuing the birth \n     certificate--\n\n  Whatever agency in the State issues the birth certificate.\n  Use of safety paper, tamper-free paper, that is true. We have said \nthat they have to move toward tamper-free paper.\n\n       The seal of the issuing agency--\n\n  Whatever that agency is in any State.\n\n     and other features designed to limit tampering--\n\n  Left up, again, to the State.\n\n     counterfeiting, and use by impostors.\n\n  There it is, I say to my friends. Those are the provisions that we \nare asking in order to stop illegal immigration into this country. How \ncan we say that these are unreasonable? How can we say that these are \nnot necessary? How can we say if we are serious about illegal \nimmigration that just insisting that there is going to be tamperproof \npaper out there, the seal of the issuing agency, whatever that might \nbe, and other features designed to limit tampering and counterfeiting. \nWe let the States do whatever else they want to do, but we are trying \nto get a handle on this.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of questions about how this is \ngoing to be costly. It is approximately $10 an issuance of a birth \ncertificate in the State of Georgia. We can give other illustrations of \nthat as well.\n  So it is important as we go to this issue about the birth \ncertificates to really understand it. As has been pointed out time in \nand time out during this debate, the birth certificate is that breeder \ndocument. If you get that birth certificate from any State that has \nopen files on it--we have 13 States that have open files on it--as I \nmentioned earlier, and you can go on in there and get a copy of \nanyone's birth certificate and get your own picture put with that birth \ncertificate, and you can have a driver's license, if you pass the \ndriver's requirement, and that is one of the eligibility cards for \nemployment.\n  So, Mr. President, if we are serious about trying to deal with this \nunderlying issue, this proposal that Senator Simpson has is absolutely \nessential, necessary and reasonable to try and deal with this issue.\n  On the second question about the various pilot programs to figure out \na better way to help employers verify who can work, because the current \napproach is not working, our provision simply requires the Attorney \nGeneral to conduct some pilot programs.\n  I wish we would spend a moment, and I will just take a moment, \nreferring our colleagues to those provisions on page 13 of the \nlegislation which outlines what will be necessary in terms of these \nvarious pilot projects. We pointed out they are not being put into \neffect. They will be completed and then a report will be made to the \nCongress, and the Congress will be able to take whatever steps that it \nwill.\n  It says:\n\n       (2) The plan described . . . shall take effect on the date \n     of enactment of a bill or joint resolution . . .\n\n  The objectives it must meet: the purpose is to reduce illegal \nimmigration, to increase employer compliance, to protect individuals \nfrom unlawful discrimination, to minimize the burden on businesses.\n  Those are the objectives. They sound pretty good to me. That is \nbasically what we are considering on that.\n  Within that, Mr. President, as I have seen as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, they believe that they may very well be able to \nissue or develop programs to increase the certification and accuracy \nthat are industry based, perhaps regionally based, but industry or \nemployer based. You have about 80 percent in seven States, 80 percent \nof the illegals in seven States.\n\n  There are some very interesting pilot programs that are in the \nprocess at the present time. We have not the time to\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\ngo through them, although I think anyone on the Judiciary Committee who \ntook the time to get the briefing from the Justice Department has to be \nimpressed about what they think the possibilities are of really \nstrengthening the whole process to be able to root out illegal \nimmigrants from the employment process in this country.\n  There are very important privacy protections, Mr. President, and the \nlist goes on. We have drafted to deal with that. The amendment has been \ndrafted to try to take into consideration every possible limitation and \nsensitivity.\n  But, Mr. President, we are going to have to ultimately make a \njudgment. If you are serious about controlling illegal immigration, \nserious about that, recognizing that half the illegals get here legally \nand then jimmy the system with these documents that are fraudulent, \npicked up easily, and get jobs and displace American workers. If you \nare interested in halting illegal immigration, you are going to have to \ndo more than border guards. You are going to have to get at the breeder \ndocuments and get it in an effective system.\n  If you are interested in protecting the Federal taxpayer, from \nillegal aliens getting fraudulent documents so that they can qualify \nfor public assistance programs, you better be interested in doing \nsomething about these fraudulent documents or otherwise we are just \ngiving lip service to trying to protect the taxpayer.\n  If you recognize the importance of trying to do something about the \nillegals, again, displacing jobs, we feel that it is important that we \nat least try to develop three pilot programs to see what \nrecommendations can be made to try to deal with this problem. These are \nrecommendations that are made by the Jordan commission and by others \nwho have studied it. We ought to be prepared to examine those at the \ntime they are recommended, to evaluate them, to find out if they are \ngoing to make a difference. I believe they can make important \nrecommendations and suggestions.\n  Mr. President, this is a hard and difficult issue. It is a \ncomplicated one. For people just to say that we can solve our problems \nwith illegal immigration by bumper-sticker solutions, that with that we \nare going to halt illegal immigration, that all we have to do is put up \nfences and more border guards, that we are going to halt that just by \nadding more penalties--I have been around here. We have added more \npenalties on the problems of guns since I have been around here than \nyou can possibly imagine. You think it is stopping gun crimes in this \ncountry? Absolutely not.\n  You can just keep on adding these penalties, but unless you are going \nto get to the root causes of any of these problems, we are not going to \nhave a piece of legislation that is worthy of its name in dealing with \na complex, difficult problem.\n  Let me just say, finally, unless we are going to do that, we are \ngoing to do what we have heard stated out here on the floor, the \nAmerican people are going to get frustrated by the failure to act; and \nthen we are going to have recriminations that are going to come down in \na cruel kind of world and divide families and loved ones, and there \nwill be a backlash against legitimate people being reunited and trying \nto make a difference and contribute to this country.\n  This, I think, is one of the most important pieces of this whole \nlegislation. I hope the Abraham-Feingold amendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. This has been a good debate. It appears to be winding \ndown. Let me just add a couple responses to the comments of the \nSenators from Wyoming and Massachusetts.\n  One of the words that has been kicked around here is the word \n``permission.'' Does this employer identification system, if it is \nfully implemented, require permission from the Federal Government for \nan employer to hire somebody? It has been sort of muddying the issue.\n  I suppose you could call the current system, asking for \n``permission.'' It is kind of a loose use of the word, because what is \nrequired now with the I-9 is the obtaining of a certain kind of \nidentification card. But what it does not include--and this is the \nphrase I used when I spoke; I did not just say ``permission,'' I said, \n``having to ask permission from Washington, DC.'' That is what this \nsystem that could arise from this proposal may create.\n  What happens now is the employer does not have to get on the phone or \nthrough a computer to find out something from a national databank. That \nis a big difference. Ask anybody who tries to run a small business or a \nfarm how they are going to like the idea that, in addition to \neverything else they have to do now to try to keep their business \ngoing, every time they want to hire somebody under one of these \nalternatives, they would have to either call Washington or they would \nhave to communicate with Washington through some other system, such as \na computer system.\n  Who is going to pay for all those systems? Who is going to make up \nfor the lost time of the employer who has these additional burdens? It \nis very important to distinguish here between what is current law and \nwhat this bill could do if this amendment is not adopted--getting \npermission from Washington, DC. I think that is a fair statement of \nwhat this adds to this bill.\n  How can this possibly square with the rhetoric and legislation \nproposed in the 104th Congress? Whatever happened to the notion that we \nshould not do more unfunded mandates from Washington, especially on \nsmall businesses? Whatever happened to the notion of regulatory reform, \nwhich almost every Senator at least paid lip service to? This seems to \nbe one of the biggest potential unfunded mandates that has ever been \nproposed on this floor.\n  I am confident that almost no employer in the State of Wisconsin \nwould feel comfortable with the notion that suddenly, in addition to \neverything else they have to do, they have to call up Washington under \nthis. If there is any ambiguity involved about the possibility that \nthis might occur, I refer to page 26 of the bill, and subsection (E), \nwhere it explicitly states that one of the things that could be done in \nthese pilot projects is to create the following:\n\n       A system that requires employers to verify the validity of \n     employee social security account numbers through a telephone \n     call, and to verify employee identity through a United States \n     passport, a State driver's license or \n     identification document, or a document issued by the \n     Service for purposes of this clause.\n\n  So it is explicit in the bill. It is not just some objectives, \ngeneral objectives, as the Senator from Massachusetts was reading \nearlier.\n  You go 13 pages later, there are the explicit approaches that are \npermitted. One of those approaches is to put in place a pilot program \nthat presumably would lead to a national program requiring every \nemployer to essentially call Washington after they have hired someone. \nI think this is very troubling and certainly something that should be \nremoved from the bill.\n  Another comment that I found interesting was the comment of the \nSenator from Wyoming. He said that if this system costs $10 billion, it \nwould be worth it. I think that is debatable, perhaps. But we have no \nassurance that even after we have gone through this process, either \nallowed every employer to do this or mandated every employer to do \nthis, after we spend $10 billion, we have no assurance at all that this \nsystem will work.\n  There will still be fraud. There will still be fraudulent documents. \nNo one has been able to assure us this is foolproof. We may have \ncreated this giant mandate and spent $10 billion, have this huge system \nin place, and it may not work. So it is not just a question of spending \nthe money. There is no guarantee it would, in fact, work.\n  So the question here in the end is, What the adoption of this \namendment will do to this whole bill? Some say it will destroy the \nbill. Others think, as I do, as Senator Abraham does, that it will make \nit a measured response. Instead of using a meat ax to deal with the \nproblem of illegal immigration, we will focus on the tough items that \nare in the bill that the Senator from Ohio identified.\n  There are strong measures in this bill. Frankly, I think a couple of \nthem might go a little too far. This is not a weak-kneed piece of \nlegislation if we get rid of this extreme mandate that\n\n[[Page S4487]]\n\ncould potentially arise from these pilot programs.\n  So, Mr. President, for those who support a strong immigration bill, I \nreject the notion that getting rid of this potential employer \nverification system would make it a weak bill. I think that is wrong. I \nthink everyone should remember the balance here between keeping the \nstrong provisions that are in the bill versus making the bill so \ndifficult for so many Americans and so many businesses that it would be \nresented rather than welcomed. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me propose a unanimous-consent \nrequest, which will get us to vote on the pending amendments, if I may, \nand answer any questions, or you may reserve the right to object. I \nwill certainly do that. Here is the consent agreement I would propose.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on or in relation to \namendment No. 3790 at the hour of 4 o'clock today to be followed by a \nvote on or in relation to amendment No. 3780, to be followed by a vote \non or in relation to amendment No. 3752; further, that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to each of \nthose votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Let me say, too, that there are two other amendments. \nThere was an amendment of Senator Feinstein from last night with regard \nto fencing, which Senator Kyl and Senator Feinstein are working toward \nresolving and may have something on that. We are not ready for a vote \nthere. Of course, that is not part of this.\n  Then there is an amendment of Senator Simon with regard to deeming, \nwith regard to the issue of disabled persons. We have not included that \nhere, but that will be coming up as soon as we conclude this.\n  Senator Reid has an amendment with regard to criminal penalties on \nfemale genital mutilation.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I do not intend to speak much longer. I \njust wanted to give a brief summary of a few points, both in response \nto some of the arguments that have been made by the last few speakers \nand also just to kind of put in perspective exactly what this all comes \ndown to.\n  First of all, a statement made earlier that this pilot program \napproach or the broader approach would not have any cost to employers \nis simply not the case for a variety of reasons, but the National \nRetail Federation has suggested that even the pilot program as \nconceptualized would probably work out to something in the vicinity of \n$7 per verification. That might not mean a lot to a business that does \nnot have much turnover, but to those that have lots of employees coming \nand going it is a pretty big impact.\n  In addition, it has been suggested that somehow because the 1986 \nlegislation has not gone as far as people had hoped for, it is a \nmistake to resist this approach that is being proposed with the pilot \nprogram. I think that is actually counter-intuitive, Mr. President. The \nfact is, every few years people come along with a new, better \nmousetrap, it would seem, or they would claim, for addressing the \nproblems of illegal aliens securing employment.\n  Ten years ago we burdened the American economy and our businesses and \nemployers with a lot of redtape--I-9 forms and other things--and they \nhave not worked. Those who bring this amendment today are saying, \n``Let's not add yet another level, another tier, another round of \nredtape to those people who are trying to play by the rules and create \nopportunities for people in this country.''\n\n  Third, Mr. President, it has been suggested that somehow this is \nreally something good for employers, it is good for people who might be \ndiscriminated against because of their ethnicity or their race. This is \na case, though, where frankly the people who are the alleged \nbeneficiaries are saying, ``Thanks, but no thanks.'' That is why this \namendment that we are bringing, both the verification amendment as well \nas the amendment that Senator DeWine has separately offered with \nrespect to birth certificates and driver's licenses, are being \nsupported by the National Federation of Independent Business, and they \nare key votes for that organization, by the chamber of commerce, by the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, by the National Retail \nFederation, and yes, the National Restaurant Association. We have heard \nearlier somehow that restaurants were supporting this. The national \nassociation opposes it.\n  The businesses who will have to implement this, whether in pilot \nprogram form or otherwise, say, ``Thank you, but no thanks.'' So, too, \ndo groups historically fighting discrimination, such as the ACLU and \nothers. The fact is, the beneficiaries are not really going to benefit, \nMr. President, if this is looked at closely.\n  Meanwhile, I draw attention to the issue of the pilot project. We are \nbeing asked to support this on a theory it is not really a national \nsystem but a pilot project. The way the legislation is drafted allows \nthat type of pilot program to encompass regions with no definition as \nfor their size. In addition, because of the nature of verification, it \nalmost certainly will require the creation of the type of national data \nbase that will be both costly, onerous, and burdensome. To say that a \npilot program is just a small step is not accurate, Mr. President. It \nis a very big step.\n  That brings me to the final point I want to make today--the cost \nversus the benefits. The costs will be great to employers who have to \nverify new employees, whatever the size of the program. The cost will \nbe great to the employees themselves who are playing by the rules--U.S. \ncitizens and those who legally can seek employment--because those \npeople in some cases will be denied employment because of data base \nmalfunctions. The cost to taxpayers of setting up the type of data base \ninvolved will be considerable, and the cost to average American \ncitizens who, because of this type of program, find they need new birth \ncertificates or new driver's licenses, will be considerable as well. A \nlot of costs, Mr. President.\n\n  The benefits, on the other side, are not very clear to me. First of \nall, as I have said in previous comments, those employers who intend to \nfire illegal aliens at lower-paying jobs or below the wage level they \notherwise would have to pay will get around any kind of verification \nsystem because they will not participate. To the idea that we will \ncreate a foolproof system, a card that defies any type of tampering or \ncounterfeiting, to me, is a remote possibility.\n  There will be plenty of costs and very few, in my view, benefits. \nRather than going down the route we went in 1986, it is our argument \nthat we understand, very simply, the losers here are the taxpayers, the \nemployers, the employees, the people playing by the rules. Those are \nthe folks we should be helping, Mr. President.\n  The balance of this legislation does exactly that, by cracking down \non the people who are violating this. I do not think we should take a \nstep other than in that direction. For those reasons, Mr. President, I \nstrongly urge passage of this amendment, support for the striking of \nboth the verification procedures as well as the procedure of the \ndriver's license and the birth certificate procedure.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I think this has been a very impressive \nand important debate. I commend Senator Abraham. I can see why the \npeople of his State placed him here. He will have a great career here. \nI wish him well. He is very able, formidable, and fair. We try to \nexpress to each other what is occurring on the floor, even though it \nmay be arcane and somewhat bizarre from time to time, but I always try \nto do that. To Senator DeWine and his participation, and Senator \nFeingold, a very thorough debate.\n  Now, the reason we set that unanimous-consent agreement is that there \nare at least several who have told me, ``I do want to get over and \nspeak on the amendment of Senator Leahy and Senator Bradley.'' I do not \nbelieve any further persons intend to debate on the issue of the \nAbraham amendment, but the reason we set the vote for 4 o'clock is to \nallow those who wish to debate the issues of Senator Leahy's amendment \nand Senator Bradley to come forward. If they do not, they are \nforeclosed as of 4 o'clock. I hope they realize that, that there will \nbe no further opportunity to address those two amendments, or three \namendments\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\n--the Abraham amendment, too--after the hour of 4 o'clock. Then we will \ngo to the order of the amendments as Senator Bradley, Senator Leahy, \nSenator Abraham, with the usual 2 minutes of debate.\n  Mr. President, let me inform the Chair that the majority leader has \ndesignated Senator Hatch as the manager of the bill for the present \ntime and that the majority leader has yielded 1 hour to me, in my \ncapacity as an individual Senator, for the purposes of being able to \ncomplete debate on the bill, because I only have 27 minutes left. That \nis the purpose of that. I promise I shall not expend any more on the \nother issue. Maybe on the birth certificate--I could do a few minutes \non that.\n  Well, I think I will since no one has come forward.\n  Let me indicate that I will speak a very few minutes on the issue of \nthe birth certificate, but if these Senators who are going to come \nforward immediately will notify me--I will yield to them--that will \nexpedite our efforts.\n  Let me just briefly remark about the birth certificate, because I \nthink it is very important that we understand that that is the \nfundamental ID-related document. I think it would be just as disturbing \nto the Senator from Ohio as it is to me. We do not have any way to \nmatch up birth and death records in the United States. That seems \nbizarre, but we do not. Maybe some States have tried to do that. One of \nthe questions that arose in the debate was, well, what will this do? \nOne thing it will do, which we do not do now, is that if it is known \nthat the person is deceased, the word ``deceased'' will be placed upon \nthat birth certificate, wherever that birth certificate is. Now, that \nis one of the advantages of the word ``deceased'' being stamped on a \nbirth certificate. You would think, surely, they must be doing that in \nthe United States of America. But they are not doing that in the United \nStates of America.\n  That is just one part of the proposal. Again, please recognize that \nthe motion to strike is directed toward the revised or amended form as \nit left the Senate Judiciary Committee, as I say, trying to work with \nall concerns, realizing that we cannot indeed satisfy all aspects; but \na good-faith attempt was done with regard to that.\n  Of course, the ID-related document that is the most fundamental. It \nproves U.S. citizenship, the most valuable benefit the country can \nprovide. As we all have indicated, it is the common breeder document \nused to obtain other documents, including a driver's license and a \nSocial Security number and card. That is the power of the birth \ncertificate.\n  With the birth certificate, plus the driver's license, and a Social \nSecurity card, a person can obtain just about any other ID-related \ndocument and would be verified as authorized to work and receive public \nassistance by nearly any verification system it is possible to \nconceive, including any system likely to be implemented in the \nforeseeable future.\n  Yet, the weird part of it is that this birth certificate--and it is a \nsacred document, the type of document that is pressed into the Bible; \nit is the book that goes into the safe deposit box--is the most easily \ncounterfeited of all ID-related documents, partly because copies are \nissued by 50 States, some with laws like Ohio, some with laws like \nWyoming--50 States and over 7,000 local registrars in a myriad of forms \nand political subdivisions and, as Senator Leahy indicated \nin committee, I think townships.\n\n  So how can anyone looking at a particular certificate know whether it \neven resembles a bona fide certificate? Furthermore, birth certificates \ncan readily be obtained in genuine form by requesting a copy of a \ndeceased person's certificate. And birth and death records are only \nbeginning--this is the very beginnings--to be matched. That is puzzling \nto me in every sense. In most States, it is only for recent deaths. So \nwe have a situation where people want to build a new identity. They try \nto get the certificate of a person who was born in the year they were, \nor near their own birth year, or died as an infant, perhaps, so that \nthe deceased person would not have obtained a Social Security card or \notherwise established an identity.\n  It is acknowledged by a great majority of experts that a secure \nverification system cannot be achieved without improvements in the \nbirth certificate, and in the procedures followed to issue it. Without \na secure, effective verification system, the current law prohibiting \nthe knowing employment of illegal aliens cannot be enforced. I \nemphasize current law because some of my colleagues argue as if this \nbill would put this provision into law, and that is not so. It need \nnot.\n  This is the law now. We are not putting this into the law. There is a \nsystem in the law. The issue simply is, do we here in Congress intend \nto take reasonable steps so that this part of current law can be \neffectively enforced? That is the problem. Do we want to do that?\n  Mr. President, without effective employer sanctions, illegal \nimmigration, including not only unlawful border crossing, but visa \noverstays, will not be brought under control. It is just that simple. \nThus, fraud resistant birth certificates and procedures to issue them \nare a crucial part of any effort to make that effective. In addition to \nimmigration and welfare advantages, a more secure birth certificate \nwill help us to reduce many more harms associated with fraudulent use \nof ID's, ranging from financial crimes--we will see ever more of \nthose--and then those through the Internet--and we will see more of \nthose--and through electronic and computer-based systems, to voting \nfraud, to terrorism. Accordingly, S. 1664 proposes significant reforms \nin birth certificates themselves, and in the procedures followed to \nissue them, and improvements of a similar nature for driver's licenses, \nwhich I think are critically important.\n  The final provision on birth certificates was drafted with assistance \nfrom the Association for Public Health Statistics and Information. I \nwant to share that with my colleagues. The National Association of \nState Registrars and Vital Statistics Offices--that was drafted with \ntheir assistance--these officials made very valuable suggestions to us, \nand they expressed their approval of the final language, which is here \nto be stricken. Additional improvements were made in the amendment I \noffered yesterday, which was accepted, and which will be stricken if \nthis amendment is passed.\n\n  I will just summarize the birth certificate provisions of the bill. I \nam using my time, but I will yield to my friend from Ohio. I emphasize \nto those who are waiting to come to the floor on the Bradley amendment \nor the Leahy amendment that their opportunity will close at 4 o'clock \non that procedure.\n  If my friend from Ohio has any comment at this time, I will save some \nof my time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and I \nagree with him that we have had a very spirited debate and, I think, a \nvery good debate--a debate that has covered, I think, most of the \nissues that we are going to cover here today.\n  Let me just state, on a couple of related subjects, the following. We \nhave, again, confirmed, I say to the Members of the Senate, this \nafternoon that this amendment is supported by the National Conference \nof State Legislators, the National Association of Counties, and by the \nNational League of Cities. All three organizations support this \namendment. Again, they emphasize they support it on the basis of cost--\ncost to them as local units of government--and they also support it on \nthe basis of the whole question of preemption. Once again, that is the \nFederal Government coming in and, frankly, telling them exactly what to \ndo.\n  Let me just make a couple of additional comments in regard to the \nissue my colleague from Wyoming was talking a moment ago about, which \nis birth certificates. To me, it is almost shocking when we think of \nthe implications of what this bill, as currently written, would do. I \nhave given the example here on the floor that when you turn 65, you are \nhopefully going to get Social Security and Medicare; at 16, in most \nStates, a driver's license, or try to get your driver's license; or you \nwill get married. For any of those purposes, you will have to get a \nbirth certificate, and your old birth certificate is no longer going to \nbe any good for that purpose.\n  Let your imagination run. You can think of all the other reasons why \nduring your lifetime you might need a birth certificate. Everybody can \njust about figure 270 million Americans are\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\nat some point in time going to need their birth certificates.\n  I suppose if you are over 65 and already on Social Security, and you \nare not traveling, I suppose some folks never are going to have to use \nthis new birth certificate and are never going to have to do what tens \nof millions of Americans are now going to have to do under the \nprovisions of this bill, which is to go and get new birth certificates.\n  Again, what we are saying in this bill and with this amendment, what \nwe are saying to 270 million Americans is, ``Yes, your birth \ncertificate is still valid, but you really just cannot use it much for \nanything. You will have to get a new one.'' That, to me, is onerous, \nwhether you travel overseas--how many of us have had occasion as \nMembers of the Senate or the House to get the frantic call from someone \nwho says, ``I am supposed to be going overseas and I had this passport. \nI cannot find it. I found out today it is expired. I am leaving in 5 \ndays, or 4 days.'' What if you had to add to all of the problems they \nhave to go through now, with the red tape, one more thing--you have to \ngo back and get a new birth certificate because that birth certificate \nwhich you have had all of these years will not work anymore. That might \nbe acceptable. At least, it would not be for me. I do not think it \nwould be.\n  If we could make the case that the reissuance of a new birth \ncertificate on this tamperproof paper, with all of the bells and \nwhistles prescribed by the Federal bureaucrats, if that would deal with \nthe problem--but maybe I am missing something in this discussion. I \nbelieve my colleague from Wyoming when he says it is the breeder \ndocument. I trust him on it. He has had enough experience on this. He \nhas talked about this problem. But it still is going to be a problem, \nand, in fact, it may be even worse of a problem, more of a problem.\n  There are States--and Ohio is one, but Ohio is not the only one--\nwhere you can get anybody's birth certificate. Let me repeat that: You \ncan get anybody's birth certificate. You walk into the county, and if \nsomeone was born there, you can get their birth certificate. You put \ndown $7; you can get 5, 20, or as many birth certificates as you want \nas long as you know the name of the people. You can get them. They are \npublic records.\n  What we are now saying is, instead of the old birth certificate copy, \nthese are going to be new ones. Obviously, they are more expensive--\ntamperproof, bells and whistles--with all of the things the printers \ntold us when we tried to find out what the cost would be, and they will \nhave them. So what? What is the protection? What is the protection if I \nhave walked in and Mike DeWine, at the age of 49, went in and got \nsomebody else's who is 49 and might look the same? I now have a birth \ncertificate. I do not see what has been accomplished. I do not see what \nwe have done in regard to this, even in States where it is more \ndifficult.\n  Again, instead of the breeder document, instead of the father \ndocument or the mother document, this may be the son, or the \ngranddaughter. This may be two generations away. It may be an illegal \nlicense, as my colleague still has displayed in the Senate here, maybe \nan illegal license that is the breeder document. I do not know.\n  Again, this is not going to solve the problem. My friend talks about \nnow the provision is in the bill that States should, if they know it, \nstamp on this birth certificate if the person is deceased. We can \nimagine how accurate that is going to be, or what percentage of these \nbirth certificates is going to ever be stamped with the deceased on \nthem. It may be a great idea. But, again, it is going to be a very, \nvery small percentage where the local clerk of the county is going to \nknow that someone is deceased. In some cases, they will, but in a great \nmajority of the cases, they will not. We live in a very mobile society, \nMr. President. This, I do not think, is going to help a great deal.\n  If you really want to make these tamperproof, what you are going to \ndo is require people to go in and, face to face, get their new birth \ncertificate. I do not think we are going to do that. I do not think we \nare going to say to a retiree who lives in North Carolina or who lives \nin Florida or lives in California, ``You have to go back to Cincinnati, \nOH, you have to drive back and get a new birth certificate.'' I do not \nthink anyone is going to make them do that. I do not think it is a \nserious idea. But yet, if you are going to make it tamperproof, you at \nleast have to do that, not allowing it to be by U.S. mail and getting \nanybody's birth certificate. I think it is very onerous, but I think it \nis not going to be effective. It is going to be no good at all.\n  In thinking about this, we ought to learn from our past mistakes. We \nought to learn from what this Congress has done in the past that we \nhave regretted. I have cast votes that I have regretted. I have cast \nvotes where I looked around and said later on that I was wrong. This is \nnot the first time we have tried in this Congress within recent memory \nto deal with a specific targeted problem by putting an onerous burden \non everybody. We have a finite problem. It is important. But the way we \ndeal with it, the way we would deal with it, without this amendment, is \nto put the burden on absolutely everyone, to say to 270 million \nAmericans that ``your birth certificate no longer is any good. You will \nhave to go get a new one.'' If you ever want to use it, you will have \nto say to every employer in this country that if you, in fact, want to \nhire someone, you will have to call a 1-800 number. You will have to \nseek permission from the Federal Government. I know there has been \ncomment on the floor about that not being the right terminology. That \nis what it is. You will have to check the person out and to do it by \nhow the Federal bureaucracy tells you how to do it. As an employee, you \nare going to be in the situation of arguing with a computer.\n\n  Again, I have had some experience in dealing with the criminal \nrecords system. Anybody who has dealt with any kind of big data base \nknows the problems. Someone gets turned down for a job or someone is \ntold after they have been hired that we have a problem. You need to get \nthis problem straightened out with the INS. You need to get this \nproblem straightened out with the computer data base. How many of us in \nthis world today enjoy dealing with computers, particularly in regard \nto one of the most important things in our lives, how to make our \nlivelihood?\n  So this is not the first time Congress has spread a burden among \nevery single American to deal with a few people. If history tells us \nanything, it tells us that people in this country ultimately will not \nput up with this.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples. Remember contemporaneous \nrecordkeeping for people who used their car in business? Remember when \nwe passed that? We did it because some people cheated on their taxes \nwhen calculating the business use of their car. Because of that fact, \nbecause some people cheated, Congress made all of the people who used \ntheir car in business to keep very detailed daily records. I was in the \nHouse when that happened. I was in the House when we started getting \ncalls. I was in the House when I would go out and have office hours and \nbe flooded by people who said, ``What is this? I do not keep records \nevery single day just because a few people cheat.'' What did we do, Mr. \nPresident? We did what we always do: We repealed it. It was a mistake.\n  Remember section 89 because some businesses discriminated in setting \nup the benefit plans for their employees? Congress made all businesses \ncomply with detailed recordkeeping to prove they were not \ndiscriminating. We did that. The public did not stand for that either. \nAnd, again, it was repealed. It happens every single time that we \nspread the burden among everyone for a very specific problem. In fact, \nI do not think Congress has ever had a provision as burdensome or \nreally as broad as this particular provision. This provision applies to \neveryone who wants to use a birth certificate or a driver's license--to \neveryone.\n\n  I submit, Mr. President, that we do this at our own peril. The public \nultimately is not going to stand for it. I think it is a very, very \nserious mistake.\n  Therefore, again, I urge my colleagues to pass the Abraham-Feingold \namendment. It is an amendment that is supported by a broad group of \nSenators, certainly across the political spectrum.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4490]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3865, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modified version of my \namendment, No. 3865.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3865), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the matter proposed to be \n     inserted by the amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the practice of female genital mutilation is carried \n     out by members of certain cultural and religious groups \n     within the United States;\n       (2) the practice of female genital mutilation often results \n     in the occurrence of physical and psychological health \n     effects that harm the women involved;\n       (3) such mutilation infringes upon the guarantees of rights \n     secured by Federal and State law, both statutory and \n     constitutional;\n       (4) the unique circumstances surrounding the practice of \n     female genital mutilation place it beyond the ability of any \n     single State or local jurisdiction to control;\n       (5) the practice of female genital mutilation can be \n     prohibited without abridging the exercise of any rights \n     guaranteed under the First Amendment to the Constitution or \n     under any other law; and\n       (6) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of \n     article I, the necessary and proper clause, section 5 of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment, as well as under the treaty clause of \n     the Constitution to enact such legislation.\n       (b) Criminal Conduct.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 7 of title 18, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 116. Female genital mutilation\n\n       ``(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), whoever \n     knowingly circumcises, excises, or infibulates the whole or \n     any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of \n     another person who has not attained the age of 18 years shall \n     be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 \n     years, or both.\n       ``(b) A surgical operation is not a violation of this \n     section if the operation is--\n       ``(1) necessary to the health of the person on whom it is \n     performed, and is performed by a person licensed in the place \n     of its performance as a medical practitioner; or\n       ``(2) performed on a person in labor or who has just given \n     birth and is performed for medical purposes connected with \n     that labor or birth by a person licensed in the place it is \n     performed as a medical practitioner, midwife, or person in \n     training to become such a practitioner or midwife.\n       ``(c) In applying subsection (b)(1), no account shall be \n     taken of the effect on the person on whom the operation is to \n     be performed of any belief on the part of that or any other \n     person that the operation is required as a matter of custom \n     or ritual.\n       ``(d) Whoever knowingly denies to any person medical care \n     or services or otherwise discriminates against any person in \n     the provision of medical care or services, because--\n       ``(1) that person has undergone female circumcision, \n     excision, or infibulation; or\n       ``(2) that person has requested that female circumcision, \n     excision, or infibulation be performed on any person;\n\n     shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than \n     one year, or both.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 7 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``116. Female genital mutilation.''.\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--Subsection (c) shall take effect on \n     the date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the modification I send to the desk is a \nmodification of the amendment regarding female genital mutilation. The \nmodified version of this amendment strikes the language requiring the \nthreat of female genital mutilation be made consideration for an asylum \nclaim.\n  I repeat, at this time I believe in the asylum aspect of it, but I \nunderstand the problems associated with this; that we would need to \nmake a better case to the committee and to this body. Therefore, I will \nnot go into the reasons why I think it should be made a basis for \nasylum. The fact of the matter is, we are not going to do it in this \nlegislation. We will look down the road to work with the committee to \nsee if we can come up with a basis for doing that.\n  I offer this modified version of my amendment today so we can \ncriminalize this torture in the United States, as a number of other \ncountries have already done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Senator from Nevada. This is not some issue \nthat he has come to in recent times, simply because of media attention. \nHe has been involved in this, and I have observed him with great \nadmiration. It is a serious issue. It is an issue of criminal activity. \nIt is an issue of assault. It is an issue of culture. And there is much \nto it.\n  As the Canadian experience has indicated, the problem, sometimes, \nwith bringing in an asylee is that soon thereafter, when other family \nmembers join, they have not only brought the victim but they bring the \nperpetrator. We will be glad to have some hearings on that. We will \ndiscuss that.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada. He has always been very helpful. \nThis is very helpful, that we do not go into the deep issue of asylum, \nbut that we make it a crime because at that point we will solve a great \ndeal of it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will just say in closing--and I would want \nspread on the record--that I have spoken personally with the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee in the House, Henry Hyde. He acknowledges \nthe brutality of this and has indicated on the bill that was signed by \nthe President last Saturday, the omnibus appropriation bill, there was \nthis provision that was taken out in conference.\n  That is not because of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the \nHouse that was taken out. He supports this issue. I hope my friend, as \nI know he will during the conference on this matter, will hang tough \nfor this issue.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3865), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3810\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I think we may be able to dispose of one of \nmy amendments just before the 4 o'clock vote. I will simply speak \nbriefly on this.\n  This is an amendment that says, ``To exempt from the deeming rules, \nimmigrants who are disabled after entering the United States.''\n  That is the current law. It simply goes back to the current law. It \nsets a safety net there. So that no one thinks all of a sudden people \nare going to claim that they are disabled, the amendment says, the \nrequirements of subsection (A) shall not apply with respect to any \nalien who has been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent \nresidence and who since the date of such lawful admission has become \nblind or disabled, as those terms are defined in the Social Security \nAct.\n  Social Security disability is not an easy thing to achieve, as my \ncolleagues here know. I will add, the amendment is endorsed by State \nand local governments. I think it makes sense, and I hope it can be \nadopted.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, we do have a Member ready to debate \nbriefly the Leahy or Bradley amendment. May we come back to that, \nplease?\n  I yield to Senator Hatch, whose time is limited. We certainly thank \nthe chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3780\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, with regard to the Leahy-Simon amendment, \nlet me say that this amendment is an improvement of the amendment that \nSenator Leahy offered in the Judiciary Committee, because it will \npermit for special summary exclusion procedures in extraordinary \nmigration situations. The amendment will remove summary exclusion \nprocedures where they could be problematic.\n\n  In particular, the amendment removes the summary exclusion procedures \nfor asylum applicants. Those would require that INS officers at\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\npoints of entry make threshold determinations of how an alien traveled \nto the United States and whether someone claiming asylum has a credible \nfear of persecution. This would present a burden to our INS officers at \nborders, who would now have to become experts in asylum law and would \nhave to perform additional bureaucratic functions.\n  I am also concerned about the harsh consequences that could result to \nasylum applicants who do have a valid claim but who may not speak \nEnglish, may not have the necessary proof of their claim with them, and \nthat sort of thing.\n  I also note that the INS has had success with reducing frivolous \nasylum claims. This provision seems unnecessary at this time and could \ncreate burdens on INS border agents, who should be focussing on other \nmatters.\n  This amendment also deletes provisions of the bill providing that an \nalien using fraudulent documents for entry is excludable and ineligible \nfor withholding of deportation. Many asylum applicants fleeing \npersecution may have to destroy their documents for various reasons and \nmay have to present fraudulent documents. The bill does provide for an \nexception for those who have a valid asylum claim. Accordingly, I do \nnot think those provisions of the bill are as problematic. but I think \nthat on the whole the provisions of the amendment are meritorious and I \nsupport the amendment.\n  I realize that the terrorism bill that came out of conference \nincluded summary exclusion provisions for asylum applicants. That \nprovision was primarily driven by some House Members and, although I \ndid not think it belonged in the terrorism bill, I knew that we would \ndeal with this here on the immigration bill. Accordingly, I do not \nthink it is inconsistent for those who supported the terrorism bill to \nsupport the Leahy asylum amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am going to support the Leahy asylum amendment \nbecause I think it is the right thing to do. I do like the changes he \nmade. Even though I voted against the amendment in committee, I think \nthe changes make the amendment a good amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3790\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the Bradley \namendment for a few minutes as well, and I appreciate my colleagues \ngiving me this opportunity.\n  This Congress is supposed to be about reducing the Federal \nbureaucracy. I must confess that I am perplexed about where the idea \nfor a new Federal bureaucracy is coming from. The administration \nopposes this provision for a new Office of Enforcement of Employer \nSanctions. It argues that this new Office would be duplicative of \nongoing programs within the INS and the Office of Special Counsel. In \nfact, the Attorney General's office suggests that a new office would \nnot only be a waste of money, but make the program even less effective.\n  The employer sanctions provisions of the Immigration Reform and \nControl Act of 1986 [IRCA] have not successfully controlled illegal \nimmigration. That is not simply my opinion, it is a fact.\n  Illegal aliens continue to pour into this country. A cottage industry \nin counterfeit and fraudulent documents has flourished, and an \nincreasingly lucrative black market in smuggling aliens into this \ncountry has thrived.\n  Employer sanctions do not work. If they did, we would not be debating \na verification system. If sanctions worked, we would not have the level \nof concern we presently have about the very issue of illegal \nimmigration. We would not have seen so much television footage of \npersons illegally crossing our borders by running against traffic on \nhighways in order to defeat vehicular pursuit. We would not have seen a \nship ground off of the New Jersey shore a few years ago loaded with \naliens to be smuggled into our country. We would not be reading about \nillegal aliens loaded onto boxcars which are then sealed south of our \nborder on their way north.\n\n  At the same time, sanctions have had serious adverse consequences. \nThough unintended, they are still very real. Some employers have \nengaged in illegal discrimination against Americans who look or sound \nforeign in order to avoid potential lawsuits, fines, and jail sentences \nunder IRCA's sanctions provisions. Further, the paperwork and related \nburdens on American businesses--as small as entities with just one \nemployee--impose costs onto the American consumer.\n  In my view, employer sanctions simply are not worth the price of \nincreased employment discrimination and increased burdens on small \nbusiness.\n  Let us speak for a few moments about the anticivil rights nature of \nemployer sanctions. The easiest way for an employer to avoid sanctions \nis to refuse to hire those who look or sound different. To be sure, the \nlaw penalizes such discrimination. But the law does not always catch up \nwith all the discrimination that occurs. So to place an incentive into \nthe law for discrimination is, I respectfully submit, truly \nunfortunate.\n  The Comptroller General's testimony before the Judiciary Committee on \nMarch 30, 1990, highlighting key issues in GAO's report to Congress on \nIRCA and the question of discrimination was quite simple and \nstraightforward: He stated that the GAO had found widespread \ndiscrimination as a result of IRCA.\n\n  The GAO said:\n\n       The results of our survey of a random sample of the \n     Nation's employers shows that an estimated 891,000 employers, \n     19 percent of the 4.6 million in the population surveyed \n     reported beginning discriminatory practices because of the \n     law.\n\n  The American people have a right to know these facts, and I think \nMembers of the Senate have a right to know these facts.\n  Notably, in 1994 the AFL-CIO Executive Council called for ``a \nthorough reexamination of * * * employer sanctions * * * and their \neffects on workers, as well as the exploration of changes and viable \nalternatives that will best meet our criteria of fairness and justice \nfor all workers.''\n\n\n     EMPLOYER SANCTIONS PLACE AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN ON BUSINESS, \n                      PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESS\n\n  Even those who have long disagreed with my position on sanctions \nhave, in effect, acknowledged that the current system does not work. \nThe failure is due, in part, to the number of work eligibility \ndocuments and the widespread use of fraudulent documents.\n  This bill seeks to address those deficiencies in some way, but \npotential improvement efforts have not yet been implemented, let alone \nevaluated. To assume, therefore, that the employer sanctions program \nwill now be more workable is simply wrong.\n  There is little evidence to support the assumption that employer \nsanctions have done anything more than increase discrimination and \nplace tremendous burdens on small business. While jobs may be a magnet \nfor illegal immigration, there is no evidence that the existence of \nsanctions has in any way deterred illegal immigrants from attempting to \nenter this country. These sanctions have been in effect for 10 years. \nThe problem of illegal immigration, as we all know, has gotten worse \nduring that period.\n\n  The employer sanctions regime, in effect, converts our Nation's \nemployers into guardians of our borders--that is the job for the Border \nPatrol and the INS.\n  I support many of the provisions in this bill, and I compliment my \ndistinguished colleague from Wyoming for the hard work he has done in \nputting this together. I support including strengthening our Border \nPatrol and curbing alien smuggling.\n  Our 10 years of experience with employer sanctions, however, offers \nmore than sufficient evidence that they do more harm than good.\n  Our employers have enough to do competing in the global marketplace \nwhile complying with hundreds of other Federal rules and regulations.\n  The appropriate response to a bankrupt policy with a 10-year history \nof all costs and no benefits should not be to throw more money at it. \nAnd most certainly, the appropriate response is not to create a new \nFederal bureaucracy to manage it.\n  Mr. President, I really believe that we should defeat this amendment, \nand I ask my colleagues to consider doing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Bradley amendment.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4492]]\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I hope people will support this \namendment. What is the problem with illegal immigration? Why are \nillegal immigrants coming to this country? Because they get jobs. \nEmployers hire them.\n  In 1986 we said, if an employer hires an illegal immigrant, taking \nthat job away from an American, that person can be fined, ultimately \ncan be put in jail for up to 3 years. Employer sanctions were the right \npolicy in 1986. The problem is, they were not enforced.\n  The number of inspections, the number of inspectors between 1989 and \n1995, dropped 50 percent. Employer sanctions should be enforced. If so, \nwe would have fewer illegal immigrants coming into this country. This \namendment simply creates a special enforcement office in the \nImmigration Service, allocates such funds to do the job, and says to \nthe Immigration Service, ``Enforce employer sanctions. Stop illegal \nimmigration.''\n  I am pleased to yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I do agree with the Senator's amendment. \nSenator Hatch and I respectfully differ on this. There are two things \nwrong with employer sanctions--lack of enforcement and fraudulent \ndocuments. This will solve one.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I use these few seconds to say I strongly agree with the Senator's \nopposition to this amendment. As we learned in committee, this is a \nduplication to add to this agency. Where is the $100 million going to \ncome from that this amendment provides for this agency? The Clinton \nadministration has been clear that they do not need it, that this would \nprobably make their lives more difficult in terms of fighting the \nproblem.\n  On a bipartisan basis in committee we were able to defeat this \nnotion. I hope we will not go backward on it on the floor. I thank the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Clinton administration, as my \ndistinguished colleague just said, opposes the creation of an office \nfor the enforcement of employer sanctions. The Congress should be about \ncutting the Federal bureaucracy, not adding to it. This bill throws \nanother $100 million of employer sanctions enforcement on top of the \n$43 million spent in the current year on worksite enforcement.\n  Sanctions have not worked. They are a burden on business, especially \nsmall business. They cause discrimination against those who look and \nsound foreign. The Judiciary Committee struck the office from the bill. \nFrankly, I urge the rejection of the Bradley amendment for those \nreasons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 3790, offered by the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. \nBradley.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \namendment No. 3790, offered by the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. \nBradley]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 26, nays 74, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 99 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--26\n\n     Akaka\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Exon\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Nunn\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n\n                                NAYS--74\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 3790) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3780\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Under the previous order, there \nwill now be two minutes of debate on the Leahy amendment.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is an important amendment. You each \nhave on your desk editorials from the Washington Times, the Washington \nPost, and the New York Times. They all agree and are in support of this \namendment.\n  Do not confuse asylum with illegal immigration. This speaks of \nAmerica's vital role in offering asylum. Senators Hatch, Kerry, DeWine, \nHatfield, and I have united on this because what we are saying is, if \nsomebody comes to this country trying to escape religious oppression, \npolitical oppression, or whatever, the mere fact that they have come \nhere under a false passport--usually the only way they can get out of \nthe country these escape--we should not have a low-level person be able \nto turn them back automatically for that.\n  Let them have a full asylum hearing. It does not do anything for \nillegal immigrants. But it makes sure that the U.S. promise of a fair \nhearing for those who are escaping religious or political persecution \ncan get it.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment would seriously impair the \nbill's provisions to expedite the exclusion of aliens who attempt to \nenter the United States surreptitiously, or through the use of \nfraudulent documents. You saw the ``60 Minute'' segment some time ago.\n  This is the scenario. The alien uses documents to board an airliner, \nthen disposes of the documents, and claims asylum. And that cannot be. \nThe amendment is not required to protect the deserving asylum \napplicants. We have a credible fear exception. If they have credible \nfear, they get a full hearing without any question. They simply show \nthat to a specially trained asylum officer, and not to just somebody \nwho is at a lower level. It is a significantly lesser fear standard \nthan we use for any other provision.\n  That is what we use with Hatians.\n  I yield two seconds to Senator D'Amato.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, if we pass this amendment what you are \nsaying is let people come in with illegal documents with just plain \npolitical persecution, and set them lose. They just continue.

Mr. President, I will not make the motion now, but \nimmediately after the 2 minutes of explanation on this amendment, I \nwill make the motion to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Are you asking for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. SIMON. I have not made the motion to table because we have not \nhad the final 2 minutes.\n  I move to table, Mr. President, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would not be appropriate at this time. It \nwill be necessary to wait until the time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, can we have order, now? This is an \nextremely important 2 minutes we are having here on this debate. I \nthink it is probably as important as any issue on the legislation. \nMembers ought to have an opportunity to be heard.\n  If we could still insist on order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. There will now \nbe 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would say this is an amendment brought \nby Senators DeWine, Feingold, Inhofe, Mack, Lott, Lieberman, Nickles, \nand myself. It represents an effort to strike from the bill a \nverification system that is a Government intrusive system to try to \nverify employment. In our view it will not succeed, but it will be very \ncostly, costly to employers, costly to employees who will be denied \njobs because it is impossible to perfect such a system, costly to the \ntaxpayers to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, and costly \nfor reasons that the Senator from Ohio will now address in terms of the \nneed for people to obtain new birth certificates in order to comply \nwith this legislation.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this bill says to 270 million Americans \nthat your birth certificate is still valid, but if you ever want to use \nit, you have to go back to the origin, the place you were born, and get \na new federally prescribed birth certificate that this Congress is \ngoing to tell all 50 States they have to reissue.\n  If you get a driver's license at age 16, when you turn 65 and you \nwant Social Security or Medicare, or you get married, or you want a \npassport, you are going to need your birth certificate, and that birth \ncertificate that you have had all these years no longer is going to be \nvalid for that purpose.\n  It is very costly. It is a hidden tax, and it is going to be a major, \nmajor mistake. It will be something I think, if we vote for it, will \ncome back and we will be very, very sorry.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this is the critical test of the \nlegislation. Without effective employer sanctions, the United States \nwill not achieve control over illegal immigration. Without an effective \nverification system, there cannot be effective employer sanctions. \nWithout more fraud-resistant birth certificates and driver's licenses--\nthis is my California variety, you can get them for 75 bucks--there \nwill never be an effective verification system.\n  This amendment strips the verification process that was in the bill \nand strips any ability to deal with the worst fraud-ridden breeder \ndocument, which is the birth certificate. I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Simpson is absolutely right. This \nis the most important vote we are going to have on immigration. It is a \nquestion of whether we are going to continue with document abuse or \nnot. That is the basic difficulty in terms of trying to protect \nAmerican jobs, as well as trying to limit the magnet of immigration, \nwhich is jobs. If we deal with that, we are going to stop the magnet of \nimmigration of people coming here illegally.\n  This is the heart and soul of that program. Otherwise, we are going \nto continue to get these false documents produced day in and day out. \nThis is the only way to do it. It is a narrow, modest program. If we do \nnot do it now, the rest of the bill, I think, is unworkable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 3752, offered by the Senator from \nMichigan [Mr. Abraham].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, let me commend you on a very forceful and \nfair procedure during these many months. It has been a rare privilege \nfor me to come to know you better and to know you as a legislator. You \nare fair, formidable, efficient, and effective. That is not just \nbecause of the win and lose issue. I would have said that under either \ncircumstance and meant it. And\n\n[[Page S4494]]\n\nSenator DeWine, dogged and determined. I would not want to be \npracticing law or doing much more of this with worthy adversaries such \nas Senator Spencer Abraham and Michael DeWine and my friend Russ \nFeingold from Wisconsin. I commend them all.\n  Someone came up to me said, ``Oh, you really are on a roll,'' and I \nsaid, ``I have been rolled for 6 months.'' The roll is not always in \nthe eye of the beholder. Win a few, lose a few, and you move on in good \ncamaraderie, good spirit. You are setting that tone as you occupy the \nchair after a very vigorous debate. You have learned the essence of the \nSenate: Do your work, give it your best shot, take a shot in the neck \nand a belt in the head, swallow hard and move on, shake hands with the \nadversary, and go off, have a great big pop or something else.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could have 30 seconds, I want to thank all those \nthat participated in that debate and discussion. I think the Members \nfound there were appealing arguments on all sides. I think as we find \nout on these immigration issues sometimes, when you prevail you are not \nalways right. It has been a constant learning experience because it \ninvolves human beings' behavior and trying to predict how people will \nreact to different suggestions and recommendations.\n  I join Senator Simpson and thank all those who are on different sides \nand those that were on our side for the courtesy and attention they \ngave to the debate and discussion.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me just comment, I have frequently said \non the floor we are too partisan, excessively partisan. It is true. But \nthis is a case where we discussed the issues, where on one side you had \nthe Simpson-Kennedy leadership, on the other side you had Senator \nAbraham and Senator Feingold. That is the way it should be on most \nissues. Very few issues, really, involve party political philosophy. \nWhether you won or lost on this issue, this is the way legislating \nought to take place.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3810\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I believe the pending amendment is my \namendment No. 3810, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, what this does--and this is not a \ncomplicated one--this simply says that we are going to go back to the \ncurrent law that if someone is disabled under the definition of the \nSocial Security Act, if you are blind or disabled, then the deeming \nprovision does not apply.\n  The pending bill requires that 100 percent of an immigrant sponsor's \nincome be deemed to the immigrants. Say your sponsor has a $30,000-a-\nyear income; it is totally unrealistic, among other things, to assume \nthat sponsor can provide $30,000 worth of support for the immigrant.\n  I hope we would keep the current law. I think it is simply sensible \nand compassionate as well as practical that we not move in this \ndirection. I know my colleague from Wyoming has a slightly different \nperspective on this. My amendment is supported by the National \nConference of State Legislatures, the Natural League of Cities and the \nNational Association of Counties.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague and friend for \nthis amendment. I think it is important to note that disabled persons \nare covered by this amendment only if they become disabled after the \nimmigrants arrive. It is unfair to make the sponsors foot the bill for \nunforeseen tragedies such as this. No one can predict when disability \nwill strike. It is a very small target, but it will make a very \nimportant difference to a number of individuals who are experiencing \nthis type of tragedy. I hope we might be able to see this amendment \nthrough and accept it.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, again, what seems to be so appropriate in \nimmigration matters often has a deeper tenor when we are talking about \nthe blind and the disabled. We all want to respond.\n  Let me say this: We only make the sponsor pay what the sponsor is \nable to pay. We are back to the same issue. This is a very singular \nissue, as were the amendments we voted on last night. The issue is, \nwhen you come to the United States of America as a sponsor, you are \nsaying that the immigrant you are bringing here will not become a \npublic charge. That is the law.\n  If you become disabled or blind and you go to seek assistance, the \nlaw provides that if your sponsor has a lot of money, you are going to \nget the money from the sponsor first. That is what we are going to do. \nIt does not matter what your level of disability; that is the law, or \nwill be the law under this bill. It will be clarified, it will be \nstrengthened, and that is what this is about. We are not saying that we \nare going to break the sponsor because the person is disabled. If the \nsponsor has tremendous assets, and you have a disabled or blind person, \nthat sponsor is supposed to keep their promise. Why should he or she \nnot? That was the promise made. Maybe they were not disabled at the \ntime. I understand that. But they become disabled and here they are. \nShould the taxpayers of America pick that up when the sponsor is \nfinancially able to do it?\n\n  But there is a little more to this here. The number of ``disabled \nimmigrants'' receiving SSI has increased 825 percent over the last 15 \nyears. That is an extraordinary figure. The number of disabled \nimmigrants receiving SSI has increased 825 percent over the last 15 \nyears. American taxpayers pay over $1 billion every year in SSI \npayments to disabled immigrants. The purpose of the requirement that \nimmigrants obtain the sponsor agreement is precisely to provide a \nreasonable assurance to the American taxpayer that, if they need \nfinancial assistance, it will come first from the sponsor and not from \nthe taxpayers.\n  It would actually be more reasonable to provide an exception, I \nthink, here, if the sponsor became disabled and it was impossible for \nthat sponsor to provide the support. Of course, please hear this: If \nthe sponsor has no income, there is no income to deem, and no exception \nis needed. You do not need to have an exception if the sponsor went \nbroke or if the sponsor cannot afford to do this. Then there we are. \nThe sponsor's income is not deemed, and then the taxpayers pick up the \nprogram, pick up the individual. That is where we are.\n  I urge all of us to remember, as we do these amendments, that they \nall have a tremendous emotional pull. We have seen the emotional pulls \nfor 11 or 12 days on this floor. But in each of these amendments \nrelated to deeming--whether it is blindness, whether it is disability, \nwhether it is veterans, whether it is kids, whether it is senior \ncitizens, whatever, plucks genuinely at your heartstrings--the issue is \nthat none of those people should become the burden of the taxpayers if \nthey had a sponsor that remains totally able, because of their assets, \nto sustain them. That is it. That is where we are. That was the \ncontract made. That is what they agreed to do, and that is the public \ncharge that we have always embraced since the year 1882, and which we \nare now trying to strengthen, and believe that we certainly will.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I will take 1 minute in rebuttal. The \nfigures that my friend from Wyoming cites are people, many of whom came \nhere disabled, and so they have ended up on SSI. This applies to people \nwho have become disabled after they have come here. I hope that the \namendment will be accepted.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Wyoming this. I have another amendment that I \nam ready with. The understanding is that we will stack the votes, is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. No, Mr. President, that is not my understanding. The \nleader is here. Mr. President, we will work toward some type of \nagreement if we can either lock things in, and maybe get time \nagreements. There are not many amendments, actually, left. There are \nsome place-holder amendments. But I cannot say that we will be stacking \nvotes.\n  Certainly, if you wish to present an amendment and go back-to-back on \nthat, we will certainly do that and maybe have 15 minutes on the first \nvote and 10 for the second. I think we can get a unanimous consent to \ndo that, with the approval of the leader, at an appropriate time, \naccording to the leader.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if this is acceptable to the Senator from \nWyoming, I will ask that we set aside the amendment I just offered so \nthat I may consider a second amendment that I have.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is perfectly appropriate with me, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside my \nfirst amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3813 to Amendment No. 3743\n\n      (Purpose: To prevent retroactive deeming of sponsor income)\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], for himself, Mr. \n     Graham, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3813 to amendment No. 3743.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike page 199, line 4, and all that follows through page \n     202, line 5, and insert the following: ``to provide support \n     for such alien.\n       ``(d) Exceptions.--\n       (1) Indigence.--\n       (A) In general.--If a determination described in \n     subparagraph (B) is made, the amount of income and resources \n     of the sponsor or the sponsor's spouse which shall be \n     attributed to the sponsored alien shall not exceed the amount \n     actually provided for a period--\n       (I) beginning on the date of such determination and ending \n     12 months after such date, or\n       (ii) if the address of the sponsor is unknown to the \n     sponsored alien, beginning on the date of such detemination \n     and ending on the date that is 12 months after the address of \n     the sponsor becomes known to the sponsored alien or to the \n     agency (which shall inform such alien of the address within 7 \n     days).\n       (B) Determination described.--A determination described in \n     this subparagraph is a determination by an agency that a \n     sponsored alien would, in the absence of the assistance \n     provided by the agency, be unable to obtain food and shelter, \n     taking into account the alien's own income, plus any cash, \n     food, housing, or other assistance provided by other \n     individuals, including the sponsor.\n       (2) Education assistance.--\n       (A) In general.--The requirements of subsection (a) shall \n     not apply with respect to sponsored aliens who have received, \n     or have been approved to receive, student assistance under \n     the title IV, V, IX, or X of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     in an academic year which ends or begins in the calendar year \n     in which this Act is enacted.\n       (B) Duration.--The exception described in subparagraph (A) \n     shall apply only for the period normally required to complete \n     the course of study for which the sponsored alien receives \n     assistance described in that subparagraph.\n       (3) Certain services and assistance.--The requirements of \n     subsection (a) shall not apply to any service or assistance \n     described in section 201(a)(1)(A)(vii).\n       (e) Deeming Authority to State and Local Agencies.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, but subject to exceptions equivalent to the exceptions \n     described in subsection (d), the State or local government \n     may, for purposes of determining the eligibility of an alien \n     for benefits, and the amount of benefits,under any state or \n     local program of assistance for which eligibility is based on \n     need, or any need-based program of assistance administered by \n     a State or local government (other than a program of \n     assistance provided or funded, in whole or in part, by the \n     Federal Government), require that the income and resources \n     described in subsection (b) be deemed to be the income and \n     resources of such alien.\n       (c) Length of deeming period.--Subject to exceptions \n     quivalent to the exceptions described in subsection (d), a \n     State of local government may impose the requirement \n     described in paragraph (1) for the period for which the \n     sponsor has agreed, in such affidavit or agreement, to \n     provide support for such alien.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that is cosponsored by \nSenator Graham of Florida, Senator Feinstein of California, and Senator \nMurray of Washington.\n  This amendment simply makes the deeming provisions prospective. Every \nonce in a while--not often in this body--we retroactively change the \nlaw. And three out of four times, we do harm when we do it. This simply \nsays to sponsors that this is going to apply prospectively.\n  Let me give you a very practical example. Let us say that, right now, \nbecause under the present law the only Federal programs that are \nsubject to deeming are AFDC, food stamps, and SSI. Without my \namendment, I say to my colleagues here from Michigan, Kansas, New \nMexico, and Wyoming, if a student is at a community college and getting \nstudent assistance of one kind or another, without this amendment, the \nsponsor who signed up for 3 years is responsible for 5 years, not just \nfor the three welfare programs, but for any Federal assistance.\n  I just think that is wrong. We ought to say it is prospectively. And \nI support Senator Simpson in this. Let us make it 5 years, but we \nshould not say we are going back to sponsors who signed up for 3 years, \nand say, ``Even though you signed up for 3 years, we are making it 5. \nAnd you thought you were only going to be responsible for three \nprograms--AFDC, food stamps, and SSI--but you are going to be \nresponsible for every kind of Federal program.''\n  Let me just add, the higher education community strongly favors my \namendment.\n  I think we ought to move in this direction. I think it is fair. I \nthink, again, three out of four times when this body tries to do \nsomething retroactively, we make a mistake. If we go ahead with this \nretroactively, we are going to make a mistake.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Graham, on the floor. I believe he wants \nto speak on this, too.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, here we are again dealing with the issue \nof deeming. When I said that my colleagues were persistent, I did not \nmean to leave out Senator Paul Simon of Illinois. In my experience of \n25 years knowing this likeable man, I know his persistence is indeed \none of his principal attributes.\n  He is back again with another deeming type of amendment. They are all \nvery compassionately offered. They are carefully thought through. But, \nagain, it is an issue we dealt with last night.\n  It is true, and he is right; he has found this provision that \nindividuals already in this country will not be the beneficiaries of \nthe new legally enforceable sponsor agreements. They are going to be \nvery strict. We have done a good job on that. The ones that will be \nrequired is after enactment.\n  It is also true that some of them who have been here less than 5 \nyears will nevertheless be subject to at least a portion of the minimum \n5-year deeming period. Thus, there could be a case where such an \nindividual would be unable to obtain public assistance because under \ndeeming they neither received the promised assistance from their \nsponsor nor were able to sue them for support.\n  But, again, let me remind my colleagues that no immigrants are \nadmitted to the United States if they cannot provide adequate assurance \nto the consular officer, or to the immigration inspector, that they are \nnot likely become a public charge, making that promise to the American \npeople that they will not became a burden on the taxpayers. If they do \nuse a substantial amount of welfare within the first 5 years, they are \nsubject to deportation under certain circumstances. That is not a swift \nprocedure. It is a thoughtful procedure.\n  I remind my colleagues again that major welfare programs already \nrequire deeming--AFDC, food stamps for 3 years, SSI for 5, even though \nsponsored agreements are not now legally enforceable. Furthermore, the \nPresident's own 1994 welfare bill proposed a 5-year deeming for those \nprograms. This would have applied to those who had only received the \nsponsor agreement to provide support for 3 years, an agreement that is \nnot legally enforceable.\n  So I just do not believe it is unreasonable for the taxpayers of this \ncountry to require recently arrived immigrants to depend on their \nsponsors for the first 5 years under all circumstances if the sponsor \nhas the assets. If the sponsor does not have the assets, we will pick \nthem up. We have never failed to do that.\n  It is only on that basis of assurance that they even came here \nbecause they could not have come here if they were to be a public \ncharge.\n  Regardless of the compassionate aspects of it, that is what we ought \nto do.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I had not intended to speak on this \nsubject, but we have now had about a half dozen amendments on this \ndeeming issue. It seems to me that the Senate has spoken on this issue. \nFar be it from me to say that our colleagues are infringing\n\n[[Page S4496]]\n\non our patience, but it seems to me this is a very clear issue. The \nAmerican people have very strong opinions about it. We have voted on \nit. I do not see what we gain by going over and over and over again \nplowing this same ground, or in this case dragging this dead cat which \nsmells rank back across the table.\n  Here is the issue. When people come to America, they get the greatest \nworldly gift you can get. They have an opportunity to become Americans. \nI am very proud of the fact that I stood up on the floor of the Senate \nand fought an effort that was trying to slam the door on people who \ncome to this country legally. I believe in immigration. I do not want \nto tear down the Statue of Liberty. I believe new Americans bring new \nvision and new energy, and America would not be America without \nimmigrants. But when people come to America, they come with sponsors, \nand these sponsors guarantee to the American taxpayer that the \nimmigrant is not going to become a ward of the State.\n  If you want to know how lousy the current program is, in the last 10 \nyears when we have had millions of immigrants come to America legally, \nhow many people do you think have been deported because they have \nbecome wards of the State? In 10 years with millions of legal \nimmigrants, we have had, I understand, 13 people that have been \ndeported. Obviously, the current system is not working.\n  What the bill of the distinguished Senator from Wyoming says is \nsimply this: When you sign that pledge that you are going to take care \nof these people until they can take care of themselves, we expect you \nto live up to your promise. We expect you to use your energy and your \nassets to see that the person you have sponsored does not become a \nburden on the taxpayers.\n  So what the bill does, in essence, is count the sponsor's income and \nthe sponsor's assets as yours for the purpose of your applying for \nwelfare.\n  It seems to me that we do not have anything to apologize about in \ngiving people the greatest worldly gift you can get, and that is \nbecoming an American. I do not think we ought to have any deviations, \nperiod, from this whole deeming issue. If you come to America, you have \na sponsor. They say they are going to take care of you. If things go \nwrong, we ought to go back on their assets.\n  But this idea that there ought to be some magic things that we are \ngoing to exempt--and we have seen all of these real tear-jerkers about, \nyou know, in this particular case, or that particular case--this is a \nprinciple where I do not think there ought to be any particular cases.\n  If people want to come to America, let them come to America, but let \nthem come with their sleeves rolled up ready to go to work. Do not let \nthem come with their hand out. If you want to live off the fruits of \nsomebody else's labor, go somewhere else; do not come to America. But \nif you want to come here and build your dream and build the American \ndream and work and struggle and succeed as the grandparents of most of \nthe Members, the parents of most of the Members of this body did, \nwelcome. We have too few people who want to come and work and build \ntheir dream.\n  But I think we pretty well settled this whole deeming issue. I think \nwe ought to get on with it. This is now a good bill. We have spoken. I \nthink we are at the point where people are ready to vote. I think after \na half dozen votes on this issue that, ``Well, you are exempt from \ndeeming if you are going to church to say a prayer and you trip and you \nbreak your back''--I mean, I think we have established the principle. I \ndo not think we have to go on plowing this ground over and over again.\n  The American people want people to come to work. They do not want \npeople to come to go on welfare. We have a provision in the welfare \nbill that is even stronger than the deeming provision in this bill. \nMaybe we could have a vote that says under any circumstances except \ndivine intervention that we stay with the provisions. We could vote on \nit and be through with it.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. My friend talks about the contract you sign. What I want \nto do is say the United States, which signs the contract with the \nsponsor, will live up to its side of the contract. That contract right \nnow is for 3 years for every sponsor. I am for moving to 5 years but \ndoing it prospectively. This bill says to the people who signed the \ncontract that Uncle Sam has changed his mind. He is going to make you \nresponsible for 5 years when you sign for 3 years.\n  Does the Senator from Texas think that is fair?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me respond by saying that I believe that when we are \ntalking about people coming to America, that is a great deal. I do not \nthink we have to second-guess it by saying that we are going to try to \nsee that after so many years you can get welfare. I personally believe \nthat until a person becomes a citizen, they ought not to be eligible \nfor welfare. I am for a stronger provision than the Senate has adopted. \nI do not think immigrants should be eligible for welfare until they \nbecome citizens and, therefore, under the Constitution must be treated \nlike everybody else, because under the Constitution there can be no \ndifferentiation between how they are treated as a natural-born American \nor nationalized. There is only one difference, and that is you cannot \nbecome President.\n  But here is the point. I think that ought to be the provision. That \nis not even what we are talking about here. We are talking about \nsomething much less, and that is the deeming provision. The point I am \nmaking is this:\n  The point I am making is this. We have voted on this thing a half a \ndozen times. I wish we could come up with every story or manipulation \nor hardship that we could get, put it all into one and vote on it and \nsettle it. That is all I wish to do.\n  Mr. SIMON. First of all, the Senator does not understand the \namendment, obviously.\n  Mr. GRAMM. No, I understand the amendment perfectly.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator then did not respond to my question. The \nquestion is whether Uncle Sam is going to live up to his contract. We \nsay to the sponsors you are a sponsor for 3 years. Now we come back \nwith this legislation and say, sorry, we are changing the contract. You \nthought you signed up for 3 years. We are going to make it 5 years.\n  I think that is wrong.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Would the Senator, if he wants to change the provision, \nchange it to say that immigrants are not eligible for welfare or public \nassistance until they become citizens?\n  Mr. SIMON. We already have a provision in here for 5 years. That is \nnot the issue. The issue is, are we going to go back, on this \namendment, retroactively and say to sponsors, sorry, Uncle Sam is not \ngoing to live up to his word; we are changing your contract from 3 \nyears to 5 years.\n  I think I know the Senator from Texas well enough--and, incidentally, \nhe has had a lot more amendments on this floor than the Senator from \nIllinois over the years.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not think so today.\n  Mr. SIMON. Not today.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object to amendments I am not participating in today.\n  Mr. SIMON. I am not complaining about the Senator from Texas offering \ntoo many amendments. But the question on this amendment--\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President. Let me just make a \npoint on the deeming issue. The only point I wanted to make is this. We \nhave had a half a dozen votes on it. The outcome has been the same each \ntime, and each time we have had a new amendment we have had some new \nsob story where we picked out a little blue-eyed girl 3 years old or \nyounger or something.\n  I am just saying I would like to settle the issue. I think the Senate \nhas decided on the deeming issue, and I think the decision that we have \nmade is you ought not to be able to come to America as an immigrant to \ngo on welfare. We are having to go about that in different ways through \ndifferent bills. My point is I do not know what the seventh or eighth \nor ninth amendment is going to do. I hope we will defeat these \namendments decisively and get on with passing a bill that the American \npublic wants.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to say to Senator Gramm, first, I \nam\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\ntotally, fully aware of the Senator's commitment to legal immigration, \nand I have personally told the Senator that I saw his speech in the \nChamber which had some personal aspects of the Senator's views because \nof his family, because of his wife and her family.\n  I have told the Senator of mine. Both of mine came over as little \nkids to Albuquerque from Italy. I was very lucky. I always say the only \ngood thing about the farm programs of Italy at the turn of the century \nwas they were so awful that kids like my folks could not make a living \nand so they sent them to America.\n  That is true. In my dad's family were six kids, and they had enough \nacreage, why, for 50 years before that they could all make a living. \nBut as bureaucracies grow, they had a farm policy, and they could not \nmake a nickel. So thank God for bad farm policy in Italy. That is why I \nam here.\n  From our earliest days, we did not intend that aliens be public \ncharges. This is not today. This is America when we accepted millions \nthat made America great. We had a philosophy that the public money \nwould not be used for aliens.\n  Now, that is not a mean, harsh policy. It is a reality. And I am \ntelling you what has happened. If it was a reality of the philosophy of \nAmerica in the early days, what has happened to it today is that nobody \npaid attention to the programs that they were applying for, so that \nMedicaid has, it is estimated, up to $3 billion--it could be that \nhigh--being paid to people who are aliens. That is $3 billion of public \ncharge when we probably never really intended it, for all of these did \nnot come in after deeming periods. Everybody knew the deeming periods \nand all that were irrelevant.\n  Why did they know that? The Senator just stated it. Nothing happened \nto them if they violated them. I had them on the witness stand. I asked \nINS, ``Could you enforce these?'' ``No, we cannot enforce them.'' I \nsaid, ``Do you think there are only 13?'' There are 1.2 million aliens \non one program--1.2 million people. I said, ``Could you enforce it? \nCould there be 500 of them that are illegal?'' I said, ``I think \nprobably there are 600,000 that should not be on there.'' I think that \nmight be so.\n  So I do not think this is an issue of changing the contract. In fact, \nthis is a whole new concept about deeming the resources of a sponsor \nliable for an alien before the citizens of America under taxes pay for \nit. And it is pretty patent to me that to say everything stays just \nlike it is for the past is just not fair to the American people.\n\n  We are talking about it is unfair to some certain patrons. We are \nstill saying--this bill is very generous because what it says is, if a \nsponsor does not have the money, they are back on public charge.\n  Did the Senator know that?\n  That is different than we were thinking of. That is a generous act on \nthe part of the chairman, saying, well, OK, if the ward does not have \nany money, then it does not do much good to deem them; they cannot pay \nfor it.\n  That is pretty generous. That is a whole new act of generosity on the \npart of America, if that becomes law.\n  Now, I would say it is fair because if you do not want that new act \nof generosity, then maybe we will go back to the old one. But you can \ncount on it: Up to the deeming period, we will not pay for you whether \nyour sponsor runs out of money or not because that was the law, albeit \nnever enforced.\n  So I think there are things on both sides of that scale of fairness, \nand, frankly, from my standpoint, I have been through so many efforts \nto cut back programs that Americans get angry at us about that are \nprograms for Americans that I thought we had to come here as \nbudgeteers--the Senator worked at it with me, I say to the senior \nSenator from Texas. We are over here saying, look, we cannot afford \neducation money, we cannot afford this. Why, here we have $3 billion \nmaybe, $1 to $3 billion in Medicaid going to aliens. And I am not sure \nthe public even knows that. Where should we save first? It seems to me \nwe should save by passing this bill. That is what I think.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Senator and Senator Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me review where we are and where the leader would like us to be. \nWe have the Simon amendment and two Graham amendments, Senator Graham \nof Florida, and Senator Feinstein will modify her amendment. Senator \nKyl and she have resolved any difficulty there. We will take that.\n  We would like to proceed with debate and try to have votes stacked \naround 7 or 7:30, if we could proceed with gusto, and I will try to do \nthat, too. It is very difficult. But that would be the pattern, if \nthere is further debate. And I concur with Senator Gramm. It is about \ndeeming, and we have addressed that last night and we will address it \nagain today.\n  Just remember one thing. We did not like this before. A few years \nago, we voted to extend deeming from 3 to 5 years for SSI, and we did \nthat to achieve savings for an extension of unemployment benefits. We \ndid not ask the sponsors. We just extended the deeming period, and we \nhave done that in the past.\n  I think those would be my final remarks on that. I wonder if we \nmight--unless there is some further discussion of that amendment, if we \nmight set that aside and go to Senator Graham.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the \namendment of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I see.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we had a lot of rhetoric, expressions of \nwhat we might have fantasized reality was, what we thought it might be; \nwords like ``we expect you to live up to your promise.'' All of those \nare patriotic, soaring statements, which have little to do with the \nreality of the amendment that the Senator from Illinois has offered.\n  What is the reality today, of the requirement of sponsors to their \nlegal alien sponsoree, who is in the United States? As the Senator from \nIllinois has pointed out, we Members of Congress have looked at all the \nprograms that we might wish to require deeming to apply to, that is to \nrequire the sponsor's income to be added to the alien's income in \ndetermining the alien's eligibility for programs. What have we decided? \nWe have decided we will require deeming for SSI, supplemental Social \nSecurity income, which primarily affects older aliens; we will require \ndeeming for food stamps; and we will require deeming for aid to \nfamilies with dependent children.\n  We could have passed deeming for Medicaid, we could have passed \ndeeming for college Pell grants and guaranteed Federal loans, we could \nhave passed deeming for weatherization and heating for low-income \npeople, we could have passed deeming for any one of the hundreds of \nprograms the Federal Government has that requires some form of means \ntesting in order to be eligible. But we decided thus far not to do so, \nbut to limit it to those three programs. As the Senator from Illinois \nhas pointed out, in two of those three programs the deeming period is 3 \nyears, not the 5 years that is being suggested here today.\n  But I think even more powerful is the fact that this Congress has \nknown for a long, long time that the courts have held the current \napplication, the affidavit signed by the sponsor, to be legally \nunenforceable. Let me read a paragraph from a letter from the office of \nthe Commissioner of INS on the issue of what is the enforceability of \nthese affidavits that sponsors sign. To quote from the letter:\n\n       In at least three States, however, courts have held that an \n     affidavit of support does not impose on the person who signs \n     it a legally enforceable obligation to reimburse public \n     agencies and provide public assistance to an alien.\n\n  The letter then cites a case, San Diego County versus Viarea, from \nthe California court, a 1969 opinion; the Attorney General versus \nBinder, an opinion from the State of our Presiding Officer, from 1959; \nCalifornia Department of Mental Hygiene versus Reynault, a case from \n1958; another case from New York dated 1959.\n  The letter goes on to state,\n\n       The Michigan Supreme Court has also held that Michigan \n     public assistance agencies may not consider the income of a \n     person who executed an affidavit of support to be an alien's \n     income in determining the alien's eligibility for State \n     public assistance programs.\n\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\n\n  That is a 1987 Michigan case, despite the fact that this income \ndeeming is permitted in determining eligibility for food stamps.\n  Finally, the Missouri Court of Appeals has held that an affidavit of \nsupport does not create an express or implied contract for the payment \nof child support on behalf of a child adopted by a former spouse. That \nis a 1992 opinion.\n  Mr. President, I cite these cases, not with the spirit of support but \nof the cold reality that this is the state of the law. So a person who \nhas sponsored an alien to come into the United States today has had the \nlegal expectation of the unenforceability of that affidavit and this \nCongress has, at least since 1958, been aware that courts were ruling \nthus and has not, until the action of the Senator from Wyoming, taken \nsteps to make these affidavits enforceable.\n  So the consequence of applying this new standard retroactively is \ngoing to be to substantially change the expectation of both the legal \nalien and the legal alien's sponsor, because now we are about to say \nthat an affidavit which the courts have consistently ruled to be \nunenforceable, we are going to breathe life into that affidavit and we \nare going to expand that affidavit to cover an indeterminate number of \nprograms for which there is some Federal financial involvement.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not disagree with the thrust of the idea that we \nought to be making these affidavits financially responsible, that we \nought to make them documents which have some legal enforceability. I am \nconcerned about the reach that we are about to apply to the number of \nprograms, but that is for another debate. But I think it is patently \nunfair to now say we are going to retroactively go back and make \naffidavits that have been unenforceable, enforceable, and expand them \nto an indeterminate number of programs.\n  The argument for doing so, for reaching back retroactively, is that, \n``We have two people who can pay. We have one person who can pay who is \nthe sponsor. We have the other person who can pay who is the Federal \ntaxpayer. It is better to force the sponsor to pay even if we do it in \nderogation of the understandings when the sponsor signed the affidavit, \nthan it is to continue to ask the Federal taxpayer to pay.'' I suggest \nthat is a false analysis of what is really going to happen. What is \nreally going to happen is not that the sponsor is going to pay \nretroactively, because I do not think we can legally breathe life into \na currently unenforceable affidavit. And I do not think the Federal \ntaxpayer is the party that is at final risk.\n  I suggest what is really going to happen is what the National \nConference of State Legislators has said. What really is going to \nhappen is what the National Association of Counties has said. What is \nreally going to happen is what the National League of Cities has said. \nWhat is really going to happen is what the National Association of \nPublic Hospitals and Health Systems has said. What is really going to \nhappen is what Catholic Charities USA has said. And that is that there \nis going to be a massive transfer of responsibility to the communities \nand States, and they will be asked to pick up these costs.\n  The most dramatic example of that is going to be in the area of \nhealth care. In the field of health care, we have the anomaly that, by \nFederal law, public hospitals are required to treat anybody with an \nemergency condition. By laws that we passed, they are prohibited from \nasking a person seeking emergency assistance, what is your income? What \nis your financial capability? So we are going to be encouraging people \nto get sick enough to come in and use the emergency rooms at the local \nhospital and then, with no one to pay and with the Federal Government \nno longer picking up part of the cost through Medicaid, they will \nbecome a massive burden on those hospitals and on the communities which \nsupport those hospitals.\n  The further irony of this is, this is going to be occurring in \ncommunities which are already paying a substantial burden because of \nthe Federal Government's failure to enforce its immigration laws and to \nhave provided adequately for the impact of these large populations. I \nknow it well in my own State, which is one of the States that is \nparticularly at risk under this proposal. Dade County, FL, Miami, has \nhad one of the fastest if not the fastest growing urban school systems \nin America in the last 10 years, primarily because of the massive \nnumbers of nonnative students who have entered that school system. It \nhas stretched the system to the breaking point.\n  Now we are about to say in this bill that the Federal Government will \nprovide less support to the education system of that and other stressed \ncounties, and that the Federal Government will restrict the funding for \nindividuals who would otherwise be eligible for these programs, \nretroactively, so that those costs will now become an additional burden \nof those already overburdened communities.\n  I think, Mr. President, in the fundamental spirit of fairness to all \nconcerned, and specifically to those communities that have already paid \na heavy price, that it is only fair and proper that we make this change \nof rules be prospective. Let us apply it to those people who come from \nthe enactment of this bill forward, who come with the understanding \nthat they are signing an affidavit, if they are a sponsor, that will be \nlegally enforceable; that they will know if they are coming as a legal \nalien what they are going to be able to expect once they arrive here.\n  I think it is patently unfair to change the rule for thousands of \npeople who are already here and then to have us, essentially, transfer \nthis financial responsibility to the communities in which they happen \nto have chosen to live.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge in the strongest terms the support of the \namendment of the Senator from Illinois, because without his amendment, \nI think this legislation carries with it the fatal flaw of fundamental \nunfairness.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I think we have perhaps completed the \ndebate on that amendment and we might set that aside and proceed to--my \nfriend from Massachusetts is not here.\n  Is there a second Graham amendment? Does the Senator from Florida \nhave any idea as to the time involved in the presentation of this \namendment? May I inquire, Mr. President, of the Senator from Florida if \nhe has any idea where we are, because so many people are involved--\napparently there is an Olympics banquet, many awards banquets. Many \npeople have asked for a window. I am perfectly willing to stand right \nhere until midnight and finish this bill. I would do that. If we can \nget an idea of time, that would be very helpful.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in response to the question of the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, the time to present this amendment, which is amendment \nNo. 3764, will be approximately 15 to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment of the Senator from Illinois be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is temporarily set aside. The Senator from \nFlorida is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3764 to Amendment No. 3743\n\n (Purpose: To limit the deeming provisions for purposes of determining \n   eligibility of legal aliens for Medicaid, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3764.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3764 to amendment No. 3743.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 201, strike lines 1 through 4 and insert the \n     following:\n       (3) Certain services and assistance.--The requirements of \n     subsection (a) shall not apply to--\n       (A) any services or assistance described in subsection \n     201(a)(1)(A)(vii); and\n       (B) in the case of an eligible alien (as described in \n     section 201(f)(1))--\n       (i) any care or services provided to an alien for an \n     emergency medical condition, as defined in section 1903(v)(3) \n     of the Social Security Act; and\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\n       (ii) any public health assistance for immunizations and \n     immunizable diseases, and for the testing and treatment of \n     communicable diseases.\n       (4) Medical Services for Legal Immigrants.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, for purposes of determining the eligibility for medical \n     assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act (other \n     than services for which an exception is provided under \n     paragraph (3)(B))--\n       (i) the requirements of subsection (a) shall not apply to \n     an alien lawfully admitted to the United States before the \n     date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) for an alien who has entered the United States on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the income and \n     resources described in subsection (b) shall be deemed to be \n     the income of the alien for a period of two years beginning \n     on the day such alien was first lawfully in the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the underlying bill, S. 1664, for the \nfirst time would deny to legal immigrants--legal immigrants--access to \nMedicaid through newly federally imposed or mandated deeming \nrequirements. This prohibition, as the discussion of the amendment of \nthe Senator from Illinois has indicated, will apply both prospectively, \nto persons who arrive after this bill is enacted, and retroactively, to \nlegal aliens who are already in the country.\n  My amendment changes the deeming period for Medicaid to 2 years. It \neliminates the retrospective nature of this provision, and it would \napply these provisions to future immigrants and provide for an \nexemption for emergency care and public health.\n  So to restate what the amendment does, the amendment changes the \ndeeming period for Medicaid to 2 years. Second, it eliminates the \nretroactive nature of the legislation in the same way that the \namendment of the Senator from Illinois would do to all of the deemed \nprograms. It would apply these provisions prospectively to future legal \naliens, and it would provide an exemption for emergency care and for \npublic health.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Conference of State \nLegislators. It is supported by the National Association of Counties. \nIt is supported by the National League of Cities. It is supported by \nthe United States Conference of Mayors. It is supported by the National \nAssociation of Public Hospitals. It is supported by the American Public \nHealth Association. It is supported by the National Association of \nCommunity Health Centers. It is supported by Interfaith, by the \nCatholic Charities USA and the U.S. Catholic Conference. It is \nsupported by the Council of Jewish Federations, the Lutheran \nImmigration and Refugee Services and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment today which I consider to be a \nsubstantial improvement of this bill. It is a substantial improvement \nby recognizing the fact that health services are different from other \nbenefits that a legal alien might seek.\n  While I strongly support the idea that sponsors should be required to \nprovide housing, transportation, food, cash assistance to legal aliens \nwho they have sponsored, legal aliens and the sponsor would be unable \nto provide for themselves, for whatever reason, reasonable access to \nthe health care which unpredictable illness and debilitating disease or \ninjury might impose.\n  Unlike cash assistance, housing or food, health care must be provided \nby a qualified professional, tailored to the specific diagnostic and \ntreatment needs. Ultimately, no amount of hard work and personal \nresponsibility can protect an immigrant or anyone else from illness or \ninjury.\n  My proposal would be to deem Medicaid for 2 years. That is, for the \nfirst 2 years that the legal alien is in the United States, the income \nof the sponsor will be deemed to be that of the alien.\n  This is a reasonable compromise with what I hope will have bipartisan \nsupport. It would not exempt Medicaid from deeming altogether. Instead, \nit would create a 2-year deeming period for the Medicaid Program alone.\n  As a result, this amendment eliminates the magnet, the draw or \nincentive to come to the United States in order to receive medical \ncare, especially since an immigrant cannot plan to get sick 2 years in \nadvance.\n  However, it does recognize that in the long run, health care is \ndifferent from other benefits. This amendment also recognizes and \nattempts to alleviate the tremendous other burdens, cost shifts, \nunfunded mandates and public health problems which potentially could be \ncaused by S. 1664.\n  What are some of these potential problems?\n  First, cost shifting. The Medicaid provisions in S. 1664 are \ncurrently nothing more than a cost shift to States, local governmental \nunits and our Nation's hospital system. Simply put, if people are sick \nand cannot afford to pay for coverage for some of the most disabling \nconditions, someone will absorb the cost.\n  The question is whether the Federal Government will pay a portion of \nthat cost, or will such costs be shifted entirely to those States and \nlocal governments and hospitals where legal aliens will seek those \nservices?\n  As the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National \nAssociation of Counties and National League of Cities wrote in an April \n24, 1996, letter:\n\n       Without Medicaid eligibility, many legal immigrants will \n     have no access to health care. Legal immigrants will be \n     forced to turn to state indigent health care programs, public \n     hospitals, and emergency rooms for assistance or avoid \n     treatment altogether. This will in turn endanger the public \n     health and increase the cost of providing health care to \n     everyone. Furthermore, without Medicaid reimbursement, public \n     hospitals and clinics in States and localities would incur \n     increased unreimbursed costs for treating legal immigrants.\n\n  The National Association of Public Hospitals, in their April 12, \n1996, letter added:\n\n       The [National Association of Public Hospitals] opposes a \n     deeming requirement for Medicaid. It will lead to an increase \n     in the number of uninsured patients and exacerbate an already \n     tremendous burden of uncompensated care on public hospitals. \n     * * *\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the effect of this \nbill's current provision will be to reduce Federal reimbursement for \nsuch Medicaid costs by $2.7 billion. This is nothing more than a \nmassive cost shifting to the States and local governments in which \nthese legal aliens reside.\n  The bill's deeming provisions, in addition to being nothing more than \na huge cost-shift to State and local governments, will also impose an \nadministrative burden and a huge unfunded mandate on State Medicaid \nprograms. In light of a series of calls throughout the year by the \nNation's Governors, the administration and this Congress have been \nasked to provide States with greater flexibility to more efficiently \nadminister their Medicaid programs. This provision is incredibly ironic \nand in sharp contrast to everything that we have been discussing in \nMedicaid policy over the last 2 years.\n  For a Medicaid case worker, who already has to learn the complex \nrequirements of the Medicaid program, he or she now must also learn \nimmigration law. As a study by the National Conference of State \nLegislatures notes, this would require an extensive citizenship \nverification made for all applicants to the Medicaid Program.\n  According to the Conference of State Legislatures:\n\n       These [deeming] mandates will require States to verify \n     citizenship status, immigration status, sponsoring status, \n     and length of time in the U.S. in each eligibility \n     determination for a deemed Federal program. They will also \n     require State and local governments to implement and maintain \n     costly data information systems.\n\n  In addition to all these costs, States will have infrastructure \ntraining and ongoing implementation costs associated with the staff \ntime needed to make these complicated deeming calculations. The result \nwill be a tremendously costly and bureaucratic unfunded mandate on \nState Medicaid programs.\n  This bill also threatens our Nation's public health. Residents of \ncommunities where legal aliens live would face an increased health risk \nfrom communicable diseases under this provision of the bill because \nimmigrants would be ineligible for Medicaid and other public health \nprograms designated to provide early treatment to prevent communicable \ndisease outbreaks.\n  Such policies have historically and consistently had horrendous \nresults. For example, in 1977, Orange County, TX, instituted a policy \nthat required people to prove legal status or be reported to the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service when requesting service at any \ncounty health facility.\n  As noted by El Paso County Judge Pat O'Rourke, in a letter dated \nSeptember 24, 1986:\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\n       . . . within eighteen months, the county experienced a 57 \n     percent increase in extrapulmonary tuberculosis, a 47 percent \n     increase in salmonella, a 14 percent increase in infectious \n     hepatitis, a 53 percent increase in rubella and a 153 percent \n     increase in syphilis.\n\n  The judge cites a 1978 report by the Task Force on Public General \nHospitals of the American Public Health Association in saying:\n\n       Hence, what was a simple condition requiring a relatively \n     small expense became a large matter adversely affecting all \n     taxpayers.\n\n  In an analysis of the potential health impacts of S. 1664, the bill \nbefore us this evening, conducted by Dr. Richard Brown, the president \nof the American Public Health Association and director of the \nUniversity of California at Los Angeles Center for Health Policy \nResearch, Dr. Brown states:\n\n       In a study of tuberculosis patients in Los Angeles, more \n     than 80 percent learned of their disease when they sought \n     treatment for a symptom or other health condition, not \n     because they sought a TB screening. Yet [S. 1664] would make \n     it more difficult for immigrants to seek diagnosis and \n     treatment because their access to health care would be \n     sharply reduced, permitting this debilitating and often \n     deadly disease to spread throughout the community. When an \n     infected person becomes seriously ill with tuberculosis, the \n     costs of treating these true emergencies will be borne by \n     everyone, especially taxpayers.\n\n  Dr. Brown concludes:\n\n       Tuberculosis and other communicable diseases do not respect \n     distinctions between citizens and non-citizens, legal \n     residents and people who are not here lawfully. The key to \n     controlling an outbreak of tuberculosis, hepatitis, sexually \n     transmitted diseases, or other communicable diseases is early \n     identification of the source of the infection and immediate \n     intervention to treat all infected persons. Because these \n     bills will discourage immigrants from seeking treatment, they \n     will endanger the health of everyone in the community.\n\n  In the interest of our Nation's public health, why, Mr. President, \nwhy would we wish to take such an unnecessary risk?\n  In addition, the Medicaid deeming provisions, by creating a obstacle \nto preventive health services, will result in certain cases of \nimmigrants resorting to emergency room care. Health care costs will \nthus be more expensive.\n  This would further strain the already overburdened and underfunded \nemergency and trauma care facilities across the country, particularly \nin our Nation's urban centers. Without reimbursements, such hospitals \nwill be forced to consider shutting their emergency room doors for all \nresidents of the county, affecting all residents, immigrants or \notherwise.\n  For example, Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami estimates that its \nuncompensated care costs for fiscal year 1995 for undocumented \nimmigrants was $45.8 million. To repeat, for 1995, in that one public \nhospital, Jackson Memorial in Miami, the cost in uncompensated care for \nundocumented aliens was $45.8 million. An additional $60 million in \nuncompensated care costs was attributed by Jackson Memorial Hospital to \nlegal aliens in the community. However, they currently do receive some \nreimbursement for care to legal aliens through private health care \nplans and Medicaid. Without the Medicaid payments, total uncompensated \ncosts will grow and require the local community to either raise its \ntaxes or consider reducing hospital services.\n  In addition, by reducing access of pregnant immigrant women to \nprenatal care and nutrition support programs, the health of the U.S.-\ncitizen infants will be threatened. The National Academy of Sciences' \nInstitute of Medicine estimates that for every $1 spent on prenatal \ncare, there is a $3 savings in future medical care for low birthweight \nbabies. Denying prenatal and well-baby care to an immigrant only \nthreatens the life of her U.S.-citizen child. Mr. President, that makes \nabsolutely no sense. In fact, it is neither cost effective nor in the \ninterest of public health.\n  Another concern raised by Catholic Charities USA is the potential for \nincreased abortions as a result of S. 1664.\n  To quote from the Catholic Charities U.S.A.,\n\n       The most immediate threat of the Medicaid deeming provision \n     is the pressure on poor pregnant women to end their \n     pregnancies inexpensively through abortion rather than to \n     carry them to term. A legal immigrant who becomes pregnant \n     and does not have the means to obtain health care will be \n     able to finance a $250 abortion at a local clinic much more \n     easily than either she or her sponsor can pay for prenatal \n     care or put down a $1,000 deposit at a hospital for labor and \n     delivery.\n\n  In summary, as currently drafted, S. 1664 would have the following \nnegative consequences: It shifts costs to States, local governments, \nand hospitals. It imposes an administrative unfunded mandate on State \nmedicaid programs. It threatens the Nation's or the public's health. It \nis not cost effective and it may lead to an increase in abortions.\n  My amendment would help address these problems. Therefore, it is \nsupported by the National Conference of State Legislatures, the \nNational Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the National Association of Public Hospitals, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, the National Association of \nCommunity Health Centers, InterHealth, Catholic Charities U.S.A., and \nthe U.S. Catholic Conference, the Council of Jewish Federations, \nLutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, and Evangelical Lutheran \nChurch of America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nimmediately after my remarks statements by several of these \norganizations in support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I close by saying that I regret we have \nhad to consider so many amendments that related specifically to the \nprovisions in this bill that will apply retroactively and prospectively \nthe income of a sponsor to the income of a legal alien--I emphasize \nlegal alien--for purposes determining eligibility for means-tested \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, if you represent the concerns of the millions of \nAmericans who are represented by these organizations, if you understand \nthe pragmatic reality of what we are about to do both to individuals \nand to the communities in which they live, and to the taxpayers in the \ncommunities and States in which you live, you would understand why \nthere have been so many amendments offered on this subject.\n  I believe that the amendment which I have offered is a reasoned \nmiddle ground. By setting a 2-year deeming provision it would give us \nassurance that no one would come to this country with a specific \ncondition--whether that be pregnancy or a known medical infirmity--in \norder to receive U.S. taxpayer-financed medical service. Very few \npeople are prophetic enough to know what their condition is going to be \n24 months from now. By providing that this will be prospective, all \npersons who come into this country from this point forward, from the \nenactment of this bill forward, will know under what conditions they \nwill be entering this country.\n  By exempting those programs that affect the public health and relate \nto emergency care, we will be recognizing the fact that those steps are \nnot just for the benefit of the individual but they are for the benefit \nof the broad public with its interest in continuing to have access to \nemergency facilities and to be saved from having unintended access to \ncommunicable diseases.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a constructive amendment which deals \nwith serious issues within this legislation. I urge its adoption.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         National Conference of State Legislatures, National \n           Association of Counties, National League of Cities\n                                                   April 24, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The National Conference of State Legislatures \n     (NCSL), the National Association of Counties, (NCAo), and the \n     National League of Cities (NLC) are very concerned about \n     unfunded mandates in S. 1664, the Immigration Control and \n     Financial Responsibility Act of 1996 that would be an \n     administrative burden on all states and localities. We urge \n     you to support a number of amendments that will be offered on \n     the Senate floor to mitigate the impact of these mandates on, \n     and cost shifts to, states and localities.\n       S. 1664 would extend ``deeming'' from three programs (AFDC, \n     SSI and Food Stamps) to all federal means-tested programs, \n     including foster care, adoption assistance, school lunch, WIC \n     and approximately fifty others. As you know, ``deeming'' is \n     attributing a sponsor's income to the immigrant when \n     determining program eligibility. It is unclear what ``all \n     federal means-tested programs'' means. Various definitions of \n     the phrase\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\n     ``federal means-tested programs'' would include a range of \n     between 50-80 programs. Furthermore, regardless of the size \n     of their immigrant populations, this mandate will require all \n     states to verify citizenships status, immigration status, \n     sponsorship status, sponsor's income and length of time in \n     the U.S. in each eligibility determination for ``all federal \n     means-tested programs.'' NCSL estimates that implementing \n     deeming restrictions for just ten of these programs will cost \n     states approximately $744 million. Extending deeming mandates \n     to over 50 programs garners little federal savings and should \n     be eliminated as part of the Congressional commitment to \n     eliminating cost shifts to state and local budgets and \n     taxpayers.\n       Therefore, we urge you to support Senator Bob Graham's \n     effort to raise a point of order against S. 1664 based on its \n     violation of P.L. 104-4, the Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995. \n     This is a critical test of your commitment to preventing \n     cost-shifts to, and unfunded administrative burdens on, \n     states and localities. We also urge you to support subsequent \n     amendments that will reduce the scope of the deeming \n     provisions and limit the administrative burden on states and \n     localities. These include:\n       Senator Graham's amendment giving deeming mandate exemption \n     to: 1) programs where deeming costs more to implement than it \n     saves in state or local spending; or 2) programs that the \n     federal government does not pay for the administrative cost \n     of implementing deeming. This ensures that new deeming \n     mandates are cost effective and are not unfunded mandates.\n       Senator Graham's amendment substituting a clear and \n     concrete list of programs to be deemed for the vague language \n     in S. 1664 requiring deeming for ``all federal means-tested \n     programs.'' This amendment ensures that Congress, and not the \n     courts, will decide which programs are deemed.\n       Senator Kennedy's amendment conforming Senate deeming \n     exemptions to those accepted by the House in H.R. 2202.\n       In addition, we urge you to support other amendments that \n     would temper the unfunded mandates in S. 1664 and relieve the \n     administrative burden on states and localities. We are \n     especially concerned about the impact of extending the \n     deeming requirements to the Medicaid program. Without \n     Medicaid eligibility, many legal immigrants will not have \n     access to health care. Legal immigrants will be forced to \n     turn to state indigent health care programs, public \n     hospitals, and emergency rooms for assistance or avoid \n     treatment altogether. This will in turn endanger the \n     public health and increase the cost of providing health \n     care to everyone. Furthermore, without Medicaid \n     reimbursement, public hospitals and clinics and states and \n     localities would incur increased unreimbursed costs for \n     treating legal immigrants. We support the following \n     compromise amendment to preserve some Medicaid eligibility \n     for legal sponsored immigrants.\n       Senator Graham's amendment to limit Medicaid deeming to two \n     years.\n       We strongly support amendments to exempt the most \n     vulnerable legal immigrant populations from deeming \n     requirements. We urge you to support the following amendments \n     that will preserve a minimal amount of federal program \n     eligibility for the neediest legal immigrants and protect \n     states and localities from bearing the cost of these \n     services.\n       Senator Kennedy's amendment exempting children and pre-\n     natal and post-partum care from Medicaid deeming \n     restrictions.\n       Senator Simon's amendment exempting immigrants disabled \n     after arrival from deeming restrictions.\n       Senator Leahy's amendment exempting immigrant children from \n     nutrition program deeming.\n       Finally, we firmly believe that deeming restrictions are \n     incompatible with our responsibility to protect abused and \n     neglected children. Courts will decide to remove children \n     from unsafe homes regardless of their sponsorship status and \n     state and local officials must protect them. Deeming for \n     foster care and adoption services will shift massive \n     administrative costs to states and localities and force them \n     to fund 100% of thee benefits. We urge you to support the \n     following amendments to protect states and localities from \n     this cost shift.\n       Senator Murray's amendment exempting immigrant children \n     from foster care and adoption deeming restrictions.\n       Senator Wellstone's amendment exempting battered spouses \n     and children from deeming restrictions.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our concerns and urge \n     you to protect states and localities from the unfunded \n     mandates in S. 1664.\n           Sincerely,\n     James J. Lack,\n       New York Senate,\n       President, NCSL.\n     Douglas R. Bovin,\n       Commissioner, Delta County, MI,\n       President, NACo.\n     Gregory S. Lashutka,\n       Mayor, Columbus, OH,\n       President, NLC.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    Catholic Charities USA Supports The Elimination Of The Medicaid \n    ``Deeming'' Requirement Included In The Immigration Reform Bill\n\n       S. 269 currently requires that the income and resources of \n     a legal immigrant's sponsor and the sponsor's spouse be \n     ``deemed'' to the income of the legal immigrant when \n     determining the immigrant's eligibility for all means-tested \n     federal public assistance programs, including Medicaid. The \n     deeming period would be a minimum of 10 years (or until \n     citizenship).\n       Catholic Charities USA supports the elimination of the \n     Medicaid deeming requirement for two main reasons. First, \n     requiring deeming for the Medicaid program ignores the \n     dichotomy between medical services and other need-based \n     assistance that Congress has followed since the inception of \n     Medicaid. For over 30 years, Congress has treated Medicaid \n     benefits for legal immigrants in a fundamentally different \n     fashion than other federal benefits programs. Historically, \n     Congress has never required deeming for Medicaid, recognizing \n     that no level of hard work and personal responsibility can \n     protect someone from illness and injury, and that payments \n     for medical care are significantly higher and more \n     unpredictable than payments for other necessities. In \n     addition, although an immigrant's sponsor or other charitable \n     individual may be able to share food and shelter--and even \n     income to a certain extent--a person cannot share his or her \n     medical care. Unlike housing or food, health care must be \n     provided by a qualified professional and must be tailored to \n     a person's specific health needs. In this sense, Medicaid is \n     substantively different than other needs-based assistance. S. \n     269 would end Congress' long-standing recognition of the \n     special nature of Medicaid.\n       Second, the Medicaid deeming requirement will lead to an \n     increase in the number of uninsured patients and exacerbate \n     an already tremendous burden of uncompensated care on public \n     hospitals and other providers who treat large numbers of low-\n     income patients. Although the bill would require the sponsor \n     to agree, in a legally enforceable affidavit of support, to \n     financially support the immigrant, many sponsors may \n     nevertheless be unable to finance the health care costs of \n     the immigrants, many sponsors may nevertheless be unable to \n     finance the health care costs of the immigrants they sponsor.\n       Finally, it should be noted that in order to qualify for \n     Medicaid coverage an individual must not only be very poor \n     but in addition must qualify under one of the vulnerable \n     categories that include pregnant women, children, the \n     elderly, and people with disabilities. Therefore, because of \n     the strict eligibility requirements for the Medicaid program, \n     legal immigrants who do qualify for coverage are very limited \n     in number and extremely vulnerable.\n       For these reasons, Catholic Charities USA supports the \n     elimination of the deeming requirement for Medicaid. Should \n     the elimination of deeming for Medicaid prove unworkable in \n     the current political context, we would support an amendment \n     to limit Medicaid deeming to the shortest time period \n     possible.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Medicaid ``Deeming'' for Legal Immigrants Should Be Limited to Two \n                                 Years\n\n       The Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act \n     (S. 1664), which is scheduled for Senate floor action on \n     April 15, proposes harsh new restrictions on immigrants who \n     are in this country legally. The bill denies Medicaid for a \n     minimum of ten years, or until citizenship, for immigrants \n     who have come to this country, worked hard, paid taxes, and \n     in every respect ``played by the rules.'' The bill does this \n     through a mechanism called ``deeming.''\n       How Deeming Works: To be eligible for Medicaid, an \n     individual must have sufficiently low income to qualify. \n     Deeming is a process where by a person's income is ``deemed'' \n     to include not only is or her own income, but also income \n     from other sources. S. 1664 requires a legal immigrant's \n     income to be deemed to include the income of the immigrant's \n     sponsor and the sponsor's spouse. In addition, the \n     immigrant's income is ``deemed'' to include the value of the \n     sponsor's resources, such as the sponsor's car and home. \n     Although a legal immigrant could well qualify for benefits \n     based on his or her own resources, many immigrants will \n     effectively be denied Medicaid because of their sponsor's \n     income and resources.\n       Catholic Charities USA opposes Medicaid deeming for the \n     following reasons:\n       The Risk of Increased Abortions: To most immediate threat \n     of the Medicaid deeming provision is the pressure on poor \n     pregnant women to end their pregnancies inexpensively through \n     abortion rather than carry them to term. A legal immigrant \n     who becomes pregnant and does not have the means to obtain \n     health care will be able to finance a $250 abortion at a \n     local clinic much more easily than either she or her sponsor \n     can pay for prenatal care or put down a $1000 deposit at a \n     hospital for labor and delivery.\n       Medical Needs are Unpredictable and Impossible to \n     ``Share:'' If an immigrant cannot provide for him or herself \n     S. 1664 requires that a sponsor provide housing, \n     transportation, food, or even cash assistance in some \n     circumstances. Although Catholic Charities USA opposes these \n     extensions of current law, we acknowledge a distinction \n     between these forms of assistance and the specific area of \n     medical care. Unlike housing or food, health care must be \n     provided by a qualified professional and tailored to a \n     persons's specific diagnostic and treatments needs. Although \n     a citizen may have enough income and resources to qualify as \n     a sponsor, the sometimes expensive and often unpredictable \n     nature of medical care may limit the sponsor's\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\n     ability to finance a sudden and drastic emergency.\n       Early Diagnosis and Treatment is Less Expensive Than \n     Emergency Care: Basic preventative and diagnostic services \n     treat conditions inexpensively before they become aggravated. \n     If such services are denied, relatively unthreatening \n     illnesses may turn into emergencies to be treated with much \n     more expansive and expensive means. For example, $3 is saved \n     on average for every $1 spent in prenatal care. Moreover, if \n     a legal immigrant is denied prenatal services, her child may \n     be born with serious conditions that will last an entire \n     lifetime. These children, born to legal immigrants, are \n     citizens who will be eligible for Medicaid.\n       The Cost of Denying Care is an Unfunded Mandate to be Borne \n     By Local Hospitals and Communities: Public hospitals in local \n     communities are required to treat anyone with emergency \n     conditions. If legal immigrants are denied medical services \n     and forced to let their illnesses deteriorate, local \n     hospitals eventually will be required to treat them as \n     emergencies. Since public hospitals are funded by local \n     taxpayers, this policy represents an enormous cost-shift from \n     the federal government onto state and local entities. \n     Although designed to reduce federal expense, the deeming \n     provision would essentially create an entirely new population \n     of uninsured individuals, force immigrants to wait until \n     their conditions become more expensive, and then mandate that \n     local hospitals serve them and pay for this service--all \n     effects that will have real-world financial repercussions for \n     citizens.\n       Denying Medical Services to Immigrants Endangers Entire \n     Communities: Due to the increased cost to local hospitals, \n     services will degenerate--not only for legal immigrants--but \n     for every person in the community who relies on that hospital \n     for care. If a portion of a hospital's budget is diverted to \n     cover the increased expense of handling emergency conditions, \n     less money will be available to finance services for \n     everyone. Perhaps more importantly, if immigrants are not \n     immunized or treated for communicable diseases, entire \n     communities will be at risk.\n       Immigrants Currently Finance Benefits for Citizens: Legal \n     immigrants are subject to the same tax laws as citizens. \n     However, as a group, legal immigrants pay more proportionally \n     in taxes than citizens. They also use fewer benefits than \n     citizens. Although some claim immigrants drain resources, \n     legal immigrants actually finance public assistance benefits \n     for citizens. Because of these factors, basic fairness \n     counsels against denying legal immigrants the same safety net \n     security as citizens. Immigrants should be able to rely on \n     support times of need in the same manner as other taxpayers, \n     especially since they have demonstrated that they require \n     such services less often.\n       Catholic Charities USA favors a reduced deeming period of \n     two years for Medicaid. A two-year deeming period would \n     substantially remove what some view as a ``draw'' for \n     immigrants entering the country solely to obtain medical \n     services, especially since an immigrant could hardly plan an \n     illness two years in advance. In addition, this compromise \n     would preserve the distinction between medical services and \n     other forms of assistance, recognizing that no amount of hard \n     work and personal responsibility can protect someone from \n     illness and injury. Although opponents may oppose such an \n     amendment because it won't reduce federal spending as much, \n     the effect of a longer period would be an exponential \n     increase in the cost to state and local entities. The bill \n     itself, by setting the deeming period at two years, \n     recognizes that a sponsor's liability should not continue \n     indefinitely. Catholic Charities USA believes a reduced, two \n     year deeming period for Medicaid is a viable compromise that \n     recognizes all of these concerns.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              The Health Effects of S. 1664 and H.R. 2202\n\n                      (By E. Richard Brown, Ph.D)\n\n       S. 1664 and H.R. 2202 threaten the health of immigrants and \n     of the larger community. They threaten the health of \n     immigrants and the larger community by making it more \n     difficult to control the spread of serious communicable \n     diseases and making it more likely that such diseases would \n     spread through the community, threaten the health of U.S.-\n     citizen infants by reducing the access of pregnant immigrant \n     women to prenatal care and nutrition support programs; and \n     threaten the health of immigrants by reducing management of \n     chronic illnesses and early intervention to prevent health \n     problems from developing into more serious ones, resulting in \n     more disability and higher medical costs both among \n     immigrants and their U.S.-citizen children.\n\n\n                  provisions of s. 1664 and h.r. 2202\n\n       Public health care services and publicly funded community-\n     based services are essential to control the progression and \n     spread of disease among low-income persons and communities. \n     These services are essential because a high proportion of \n     low-income immigrants do not receive health insurance through \n     employment, despite their high rates of labor force \n     participation. Because of their low incomes, they cannot \n     afford to purchase health insurance in the private \n     marketplace. Although uninsured immigrants pay a considerably \n     higher proportion of their incomes out-of-pocket for medical \n     services than do persons with insurance, they often cannot \n     afford an adequate level of medical care without the \n     assistance of public programs and publicly subsidized health \n     services.\n       S. 1664 and H.R. 2202 would impose such onerous financial \n     requirements on legal immigrants that they effectively \n     exclude millions of legally resident children and adult \n     immigrants from receiving any health services or nutrition \n     supplements. These bills also prohibit undocumented \n     immigrants from receiving all but emergency medical care from \n     any public agency or from community-based health services, \n     such as migrant health centers and community health centers. \n     These bills will reduce access to cost-effective primary care \n     and prevention and force immigrants to use expensive \n     emergency and hospital services--at increased cost to \n     taxpayers and poorer health outcomes for immigrants and the \n     larger community.\n\n                            Legal immigrants\n\n       Legal immigrants would become deportable if they \n     participate in Medicaid, virtually any state health insurance \n     or health care program that is means-tested, or any local \n     means-tested services for more than 12 months during their \n     first five years (seven years in the House bill) in the \n     United States. This provision would strongly deter most legal \n     immigrants from enrolling in Medicaid or otherwise obtaining \n     health services on a sliding fee-scale from a local health \n     department or any community health center, migrant health \n     center, or other community-based health service which \n     receives any federal, state or local government funds. \n     Receiving any combination of such benefits for a total of \n     more than 12 months would make the immigrant ineligible \n     for citizenship.\n       Furthermore, to determine eligibility for such services or \n     programs, the sponsor's income (and the income of the \n     sponsor's spouse) would be ``deemed'' available to the \n     immigrant. The bills would require that the sponsor's income \n     be combined with the immigrant's income until the immigrant \n     had worked for 40 quarters (at least 10 years) in which he/\n     she earned enough to pay taxes or until he/she became a \n     citizen. This provision would make most sponsored legal \n     immigrants ineligible for such benefits, even if they \n     maintain a separate household with substantial combined \n     expenses or do not have access to their sponsor's income.\n       These provisions make more stringent the conditions under \n     which legal immigrants may receive these public benefits, \n     lengthening the time during which they are potentially \n     deportable for receiving benefits, reducing the conditions \n     under which they may legitimately receive them, and extending \n     the ``deeming'' process to more programs and for a longer \n     period of time.\n\n                        Undocumented immigrants\n\n       Undocumented immigrant women would be barred from receiving \n     prenatal and postpartum care under Medicaid. States may \n     provide prenatal and postpartum care to undocumented \n     immigrant women who have continuously resided in the United \n     States for at least three years (the House bill excludes \n     pregnancy care altogether). The bills would allow \n     undocumented immigrants to receive immunizations and be \n     tested and treated for serious communicable diseases. Because \n     these provisions apply to any services provided or funded by \n     federal, state or local government, they prohibit most \n     community-based health services, such as migrant health \n     centers and community health centers, from providing primary \n     or preventive care to undocumented immigrants.\n       Undocumented immigrants currently are not eligible for any \n     means-tested health programs except emergency medical \n     services, including childbirth services (funded by Medicaid), \n     immunizations, and nutrition programs for pregnant women and \n     children. These bills extend this prohibition to prenatal and \n     postpartum care, and they extend to nearly all publicly \n     funded programs and services the prohibitions on providing \n     non-emergency care that formerly were restricted to Medicaid.\n\n\n                           Effects on health\n\n       These bills would maek it more difficult for low-income \n     immigrants, whether they are here legally or not, to obtain \n     preventive or porimary health care. By denying access to \n     cost-effective health services that can prevent or limit \n     illness, this legislation would increase the use of emergency \n     rooms and hospitals at greater cost to taxpayers and cause \n     more disability among immigrants.\n\n                    Prenatal care and birth outcomes\n\n       The provisions in these bills will result in an increased \n     number of low birthweight and higher death rates among U.S.-\n     citizen infants. The expanded ``deeming'' provisions would \n     prevent many legal immigrant women who are pregnant and needy \n     from qualifying for Medicaid, and the expanded threats of \n     deportation would discourage other needy legal immigrant \n     women from applying for Medicaid. The bills also would \n     prohibit pregnancy-related health services to most \n     undocumented immigrant women.\n       Denying inexpensive prenatal care to many pregnant women \n     will increase the health risks to the women and their U.S.-\n     citizen infants, all at great cost to federal and state \n     taxpayers. The National Academy of Sciences' Institute of \n     Medicine estimates that every $1 spent on prenatal care saves \n     $3 that otherwise would be spent on medical care for low \n     birthweight infants. A recent study by the California \n     Department of Health Services found that Medi-Cal hospital\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\n     costs for low birthweight babies averaged $32,800, thirteen \n     times higher than those of non-low birthweight babies \n     ($2,560). With no prenatal care, the expected hospital \n     medical costs for a baby born to a Mexican-American woman \n     with no prenatal care are 60% higher than if she had gotten \n     adequate prenatal care, or $1,360 higher per birth. The \n     American-born infants of immigrant mothers automatically \n     would be U.S. citizens, entitling them to medical care paid \n     for by Medicaid. These added medical costs may well exceed \n     any savings due to reduced Medicaid eligibility among \n     immigrant pregnant women.\n\n                     Management of chronic illness\n\n       These bills would prohibit undocumented and many legal \n     immigrants from using local health department clinics or \n     community-based clinics, such as migrant or community health \n     centers, for other than emergency care or diagnosis and \n     treatment for a communicable disease. High blood pressure, \n     diabetes, asthma, and many other chronic illnesses can be \n     managed effectively by regular medical care, which includes \n     monitoring of the condition, teaching the patient appropriate \n     self-management, and provision of necessary medication. When \n     diabetes goes untreated, it results in diabetic foot ulcers, \n     blindness, and many other complications. Uncontrolled high \n     blood pressure causes heart attacks, strokes, and kidney \n     failure, all of which lead to expensive emergency hospital \n     admissions. In the absence of regular care, people with these \n     controllable diseases will present repeatedly to hospitals in \n     severe distress, resulting in emergency and intensive care \n     for a much higher cost than periodic visits and maintenance \n     medication. Primary care and prevention are cost-effective \n     alternatives to use of emergency rooms, specialty clinics, \n     and hospitalization--and they preserve and improve the \n     person's functional status. As with pre- and postnatal care, \n     the costs of increased use of emergency and hospital services \n     are likely to offset any savings due to reduced use of \n     primary and preventive care.\n\n                         Communicable diseases\n\n       These bills would make it more difficult for undocumented \n     immigrants or legal immigrants to obtain care for \n     communicable diseases. Although they explicitly permit \n     undocumented immigrants to be diagnosed and treated for \n     communicable diseases, public health services throughout the \n     country are being restructured to eliminate dedicated clinics \n     for tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, and other \n     cummunicable diseases. Instead diagnosis, treatment, and \n     management of these health problems are being integrated into \n     primary care, which would be denied to undocumented \n     immigrants and most legal immigrants alike who cannot afford \n     to pay the full cost of these services. Without access to \n     primary care, immigrants would have few options to receive \n     medical attention for persistent illnesses. Coughs that do \n     not go away, fevers that do not subside, and rashes and \n     lesions that do not heal may be due to communicable diseases \n     such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, meningitis, or a sexually \n     transmitted disease.\n       Tuberculosis is prevalent among legal, as well as \n     undocumented, immigrants from Asia and Latin America. It is \n     easily spread if those who are infected are not diagnosed and \n     treated. In a recent study of tuberculosis patients in Los \n     Angeles, more than 80% learned of their disease when they \n     sought treatment for a symptom or other health condition, not \n     because they sought tuberculosis screening. Yet these bills \n     would make it more difficult for immigrants to seek diagnosis \n     and treatment because their access to health care would be \n     sharply reduced, permitting this debilitating and often \n     deadly disease to spread throughout the community. When an \n     infected person becomes seriously ill with tuberculosis, the \n     costs of treating these true emergencies will be borne by \n     everyone, especially taxpayers. The California Department of \n     Health Services estimates that it costs $150 to provide \n     preventive therapy to a tuberculosis-infected patient, but it \n     costs 100 times as much for a tuberculosis patient who must \n     be hospitalized--and more than 600 times as much if the \n     patient has developed a drug-resistant variety of \n     tuberculosis.\n       Tuberculosis and other communicable diseases do not respect \n     distinctions between citizens and non-citizens, legal \n     residents and people who are not here lawfully. The key to \n     controlling an outbreak of tuberculosis, hepatitis, sexually \n     transmitted diseases, or other communicable diseases is early \n     identification of the source of infection and immediate \n     intervention to treat all infected persons. Because these \n     bills will discourage immigrants from seeking treatment, they \n     will endanger the health of everyone in the community.\n\n\n                          administrative costs\n\n       S. 1664 and H.R. 2202 would impose substantial \n     administrative burdens on health care services to check \n     clients' immigration status and obtain information necessary \n     to ``deeming.'' These administrative costs include \n     interviewing clients and obtaining the information from them, \n     verifying the accuracy of information, training of staff, and \n     record keeping and processing. The administrative burden \n     includes obtaining information about the client's immigration \n     status, date on which the person entered the country, whether \n     the immigrant has a sponsor, whether the immigrant has worked \n     for 40 quarters during which they earned enough to have a tax \n     liability, and the income and resources of the immigrant, the \n     sponsor, and the sponsor's spouse. These administrative costs \n     must be borne by the program or service provider, except for \n     anti-fraud investigators in hospitals.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       1664 and H.R. 2202 will:\n       Reduce access of legal immigrants and undocumented \n     immigrants to primary care and preventive health services and \n     increase immigrants' use of emergency and hospital services;\n       Result in poorer health outcomes for immigrants and their \n     U.S.-citizen infants;\n       Increase the larger community's risk of contracting \n     communicable diseases;\n       Increase expenditures on emergency and hospital services, \n     offsetting savings due to reduced use of preventive and \n     primary care; and\n       Increase administrative costs for publicly funded health \n     care providers.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, may we set aside this amendment and go \ndirectly to the amendment of Senator Feinstein so she might modify a \nprevious amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The pending amendment No. 3764 is set aside.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3777, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Wyoming. Mr. President, I \nsend a modification to amendment 3777 to the desk.\n  The amendment (No. 3777), as modified, is as follows:\n       Beginning on page 10, strike line 18 and all that follows \n     through line 13 on page 11 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 108. CONSTRUCTION OF PHYSICAL BARRIERS, DEPLOYMENT OF \n                   TECHNOLOGY AND IMPROVEMENTS TO ROADS IN THE \n                   BORDER AREA NEAR SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated funds of $12 \n     million for the construction, expansion, improvement or \n     deployment of triple-fencing in addition to that currently \n     under construction, where such triple-fencing is determined \n     by the Immigration & Naturalization Service (INS) to be safe \n     and effective, and in addition, bollard style concrete \n     columns, all weather roads, low light television systems, \n     lighting, sensors and other technologies along the \n     international land border between the United States and \n     Mexico south of San Diego, California, for the purpose of \n     detecting and deterring unlawful entry across the border. \n     Amounts appropriated under this section are authorized to \n     remain available until expended. The INS, while constructing \n     the additional fencing, shall incorporate the necessary \n     safety features into the design of the fence system to insure \n     the well-being of Border Patrol agents deployed within or in \n     near proximity to these additional barriers.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, earlier I sent an amendment to the \ndesk on behalf of Senator Boxer and myself which relates to the triple \nfencing of the Southwest border, particularly in the vicinity of San \nDiego and Mexico. This is an amendment to that amendment which has been \nworked out with Senator Kyl and which I believe, hopefully will be \nacceptable to both sides. Senator Kyl and I have discussed this. We \nhave also discussed it with Doris Meissner, the INS Commissioner. We \nhave worked out language to which INS now agrees.\n  Essentially, the language would authorize the appropriation of $12 \nmillion for the construction, expansion, improvement, and deployment of \ntriple fencing. In addition, that currently under construction where \nsuch triple fencing is determined by the INS to be safe and effective, \nand in addition, bollard-style concrete columns, all weather roads, \nlow-light television systems, lighting sensors and other technologies \nalong the international land border between the United States and \nMexico south of San Diego, CA, for the purpose of detecting and \ndeterring unlawful entry across the border.\n  I believe this amendment in full is acceptable to both sides. \nCommissioner Meissner has also agreed to send a letter to \nRepresentative Hunter which would State that the INS is in the process \nof testing triple fencing, will continue that testing, and is prepared \nto add to it where it has proven to be effective and safe.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from \nCalifornia for the fine work that she has done here in conjunction with \nthe Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl. Both of you committed to the \nsame objective, both of you from States heavily affected, both of you \nmore aware of these things than any of us in this Chamber.\n  I insist in these remarks of all these past months that if there are \npeople\n\n[[Page S4504]]\n\nthat understand illegal immigration any better than the people of \nTexas, California, Florida, and Illinois--although not on the border of \nour country but yet one of the large States with a large number of \nformally undocumented persons; that I think has been corrected; but a \nlarge and sometimes vexing population. I think you have resolved that \nto the betterment of all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3777), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I believe now that the status of matters \nis that we have two Simon amendments that we will deal with.\n  Mr. SIMON. We have dealt with them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3764\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. We have not quite finished dealing with them. I had a \ncomment or two to make.\n  Mr. President, with regard to Senator Graham's remarks and his \namendment, I hope--and I will not be long--we have heard in that \namendment the revisitation of an old theme. The issue is very simple. \nAs we hear the continual discussion about taxpayers and what is going \nto happen to taxpayers--taxpayers this, taxpayers that--I have a \nthought for you. I will tell you who should pay for the legal \nimmigrant: the sponsor who promised to pay for the legal immigrant.\n  This is not mystery land. This is extraordinary. How can we keep \ncoming back to the same theme when the issue is so basic?\n  If you are a legal immigrant to the United States, this is such a \nbasic theme that I do not know why it needs to be repeated again and \nagain and again. But I hope it will be dealt with in the same fashion \nagain and again and again, because it is this: When the legal immigrant \ncomes to the United States, the consular officer, the people involved \nin the decision, and the sponsor agrees that that person will not \nbecome a public charge. That was the law in 1882. We have made a \nmockery of that law through administrative law judge decisions and \ncourt decisions through the years, where it is not just the ``steak and \nthe tooth,'' as my friend from Illinois referred to, there is no steak \nand no teeth in it.\n  And so, one of the most expensive welfare programs for the United \nStates taxpayers is Medicaid. Everybody knows it. The figures are huge. \nSenator Domenici knows it. He covered it the other day. They are huge, \nand we all know that. We know the burden on the States.\n  So all we are saying is the sponsor, the person who made the move to \nbring in the legal immigrant, is going to be responsible, and all of \nthat person's assets are going to be deemed for the assets of the legal \nimmigrant. So it does not matter what type of extraordinary situation \nyou want to describe to us all, and all of them will be genuinely and \nauthentically touching, they will move us, maybe to tears. I am not \nbeing sarcastic. Those things are real. They will be veterans, they \nwill be children, they will be disabled, they will be sick, and all we \nare saying is that the sponsor will pay first, which is exactly what \nthey promised to do. And so, if the sponsor, having been hit too hard, \nis pressed to bankruptcy, is pressed to destruction, is pressed \nwherever one would be pressed, then we step in, the U.S.A., the old \ntaxpayers step into the game --but not until the sponsor has suffered \nto a degree where they cannot pony up the bucks that they promised to \npay.\n\n  If the sponsor has the financial resources to pay for the medical \ncare needed by an immigrant, why on God's earth should the U.S. \ntaxpayers pay for it? That is the real question. That is one that is \neasy to debate.\n  Does any Senator in this Chamber believe that the taxpayers of this \ncountry would agree to admit to our country an immigrant if they \nbelieved that the immigrant would impose major medical costs on the \ntaxpayers, and that the immigrant sponsor would not be providing the \nsupport that they promised to pay? Now, that is where we are. That is \nwhere we have been. We can argue on into the night and get the same \nresult, I think, that we got last night and will get tomorrow--the \nissue being, regardless of the tragic nature of this situation, \nwhatever it is, the sponsor pays.\n  Then if you are saying, ``But if the sponsor cannot pay,'' we have \nalready taken care of that. If the sponsor cannot pay--goes bankrupt, \ndies, or whatever--the Government of the United States of America, the \ntaxpayers, will pick up the slack; but not until the sponsor has had \nthe slack drawn out of them--not to the point so they cannot live or \nbecome public charges themselves, but that is what this is about.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to slightly, again, correct the \nRecord. I know the Senator from Wyoming feels passionately about his \nposition. His position just happens to be at variance with the facts.\n  I will cite and read this and ask if the Senator would disagree that \nthese are the words in the United States Code 42, section 1382(j). This \nhappens to be one of the three areas in which this Congress, at its \nelection, has decided to specifically require that the income of the \nsponsor be added to that of the income of the legal alien for the \npurposes of determining eligibility for benefits. This happens to be \nthe program of Supplemental Security Income. Here is what the law says:\n\n       For the purposes of determining eligibility for and the \n     amount of benefits under this subchapter for an individual \n     who is an alien, the income and resources of any person who, \n     as a sponsor of such individual's entry into the United \n     States, executed an affidavit of support, or similar \n     agreement, with respect to such individual, and the income \n     and resources of the sponsor spouse shall be deemed to be the \n     income and resources of the individual for a period of 3 \n     years after the individual's entry into the United States.\n\n  That is quite clear. That is what the obligation of the sponsor was. \nThere is similar clarity of language to be found under the provisions \nrelating to Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps. So \nif a person wanted to know, what is my legal obligation when I sign a \nsponsorship affidavit, they could go to the law books of the United \nStates and read, with clarity, what those programs happen to be.\n  My friend from Wyoming, the reality is that this Congress, until \ntonight, has not chosen to place Medicaid as one of those programs for \nwhich such deeming is required. By failing to do so, and by doing so \nfor these three distinct programs, I think a very clear implication has \nbeen created that we did not intend, that there be deeming of the \nsponsor's income for the purposes of eligibility for Medicaid.\n  I believe that the kinds of arguments that are made by responsible \norganizations, such as the Association of Public Hospitals, is why this \nCongress, up until tonight, has not deemed it appropriate to deem the \nincome of the sponsor to the legal alien for the purposes of Medicaid.\n  If that argument was so persuasive in the past, why have we not added \nMedicaid to the list of responsibilities in the past?\n  Mr. President, I believe--the rhetoric aside--that the facts are that \nthere is clarity as to what the sponsor's obligation is today. No. 2, \nthat we are about to change that responsibility and make those changes \nretroactive, applying to literally hundreds of thousands of people. \nAnd, in the case of Medicaid, in my judgment, we are about to adopt \nlegislation that would have a range of negative effects, from \nincreasing the threat to the public health of communicable diseases, to \nendangering the already fragile financial status of some of our most \nimportant American hospitals, to increasing the likelihood that a poor, \npregnant woman would choose abortion rather than deliver a full-term \nchild.\n  And so, Mr. President, I believe that both the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Illinois and, immodestly, the amendment I have \npresented to the Senate represent the kind of public policy that is \nconsistent with the reality of our history of the treatment of legal \naliens--again, I underscore legal aliens--and should be continued by \nthe adoption of the amendments that will be before the Senate shortly.\n\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 3866\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request \ncleared with the minority.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make two minor technical \ncorrections to two provisions of amendment No. 3866 to the bill, S. \n1664.\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\n  The first correction corrects a printing error, by which a provision \nbelonging in one section of the amendment No. 3866 was inadvertently \nplaced in a different section.\n  The second correction is a minor change in the wording.\n  These two corrections have been cleared on both sides, and I ask \nunanimous consent that they be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification follows:\n\n       (1) Subsection (c) of section 201 of S. 1664, (relating to \n     social security benefits), as amended by amendment no. 3866, \n     is further amended to read as follows:\n       (c) Social Security Benefits.--(1) Section 202 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new subsection:\n\n                   ``Limitation on Payments to Aliens\n\n       ``(y)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and \n     except as provided in paragraph (2), no monthly benefit under \n     this title shall be payable to any alien in the United States \n     for any month during which such alien is not lawfully present \n     in the United States as determined by the Attorney General.\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any case where \n     entitlement to such benefit is based on an application filed \n     before the date of the enactment of this subsection.''.\n       (2) Nothing in this subsection (c) shall affect any \n     obligation or liability of any individual or employer under \n     title 21 of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code.\n       (3) No more than 18 months following enactment of this Act, \n     the Comptroller General is directed to conduct and complete a \n     study of whether, and to what extent, individuals who are not \n     authorized to work in the United States are qualifying for \n     Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits \n     based on their earnings record.\n       (2) In section 214(b)(2) of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act of 1980, as added by section 222 of S. 1664 \n     (relating to prorating of financial assistance), as added by \n     amendment no. 3866--\n       (A) strike ``eligibility of one or more'' and insert \n     ``ineligibility of one or more''; and\n       (B) strike ``has not been affirmatively'' and insert ``has \n     been affirmatively''.\n       (3) In the last sentence of section 214(d)(1)(A) of the \n     Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, as added by \n     section 224 of S. 1664 (relating to verification of \n     immigration status and eligibility for financial assistance), \n     as added by amendment no. 3866, insert after ``Housing and \n     Urban Development'' the following: ``or the agency \n     administering assistance covered by this section''.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I think we can go forward. We now, so \nthat our colleagues will be aware, are in a position to vote on three \namendments. We will likely do that in a short period of time.\n  The Feinstein amendment has been resolved.\n  There is a Simon amendment on disability deeming, a Simon amendment \non retroactivity deeming, and the Graham amendment that we have just \nbeen debating with regard to 2-year deeming.\n  We have many of our colleagues who apparently are involved with the \nOlympic activities tonight passing on the torch, and some other \nactivity.\n  There is a Gramm amendment on the Border Patrol and a Hutchison \namendment on Border Patrol. Those will be accepted. There is a Robb \namendment which will be accepted.\n  I inquire of the Senator from Florida if he has any further \namendments. At one time there was a list. I wonder if there is any \nfurther amendment other than the pending amendment from the Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. I have one other amendment that relates to the \nimpact on State and local communities of unfunded mandates. I \nunderstand that there may be a desire to withhold further votes after \nthe three that are currently stacked. If that is the case, I would be \npleased to offer my next amendment tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank our remarkable staff. And \nElizabeth certainly is one of the most remarkable. I think we can get a \nvote here in the next few minutes on three amendments which are 15 \nminutes in original time and 10 on the second two with a lock-in of \ntomorrow to take care of the rest of the amendments on this bill. We \nmay proceed a bit tonight with the debate. That will be resolved \nshortly.\n  But the Senator from Florida has one rather sweeping amendment on \nwhich we will need further debate, will we not; more than 15 minutes \nperhaps?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I anticipate it will require more than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I see. I would probably have that much on the other \nside.\n  Then I have one with Senator Kennedy and share with my colleagues \nthat I do have a place holder amendment. It is my intention, unless \nanyone responds to this, not at this time but tomorrow--you will recall \nthat Senator Moynihan placed an amendment at the time of the welfare \nbill with regard to the Social Security system having a study, that \nthey should begin to do something in that agency to determine how to \nmake that card more tamper resistant. It was cosponsored by Senator \nDole. It passed unanimously here. That would be an amendment that I \nhave the ability to enter unless it is exceedingly contentious. I \nintend to do so because it certainly is one that is not strange to us, \nand the date of its original passage was--so that the staff may be \naware of the measure, that was in the Congressional Record of September \n8, 1995, page S12915, directing the Commissioner to develop--this is \nnot something that is immediate--to be done in a year, and a study and \na report will come back. There is nothing sinister with regard to it, \nbut it is important to consider that.\n\n  We have an amendment of Senator Robb, and apparently an objection to \nthat amendment from that side of the aisle. I hope that might be \nresolved.\n  Let me go forward and accept the Gramm amendment, the Hutchison \namendment, and if you have those, I will send them to the desk.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3948 to Amendment No. 3743\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress regarding the critical \n  role of interior Border Patrol stations in the agency's enforcement \n                                mission)\n\n  On behalf of Senators Gramm and Hutchison, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], for Mr. Gramm, for \n     himself, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Domenici, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3948 to amendment No. 3743.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FINDINGS RELATED TO THE ROLE OF INTERIOR BORDER \n                   PATROL STATIONS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Immigration and Naturalization Service has drafted \n     a preliminary plan for the removal of 200 Border Patrol \n     agents from interior stations and the transfer of these \n     agents to the Southwest border.\n       (2) The INS has stated that it intends to carry out this \n     transfer without disrupting service and support to the \n     communities in which interior stations are located.\n       (3) Briefings conducted by INS personnel in communities \n     with interior Border Patrol stations have revealed that \n     Border Patrol agents at interior stations, particularly those \n     located in Southwest border States, perform valuable law \n     enforcement functions that cannot be performed by other INS \n     personnel.\n       (4) The transfer of 200 Border Patrol agents from interior \n     stations to the Southwest border, which would not increase \n     the total number of law enforcement personnel at INS, would \n     cost the federal government approximately $12,000,000.\n       (5) The cost to the federal government of hiring new \n     criminal investigators and other personnel for interior \n     stations is likely to be greater than the cost of retaining \n     Border Patrol agents at interior stations.\n       (6) The first recommendation of the report by the National \n     Task Force on Immigration was to increase the number of \n     Border Patrol agents at the interior stations.\n       (7) Therefore, it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (A) the U.S. Border Patrol plays a key role in apprehending \n     and deporting undocumented aliens throughout the United \n     States;\n       (B) interior Border Patrol stations play a unique and \n     critical role in the agency's enforcement mission and serve \n     as an invaluable second line of defense in controlling \n     illegal immigration and its penetration to the interior of \n     our country;\n       (C) a permanent redeployment of Border Patrol agents from \n     interior stations is not the most cost-effective way to meet \n     enforcement needs along the Southwest border, and should only \n     be done where new Border Patrol agents cannot practicably be \n     assigned to meet enforcement needs along the Southwest \n     border; and\n       (D) the INS should hire, train and assign new staff based \n     on a strong Border Patrol presence both on the Southwest \n     border and in interior stations that support border \n     enforcement.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. This amendment has been cleared by both sides of the \naisle.\n\n[[Page S4506]]\n\n It has to do with the Border Patrol, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. May I make an inquiry? Is this the amendment that says, \nin effect, that if Border Patrol personnel are relocated from the \ninterior assignment to the assignment in a border position, that there \nhas to be some coordination with the law enforcement agencies in the \ncommunities from which the personnel are being relocated?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, that would be the Hutchison amendment, \nnot this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That will be next, the Hutchison amendment?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes. The one that is before the body is the sense of the \nCongress regarding the critical role of the interior Border Patrol \nsaying that it plays a key role in apprehending and deporting \nundocumented aliens and plays a critical role in the agency's \nenforcement mission and serves as a valuable second line of defense. \nRedeployment of Border Patrol agents at interior stations would not be \ncost-effective, and it is unnecessary in view of plans to nearly double \nthe Border Patrol agents over the next 5 years, and INS should hire, \ntrain, and assign new staff based on a strong Border Patrol presence, \nboth on the Southwest border and interior stations that support border \nenforcement.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am not going to object to either of \nthese amendments, but I would like to raise the concern that currently \nthere is a great deal of apprehension by interior law enforcement, that \nis, law enforcement that is not directly on the Nation's border, at the \nlevel of support being provided by INS and the Border Patrol.\n  I might state that I recently met with a group of law enforcement \nleaders from the central part of my State who stated that the common \npractice was that for the first 6 to 9 months of the year, if they had \nan illegal alien in detention, the Border Patrol or appropriate other \nINS officials would come and take custody of that individual. During \nthe last 3 to 6 months of the fiscal year depending on the status of \nthe budget of the INS, nobody would show up, and therefore the law \nenforcement officials were in the position of either making a judgment \nto release the individual or to continue them in detention at their \nexpense and oftentimes on a questionable legal basis for continued \ndetention.\n  I raise this phenomenon to say I hope that as the INS and the Border \nPatrol look at the redeployment of resources that this legislation is \ngoing to call for it is more than just a coordination with local law \nenforcement but, rather, that there is an affirmative effort made to \nassure that the capability to assume responsibility for and detain \nillegal aliens wherever they are determined in the United States is a \nhigh priority of the agencies.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, perhaps we could go ahead--since there \nwas no objection to that amendment, I certainly withhold the other one \nbecause it does address what the Senator from Florida is saying. So I \nurge adoption of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3948) was agreed to.\n\n\n                   nutrition programs and immigration\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate agreed to include an \namendment which I submitted to the immigration bill. This amendment \naddresses the serious problem of adding to the administrative load of \nthe already overburdened nutrition programs.\n  I met a couple of weeks ago with the Vermont School Food Service \nAssociation and they expressed tremendous concern over the additional \nworkload this bill would add to their schools. Marlene Senecal, Connie \nBellevance, and Sue Steinhurst of the American School Food Service \nAssociation urged me to take action as did Jo Busha, the State director \nof child nutrition programs.\n  For the school lunch and breakfast programs the ASFSA estimated that \n14,881 new staff would have to be hired nationwide to handle the \nadditional paperwork of verifying citizenship status for each child and \nworking with the INS.\n  If the average salary of new staff is $25,000 to $30,000 a year we \nare talking about a huge burden for schools--at least $370 million per \nyear.\n  The magnitude of this unfunded mandate imposed on schools could drive \nthousands of schools off the school lunch and breakfast program.\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures are also concerned that \nthe bill, as written, places a huge unfunded mandate on local schools, \nlocal governments, and State agencies.\n  This bill also inflicts complex sponsor deeming procedures regarding \nlegal immigrants in most Federal programs, including child nutrition \nprograms, and WIC.\n  ``Deeming'', the practice of counting a sponsor's income as that of \nan immigrant's when calculating eligibility for Federal programs, would \nadd unnecessary bureaucratic burdens on local and State administrators, \nschools, child care providers, and WIC clinics.\n  Those already burdened will be forced to spend more time filling out \nforms and less time providing for the poor and disadvantaged.\n  States like Vermont, with very few immigrants, will still be affected \nby the additional administrative burden.\n  Also, denying these benefits to pregnant immigrant women will lead to \nincreased costs for taxpayers. It is estimated that for every dollar \nWIC spends on pregnant women $3 is saved in future Medicaid costs. We \nwill end up paying far more through Medicaid to take care of children \nwith low birth rates.\n  Regardless of the citizenship status of these mothers, their children \nwill be U.S. citizens and eligible for means tested programs.\n  And, ironically, States with large native American populations who \nbenefit from the food distribution program on Indian reservations would \nhave been forced to verify the citizenship of their native American \ncitizens.\n  The American School Food Service Association, the National Conference \nof State Legislatures, and others, are very concerned about the \nadditional mandates and administrative duties that would have been \nimposed upon schools and States by the ``deeming'' requirements and the \nimmigrant determination process as they affect child nutrition \nprograms.\n  Most soup kitchen and food bank programs are run by volunteers. \nRequiring volunteers to do alien status checks and income verification \nwith sponsoring families would be nearly impossible, but hiring staff \nfor this purpose would use donated funds in ways not intended by those \nmaking the donations.\n  School lunch and breakfast programs are run by local schools who \nstruggle with increasing administrative and overhead costs. Requiring \nthem to closely monitor immigrant status and sponsor incomes would have \nburdened them greatly according to the American School Food Service \nAssociation. Fifty million children attend school each school day in \nthe United States.\n  Similar arguments can be raised for other child nutrition programs \nsuch as the WIC Program.\n  My amendment also corrected what I believe are some drafting errors \nin the bill and makes additional improvements.\n  First, on page 180, ineligible aliens are disqualified from receiving \npublic assistance except for certain programs such as those under the \nNational School Lunch Act, the Child Nutrition Act, and other \nassistance such as soup kitchens if they are not means tested.\n  This language omits several programs such as the commodity \nsupplemental food program which is an alternative to WIC in many areas \nof the country.\n  There is no reason I can think of for pregnant women getting WIC \nbenefits to be treated differently from pregnant women getting the same \nbenefits under the Commodity Supplemental Food Program which was the \nprecursor to WIC, and is still operated in about 30 areas around the \nNation.\n  Also, the soup kitchen program, the food bank program and the \nemergency food assistance program could be considered to be means \ntested so they would not be exempt either.\n\n[[Page S4507]]\n\n  These programs provide emergency food assistance to families and I \ndoubt if anyone intended to treat them differently from the nutrition \nprograms already exempted.\n\n\n                     harkin-byrd-daschle amendment\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined with my \ncolleagues, Senators Harkin and Daschle, in sponsoring an amendment to \nthis bill which requires the Attorney General to ensure that every \nState has at least 10 full-time active duty agents from the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service. Currently, West Virginia is one of only \nthree States that does not have a permanent INS presence. Our amendment \nrectifies that problem.\n  As the debate on this bill has shown, the Senate is determined to \nstrengthen our current laws with respect to immigration, particularly \nillegal immigration. But whatever we pass, whatever new laws we fashion \nto combat the serious problem of illegal immigration, they will mean \nlittle if we are not also willing to provide the tools and support to \nenforce those laws.\n  Mr. President, In America today, illegal immigration is not simply a \nCalifornia problem, or a Texas problem, or a New York problem. On the \ncontrary, it is a national problem that impacts on every one of the 50 \nStates. Obviously, my State of West Virginia does not suffer the \nconsequences associated with illegal immigration to the same degree as \ndo other States. But I believe that if we are to have a coherent \nnational policy, a policy based on stopping the hiring of illegal \naliens and swiftly deporting those who are here illegally, then every \nState must be brought into our enforcement efforts. And that means \nproviding every State, not just some States, with the law enforcement \ntools they need.\n  Clearly, every State needs a minimum INS presence to meet basic \nneeds. By providing each State with its own INS office, the Justice \nDepartment will, I believe, save taxpayer dollars by reducing not only \ntravel time for those agents who must now come from other areas, but \nalso jail time per illegal alien, since a permanent INS presence would \nsubstantially speed up deportation proceedings.\n  Moreover, there is a growing need to assist legal immigrants and to \nspeed up document processing. How are employers--who will be mandated \nunder this bill to aggressively work to deter the hiring of illegal \naliens--going to receive the administrative help they need without the \nassistance of local INS personnel?\n  Mr. President, this amendment makes sense, good common sense. It is a \nmodest proposal that I believe will send a clear message that we are \nserious in our commitment to enforcing our immigration laws. \nConsequently, I am pleased to have sponsored the amendment, and equally \npleased that the Senate has included it in the current bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. And now I have a unanimous-consent request to propose.\n  I ask unanimous consent that votes occur on or in relation to the \nfollowing amendments at 7:15 p.m., with 2 minutes equally divided for \ndebate between each vote: Simon amendment No. 3810, Simon amendment No. \n3813, Graham amendment No. 3764.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Now, with that having been accomplished, we will I think \nbe able to accommodate you, all of our colleagues, by finding out \ntonight and wrapping up everything so that we will finish this measure \ntomorrow. That will be I think attainable from what I see at the table, \nand I think my colleague from Massachusetts will agree. And we will \nthen proceed at 7:15.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 60 minutes of Senator \nDaschle's time be allotted for Senator Graham and 60 minutes of Senator \nDole's time be allotted to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I may ask the Senator from Wyoming, as I understand \nit, that would leave the Graham, Chafee and Simpson amendments \nremaining for consideration on tomorrow. Is that the Senator's \nunderstanding? That would be at least my understanding. If we are \nmissing something, some Member out there has a measure that we have not \nmentioned, we hope at the time of the vote they will mention it. We are \nnot urging other Senators to add more to the list. But that is at least \nmy understanding. I will be glad to hear from others if that is not \ncorrect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I might have more than one amendment tomorrow.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, we can all have more than one amendment. \nI hope the Senator from Florida will assist us in buttoning this down. \nIf there is another amendment or two other amendments, let us button it \ndown and get it to rest. We do have a Robb amendment, I say to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, which has an objection on that side of the \naisle.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand the Robb amendment has been withdrawn.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Withdrawn?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Withdrawn.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. There is a Hutchison amendment which has been questioned \nby the Senator from Florida. There is a Simpson-Kennedy amendment with \nregard to verification. And then there is a place holder amendment \nwhich I intend to present, the Moynihan-Dole amendment, which passed \nunanimously in September, to allow the Social Security Administration \nto begin, nothing more, a study to determine how in the future we are \nto make that system more tamper resistant. It is not anything that goes \ninto place. It is a report. And those who were involved at the time \nwill recall.\n  That is what I have. That is the extent of it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Since we have another moment then, is it the intention, \nafter we dispose of this, to at least make a request that only those \namendments which have been outlined now be in order for tomorrow? And \nthat it would at least be our attempt during the evening time to try \nand get some time understandings with those----\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is being done at the present time, all of that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The leader will be out here, I am sure, shortly, but we \nwould start then early and try and move this through in the course of \nthe day.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. This matter will be concluded. The staffs on both sides \nof the aisle are working to present that to us in a few moments, to \ntighten and button down a complete agreement on time agreements and \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The leader will outline the plan for the rest of the \nevening. Is it the Senator's understanding that those three amendments \nwill be the final voting amendments for the evening?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I think that would be the case. The leader is not here, \nbut I think conjecture would have it be so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will wait on that issue until the leader makes a \nfinal definitive decision. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank my colleagues.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent, in the \nvoting to take place at 7:15, that the first vote at 7:15 be 15 minutes \nand the subsequent votes 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                         Vote On Amendment 3810\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nNo. 3810. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Kassebaum] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced, yeas 30, nays 69, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4508]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 102 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--30\n\n     Akaka\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--69\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnston\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kassebaum\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3810) was rejected.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to lay the motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3813\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate now is Simon \namendment No. 3813. There are 2 minutes to be divided equally between \nthe sides.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is a relatively simple amendment. If \nanything, this area is simple. If you are a sponsor of someone coming \nin, you sign up for 3 years. The Simpson bill says we go to 5 years. I \nam for that prospectively. I do not believe it is right for Uncle Sam \nto rewrite the contract and say, ``You signed up for 3 years, now you \nare responsible for 5 years.'' That is what happens without my \namendment.\n  I favor the 5 years prospectively, but I think if Uncle Sam signs a \ndeal, Uncle Sam should be responsible. He should not change a contract. \nThat is true for a used car dealer. It certainly ought to be true for \nUncle Sam.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. It is true that individuals already in the country will \nnot be the beneficiaries of new legally enforceable sponsor agreements \nthat will be required after enactment. It is also true that some of \nthose, those who have been here less than 5 years, will nevertheless be \nsubject to at least a portion of the minimum 5-year deeming period.\n  I remind my colleagues, however, that no immigrant is admitted to the \nUnited States if the immigrant does not provide adequate assurance to \nthe consular officer and commissioner and the immigration inspector \nthat he or she is not likely to become a public charge. In effect, that \nis a promise to the American people that they will not become a burden \nto the taxpayers, under any circumstance.\n  Mr. SIMON.

Under the previous order, the \nquestion occurs on amendment No. 3764 offered by the Senator from \nFlorida, Senator Graham.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator would like to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the amendment, which will next be voted \non, would do three things: One, it will say that the application of \ndeeming to Medicaid will be only for a period of 2 years. Second, it \nwill exempt emergency care and public health services. Third, it will \napply prospectively.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is supported by groups, which range \nfrom the Catholic Conference to the League of Cities. They support it \nfor a set of common reasons. They understand that the public health \nwill be at risk if we deny Medicaid to this population of legal aliens, \nand that there will be a massive cost shift to the communities in which \nhospitals, which are obligated to provide medical services that will \nnow no longer be reimbursed in part by Medicaid, are located. Catholic \nCharities is concerned about an increase in abortion, as poor pregnant \nwomen would find it economically necessary to seek an abortion rather \nthan pay the cost of a delivery.\n  For all of those reasons, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment, like so many others \nbefore, would reduce the sponsor's responsibility for their immigrant \nrelatives they bring to the United States on the basis that they will \nnot become a public charge. This amendment would nearly eliminate \ndeeming for Medicaid, the most costly and expensive of all of the \nwelfare programs. Medicaid deeming would be limited to 2 years.\n  The sponsors who promised to provide the needed assistance should pay \nthe health care assistance, as long as they have the assets to do so. \nOtherwise, the taxpayers pick up the tab.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator request the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I also ask that Senator Byrd have whatever \ntime he wishes under his control prior to the vote.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nintention to offer a point of order prior to the vote on the Dole-\nSimpson amendment. Is that provided for?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.

VANCOUVER NATIONAL HISTORIC RESERVE.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established the Vancouver \n     National Historic Reserve in the State of Washington \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Reserve'', consisting \n     of the area described in the report entitled ``Vancouver \n     National Historic Reserve Feasibility Study and Environmental \n     Assessment'' published by the Vancouver Historical Study \n     Commission and dated April 1993 as authorized by Public Law \n     101-523 (referred to in this section as the Vancouver \n     Historic Reserve Report'').\n       (b) Administration.--The Reserve shall be administered in \n     accordance with;\n       (1) the Vancouver Historic Reserve Report (including the \n     specific findings and recommendations contained in the \n     report); and\n       (2) the Memorandum of Agreement between the Secretary of \n     Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park \n     Service, and the City of Vancouver, Washington, dated \n     November 14, 1994.\n       (c) No Limitation on FAA Authority.--The establishment of \n     the Reserve shall not limit;\n       (1) the authority of the Federal Aviation Administration \n     over air traffic control, or aviation activities at Pearson \n     Airpark; or\n       (2) limit operations and airspace in the vicinity of \n     Portland International Airport.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n\n  The bill (H.R. 1296), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I strongly support the passage of this \nimportant environmental legislation. Taken together, these measures \nrepresent the most significant and important conservation package to \ncome before the Senate in over a decade. They will preserve and protect \nfor future generations important natural resource and historic \ntreasures of this country as well as providing critically needed \nmanagement authorities.\n  For the most part, the measures contained in this package have \nlanguished on the Senate floor due to holds and delaying tactics from \nSenators. I want to congratulate the majority leader, Senator Dole, for \nhis successful efforts to end the seemingly endless parade of obstacles \nto the passage of this legislation. Had we less rhetoric and a modicum \nof rational assistance from the administration, we might have \naccomplished this far earlier. We all observed the administration's \ngame plan and the willingness of the media to cater to it, including \nattaching the minimum wage package to the parks legislation.\n  Mr. President. I will not go into lengthy detail on the various \nmeasures that are finally being released, but I do want to highlight \nsome of them at this time.\n  Title I of this measure deals with the Presidio of San Francisco. By \nitself, this title is an important and critically needed measure that \nshould have been enacted months ago. With the closure\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n\nof the Presidio, the National Park Service was facing an almost \nimpossible drain on its limited funds to maintain a unique and \nimportant resource. The legislation establishes a mechanism whereby the \nPresidio will be preserved and maintained for future generations, the \nNational Park Service will be able to focus on interpretation and the \nvisitor experience, and the site will be self-supporting. I appreciate \nthe willingness of the two Senators from California to work with me and \nthe committee in crafting this novel approach.\n  Title II contains 25 miscellaneous amendments and boundary changes. \nSome of these measures were reported from the committee over a year \nago. They affect areas from the Atlantic to the Pacific and provide \nessential authorities that the administration needs for proper and \neffective management.\n  The remaining 34 titles include the establishment of new areas, such \nas the Tall Grass Prairie National Preserve, which will preserve one of \nthe last portions of the prairie that symbolized the West. Both Senator \nDole and Senator Kassebaum deserve credit for the efforts to secure \npassage of that measure, but it too had been held up by the other side. \nAmong those titles is the Snowbasin Land Exchange, which is critical \nfor the Winter Olympics. Apparently the administration is only \nconcerned with getting through November and was prepared to let that \nmeasure languish with the other measures. The title also includes the \nSelma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, an important measure that \nwill commemorate a significant part of the civil rights movement.\n\n  The Taos Pueblo Land Transfer title would transfer 764 acres of land \nwithin the Wheeler Peak Wilderness in New Mexico to the Secretary of \nthe Interior to be held in trust for Pueblo de Taos Indians. This tract \nis surrounded on three sides by Pueblo lands and is an important area \nfor use in their religious ceremonies. The Pueblo would use the lands \nfor traditional purposes, but the lands would otherwise be managed to \nprotect its wilderness character. Both Senator Domenici and Senator \nDole were instrumental in moving that measure and I appreciate their \nsupport.\n  The Rocky Mountain National Visitor Center, sponsored by Senators \nCampbell and Brown addresses a critical need at Rocky Mountain National \nPark through a creative public-private partnership to provide a visitor \ncenter for the park. Rocky Mountain National Park is the most popular \ntourist attraction in the State of Colorado, drawing over 3 million \nvisitors every year, but has not had a visitor center.\n  Mr. President. All these measures are important and all should have \npassed on their own merits long ago. These measures are important to \nthe environment, essential to the National Park System, and will be of \nlasting benefit to future generations. As I stated earlier, they \nrepresent the single largest conservation package to come before the \nSenate in over a decade.\n  This Senator at least wants to express his gratitude to the majority \nleader, Senator Dole, for being able to free at least this group of \nhostages from the political games. He will probably not receive the \ncredit he is due, but if we can enact the Presidio and the other \nmeasures included in this package, it will be as a result of his \nefforts and his leadership and I thank him.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the legislation before us today contains \nseveral issues of priority for several States. Today, we are prepared \nto go forward with a number of items concerning parks and public lands \nissues across this country and I am pleased to support this package.\n  I would like to thank Senator Murkowski for including provisions \ncritical to Kansas and California. I am pleased that the Presidio \nlegislation is included in this package. This critical provision will \nallow for the innovative preservation of the Presidio, one of our \nNation's true treasures. This bill also includes the establishment of \nthe Tall Grass Prairie National Preserve in Kansas.\n  More so than any other legislation, this package represents the \ninterests and priorities of individual States. States like Kansas and \nCalifornia want these initiatives accomplished--not battered about by \noutsiders and Washington bureaucrats who think they know best. National \nforests; land conveyances, visitor centers, land exchanges and historic \nparks--these are all issues of importance to the various interest \ninvolved and should no longer be delayed. I urge the President to \nsupport this package.\n\n\n                                presidio\n\n  Mr. President, this bill provides for the administration of the \nPresidio in California. I am pleased to join with my colleagues to pass \nthis legislation which will provide for an exciting future for the \nPresidio.\n  The Presidio is a treasured resource of this country. The legislation \nbefore us today provides for national recognition of the Presidio. I \nbelieve Senator Murkowki has sought a balance between the interests of \nthe trust charged with preserving this resource and the interests of \nthe National Park Service. In my view, the Presidio trust will ensure \nan important partnership between the local community and this property.\n  This trust, established within the Department of the Interior, will \nmanage the renovation and leasing of the specific Presidio properties. \nThe revenues generated from these leases will then offset the costs of \nmaintaining the Presidio as a national park, reducing the need for \nFederal funding. Through this innovative approach to managing one of \nour Nation's finest landmarks, we can ensure the preservation of the \nPresidio while also providing significant opportunities to the local \ncommunity.\n  The unique history of the Presidio's operation as a military post \ndates back to 1776. Its designation as a national historic landmark in \n1962 recognized the importance of the post in many military operations. \nAfter the Army closed the post, the National Park Service took over the \nPresidio. When comparing our limited resources against the number of \nnational parks and historic sites, it is apparent that we must find new \nways to manage and preserve such important resources.\n\n\n  establishment of the tall grass prairie national preserve in Kansas\n\n  For several years there have been attempts to create a National Tall \nGrass Prairie Preserve on nearly 11,000 acres in Kansas, known as the \nZ-Bar Ranch. Proposals for this preserve have faced valid opposition \nfrom concerned citizens and landowners in the area. Any involvement by \nthe Federal Government generates concerns, but this legislation \nprovides for involvement by the Federal Government.\n  Senator Kassebaum has worked to bring all parties together to discuss \nthe establishment of a prairie park and strike a balance with this \nlegislation. I have always supported Senator Kassebaum's efforts to \nencourage private participation in the establishment of a national \nprairie preserve in Kansas.\n  The Z-Bar Ranch is currently owned by a private trust, but \nestablishing Z-Bar as a national preserve requires legislation. Under \nthis legislation, the Federal Government is limited to ownership of a \nmaximum of 180 acres of the Z-Bar Ranch. The Federal Government would \nbe authorized to purchase or accept a donation of this portion of land.\n  The current owners of the ranch have offered to donate the core area \nof land to the Federal Government. This will minimize the cost of \nestablishing the preserve. In my view, a compromise which includes \nminimal Federal ownership and continued local input sets this proposal \napart from other efforts.\n  The Tall Grass Prairie is a vital part of the natural environment and \nheritage of the high plains. Those who have visited the Flint Hills of \nKansas appreciate the beauty of this prairie. Senator Kassebaum's work \nin creating a partnership between public and private sectors will help \npreserve the history of the Midwest. With a private/public partnership, \nwe can officially recognize the Tall Grass Prairie while limiting the \ninvolvement of the Federal Government. I commend Senator Kassebaum for \nher hard work on this innovative legislation and her efforts to \nrecognize this important Kansas landmark.\n  I again commend Senator Murkowski and Senator Campbell for their work \non this important piece of legislation. I know that earlier the \nadministration expressed some concerns about the Presidio legislation, \nI think in reviewing the bill before us they will find their concerns \nwere addressed by the committee. I commend the community of San \nFrancisco and people of California for recognizing this important \nresource\n\n[[Page S4511]]\n\nand working to develop an approach that will allow generations to come \nto enjoy this historic and unique landmark.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Murkowski for all \nof his hard work on the Energy Committee and on the many difficult \npublic lands issues he must deal with.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I have had serious concerns about \nlegislation requiring rather than authorizing agency heads to acquire \nland and to construct particular buildings, thereby incurring costs to \nthe Federal taxpayer.\n  Usually, such Federal acquisition and construction activities are \nauthorized by Congress. Once authorized, administrative procedures are \nin place to ensure that the project is necessary and is undertaken in \nthe order of its relative priority. The final decision of whether to go \nforward is traditionally left to the discretion of the Secretary based \non merit and priorities.\n  When the Presidio bill first came to the floor, I expressed my \nconcerns about several titles containing acquisition and construction \nmandates. In order not to hold up the bill unnecessarily, I canvassed \nthe affected agencies to determine if they opposed any of these \nmandates. The purpose of this inquiry was so that I did not have to \ninsist on changing bill mandates to authorizations if the \nadministration intended to undertake the activity even if not \ncongressionally mandated.\n  The Department of the Interior objected to one requirement dealing \nwith a land acquisition in the Corinth, MS. The bill requires the \nNational Park Service to acquire land in the vicinity of the Corinth \nbattlefield, and requires the Secretary to construct, operate, and \nmaintain an interpretive center on the property.\n  I had intended to offer an amendment to change the acquisition \nmandate to a traditional authorization so that the applicable needs \nassessment and prioritization procedures could be applied, but I have \nbeen assured by the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee that he \nwill address my concern in the conference committee.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Senator McCain is correct. I understand his concern \nabout the mandate on the Corinth battlefield title, and I will address \nit in the conference report.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. I would also like to add that the \nSenators from Mississippi have made a strong argument that the visitor \ncenter is necessary. I trust and expect that the Secretary will fully \nconsider their views in administering the authorization.\n  Furthermore, I know it is the intent of the Senator from Mississippi \nto subject the authorization to appropriations.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator McCain is correct. It has always been my intention \nthat the acquisition and construction be subject to appropriations, and \nthat this project be undertaken in the order of its relative priority.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate all of the \nMembers and their staff who have worked so hard on collaborating on \nthis omnibus package. In particular, I would like to thank my good \nfriend, the majority leader from Kansas, for his persistent efforts to \nshepherd this bill into law. He has done a great service for many of \nus, and the bill's final passage is a testament to his strength and \ntenacity as a leader.\n  I would like to say a few words about a couple of the bills, that \nhave specific meaning to me.\n  The Presidio bill, the flagship of this package, offers a unique, \ncreative, and innovative approach to provide for the long-term \nprotection and preservation of one of our Nation's greatest cultural, \nhistorical, and natural treasures. Many people have been waiting a long \ntime for this bill. I know the Senators from California and \nCongresswoman Pelosi have put a great deal of time and energy into this \nlegislation, as have the staff from the Energy Committee and personal \noffices. In our efforts to try to reach consensus on all levels, we \nhave managed to craft a bill that will provide enough balance and \nflexibility to incorporate all points of view.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to discuss several bills within the \nomnibus package that are of particular interest to me and my home State \nof Colorado. These bills deserve distinction in their own right, being \ncrafted with years of collaborative hard work and dedication. I would \nlike to make brief comments on each of them, and once again send my \ncongratulations to all those who have worked so hard on these important \nbills.\n  The Rocky Mountain National Park Visitor Center title provides the \nauthority for the National Park Service to use appropriated and donated \nfunds to operate a visitor center outside of the boundary of Rocky \nMountain National Park. The Park Service has been in need of a \nvisitor's center at the eastern entrance to Rocky for many years now, \nbut due to fiscal constraints, they have been unable to get adequate \nappropriations. Thanks to a generous private-public partnership \nproposal, the Park Service has an opportunity to provide a visitor \nservice outside of the park boundaries. This legislation simply allows \nthe Park Service to enter into this type of partnership with private \nindividuals. I would particularly like to applaud the individuals in \nEstes Park, whose innovative work, generous contributions, and \npersevering dedication have made this idea a reality.\n  This type of private-public opportunity is exactly what the Federal \nGovernment should be taking advantage of these days, and I am \nencouraged by the proposal for this visitor center that has been put \nforth. This center would help the thousands of visitors that come to \nthe park each year, and would save the Government millions in taxpayer \ndollars.\n\n  The Cache La Poudre title, sponsored by the distinguished senior \nSenator from Colorado, designates approximately 35,000 acres between \nthe cities of Fort Collins and Greeley, CO, as the Cache La Poudre \nRiver National Water Heritage Area. The headwaters of the streams that \nflow into this river tell the story of water development and river \nbasin management in the Westward expansion of the United States. This \nhistorical area holds a special meaning for Coloradans, and we feel \nthat it deserves national recognition as a heritage area. In addition \nto the designation, this title helps establish a local commission to \ndevelop and implement a long-term management plan for the area.\n  This bill holds great distinction for me, for I have been working on \nit for many years with my good friend and colleague, Senator Brown from \nColorado. The good Senator has been working hard to get this bill \nenacted into law, and each revision of the bill has been a more worthy \nproduct than the last. There are always a couple of bills that hold \nspecial meaning for us personally, and the Cache La Poudre is a good \nexample of one that the senior Senator from Colorado has a particular \ninterest in. It would be a great honor to have this bill enacted into \nlaw before my friend retires this year.\n  The Giplin County Land Exchange title represents the best type of \nland exchange possible. It is a simple, straightforward land exchange \nbill that will convey 300 acres of Bureau of Land Management lands in \nGilpin County, CO, for the acquisition of 8,733 acres of equal value \nwithin the State.\n  The bill seeks to address a site-specific land management problem \nthat is a result of the scattered mining claims of the 1800's. The \nFederal selected lands for conveyance are contained within 133 \nscattered parcels near the communities of Black Hawk and Central City, \nmost of which are less than one acre in size. These lands would be \nexchanged to the cities of Black Hawk and Central City to help \nalleviate a shortage of residential lots.\n  In return for these selected lands, the Federal Government will \nreceive approximately 8,773 acres of offered lands, which are \nanticipated to be of approximately equal dollar value to the selected \nlands. These lands are in three separate locations, described as \nfollows:\n  Circle C Church Camp: This 40-acre parcel is located within Rocky \nMountain National Park along its eastern boundaries, and lies \napproximately 5 miles south of the well known community of Estes Park. \nThis acquisition can provide additional public camping sites and \naddress a current shortage of employee housing in the popular national \npark.\n  Quilan Ranches tract: This 3,993-acre parcel is located in Conejos \nCounty, in southern Colorado. This land has excellent elk winter range \nand other wildlife\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nhabitat, and borders State lands, which are managed for wildlife \nprotection.\n\n  Bonham Ranch--Cucharas Canyon: This 4,700-acre ranch will augment \nexisting BLM land holdings in the beautiful Cucharas Canyon, identified \nas an AREA of Critical Environmental Concern [ACEC]. This ranch has \nsuperb wildlife habitat, winter range, riparian areas, raptor nesting \nand fledgling areas, as well as numerous riparian areas, rator nesting \nand fledgling areas.\n  Any equalization funds remaining from this exchange will be dedicated \nto the purchase of land and water rights, pursuant to Colorado water \nlaw, for the Blanca Wetlands Management Area, near Alamosa, CO.\n  It is clear that the merits of this bill are numerous. Moreover, the \nbill is noncontroversial, and while it may not have dramatic \nconsequence for people outside of the State of Colorado, it represents \na tremendous opportunity for citizens in my State. Due to the time-\nsensitive and fragile nature of the various components of this bill, I \nam delighted that the Senate has acted as expeditiously as possible.\n  In addition, for the past 5 years now, I have been supporting \nlegislation that seeks to bring some common sense and reason to the \nadministration of Forest Service ski area permits. The ski fees title \nwill take the most convoluted, subjective, and bizarre formula for \ncalculating ski fees, developed by the Forest Service, and replace it \nwith a simple, user friendly formula in which the ski areas will be \nable to figure out their fees with very little effort.\n  The current formula utilized by the Forest Service is encompassed in \n40 pages and contains hundreds of definitions, rulings, and policies. \nIt is simply Government bureaucracy at its worst. For the ski industry, \nthis formula is a monstrous burden, and with the expansion and \ndiversification of many ski resorts, this burden grows increasingly \nmore complex each year. I am pleased that this title will offer some \nclarity and common sense to the ski resorts of my home State.\n  Mr. President, the Grand Lake Cemetery title simply directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to authorize a permit for the town of Grand \nLake, CO, to permanently maintain their 5-acre cemetery, which happens \nto fall within the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National Park. This \ncemetery has been in use by the town since 1892, and continues to carry \nstrong emotional and sentimental attachments for the residents.\n  Currently, the cemetery is operated under a temporary special use \npermit, which is set to expire this year. By granting permanent \nmaintenance authority to the town, this title creates lasting stability \nto this longstanding issue. It is completely noncontroversial, and \nwidely supported by both the community and the Park Service.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the last title in this package that I would \nlike to address is another bill that holds special meaning for me. I \nhave been working on this legislation for many years now, and I am \npleased to see that this title has seven different cosponsors from both \nsides of the aisle. The Old Spanish Trail title will designate the Old \nSpanish Trail and the Northern Branch of the Old Spanish Trail for \nstudy for potential addition to the National Trails System as a \nNational Historic Trail.\n  The Old Spanish Trail has rightly been called ``the longest, \ncrookedest, most arduous pack mule route in the history of America.'' \nIt is that, and more. The Old Spanish Trail tells a dramatic story that \nspans two centuries of recorded history and originated in prehistoric \ntimes. This trail witnessed use by Ute and Navajo Indians, Spaniards, \nMexicans, and American trappers, explorers, and settlers, including the \nMormons. Its heyday spans the development of the West, from the native \non foot to the mounted Spaniard to the coming of the transcontinental \nrailroad. Few routes, if any, pass through as much relatively pristine \ncountry. It is time to recognize and celebrate our common heritage, and \nI am thrilled to have this included in the package passed.\n  These bills may not mean a whole lot to many Members in this Chamber, \nbut they mean a great deal to my constituents and me. I again commend \nmy colleagues for their hard work, and strongly support passage of this \nimportant legislative package this evening.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nchairman of the committee a question regarding the duties and \nauthorities of the trust as outlined in section 104(b) of the Presidio \ntrust legislation.\n  Section 104(b) provides that ``Federal laws and regulations governing \nprocurement by Federal Agencies shall not apply to the trust.'' \nHowever, the same section of the bill states that the Presidio trust \n``shall establish and promulgate procedures applicable to the trust's \nprocurement of goods and services'' that just ``conform to laws and \nregulations related to Federal Government contracts governing working \nconditions and wage scales including the provisions of 40 U.S.C. Sec. \n276a-276a6 (Davis Bacon Act).''\n  Can I ask the chairman if this language means that contractors and \nsubcontractors who contract to do work at the Presidio on behalf of the \ntrust will be required to comply with prevailing wage provisions in all \nconstruction contracts and subcontracts?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to tell my friend, Senator Boxer, that \nyes, she is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support to \nthe efforts of Chairman Murkowski to move this package of bills. I \nwould like to add my thoughts as well, as to what some have called the \ndemise of the Utah wilderness bill.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate failed to break the filibuster of \nthe Utah wilderness bill. I would have liked to have had the Senate \ncontinue to debate the bill because I believe that, given the \nopportunity, we could have convinced those of my colleagues who had \ndoubts about this bill to support it. I am also a realist and I \nunderstand that in this Chamber, if one does not have the votes to \ninvoke cloture, it is difficult to move any piece of legislation.\n  I want my constituents, the people of Utah, to know of my \nappreciation for their tremendous support over the last 14 months. \nDespite what a small, but very vocal minority would have the Senate \nbelieve, the people of Utah wanted a sensible, balanced wilderness \nbill. S. 884 achieved that balanced approach and it was supported \nwidely across the State of Utah. I believe that a letter in support of \nour bill signed by over 300 elected officials in Utah is a good \nindicator that it has strong public support. A rigorous public comment \nprocess, involving thousands of written comments, personal testimony, \nand over 40 public hearings assisted the Utah delegation in drafting \nthis bill. It was a thorough, well-thought-out process and it was open \nto plenty of criticism from the other side.\n  I, particularly, want to express my tremendous appreciation to those \ncounty commissioners from the rural Utah counties who would have been \nmost impacted by wilderness designation. These faithful and dedicated \npublic servants have devoted thousands of hours to develop the county \nproposals. Despite the fact that S. 884 included 1.1 million acres more \nthan the counties recommended as wilderness, these individuals \nrecognized the need to bring the 20-year debate to closure. The county \ncommissioners have invested thousands of dollars, and sacrificed their \npersonal time to come to Washington to enlighten my colleagues about \nthe wilderness issue.\n  There are dozens of names that deserve to be mentioned, but I would \nlike to give particular credit to Commissioner Louise Liston of \nGarfield County, Commissioner Lana Moon of Millard County, \nCommissioners Bill Redd and Ty Lewis of San Juan County, Commissioners \nRandy Johnson and Kent Peterson of Emery County. I would also be remiss \nif I failed to mention Commissioners Joe Judd of Kane County and Teryl \nHunsaker of Tooele County. As always, the fine commissioners of \nWashington County, Gayle Aldred, Jerry B. Lewis, and Russ Gallian were \ninstrumental in providing expertise. There are dozens of other faithful \ncommissioners and I apologize that I cannot mention them all by name.\n  The Utah wilderness issue is not dead. On the contrary, it is very \nmuch alive and very much unresolved. It will come again before the \nSenate, and at some point we will be forced to finally deal with the \nissue. It is my hope that next time, my colleagues will give greater \nconsideration to the $10 million\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\nof taxpayers' money and the 20 years of BLM expertise that went into \nproviding the basis for our recommendation.\n  Again, while I am disappointed that Utah wilderness will not be \nincluded in this package, there is a silver lining in this cloud. Mr. \nPresident, as you know, Utah is preparing to host the 2002 Winter \nOlympics. Last fall, Senator Hatch and I introduced the Snowbasin Land \nExchange, which would authorize the Forest Service to enter into a land \nexchange with the Snowbasin ski resort to exchange 1,320 acres of \nForest Service land around Snowbasin for over 4,000 acres throughout \nthe Wasatch Front. It is an equal value exchange, and a win-win \nsituation for both parties. Not only for the Olympics, but for other \nreasons as well.\n  For example, in Utah open space in some areas is at a premium. As our \npopulation swells each year as thousands of people from other States \nlike California and New Jersey come to Utah because of our quality of \nlife, our precious open spaces along the Wasatch Front are rapidly \ndisappearing. As part of this exchange, the Forest Service will acquire \nlands along the Bonneville Shoreline Trail which is one of the most \nheavily used recreational trails in northern Utah. The people of Weber \nCounty will benefit as the critical wildlife habitat along the benches \nabove Ogden is preserved along with the open spaces. Development will \nbe prevented from encroaching upon these areas. Again, it is a win-win \nsituation arranged for through this exchange.\n  Unfortunately, the Snowbasin exchange was caught up in the politics \nof the day and for various reasons, this legislation had the brakes put \non it by the Clinton administration. Snowbasin and the Utah delegation \nproceeded through months of negotiations with the Forest Service and \nfinally reached agreements on virtually every one of the \nadministration's concerns. This legislation is necessary for the \nsuccessful implementation of the 2002 Winter Olympics and I know that \nmy colleagues are as concerned as I am that this legislation is \nimplemented so Snowbasin may proceed to prepare for the men's and \nwomen's downhill. We all want a successful Olympic event. This \nlegislation is included as part of the chairman's package and I am \npleased that we can finally act upon this bill.\n  Again, Mr President, I thank the chairman for his willingness to move \nthis package and I encourage my colleagues to support it. I thank the \nChair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4509-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNICODEMUS NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE AND THE NEW BEDFORD NATIONAL HISTORIC \n                                LANDMARK\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I am distressed at the latest outbreak of \nviolence in Liberia. Yesterday, young gang members fired upon the U.S. \nEmbassy, prompting the marines to return fire. Fortunately, no \nAmericans were injured. Since this exchange, the situation in Monrovia \nhas calmed down and the State Department has called this an isolated \nincident. Nevertheless, this spasm of violence demonstrates the \nintractability of the conflict in Liberia and the need for a diplomatic \nsolution.\n  I believe the United States should remain committed to securing a \npeaceful solution in Liberia. I applaud the work of Assistant Secretary \nof State for African Affairs, George Moose, and Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of State William Twaddell. Their diplomatic efforts to \nimplement a cease-fire are important to U.S. national interests. In \naddition, I commend the administration's\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\nresponse of providing $30 million in logistical assistance to the West \nAfrican Peacekeeping force, ECOMOG. Such assistance is necessary to \nkeep ECOMOG actively engaged in the on-the-ground peace process.\n  Mr. President, I call upon the various warlords to respect the cease-\nfire and to pursue a peaceful solution. In addition, it is important to \nremind the warlords that an attempt by any faction to seize power by \nforce or to undo the Abuja Accords will receive a strong American \nresponse.\n  While the ultimate resolution of the crisis remains the \nresponsibility of the Liberians, the United States has an important \nrole to play. The United States is the most influential foreign power \nin Liberia. The United States must remain committed to seeking peace in \nLiberia. An engaged United States can help a Liberia that wants peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4513-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FCC'S PAGING FREEZE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, on February 8, 1996, the Federal \nCommunications Commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which \nproposed to fundamentally change the way in which paging systems are \nlicensed. The FCC adopted a freeze on the filing of paging \napplications, which immediately brought about many harmful effects. I \npromptly expressed my concerns to the FCC about its actions and asked \nChairman Hundt to do something about the freeze in a letter dated \nMarch, 15, 1996.\n  I am glad to say that on April 23, 1996, the FCC issued an order \ndemonstrating it had listened to my concerns and the concerns of the \nindustry with regard to the paging freeze. The FCC has modified the \nfreeze so that existing paging carriers can apply to expand their \nsystems by putting transmitters within 40 miles of stations they \nalready are operating, so long as these stations were licensed before \nthe freeze. The FCC also has decided against retroactively applying the \nfreeze and will now process all applications which were filed before \nthe February 8 freeze date.\n  These are two very important steps towards mitigating the harmful \nimpact of the freeze, and I wish to congratulate the FCC on its \nresponse. However, it has come to my attention there are some \nsignificant shortcomings in the mechanics of the new rules. With minor \nclarifications, the FCC could eliminate these shortcomings.\n  In particular, the industry believes--and several Members of Congress \nagree--75 miles would be a more appropriate zone of expansion as \nopposed to 40 miles. The increased distance would allow existing paging \nbusinesses to accommodate their customers' immediate needs and respond \nto new requests for paging service as factories, hospitals, and \nneighborhoods are constructed and the need for paging coverage expands.\n  Paging companies should be allowed to apply for new transmitters \nwithin 75 miles of any transmitter which has been licensed or which \nwill be licensed based on an application filed before the freeze. The \npoint is, many expansion proposals were filed by paging companies more \nthan 1 year ago, and have been delayed at the FCC. These applications \nreflect expansions that were needed months ago. Indeed, these carriers \nnow are receiving requests for further expansions. If we limit paging \ncompanies to a zone 40 miles from transmitters already licensed and \noperating, the only expansion they may be able to achieve would be \nadding those locations for which they applied last year. Additional \ncoverage needs in the coming months will go unmet.\n  Another problem is created by the FCC's proposal to allow anyone to \nfile a competing application against the expansion proposals of \nexisting carriers. The FCC has defended the freeze as a mechanism to \nprevent filing by speculators and application mills, many of which use \nthe application process to defraud consumers out of their life savings. \nThis is a worthy goal. However, the new rule contains an ironic twist. \nIf anyone can file a competing application against an existing paging \ncarrier's expansion, speculation and fraudulent filings will be \nencouraged. The application mills that currently are not able to file \napplications will now target each and every expansion proposal, because \nit will be their only opportunity to practice their unholy trade. This \nwill allow continued consumer fraud. It also will prevent bona fide \npaging companies from expanding their coverage, since any expansion \nproposal which is filed against will be held in abeyance and probably \ndismissed. This result would nullify the good work of the FCC in \nmodifying the freeze. I strongly suspect it is an unintended result.\n\n  To prevent this anomalous result, the FCC can make minor adjustments \nto its freeze modification order: First, allowing a 75-mile expansion \nzone; second, allowing the expansion sites to be established within 75 \nmiles of any transmitter granted from an application filed before the \nfreeze; and third, limiting competing applicants to other carriers.\n  It is vital the FCC take steps to mitigate the harmful effects of the \nfreeze. The paging industry provides service to over 34 million \nsubscribers. Industry members have been encouraged to make considerable \ninvestments to improve their services, and have relied in good faith on \nthe FCC's published regulations. Paging services are designed to serve \nthe needs of increasingly mobile customers. To be competitive, these \nbusinesses need to provide their service to the customers where and \nwhen they need it. If a paging service cannot respond to the needs of \nits existing and potential customers, it will not survive in this \nextremely competitive industry.\n  This competition has spurred technological advances in what can be \ncommunicated over a pager. No longer is a pager some simple little box \nthat beeps to let you know you should call your office. Today's pagers \nare vehicles for communicating written messages. For example, news \norganizations like Reuters now offer periodic summaries of breaking \nnews stories through pagers. Pagers also provide cost-efficient means \nof communicating within large factory complexes. Additionally, we must \nnot forget the lifesaving contribution these services make when used by \ndoctors, ambulance crews, and critically ill patients, to summon \nassistance in the event of an emergency.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that this technology must be \nallowed to grow. That was the basis for my letter in March. At the same \ntime, the process must not be so full of loopholes as to allow the \nunscrupulous to benefit at the expense of consumers. That is the \nchallenge faced by the FCC. It has begun meeting the challenge by \nmodifying its freeze on the filing of paging applicants. The flaws in \nits initial proposal should prove easy to address. As chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I stand \nready to help this process in any reasonable manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4514-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The point is, the Federal debt has since shot further into \nthe stratosphere.\n  As of yesterday at the close of business, a total of \n$1,276,157,534,167.42 has been added to the Federal debt since February \n26, 1992, meaning that as of the close of business yesterday, Tuesday, \nApril 30, 1996, the Federal debt stood at $5,102,048,827,234.22. On a \nper capita basis, every man, woman, and child in America owes \n$19,271.23 as his or her share of the Federal debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4514-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4514-S4515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL JOHN BULKELEY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the dedication, \npublic service and patriotism that personified the life of Vice Admiral \nJohn Duncan Bulkeley, USN. Admiral Bulkeley, who passed away on April \n6, was one of the most highly decorated combat veterans of World War \nII, and served nearly 60 years of active duty during his career.\n  A native of New York City, Admiral Bulkeley entered the U.S. Navy \nafter graduating from the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and was \ncommissioned in March of 1934. He began his Navy career as a junior \nwatch officer aboard the cruiser Indianapolis. He then spent time on \nthe carrier Saratoga and as an\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\nengineering officer in Chinese waters aboard the gunboat Sacramento, \nbefore being given a special assignment in 1941 to help begin a new \nbranch of naval service--patrol torpedo boats.\n  Lieutenant John Bulkeley's performance as a PT boat squadron leader \nis legendary. He earned the nickname ``Sea Wolf'' for his daring raids \non the Japanese Navy in the early days of the Pacific war. Most notable \namong his heroic deeds was Lieutenant Bulkeley's bold rescue of General \nDouglass MacArthur from the Philippines in 1942. General MacArthur had \nbecome surrounded by the Japanese while remaining on the island of \nCorregidor during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Lieutenant \nBulkeley's PT squadron broke through a Japanese blockade and carried \nthe general and his family to safety. ``Johnny,'' said MacArthur, \n``you've taken me out of the jaws of death--and I won't forget it.'' \nGeneral MacArthur did not forget, and for his efforts in the early part \nof the war, John Bulkeley received the highest award this Nation \nbestows for valor, the Medal of Honor.\n  The Sea Wolf's career did not end there. In 1942, he spent time \nstateside recruiting young officers for the PT program, among them a \nstalwart young man named John F. Kennedy.\n  Admiral Bulkeley then headed for Europe, where he commanded a group \nof PT boats that helped clear the way for the D-Day invasion at Utah \nbeach in Normandy. He commanded the destroyer Endicott during the \ninvasion of southern France, and sank two German warships--the only \nGerman warships sunk in surface-to-surface combat during the entire war \nin the Mediterranean.\n  At the end of WWII John Bulkeley was not yet 32 years old, but he had \nalready received every medal for courage that our country awards. \nFollowing the war, Bulkeley graduated from the Armed Forces Staff \nCollege. He also taught electrical engineering at the Naval Academy and \nserved on the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  His service did not stop here, however. Admiral Bulkeley commanded a \ndestroyer division in Korean waters during the Korean war; in 1961 he \nwas appointed commander of the Guantanamo Naval base in Cuba, an \nassignment he received from his old friend President John F. Kennedy; \nand in 1964 he was assigned as president of the Navy Board of \nInspection and Survey, a position which he held for nearly 23 years. \nUnder his active leadership, the INSURV Board was directly responsible \nfor the delivery of combat-ready ships, whether new or coming out of \noverhaul.\n  When his remarkable career came to an end, Vice Admiral Bulkeley was \none of the most decorated sailors in American history. In addition to \nreceiving the Medal of Honor, Admiral Bulkeley was also presented the \nNavy Cross, two awards of the Army Distinguished Service Cross, three \nDistinguished Service Medals, two Silver Stars, two awards of the \nLegion of Merit, two Purple Hearts, and numerous other decorations and \ncitations for outstanding performance and service to his country.\n  Vice Admiral Bulkeley was a true American patriot and a superb naval \nofficer who, throughout his naval career, led with courage and \nintegrity. His leadership and performance throughout an intense and \ndemanding period in naval and military history were instrumental in the \nsuccessful administration of the Navy and outstanding support for naval \nforces throughout the world. Thanks to his inspirational leadership and \nselfless dedication to duty, our Navy has remained second to none. He \nwill be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4514-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RELATING TO CERTAIN REGULATIONS REGARDING THE OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n  The text of the concurrent resolution (S.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to offer to \nsell to certain public agencies the indebtedness representing the \nremaining repayment balance of certain Bureau of Reclamation projects \nin Texas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n          the texas reclamation projects indebted purchase act\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I introduce today a bill on \nbehalf of the State of Texas and several major water supply authorities \nin Texas. It would transfer title for Bureau of Reclamation projects to \nlocal control.\n  The purpose of this bill is to give local public agencies the right \nto make decisions regarding their own local water supplies. In doing so \nwe will reduce the size of the Federal Government and save taxpayers \nsignificant amounts of money.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned that I am introducing this legislation on \nbehalf of the State of Texas. Our goal is to create a process to allow \nthe State of Texas or its public agencies to purchase and accept title \nto the Bureau of Reclamation projects in the State.\n  I submit this measure with the full support of the State of Texas. \nThe State legislature recently passed a resolution, endorsed and signed \nby the Governor, accepting the responsibility for this process of title \ntransfer.\n  My interest in this effort goes back to the last Congress, when in \nJune 1994, I introduced S. 2236 in an effort to correct a longstanding \nproblem involving the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the city of Corpus \nChristi.\n  That legislation directed the Secretary of the Interior to enter into \nand complete negotiations with the city of Corpus Christi concerning \nthe Nueces River project, also known as Choke Canyon Reservoir. A \nhearing was held on the legislation, but the Congress ended before the \nSenate could act.\n  This year, with title transfers being encouraged by both the \nadministration and Congress, it makes sense for the Choke Canyon \nlegislation to be included with the broader Bureau of Reclamation \nlegislation as developed by the State of Texas.\n  In 1976 the city of Corpus Christi and the Nueces River authority \ncontracted with the Bureau for construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir \non the Frio River near Three Rivers, TX. The primary purpose of the \nproject was to provide additional water to the city of Corpus Christi \nthrough the year 2040. Since project completion in 1982, however, \nsubsequent studies have determined that the current supply to the city \nfrom the project is less than contracted for, and that additional water \nsupplies likely will be required by the year 2003.\n  The local sponsors are proposing that the repayment agreements be \nrenegotiated to reflect the diminished water supply derived from the \nproject, as well as the unanticipated expenses that the local sponsors \nhave incurred to obtain additional water to compensate for the \nprojected shortfall in the Choke Canyon-Lake Corpus Christi system.\n  I have incorporated the Choke Canyon project into this legislation \nfor two reasons:\n  First, to pursue the intent of the original contract--because the \ncity still is not getting the water it was promised;\n  Second and most important, I have introduced this legislation because \nthe area is facing a very real water shortage. Due to the lower than \nanticipated yield from the Choke Canyon Reservoir, projections show the \n12-county region it serves will be short of water within 10 years. This \nwill affect nearly 400,000 people and numerous major industries.\n  The discount and prepayment conditions which the Corpus Christi is \nasking be negotiated are extremely important to the city's ability to \nensure adequate future water supplies at affordable prices. Congressman \nSolomon Ortiz has introduced similar legislation on the House side.\n  Also included in this legislation is a project near Amarillo in the \ncongressional district of Congressman Mac Thornberry: the Canadian \nRiver project. Construction of the Canadian River project by the BOR \nwas authorized by Public Law 898 on December 29, 1950, to provide a \nsource of municipal and industrial water to member cities of the \nCanadian River Municipal Water Authority in the Texas Panhandle and \nSouth Plains. The cities served include Amarillo, Borger, Brownfield, \nLamesa, Levelland, Lubbock, O'Donnell, Pampa, Plainview, Slaton, and \nTahoka. These currently comprise a combined population of nearly \n500,000 persons.\n  The major project facilities include Sanford Dam on the Canadian \nRiver 35 miles northeast of Amarillo, Lake Meredith which is formed by \nthe dam, and a 322-mile aqueduct system that transports water from the \nlake to the member cities. The project was built in the 1960's and has \nsupplied water to the cities continuously since 1968. Responsibility \nfor operation and maintenance of the entire complex of municipal water \nsupply facilities, including Sanford Dam, was transferred to the \nauthority on July 1, 1968.\n  The project authorization--section 2. (c)(3)--provides that title to \nthe aqueduct shall pass to the project sponsor upon payment of all \nobligations arising from the legislation and contract.\n\n  Total project cost was about $83.8 million, of which about $76.9 \nmillion is reimbursable to the United States by the Authority. Non-\nreimbursable components paid for flood control and fish and wildlife \nbenefits. Including interest during construction, the original \nreimbursable obligation was $83.7 million, repayable with interest at \nthe rate of 2.632 percent over a term of 50 years. Twenty-six annual \npayments have been made.\n  Under this bill the outstanding balance would be purchased by the \nproject sponsor, the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority. Title to \nthe aqueduct would be transferred to the Authority. Title to the dam \nwill not be transferred because of its flood-control functions, which \nneed to remain under the supervision of the U.S. Corps of Engineers, \nand title to the land around the reservoir to remain with the National \nPark Service because it is designated a National Recreation Area.\n  Purchase of the debt would be accomplished by payment of the net \npresent value of the cash stream which would be required to repay the \ncurrent indebtedness, discounted at U.S. Treasury rates on the date of \npurchase contract execution, after adjustment to reflect unrealized \nproject benefits and outstanding credits.\n\n\n                    advantages for federal interests\n\n  Recent changes in the mission of the Bureau of Reclamation have \nreduced emphasis on water resource development projects. Now, the BOR's \nactivities are regulatory in nature, for the most part, as they relate \nto existing projects. Transfer of Federal ownership would eliminate the \nneed for BOR participation in the oversight of operation and \nmaintenance, and relieve the Federal Government of liability related to \noperation of transferred facilities.\n  The cash payment to the Government would make funds available to \nsupport new projects that create, jobs or which cannot be funded from \npresent budget sources. Currently, BOR is considering the prospect of \ntitle transfer for selected projects, including the aqueduct system of \nthe Canadian River Project. The debt purchase proposal in\n\n[[Page S4518]]\n\nthis legislation is similar to the process which would result from \nthose activities, without extended negotiations and added \nadministrative costs.\n\n\n                     advantages for local sponsors\n\n  Because of the water supply shortfall the Canadian River Project the \nAuthority and its member cities are forced to seek replacement water. \nThe savings that would accrue from purchasing the outstanding debt \nwould allow the Authority and its member cities to finance needed \nreplacement water without undue economic hardship.\n  Replacement supplies capable of providing the lost annual supply of \n30,000 acre-feet or more are being sought at a probable cost of $76.5 \nmillion. That additional expenditure will be necessary even if the \ndiscounted debt purchase is accomplished.\n\n  Also included in the legislation is the Palmetto Bend project \nauthorized by Congress in 1968.\n  The primary purpose of Palmetto Bend is to provide municipal and \nindustrial water to a broad area along the Texas gulf coast. The \nproject was completed by the BOR in 1985 and includes, as its main \nfeature, Lake Texana.\n  Lake Texana is located near the gulf coast midway between Houston and \nCorpus Christi. It is operated by the Lavaca-Navidad River Authority. \nIn essence, the reservoir's entire yield has been committed, including \nmore than 42,000 acre-feet/year for municipal use in the cities of \nCorpus Christi and Point Comfort, and more than 32,000 acre-feet/year \nfor industrial use largely in the regional petro-chemical-plastics \nindustry. The city of Corpus Christi provides water service to a 10-\ncounty area. Two of the industries to which Lake Texana supplies water \nprovide more than 3,000 jobs to the local region.\n  Currently, the authority and the Texas Water Development Board are \nobligated for repayment to the Federal Government of about $70.7 \nmillion, at an interest rate of 3.502 percent over a term of 50 years. \nThe board has made 10 annual payments; the authority is scheduled to \nbegin payment in 1996.\n  Under this bill, the outstanding balance of debt would be prepaid, \nand the project purchased by the authority and board as State project \nsponsors. Purchase would be accomplished by payment of the net present \nvalue of the cash stream required to repay the current contractual \ndebt, discounted at U.S. Treasury rates on the date of purchase, after \nadjustment to reflect unrealized project benefits and outstanding \ncredits.\n  Title to the Federal portion of the project would be transferred to \nthe State sponsors, the authority, and the board.\n  Two clear benefits of the transfer of title to the State sponsors are \navoidance of the cost of Federal oversight of the project and the \nrelease from liability of the Federal Government. Transfer of this \nobligation should result in a reduction in the size of the Federal \nbureaucracy required to support the projects.\n  Quantified advantages include an immediate infusion of approximately \n$34 million to the Federal Treasury, annual savings of $250,000 for \nproject operation and upkeep expenses and an annual savings of about \n$12,000 by avoiding payments-in-lieu-of-taxes to Jackson County.\n  Annual debt service payments for Lake Texana will be reduced by \napproximately $1 million per year. Currently this cost is borne by the \nwater users, so municipal and industrial water costs would be reduced.\n\n  It is estimated also that up to $50,000 in costs due to BOR reporting \nmandates and management assistance would be avoided.\n  More importantly, however, state sponsors will be able to manage \ntheir projects to achieve the maximum benefits without the delay, \nexpense and uncertainty which is incurred currently by BOR management \noversight.\n  This proposal is a mutually advantageous proposition that will \nprovide economic benefits to both Federal and State interests, while \nreducing duplicative and unnecessary Government programs.\n   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues' strong support for this \nlegislation. It is responsible. It addresses serious local interests. \nIt fulfills the expressed goals of both the 104th Congress and the \nadministration, and it makes sense.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that recent testimony by a \nrepresentative of the Texas Water Development Board before the House \nSubcommittee on Water and Power Resources Subcommittee supporting this \nlegislation be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTestimony by Tom Brown, Deputy Executive Administrator Water Resources \n               Development, Texas Water Development Board\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank you for \n     the opportunity to present the views of the Texas Water \n     Development Board on the issue of transfer of Federal \n     Reclamation facilities to local project beneficiaries. The \n     Legislature of the State of Texas has passed Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 80 and the Governor has signed this \n     resolution, supporting the transfer of Bureau of Reclamation \n     projects in Texas to either the local sponsors or the State. \n     Included in SCR 80 was the direction of the legislature to \n     the Texas Water Development Board to work with local \n     interests to purchase Bureau projects in Texas and to \n     encourage Congress to adopt legislation to facilitate this \n     acquisition. Under this legislation there are three projects \n     being proposed to be purchased, the Canadian River Project, \n     Palmetto Bend Project and the Nueces River Reclamation \n     Project.\n       There are strong incentives for the Federal Government to \n     sell these projects to local sponsors. These include: First, \n     receiving lump sum cash payments totaling in excess of $100 \n     million. Since the bill provides for the purchase of the \n     facilities using a net present value of the outstanding debt, \n     these payments will provide a direct cash infusion into the \n     federal treasury while defeasing outstanding obligations of \n     the Federal Government.\n       Second, the Federal Government would be able to transfer \n     the liabilities associated with the projects to the \n     purchaser.\n       Third, the Federal Government would not have to continually \n     appropriate funds to pay for a portion of operations and \n     maintenance of the transferred facilities.\n       Fourth, it would eliminate Federal overhead on these \n     projects since oversight would not be required.\n       There are also significant local incentives for the \n     purchase of these facilities. These incentives include:\n       1. Reducing annual debt service payments for local \n     ratepayers.\n       2. Since local sponsors are currently operating and \n     maintaining the facilities the purchase would eliminate \n     duplication of management by both the Bureau and the \n     local sponsor.\n       3. Allow for consistency in operating plans for the \n     facilities. Since the State of Texas regulates the operation \n     of these facilities, local or State ownership would \n     streamline operations of the facilities through elimination \n     of duplicative or contradictory operating plans'.\n       4. Eliminating the time and oversight required by the \n     Bureau of Reclamation.\n       5. Eliminating additional cost associated with federal \n     involvement. For example, The Texas Water Development Board \n     has been working with local governments in developing water \n     conservation plans to address local issues since 1985. In \n     fact, under state law any applicant that borrows over \n     $500,000 from the Board must have an approved water \n     conservation plan. Given the recent push by the Bureau of \n     Reclamation for the development of water conservation plans \n     it will approve there are additional costs that should not \n     have to be borne by local governments.\n       In addition, the State of Texas owns the surface water \n     within its boundaries with rights to these surface waters \n     being conveyed by the State to individuals and entities for \n     beneficial uses. While the Federal Government has assisted \n     local and State sponsors in constructing these projects to \n     store and divert surface waters, the water rights for the \n     projects have remained with local sponsors, not the Federal \n     Government.\n       What is being proposed in this legislation, and what the \n     Texas Water Development Board supports, is the ability of \n     local sponsors to purchase the Federal interests in these \n     facilities at a present value of the outstanding debt \n     associated with the municipal and industrial uses in the \n     projects, a transfer of all operations and maintenance and \n     the transfer of title to the state or local sponsor. \n     Furthermore, this legislation meets the Bureau of \n     Reclamation's criteria for projects that could be transferred \n     as single purpose projects: (1) A fair return to the \n     taxpayers for Federal assets. (2) Compliance with all \n     applicable Federal Laws. (3) That interstate compacts and \n     interests are protected. (4) Native American assets are not \n     affected. (5) No international treaties are affected. (6) The \n     recipients shall maintain the public safety aspects of the \n     project.\n       It is recognized that the non-reimbursable aspects of the \n     projects such as recreational opportunities and fish and \n     wildlife benefits are a significant public benefit. However, \n     in the case of the projects referenced in this legislation \n     both the Palmetto Bend and Nueces River projects, local \n     sponsors and or the State of Texas operate all recreation and \n     wildlife areas and the Bureau of Reclamation is not directly \n     involved in the provision of these benefits, nor do they \n     provide any specific or regular management function relative \n     to these activities. The Canadian River\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\n     Project transfer will not involve transfer of any facilities \n     associated with the non-reimbursable aspects of the projects.\n       Through this legislation the Congress would affirm its \n     support to the principle that the State have the primary \n     responsibility for management and use of its water. This \n     legislation also recognizes that it is the States \n     responsibility to ensure that these transfers will relieve \n     the Federal Government of the financial liabilities \n     associated with these projects and help Texas control its \n     water destiny and meet the needs of its citizens.\n       Thank you for allowing me to issue this statement and \n     support what we believe is needed legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4517-2", "month":

                  PART 825--FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE\n\n     Sec. 825.1  Purpose and scope\n\n       (a) Section 202 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) (2 U.S.C. 1312) applies the rights and protections of \n     sections 101 through 105 of the Family and Medical Leave Act \n     of 1993 (FMLA) (29 U.S.C. 2611-2615) to covered employees. \n     (The term ``covered employee'' is defined in section 101(3) \n     of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1301(3)). See Sec. 825.800 of these \n     regulations for that definition.) The purpose of this part is \n     to set forth the regulations to carry out the provisions of \n     section 202 of the CAA.\n       (b) These regulations are issued by the Board of Directors, \n     Office of Compliance, pursuant to sections 202(d) and 304 of \n     the CAA, which direct the Board to promulgate regulations \n     implementing section 202 that are ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) [of section 202 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board \n     may determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification \n     of such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section''. The regulations issued by the Board herein are on \n     all matters for which section 202 of the CAA requires \n     regulations to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment, based on the information available to it \n     at the time of the promulgation of these regulations, that, \n     with the exception of regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     section 202 of the CAA]''.\n       (c) In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\n     Sec. 825.2  [Reserved]\n\n Subpart A--What is the Family and Medical Leave Act, and to Whom Does \n          it Apply under the Congressional Accountability Act?\n\n     Sec. 825.100  What is the Family and Medical Leave Act?\n\n       (a) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as \n     made applicable by the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA), allows ``eligible'' employees of an employing office \n     to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute \n     appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued \n     it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12 months \n     because of the birth of a child and to care for the newborn \n     child, because of the placement of a child with the employee \n     for adoption or foster care, because the employee is needed \n     to care for a family member (child, spouse, or parent) with a \n     serious health condition, or because the employee's own \n     serious health condition makes the employee unable to perform \n     the functions of his or her job (see Sec. 825.306(b)(4)). In \n     certain cases, this leave may be taken on an intermittent \n     basis rather than all at once, or the employee may work a \n     part-time schedule.\n       (b) An employee on FMLA leave is also entitled to have \n     health benefits maintained while on leave as if the employee \n     had continued to work instead of taking the leave. If an \n     employee was paying all or part of the premium payments prior \n     to leave, the employee would continue to pay his or her share \n     during the leave period. The employing office, or a \n     disbursing or other financial office of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate may recover its share only if \n     the employee does not return to work for a reason other than \n     the serious health condition of the employee or the \n     employee's immediate family member, or another reason beyond \n     the employee's control.\n       (c) An employee generally has a right to return to the same \n     position or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, \n     benefits and working conditions at the conclusion of the \n     leave. The taking of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of \n     any benefit that accrued prior to the start of the leave.\n       (d) The employing office has a right to 30 days advance \n     notice from the employee where practicable. In addition, the \n     employing office may require an employee to submit \n     certification from a health care provider to substantiate \n     that the leave is due to the serious health condition of the \n     employee or the employee's immediate family member. Failure \n     to comply with these requirements may result in a delay in \n     the start of FMLA leave. Pursuant to a uniformly applied \n     policy, the employing office may also require that an \n     employee present a certification of fitness to return to work \n     when the absence was caused by the employee's serious health \n     condition (see Sec. 825.311(c)). The employing office may \n     delay restoring the employee to employment without such \n     certificate relating to the health condition which caused the \n     employee's absence.\n\n     Sec. 825.101  What is the purpose of the FMLA?\n\n       (a) FMLA is intended to allow employees to balance their \n     work and family life by taking reasonable unpaid leave for \n     medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and \n     for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious \n     health condition. The FMLA is intended to balance the demands \n     of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the \n     stability and economic security of families, and to promote \n     national interests in preserving family integrity. It was \n     intended that the FMLA accomplish these purposes in a manner \n     that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers, and \n     in a manner consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment in minimizing the potential for \n     employment discrimination on the basis of sex, while \n     promoting equal employment opportunity for men and women.\n       (b) The enactment of FMLA was predicated on two fundamental \n     concerns ``the needs of the American workforce, and the \n     development of high-performance organizations''. \n     Increasingly, America's children and elderly are dependent \n     upon family members who must spend long hours at work. When a \n     family emergency arises, requiring workers to attend to \n     seriously-ill children or parents, or to newly-born or \n     adopted infants, or even to their own serious illness, \n     workers need reassurance that they will not be asked to \n     choose between continuing their employment, and meeting their \n     personal and family obligations or tending to vital needs at \n     home.\n       (c) The FMLA is both intended and expected to benefit \n     employers as well as their employees. A direct correlation \n     exists between stability in the family and productivity in \n     the workplace. FMLA will encourage the development of high-\n     performance organizations. When workers can count on durable \n     links to their workplace they are able to make their own full \n     commitments to their jobs. The record of hearings on family \n     and medical leave indicate the powerful productive advantages \n     of stable workplace relationships, and the comparatively \n     small costs of guaranteeing that those relationships will not \n     be dissolved while workers attend to pressing family health \n     obligations or their own serious illness.\n\n     Sec. 825.102  When are the FMLA and the CAA effective for \n       covered employees and employing offices?\n\n       (a) The rights and protection of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to certain Senate employees and \n     certain employing offices of the Senate since August 5, 1993 \n     (see section 501 of FMLA).\n       (b) The rights and protection of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to any employee in an employment \n     position and any employment authority of the House of \n     Representatives since August 5, 1993 (see section 502 of \n     FMLA).\n       (c) The rights and protections of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to certain employing offices and \n     covered employees other than those referred to in paragraphs \n     (a) and (b) of this section for certain periods since August \n     5, 1993 (see, e.g., title V of the FMLA, sections 501 and \n     502).\n       (d) The provisions of section 202 of the CAA that apply \n     rights and protections of the FMLA to covered employees are \n     effective on January 23, 1996.\n       (e) The period prior to the effective date of the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections under the CAA must \n     be considered in determining employee eligibility.\n\n     Sec. 825.103  How does the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n       CAA, affect leave in progress on, or taken before, the \n       effective date of the CAA?\n\n       (a) An eligible employee's right to take FMLA leave began \n     on the date that the rights and protections of the FMLA first \n     went into effect for the employing office and employee (see \n     Sec. 825.102(a)). Any leave taken prior to the date on which \n     the rights and protections of the FMLA first became effective \n     for the employing office from which the leave was taken may \n     not be counted for purposes of the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA. If leave qualifying as FMLA leave was underway prior \n     to the effective date of the FMLA for the employing office \n     from which the leave was taken and continued after the FMLA's \n     effective date for that office, only that portion of leave \n     taken on or after the FMLA's effective date may be counted \n     against the employee's leave entitlement under the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (b) If an employing office-approved leave is underway when \n     the application of the FMLA by the CAA takes effect, no \n     further notice would be required of the employee unless the \n     employee requests an extension of the leave. For leave which \n     commenced on the effective date or shortly thereafter, such \n     notice must have been given which was practicable, \n     considering the foreseeability of the need for leave and the \n     effective date.\n       (c) Starting on January 23, 1996, an employee is entitled \n     to FMLA leave under these regulations if the reason for the \n     leave is qualifying under the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, even if the event occasioning the need for leave (e.g., \n     the birth of a child) occurred before such date (so long as \n     any other requirements are satisfied).\n\n     Sec. 825.104  What employing offices are covered by the FMLA, \n       as made applicable by the CAA?\n\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, covers all \n     employing offices. As used in the CAA, the term ``employing \n     office'' means--\n       (1) the personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator;\n       (2) a committee of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate or a joint committee;\n       (3) any other office headed by a person with the final \n     authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, \n     conditions, or privileges of the employment of an employee of \n     the House of Representatives or the Senate; or\n       (4) the Capitol Guide Board, the Capitol Police Board, the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol, the Office of the Attending Physician, the \n     Office of Compliance, and the Office of Technology \n     Assessment.\n       (b) [Reserved].\n       (c) Separate entities will be deemed to be parts of a \n     single employer for purposes of the FMLA, as made applicable \n     by the CAA, if they meet the ``integrated employer'' test. A \n     determination of whether or not separate entities are an \n     integrated employer is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be reviewed in its totality. Factors considered in \n     determining whether two or more entities are an integrated \n     employer include:\n       (i) Common management;\n       (ii) Interrelation between operations;\n       (iii) Centralized control of labor relations; and\n       (iv) Degree of common financial control.\n\n     Sec. 825.105  [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.106  How is ``joint employment'' treated under the \n       FMLA as made applicable by the CAA?\n\n       (a) Where two or more employing offices exercise some \n     control over the work or working conditions of the employee, \n     the employing offices may be joint employers under FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA. Where the employee performs work \n     which simultaneously benefits two or more employing offices, \n     or works for two or more employing offices at different times \n     during the workweek, a joint employment relationship \n     generally will be considered to exist in situations such as:\n       (1) Where there is an arrangement between employing offices \n     to share an employee's services or to interchange employees;\n       (2) Where one employing office acts directly or indirectly \n     in the interest of the other employing office in relation to \n     the employee; or\n       (3) Where the employing offices are not completely \n     disassociated with respect to the\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\n     employee's employment and may be deemed to share control of \n     the employee, directly or indirectly, because one employing \n     office controls, is controlled by, or is under common control \n     with the other employing office.\n       (b) A determination of whether or not a joint employment \n     relationship exists is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be viewed in its totality. For example, joint employment \n     will ordinarily be found to exist when--\n       (1) an employee, who is employed by an employing office \n     other than the personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator, is under the actual \n     direction and control of the Member of the House of \n     Representatives or Senator; or\n       (2) two or more employing offices employ an individual to \n     work on common issues or other matters for both or all of \n     them.\n       (c) When employing offices employ a covered employee \n     jointly, they may designate one of themselves to be the \n     primary employing office, and the other or others to be the \n     secondary employing office(s). Such a designation shall be \n     made by written notice to the covered employee.\n       (d) If an employing office is designated a primary \n     employing office pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, \n     only that employing office is responsible for giving required \n     notices to the covered employee, providing FMLA leave, and \n     maintenance of health benefits. Job restoration is the \n     primary responsibility of the primary employing office, and \n     the secondary employing office(s) may, subject to the \n     limitations in Sec. 825.216, be responsible for accepting the \n     employee returning from FMLA leave.\n       (e) If employing offices employ an employee jointly, but \n     fail to designate a primary employing office pursuant to \n     paragraph (c) of this section, then all of these employing \n     offices shall be jointly and severally liable for giving \n     required notices to the employee, for providing FMLA leave, \n     for assuring that health benefits are maintained, and for job \n     restoration. The employee may give notice of need for FMLA \n     leave, as described in Sec. Sec.  825.302 and 825.303, to \n     whichever of these employing offices the employee chooses. If \n     the employee makes a written request for restoration to one \n     of these employing offices, that employing office shall be \n     primarily responsible for job restoration, and the other \n     employing office(s) may, subject to the limitations in \n     Sec. 825.216, be responsible for accepting the employee \n     returning from FMLA leave.\n\n     Sec. 825.107 [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.108 [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.109 [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.110 Which employees are ``eligible'' to take FMLA \n       leave under these regulations?\n\n       (a) An ``eligible employee'' under these regulations means \n     a covered employee who has been employed in any employing \n     office for 12 months and for at least 1,250 hours of \n     employment during the previous 12 months.\n       (b) The 12 months an employee must have been employed by \n     any employing office need not be consecutive months. If an \n     employee worked for two or more employing offices \n     sequentially, the time worked will be aggregated to determine \n     whether it equals 12 months. If an employee is maintained on \n     the payroll for any part of a week, including any periods of \n     paid or unpaid leave (sick, vacation) during which other \n     benefits or compensation are provided by the employer (e.g., \n     workers' compensation, group health plan benefits, etc.), the \n     week counts as a week of employment. For purposes of \n     determining whether intermittent/occasional/casual employment \n     qualifies as ``at least 12 months'', 52 weeks is deemed to be \n     equal to 12 months.\n       (c) If an employee was employed by two or more employing \n     offices, either sequentially or concurrently, the hours of \n     service will be aggregated to determine whether the minimum \n     of 1,250 hours has been reached. Whether an employee has \n     worked the minimum 1,250 hours of service is determined \n     according to the principles established under the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA), as applied by section 203 of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. 1313), for determining compensable hours of work. The \n     determining factor is the number of hours an employee has \n     worked for one or more employing offices. The determination \n     is not limited by methods of record-keeping, or by \n     compensation agreements that do not accurately reflect all of \n     the hours an employee has worked for or been in service to \n     the employing office. Any accurate accounting of actual hours \n     worked may be used. For this purpose, full-time teachers (see \n     Sec. 825.800 for definition) of an elementary or secondary \n     school system, or institution of higher education, or other \n     educational establishment or institution are deemed to meet \n     the 1,250 hour test. An employing office must be able to \n     clearly demonstrate that such an employee did not work 1,250 \n     hours during the previous 12 months in order to claim that \n     the employee is not ``eligible'' for FMLA leave.\n       (d) The determinations of whether an employee has worked \n     for any employing office for at least 1,250 hours in the \n     previous 12 months and has been employed by any employing \n     office for a total of at least 12 months must be made as of \n     the date leave commences. The ``previous 12 months'' means \n     the 12 months immediately preceding the commencement of the \n     leave. If an employee notifies the employing office of need \n     for FMLA leave before the employee meets these eligibility \n     criteria, the employing office must either confirm the \n     employee's eligibility based upon a projection that the \n     employee will be eligible on the date leave would commence or \n     must advise the employee when the eligibility requirement is \n     met. If the employing office confirms eligibility at the time \n     the notice for leave is received, the employing office may \n     not subsequently challenge the employee's eligibility. In the \n     latter case, if the employing office does not advise the \n     employee whether the employee is eligible as soon as \n     practicable (i.e., two business days absent extenuating \n     circumstances) after the date employee eligibility is \n     determined, the employee will have satisfied the notice \n     requirements and the notice of leave is considered current \n     and outstanding until the employing office does advise. If \n     the employing office fails to advise the employee whether the \n     employee is eligible prior to the date the requested leave is \n     to commence, the employee will be deemed eligible. The \n     employing office may not, then, deny the leave. Where the \n     employee does not give notice of the need for leave more than \n     two business days prior to commencing leave, the employee \n     will be deemed to be eligible if the employing office fails \n     to advise the employee that the employee is not eligible \n     within two business days of receiving the employee's notice.\n       (e) The period prior to the effective date of the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections under the CAA must \n     be considered in determining employee's eligibility.\n       (f) [Reserved].\n\n     Sec. 825.111 [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.112 Under what kinds of circumstances are employing \n       offices required to grant family or medical leave?\n\n       (a) Employing offices are required to grant leave to \n     eligible employees:\n       (1) For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the \n     newborn child;\n       (2) For placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care;\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition; and\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's \n     job.\n       (b) The right to take leave under FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA applies equally to male and female employees. A \n     father, as well as a mother, can take family leave for the \n     birth, placement for adoption or foster care of a child.\n       (c) Circumstances may require that FMLA leave begin before \n     the actual date of birth of a child. An expectant mother may \n     take FMLA leave pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section \n     before the birth of the child for prenatal care or if her \n     condition makes her unable to work.\n       (d) Employing offices are required to grant FMLA leave \n     pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section before the \n     actual placement or adoption of a child if an absence from \n     work is required for the placement for adoption or foster \n     care to proceed. For example, the employee may be required to \n     attend counseling sessions, appear in court, consult with his \n     or her attorney or the doctor(s) representing the birth \n     parent, or submit to a physical examination. The source of an \n     adopted child (e.g., whether from a licensed placement agency \n     or otherwise) is not a factor in determining eligibility for \n     leave for this purpose.\n       (e) Foster care is 24-hour care for children in \n     substitution for, and away from, their parents or guardian. \n     Such placement is made by or with the agreement of the State \n     as a result of a voluntary agreement between the parent or \n     guardian that the child be removed from the home, or pursuant \n     to a judicial determination of the necessity for foster care, \n     and involves agreement between the State and foster family \n     that the foster family will take care of the child. Although \n     foster care may be with relatives of the child, State action \n     is involved in the removal of the child from parental \n     custody.\n       (f) In situations where the employer/employee relationship \n     has been interrupted, such as an employee who has been on \n     layoff, the employee must be recalled or otherwise be re-\n     employed before being eligible for FMLA leave. Under such \n     circumstances, an eligible employee is immediately entitled \n     to further FMLA leave for a qualifying reason.\n       (g) FMLA leave is available for treatment for substance \n     abuse provided the conditions of Sec. 825.114 are met. \n     However, treatment for substance abuse does not prevent an \n     employing office from taking employment action against an \n     employee. The employing office may not take action against \n     the employee because the employee has exercised his or her \n     right to take FMLA leave for treatment. However, if the \n     employing office has an established policy, applied in a non-\n     discriminatory manner that has been communicated to all \n     employees, that provides under certain circumstances an \n     employee may be terminated for substance abuse, pursuant to \n     that policy the employee may be terminated whether or not the \n     employee is presently taking FMLA leave. An employee may also \n     take FMLA leave to care for an immediate family member who is \n     receiving treatment for substance abuse. The employing office \n     may not take action against an employee who is providing care \n     for an immediate family member receiving treatment for \n     substance abuse.\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\n     Sec. 825.113 What do ``spouse'', ``parent'', and ``son or \n       daughter'' mean for purposes of an employee qualifying to \n       take FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) Spouse means a husband or wife as defined or recognized \n     under State law for purposes of marriage in the State where \n     the employee resides, including common law marriage in States \n     where it is recognized.\n       (b) Parent means a biological parent or an individual who \n     stands or stood in loco parentis to an employee when the \n     employee was a son or daughter as defined in (c) below. This \n     term does not include parents ``in law''.\n       (c) Son or daughter means a biological, adopted, or foster \n     child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person \n     standing in loco parentis, who is either under age 18, or age \n     18 or older and ``incapable of self-care because of a mental \n     or physical disability''.\n       (1) ``Incapable of self-care'' means that the individual \n     requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily \n     self-care in three or more of the ``activities of daily \n     living'' (ADLs) or ``instrumental activities of daily \n     living'' (IADLs). Activities of daily living include adaptive \n     activities such as caring appropriately for one's grooming \n     and hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating. Instrumental \n     activities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, \n     shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills, \n     maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, \n     using a post office, etc.\n       (2) ``Physical or mental disability'' means a physical or \n     mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of \n     the major life activities of an individual. See the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by section \n     201(a)(3) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311(a)(3)).\n       (3) Persons who are ``in loco parentis'' include those with \n     day-to-day responsibilities to care for and financially \n     support a child or, in the case of an employee, who had such \n     responsibility for the employee when the employee was a \n     child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary.\n       (d) For purposes of confirmation of family relationship, \n     the employing office may require the employee giving notice \n     of the need for leave to provide reasonable documentation or \n     statement of family relationship. This documentation may take \n     the form of a simple statement from the employee, or a \n     child's birth certificate, a court document, etc. The \n     employing office is entitled to examine documentation such as \n     a birth certificate, etc., but the employee is entitled to \n     the return of the official document submitted for this \n     purpose.\n\n     Sec. 825.114 What is a ``serious health condition'' entitling \n       an employee to FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) For purposes of FMLA, ``serious health condition'' \n     entitling an employee to FMLA leave means an illness, injury, \n     impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:\n       (1) Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, \n     hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any \n     period of incapacity (for purposes of this section, defined \n     to mean inability to work, attend school or perform other \n     regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, \n     treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom), or any subsequent \n     treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or\n       (2) Continuing treatment by a health care provider. A \n     serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a \n     health care provider includes any one or more of the \n     following:\n       (i) A period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend \n     school or perform other regular daily activities due to the \n     serious health condition, treatment therefor, or recovery \n     therefrom) of more than three consecutive calendar days, and \n     any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to \n     the same condition, that also involves:\n       (A) Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, \n     by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision \n     of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care \n     services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider; or\n       (B) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment \n     under the supervision of the health care provider.\n       (ii) Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for \n     prenatal care.\n       (iii) Any period of incapacity or treatment for such \n     incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A \n     chronic serious health condition is one which:\n       (A) Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care \n     provider, or by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct \n     supervision of a health care provider;\n       (B) Continues over an extended period of time (including \n     recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n       (C) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of \n     incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n       (iv) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term \n     due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. \n     The employee or family member must be under the continuing \n     supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment \n     by, a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a \n     severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (v) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments \n     (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care \n     provider or by a provider of health care services under \n     orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either \n     for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or \n     for a condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in \n     the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (b) Treatment for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section \n     includes (but is not limited to) examinations to determine if \n     a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the \n     condition. Treatment does not include routine physical \n     examinations, eye examinations, or dental examinations. Under \n     paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B), a regimen of continuing treatment \n     includes, for example, a course of prescription medication \n     (e.g., an antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment \n     to resolve or alleviate the health condition (e.g., oxygen). \n     A regimen of continuing treatment that includes the taking of \n     over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, \n     or salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other \n     similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a \n     health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to \n     constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of \n     FMLA leave.\n       (c) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are \n     administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic \n     surgery) are not ``serious health conditions'' unless \n     inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications \n     develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common \n     cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, \n     headaches other than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia \n     problems, periodontal disease, etc., are examples of \n     conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious \n     health condition and do not qualify for FMLA leave. \n     Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or \n     removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions \n     provided all the other conditions of this regulation are met. \n     Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies may be \n     serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of \n     this section are met.\n       (d) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if \n     the conditions of this section are met. However, FMLA leave \n     may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a \n     health care provider or by a provider of health care services \n     on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand, \n     absence because of the employee's use of the substance, \n     rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.\n       (e) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (a)(2) (ii) or (iii) qualify for FMLA leave even though the \n     employee or the immediate family member does not receive \n     treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and \n     even if the absence does not last more than three days. For \n     example, an employee with asthma may be unable to report for \n     work due to the onset of an asthma attack or because the \n     employee's health care provider has advised the employee to \n     stay home when the pollen count exceeds a certain level. An \n     employee who is pregnant may be unable to report to work \n     because of severe morning sickness.\n\n     Sec. 825.115 What does it mean that ``the employee is unable \n       to perform the functions of the position of the employee''?\n\n       An employee is ``unable to perform the functions of the \n     position'' where the health care provider finds that the \n     employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform any \n     one of the essential functions of the employee's position \n     within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (ADA), as made applicable by section 201(a)(3) of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. 1311(a)(3)). An employee who must be absent from work \n     to receive medical treatment for a serious health condition \n     is considered to be unable to perform the essential functions \n     of the position during the absence for treatment. An \n     employing office has the option, in requiring certification \n     from a health care provider, to provide a statement of the \n     essential functions of the employee's position for the health \n     care provider to review. For purposes of FMLA, the essential \n     functions of the employee's position are to be determined \n     with reference to the position the employee held at the time \n     notice is given or leave commenced, whichever is earlier.\n\n     Sec. 825.116 What does it mean that an employee is ``needed \n       to care for'' a family member?\n\n       (a) The medical certification provision that an employee is \n     ``needed to care for'' a family member encompasses both \n     physical and psychological care. It includes situations \n     where, for example, because of a serious health condition, \n     the family member is unable to care for his or her own basic \n     medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, or is \n     unable to transport himself or herself to the doctor, etc. \n     The term also includes providing psychological comfort and \n     reassurance which would be beneficial to a child, spouse or \n     parent with a serious health condition who is receiving \n     inpatient or home care.\n       (b) The term also includes situations where the employee \n     may be needed to fill in for others who are caring for the \n     family member, or to make arrangements for changes in care, \n     such as transfer to a nursing home.\n       (c) An employee's intermittent leave or a reduced leave \n     schedule necessary to care for a family member includes not \n     only a situation where the family member's condition itself \n     is intermittent, but also where the employee is only needed \n     intermittently ``such as where other care is normally \n     available, or care responsibilities are shared with another \n     member of the family or a third party.\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\n     Sec. 825.117 For an employee seeking intermittent FMLA leave \n       or leave on a reduced leave schedule, what is meant by \n       ``the medical necessity for'' such leave?\n\n       For intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave \n     schedule, there must be a medical need for leave (as \n     distinguished from voluntary treatments and procedures) and \n     it must be that such medical need can be best accommodated \n     through an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. The \n     treatment regimen and other information described in the \n     certification of a serious health condition (see \n     Sec. 825.306) meets the requirement for certification of the \n     medical necessity of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule. Employees needing intermittent FMLA leave or \n     leave on a reduced leave schedule must attempt to schedule \n     their leave so as not to disrupt the employing office's \n     operations. In addition, an employing office may assign an \n     employee to an alternative position with equivalent pay and \n     benefits that better accommodates the employee's intermittent \n     or reduced leave schedule.\n\n     Sec. 825.118 What is a ``health care provider''?\n\n       (a)(1) The term ``health care provider'' means:\n       (i) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to \n     practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State in \n     which the doctor practices; or\n       (ii) Any other person determined by the Office of \n     Compliance to be capable of providing health care services.\n       (2) In making a determination referred to in subparagraph \n     (1)(ii), and absent good cause shown to do otherwise, the \n     Office of Compliance will follow any determination made by \n     the Secretary of Labor (under section 101(6)(B) of the FMLA, \n     29 U.S.C. 2611(6)(B)) that a person is capable of providing \n     health care services, provided the Secretary's determination \n     was not made at the request of a person who was then a \n     covered employee.\n       (b) Others ``capable of providing health care services'' \n     include only:\n       (1) Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, \n     optometrists, and chiropractors (limited to treatment \n     consisting of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a \n     subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist) authorized to \n     practice in the State and performing within the scope of \n     their practice as defined under State law;\n       (2) Nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives and clinical social \n     workers who are authorized to practice under State law and \n     who are performing within the scope of their practice as \n     defined under State law;\n       (3) Christian Science practitioners listed with the First \n     Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts. Where \n     an employee or family member is receiving treatment from a \n     Christian Science practitioner, an employee may not object to \n     any requirement from an employing office that the employee or \n     family member submit to examination (though not treatment) to \n     obtain a second or third certification from a health care \n     provider other than a Christian Science practitioner except \n     as otherwise provided under applicable State or local law or \n     collective bargaining agreement.\n       (4) Any health care provider from whom an employing office \n     or the employing office's group health plan's benefits \n     manager will accept certification of the existence of a \n     serious health condition to substantiate a claim for \n     benefits; and\n       (5) A health care provider listed above who practices in a \n     country other than the United States, who is authorized to \n     practice in accordance with the law of that country, and who \n     is performing within the scope of his or her practice as \n     defined under such law.\n       (c) The phrase ``authorized to practice in the State'' as \n     used in this section means that the provider must be \n     authorized to diagnose and treat physical or mental health \n     conditions without supervision by a doctor or other health \n     care provider.\n\nSubpart B--What Leave Is an Employee Entitled To Take Under the Family \n    and Medical Leave Act, as Made Applicable by the Congressional \n                          Accountability Act?\n\n     Sec. 825.200 How much leave may an employee take?\n\n       (a) An eligible employee's FMLA leave entitlement is \n     limited to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-\n     month period for any one, or more, of the following reasons:\n       (1) The birth of the employee's son or daughter, and to \n     care for the newborn child;\n       (2) The placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly placed \n     child;\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition; and\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform one or more of the essential \n     functions of his or her job.\n       (b) An employing office is permitted to choose any one of \n     the following methods for determining the ``12-month period'' \n     in which the 12 weeks of leave entitlement occurs:\n       (1) The calendar year;\n       (2) Any fixed 12-month ``leave year'', such as a fiscal \n     year or a year starting on an employee's ``anniversary'' \n     date;\n       (3) The 12-month period measured forward from the date any \n     employee's first FMLA leave begins; or\n       (4) A ``rolling'' 12-month period measured backward from \n     the date an employee uses any FMLA leave (except that such \n     measure may not extend back before the date on which the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections first becomes \n     effective for the employing office; see Sec. 825.102).\n       (c) Under methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this \n     section an employee would be entitled to up to 12 weeks of \n     FMLA leave at any time in the fixed 12-month period selected. \n     An employee could, therefore, take 12 weeks of leave at the \n     end of the year and 12 weeks at the beginning of the \n     following year. Under the method in paragraph (b)(3) of this \n     section, an employee would be entitled to 12 weeks of leave \n     during the year beginning on the first date FMLA leave is \n     taken; the next 12-month period would begin the first time \n     FMLA leave is taken after completion of any previous 12-month \n     period. Under the method in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, \n     the ``rolling'' 12-month period, each time an employee takes \n     FMLA leave the remaining leave entitlement would be any \n     balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the \n     immediately preceding 12 months. For example, if an employee \n     has taken eight weeks of leave during the past 12 months, an \n     additional four weeks of leave could be taken. If an employee \n     used four weeks beginning February 1, 1997, four weeks \n     beginning June 1, 1997, and four weeks beginning December 1, \n     1997, the employee would not be entitled to any additional \n     leave until February 1, 1998. However, beginning on February \n     1, 1998, the employee would be entitled to four weeks of \n     leave, on June 1 the employee would be entitled to an \n     additional four weeks, etc.\n       (d)(1) Employing offices will be allowed to choose any one \n     of the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section provided \n     the alternative chosen is applied consistently and uniformly \n     to all employees. An employing office wishing to change to \n     another alternative is required to give at least 60 days \n     notice to all employees, and the transition must take place \n     in such a way that the employees retain the full benefit of \n     12 weeks of leave under whichever method affords the greatest \n     benefit to the employee. Under no circumstances may a new \n     method be implemented in order to avoid the CAA's FMLA leave \n     requirements.\n       (2) [Reserved].\n       (e) If an employing office fails to select one of the \n     options in paragraph (b) of this section for measuring the \n     12-month period, the option that provides the most beneficial \n     outcome for the employee will be used. The employing office \n     may subsequently select an option only by providing the 60-\n     day notice to all employees of the option the employing \n     office intends to implement. During the running of the 60-day \n     period any other employee who needs FMLA leave may use the \n     option providing the most beneficial outcome to that \n     employee. At the conclusion of the 60-day period the \n     employing office may implement the selected option.\n       (f) For purposes of determining the amount of leave used by \n     an employee, the fact that a holiday may occur within the \n     week taken as FMLA leave has no effect; the week is counted \n     as a week of FMLA leave. However, if for some reason the \n     employing office's activity has temporarily ceased and \n     employees generally are not expected to report for work for \n     one or more weeks (e.g., a school closing two weeks for the \n     Christmas/New Year holiday or the summer vacation or an \n     employing office closing the office for repairs), the days \n     the employing office's activities have ceased do not count \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. Methods for \n     determining an employee's 12-week leave entitlement are also \n     described in Sec. 825.205.\n       (g)(1) If employing offices jointly employ an employee, and \n     if they designate a primary employer pursuant to \n     Sec. 825.106(c), the primary employer may choose any one of \n     the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section for \n     measuring the 12-month period, provided that the alternative \n     chosen is applied consistently and uniformly to all employees \n     of the primary employer including the jointly employed \n     employee.\n       (2) If employing offices fail to designated a primary \n     employer pursuant to Sec. 825.106(c), an employee jointly \n     employed by the employing offices may, by so notifying one of \n     the employing offices, select that employing office to be the \n     primary employer of the employee for purposes of the \n     application of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.\n\n     Sec. 825.201  If leave is taken for the birth of a child, or \n       for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, when \n       must the leave be concluded?\n\n       An employee's entitlement to leave for a birth or placement \n     for adoption or foster care expires at the end of the 12-\n     month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement, \n     unless the employing office permits leave to be taken for a \n     longer period. Any such FMLA leave must be concluded within \n     this one-year period.\n\n     Sec. 825.202  How much leave may a husband and wife take if \n       they are employed by the same employing office?\n\n       (a) A husband and wife who are eligible for FMLA leave and \n     are employed by the same employing office may be limited to a \n     combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month \n     period if the leave is taken--\n       (1) for birth of the employee's son or daughter or to care \n     for the child after birth;\n       (2) for placement of a son or daughter with the employee \n     for adoption or foster care, or to care for the child after \n     placement; or\n       (3) to care for the employee's parent with a serious health \n     condition.\n       (b) This limitation on the total weeks of leave applies to \n     leave taken for the reasons\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\n     specified in paragraph (a) of this section as long as a \n     husband and wife are employed by the ``same employing \n     office''. It would apply, for example, even though the \n     spouses are employed at two different work sites of an \n     employing office. On the other hand, if one spouse is \n     ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would be entitled \n     to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave.\n       (c) Where the husband and wife both use a portion of the \n     total 12-week FMLA leave entitlement for one of the purposes \n     in paragraph (a) of this section, the husband and wife would \n     each be entitled to the difference between the amount he or \n     she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for a \n     purpose other than those contained in paragraph (a) of this \n     section. For example, if each spouse took 6 weeks of leave to \n     care for a healthy, newborn child, each could use an \n     additional 6 weeks due to his or her own serious health \n     condition or to care for a child with a serious health \n     condition.\n\n     Sec. 825.203  Does FMLA leave have to be taken all at once, \n       or can it be taken in parts?\n\n       (a) FMLA leave may be taken ``intermittently or on a \n     reduced leave schedule'' under certain circumstances. \n     Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of \n     time due to a single qualifying reason. A reduced leave \n     schedule is a leave schedule that reduces an employee's usual \n     number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday. A \n     reduced leave schedule is a change in the employee's schedule \n     for a period of time, normally from full-time to part-time.\n       (b) When leave is taken after the birth or placement of a \n     child for adoption or foster care, an employee may take leave \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only if the \n     employing office agrees. Such a schedule reduction might \n     occur, for example, where an employee, with the employing \n     office's agreement, works part-time after the birth of a \n     child, or takes leave in several segments. The employing \n     office's agreement is not required, however, for leave during \n     which the mother has a serious health condition in connection \n     with the birth of her child or if the newborn child has a \n     serious health condition.\n       (c) Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave \n     schedule when medically necessary for planned and/or \n     unanticipated medical treatment of a related serious health \n     condition by or under the supervision of a health care \n     provider, or for recovery from treatment or recovery from a \n     serious health condition. It may also be taken to provide \n     care or psychological comfort to an immediate family member \n     with a serious health condition.\n       (1) Intermittent leave may be taken for a serious health \n     condition which requires treatment by a health care provider \n     periodically, rather than for one continuous period of time, \n     and may include leave of periods from an hour or more to \n     several weeks. Examples of intermittent leave would include \n     leave taken on an occasional basis for medical appointments, \n     or leave taken several days at a time spread over a period of \n     six months, such as for chemotherapy. A pregnant employee may \n     take leave intermittently for prenatal examinations or for \n     her own condition, such as for periods of severe morning \n     sickness. An example of an employee taking leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule is an employee who is recovering from a \n     serious health condition and is not strong enough to work a \n     full-time schedule.\n       (2) Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may be taken for \n     absences where the employee or family member is incapacitated \n     or unable to perform the essential functions of the position \n     because of a chronic serious health condition even if he or \n     she does not receive treatment by a health care provider.\n       (d) There is no limit on the size of an increment of leave \n     when an employee takes intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule. However, an employing office may \n     limit leave increments to the shortest period of time that \n     the employing office's payroll system uses to account for \n     absences or use of leave, provided it is one hour or less. \n     For example, an employee might take two hours off for a \n     medical appointment, or might work a reduced day of four \n     hours over a period of several weeks while recuperating from \n     an illness. An employee may not be required to take more FMLA \n     leave than necessary to address the circumstance that \n     precipitated the need for the leave, except as provided in \n     Sec. Sec. 825.601 and 825.602.\n\n     Sec. 825.204 May an employing office transfer an employee to \n       an ``alternative position'' in order to accommodate \n       intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule?\n\n       (a) If an employee needs intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule that is foreseeable based on planned \n     medical treatment for the employee or a family member, \n     including during a period of recovery from a serious health \n     condition, or if the employing office agrees to permit \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the birth of a \n     child or for placement of a child for adoption or foster \n     care, the employing office may require the employee to \n     transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule is required, to an available \n     alternative position for which the employee is qualified and \n     which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than \n     does the employee's regular position. See Sec. 825.601 for \n     special rules applicable to instructional employees of \n     schools.\n       (b) Transfer to an alternative position may require \n     compliance with any applicable collective bargaining \n     agreement and any applicable law (such as the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, as made applicable by the CAA). Transfer to \n     an alternative position may include altering an existing job \n     to better accommodate the employee's need for intermittent or \n     reduced leave.\n       (c) The alternative position must have equivalent pay and \n     benefits. An alternative position for these purposes does not \n     have to have equivalent duties. The employing office may \n     increase the pay and benefits of an existing alternative \n     position, so as to make them equivalent to the pay and \n     benefits of the employee's regular job. The employing office \n     may also transfer the employee to a part-time job with the \n     same hourly rate of pay and benefits, provided the employee \n     is not required to take more leave than is medically \n     necessary. For example, an employee desiring to take leave in \n     increments of four hours per day could be transferred to a \n     half-time job, or could remain in the employee's same job on \n     a part-time schedule, paying the same hourly rate as the \n     employee's previous job and enjoying the same benefits. The \n     employing office may not eliminate benefits which otherwise \n     would not be provided to part-time employees; however, an \n     employing office may proportionately reduce benefits such as \n     vacation leave where an employing office's normal practice is \n     to base such benefits on the number of hours worked.\n       (d) An employing office may not transfer the employee to an \n     alternative position in order to discourage the employee from \n     taking leave or otherwise work a hardship on the employee. \n     For example, a white collar employee may not be assigned to \n     perform laborer's work; an employee working the day shift may \n     not be reassigned to the graveyard shift; an employee working \n     in the headquarters facility may not be reassigned to a \n     branch a significant distance away from the employee's normal \n     job location. Any such attempt on the part of the employing \n     office to make such a transfer will be held to be contrary to \n     the prohibited-acts provisions of the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (e) When an employee who is taking leave intermittently or \n     on a reduced leave schedule and has been transferred to an \n     alternative position no longer needs to continue on leave and \n     is able to return to full-time work, the employee must be \n     placed in the same or equivalent job as the job he/she left \n     when the leave commenced. An employee may not be required to \n     take more leave than necessary to address the circumstance \n     that precipitated the need for leave.\n\n     Sec. 825.205 How does one determine the amount of leave used \n       where an employee takes leave intermittently or on a \n       reduced leave schedule?\n\n       (a) If an employee takes leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule, only the amount of leave actually \n     taken may be counted toward the 12 weeks of leave to which an \n     employee is entitled. For example, if an employee who \n     normally works five days a week takes off one day, the \n     employee would use \\1/5\\ of a week of FMLA leave. Similarly, \n     if a full-time employee who normally works 8-hour days works \n     4-hour days under a reduced leave schedule, the employee \n     would use \\1/2\\ week of FMLA leave each week.\n       (b) Where an employee normally works a part-time schedule \n     or variable hours, the amount of leave to which an employee \n     is entitled is determined on a pro rata or proportional basis \n     by comparing the new schedule with the employee's normal \n     schedule. For example, if an employee who normally works 30 \n     hours per week works only 20 hours a week under a reduced \n     leave schedule, the employee's ten hours of leave would \n     constitute one-third of a week of FMLA leave for each week \n     the employee works the reduced leave schedule.\n       (c) If an employing office has made a permanent or long-\n     term change in the employee's schedule (for reasons other \n     than FMLA, and prior to the notice of need for FMLA leave), \n     the hours worked under the new schedule are to be used for \n     making this calculation.\n       (d) If an employee's schedule varies from week to week, a \n     weekly average of the hours worked over the 12 weeks prior to \n     the beginning of the leave period would be used for \n     calculating the employee's normal workweek.\n\n     Sec. 825.206 May an employing office deduct hourly amounts \n       from an employee's salary, when providing unpaid leave \n       under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, without \n       affecting the employee's qualification for exemption as an \n       executive, administrative, or professional employee, or \n       when utilizing the fluctuating workweek method for payment \n       of overtime, under the Fair Labor Standards Act?\n\n       (a) Leave taken under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     may be unpaid. If an employee is otherwise exempt from \n     minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA), as made applicable by the CAA, as a \n     salaried executive, administrative, or professional employee \n     (under regulations issued by the Board, at part 541), \n     providing unpaid FMLA-qualifying leave to such an employee \n     will not cause the employee to lose the FLSA exemption. This \n     means that under regulations currently in effect, where an \n     employee meets the specified duties test, is paid on a salary \n     basis, and is paid a salary of at least the amount specified \n     in the regulations, the employing office may make deductions \n     from the employee's salary for any hours taken as \n     intermittent or reduced FMLA leave within\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\n     a workweek, without affecting the exempt status of the \n     employee. The fact that an employing office provides FMLA \n     leave, whether paid or unpaid, or maintains any records \n     regarding FMLA leave, will not be relevant to the \n     determination whether an employee is exempt within the \n     meaning of the Board's regulations at part 541.\n       (b) For an employee paid in accordance with a fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment for overtime, where permitted by \n     section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), the employing office, \n     during the period in which intermittent or reduced schedule \n     FMLA leave is scheduled to be taken, may compensate an \n     employee on an hourly basis and pay only for the hours the \n     employee works, including time and one-half the employee's \n     regular rate for overtime hours. The change to payment on an \n     hourly basis would include the entire period during which the \n     employee is taking intermittent leave, including weeks in \n     which no leave is taken. The hourly rate shall be determined \n     by dividing the employee's weekly salary by the employee's \n     normal or average schedule of hours worked during weeks in \n     which FMLA leave is not being taken. If an employing office \n     chooses to follow this exception from the fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment, the employing office must do so \n     uniformly, with respect to all employees paid on a \n     fluctuating workweek basis for whom FMLA leave is taken on an \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis. If an employing \n     office does not elect to convert the employee's compensation \n     to hourly pay, no deduction may be taken for FMLA leave \n     absences. Once the need for intermittent or reduced scheduled \n     leave is over, the employee may be restored to payment on a \n     fluctuating workweek basis.\n       (c) This special exception to the ``salary basis'' \n     requirements of the FLSA exemption or fluctuating workweek \n     payment requirements applies only to employees of employing \n     offices who are eligible for FMLA leave, and to leave which \n     qualifies as (one of the four types of) FMLA leave. Hourly or \n     other deductions which are not in accordance with the Board's \n     regulations at part 541 or with a permissible fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment for overtime may not be taken, for \n     example, where the employee has not worked long enough to be \n     eligible for FMLA leave without potentially affecting the \n     employee's eligibility for exemption. Nor may deductions \n     which are not permitted by the Board's regulations at part \n     541 or by a permissible fluctuating workweek method of \n     payment for overtime be taken from such an employee's salary \n     for any leave which does not qualify as FMLA leave, for \n     example, deductions from an employee's pay for leave required \n     under an employing office's policy or practice for a reason \n     which does not qualify as FMLA leave, e.g., leave to care for \n     a grandparent or for a medical condition which does not \n     qualify as a serious health condition; or for leave which is \n     more generous than provided by FMLA as made applicable by the \n     CAA, such as leave in excess of 12 weeks in a year. The \n     employing office may comply with the employing office's own \n     policy/practice under these circumstances and maintain the \n     employee's eligibility for exemption or for the fluctuating \n     workweek method of pay by not taking hourly deductions from \n     the employee's pay, in accordance with FLSA requirements, or \n     may take such deductions, treating the employee as an \n     ``hourly'' employee and pay overtime premium pay for hours \n     worked over 40 in a workweek.\n\n     Sec. 825.207 Is FMLA leave paid or unpaid?\n\n       (a) Generally, FMLA leave is unpaid. However, under the \n     circumstances described in this section, FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, permits an eligible employee to choose \n     to substitute paid leave for FMLA leave. If an employee does \n     not choose to substitute accrued paid leave, the employing \n     office may require the employee to substitute accrued paid \n     leave for FMLA leave.\n       (b) Where an employee has earned or accrued paid vacation, \n     personal or family leave, that paid leave may be substituted \n     for all or part of any (otherwise) unpaid FMLA leave relating \n     to birth, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, \n     or care for a spouse, child or parent who has a serious \n     health condition. The term ``family leave'' as used in FMLA \n     refers to paid leave provided by the employing office \n     covering the particular circumstances for which the employee \n     seeks leave for either the birth of a child and to care for \n     such child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, \n     or care for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health \n     condition. For example, if the employing office's leave plan \n     allows use of family leave to care for a child but not for a \n     parent, the employing office is not required to allow accrued \n     family leave to be substituted for FMLA leave used to care \n     for a parent.\n       (c) Substitution of paid accrued vacation, personal, or \n     medical/sick leave may be made for any (otherwise) unpaid \n     FMLA leave needed to care for a family member or the \n     employee's own serious health condition. Substitution of paid \n     sick/medical leave may be elected to the extent the \n     circumstances meet the employing office's usual requirements \n     for the use of sick/medical leave. An employing office is not \n     required to allow substitution of paid sick or medical leave \n     for unpaid FMLA leave ``in any situation'' where the \n     employing office's uniform policy would not normally allow \n     such paid leave. An employee, therefore, has a right to \n     substitute paid medical/sick leave to care for a seriously \n     ill family member only if the employing office's leave plan \n     allows paid leave to be used for that purpose. Similarly, an \n     employee does not have a right to substitute paid medical/\n     sick leave for a serious health condition which is not \n     covered by the employing office's leave plan.\n       (d)(1) Disability leave for the birth of a child would be \n     considered FMLA leave for a serious health condition and \n     counted in the 12 weeks of leave permitted under FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA. Because the leave pursuant to a \n     temporary disability benefit plan is not unpaid, the \n     provision for substitution of paid leave is inapplicable. \n     However, the employing office may designate the leave as FMLA \n     leave and count the leave as running concurrently for \n     purposes of both the benefit plan and the FMLA leave \n     entitlement. If the requirements to qualify for payments \n     pursuant to the employing office's temporary disability plan \n     are more stringent than those of FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA, the employee must meet the more stringent \n     requirements of the plan, or may choose not to meet the \n     requirements of the plan and instead receive no payments from \n     the plan and use unpaid FMLA leave or substitute available \n     accrued paid leave.\n       (2) The FMLA as made applicable by the CAA provides that a \n     serious health condition may result from injury to the \n     employee ``on or off'' the job. If the employing office \n     designates the leave as FMLA leave in accordance with \n     Sec. 825.208, the employee's FMLA 12-week leave entitlement \n     may run concurrently with a workers' compensation absence \n     when the injury is one that meets the criteria for a serious \n     health condition. As the workers' compensation absence is not \n     unpaid leave, the provision for substitution of the \n     employee's accrued paid leave is not applicable. However, if \n     the health care provider treating the employee for the \n     workers' compensation injury certifies the employee is able \n     to return to a ``light duty job'' but is unable to return to \n     the same or equivalent job, the employee may decline the \n     employing office's offer of a ``light duty job''. As a result \n     the employee may lose workers' compensation payments, but is \n     entitled to remain on unpaid FMLA leave until the 12-week \n     entitlement is exhausted. As of the date workers' \n     compensation benefits cease, the substitution provision \n     becomes applicable and either the employee may elect or the \n     employing office may require the use of accrued paid leave. \n     See also Sec. Sec.  825.210(f), 825.216(d), 825.220(d), \n     825.307(a)(1) and 825.702(d) (1) and (2) regarding the \n     relationship between workers' compensation absences and FMLA \n     leave.\n       (e) Paid vacation or personal leave, including leave earned \n     or accrued under plans allowing ``paid time off'', may be \n     substituted, at either the employee's or the employing \n     office's option, for any qualified FMLA leave. No limitations \n     may be placed by the employing office on substitution of paid \n     vacation or personal leave for these purposes.\n       (f) If neither the employee nor the employing office elects \n     to substitute paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave under the \n     above conditions and circumstances, the employee will remain \n     entitled to all the paid leave which is earned or accrued \n     under the terms of the employing office's plan.\n       (g) If an employee uses paid leave under circumstances \n     which do not qualify as FMLA leave, the leave will not count \n     against the 12 weeks of FMLA leave to which the employee is \n     entitled. For example, paid sick leave used for a medical \n     condition which is not a serious health condition does not \n     count against the 12 weeks of FMLA leave entitlement.\n       (h) When an employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid leave (of any type) for unpaid FMLA leave \n     under circumstances permitted by these regulations, and the \n     employing office's procedural requirements for taking that \n     kind of leave are less stringent than the requirements of \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA (e.g., notice or \n     certification requirements), only the less stringent \n     requirements may be imposed. An employee who complies with an \n     employing office's less stringent leave plan requirements in \n     such cases may not have leave for an FMLA purpose delayed or \n     denied on the grounds that the employee has not complied with \n     stricter requirements of FMLA as made applicable by the CAA. \n     However, where accrued paid vacation or personal leave is \n     substituted for unpaid FMLA leave for a serious health \n     condition, an employee may be required to comply with any \n     less stringent medical certification requirements of the \n     employing office's sick leave program. See \n     Sec. Sec. 825.302(g), 825.305(e) and 825.306(c).\n       (i) Compensatory time off, if any is authorized under \n     applicable law, is not a form of accrued paid leave that an \n     employing office may require the employee to substitute for \n     unpaid FMLA leave. The employee may request to use his/her \n     balance of compensatory time for an FMLA reason. If the \n     employing office permits the accrual of compensatory time to \n     be used in compliance with applicable Board regulations, the \n     absence which is paid from the employee's accrued \n     compensatory time ``account'' may not be counted against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n\n     Sec. 825.208 Under what circumstances may an employing office \n       designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA leave and, as a \n       result, enable leave to be counted against the employee's \n       total FMLA leave entitlement?\n\n       (a) In all circumstances, it is the employing office's \n     responsibility to designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-\n     qualifying, and to give notice of the designation to the \n     employee as provided in this section. In the\n\n[[Page S4527]]\n\n     case of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule, \n     only one such notice is required unless the circumstances \n     regarding the leave have changed. The employing office's \n     designation decision must be based only on information \n     received from the employee or the employee's spokesperson \n     (e.g., if the employee is incapacitated, the employee's \n     spouse, adult child, parent, doctor, etc., may provide notice \n     to the employing office of the need to take FMLA leave). In \n     any circumstance where the employing office does not have \n     sufficient information about the reason for an employee's use \n     of paid leave, the employing office should inquire further of \n     the employee or the spokesperson to ascertain whether the \n     paid leave is potentially FMLA-qualifying.\n       (1) An employee giving notice of the need for unpaid FMLA \n     leave must explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to \n     allow the employing office to determine that the leave \n     qualifies under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. If \n     the employee fails to explain the reasons, leave may be \n     denied. In many cases, in explaining the reasons for a \n     request to use paid leave, especially when the need for the \n     leave was unexpected or unforeseen, an employee will provide \n     sufficient information for the employing office to designate \n     the paid leave as FMLA leave. An employee using accrued paid \n     leave, especially vacation or personal leave, may in some \n     cases not spontaneously explain the reasons or their plans \n     for using their accrued leave.\n       (2) As noted in Sec. 825.302(c), an employee giving notice \n     of the need for unpaid FMLA leave does not need to expressly \n     assert rights under the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA or \n     even mention the FMLA to meet his or her obligation to \n     provide notice, though the employee would need to state a \n     qualifying reason for the needed leave. An employee \n     requesting or notifying the employing office of an intent to \n     use accrued paid leave, even if for a purpose covered by \n     FMLA, would not need to assert such right either. However, if \n     an employee requesting to use paid leave for an FMLA-\n     qualifying purpose does not explain the reason for the \n     leave--consistent with the employing office's established \n     policy or practice--and the employing office denies the \n     employee's request, the employee will need to provide \n     sufficient information to establish an FMLA-qualifying reason \n     for the needed leave so that the employing office is aware of \n     the employee's entitlement (i.e., that the leave may not be \n     denied) and, then, may designate that the paid leave be \n     appropriately counted against (substituted for) the \n     employee's 12-week entitlement. Similarly, an employee using \n     accrued paid vacation leave who seeks an extension of unpaid \n     leave for an FMLA-qualifying purpose will need to state the \n     reason. If this is due to an event which occurred during the \n     period of paid leave, the employing office may count the \n     leave used after the FMLA-qualifying event against the \n     employee's 12-week entitlement.\n       (b)(1) Once the employing office has acquired knowledge \n     that the leave is being taken for an FMLA required reason, \n     the employing office must promptly (within two business days \n     absent extenuating circumstances) notify the employee that \n     the paid leave is designated and will be counted as FMLA \n     leave. If there is a dispute between an employing office and \n     an employee as to whether paid leave qualifies as FMLA leave, \n     it should be resolved through discussions between the \n     employee and the employing office. Such discussions and the \n     decision must be documented.\n       (2) The employing office's notice to the employee that the \n     leave has been designated as FMLA leave may be orally or in \n     writing. If the notice is oral, it shall be confirmed in \n     writing, no later than the following payday (unless the \n     payday is less than one week after the oral notice, in which \n     case the notice must be no later than the subsequent payday). \n     The written notice may be in any form, including a notation \n     on the employee's pay stub.\n       (c) If the employing office requires paid leave to be \n     substituted for unpaid leave, or that paid leave taken under \n     an existing leave plan be counted as FMLA leave, this \n     decision must be made by the employing office within two \n     business days of the time the employee gives notice of the \n     need for leave, or, where the employing office does not \n     initially have sufficient information to make a \n     determination, when the employing office determines that the \n     leave qualifies as FMLA leave if this happens later. The \n     employing office's designation must be made before the leave \n     starts, unless the employing office does not have sufficient \n     information as to the employee's reason for taking the leave \n     until after the leave commenced. If the employing office has \n     the requisite knowledge to make a determination that the paid \n     leave is for an FMLA reason at the time the employee either \n     gives notice of the need for leave or commences leave and \n     fails to designate the leave as FMLA leave (and so notify the \n     employee in accordance with paragraph (b)), the employing \n     office may not designate leave as FMLA leave retroactively, \n     and may designate only prospectively as of the date of \n     notification to the employee of the designation. In such \n     circumstances, the employee is subject to the full \n     protections of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, but \n     none of the absence preceding the notice to the employee of \n     the designation may be counted against the employee's 12-week \n     FMLA leave entitlement.\n       (d) If the employing office learns that leave is for an \n     FMLA purpose after leave has begun, such as when an employee \n     gives notice of the need for an extension of the paid leave \n     with unpaid FMLA leave, the entire or some portion of the \n     paid leave period may be retroactively counted as FMLA leave, \n     to the extent that the leave period qualified as FMLA leave. \n     For example, an employee is granted two weeks paid vacation \n     leave for a skiing trip. In mid-week of the second week, the \n     employee contacts the employing office for an extension of \n     leave as unpaid leave and advises that at the beginning of \n     the second week of paid vacation leave the employee suffered \n     a severe accident requiring hospitalization. The employing \n     office may notify the employee that both the extension and \n     the second week of paid vacation leave (from the date of the \n     injury) is designated as FMLA leave. On the other hand, when \n     the employee takes sick leave that turns into a serious \n     health condition (e.g., bronchitis that turns into bronchial \n     pneumonia) and the employee gives notice of the need for an \n     extension of leave, the entire period of the serious health \n     condition may be counted as FMLA leave.\n       (e) Employing offices may not designate leave as FMLA leave \n     after the employee has returned to work with two exceptions:\n       (1) If the employee was absent for an FMLA reason and the \n     employing office did not learn the reason for the absence \n     until the employee's return (e.g., where the employee was \n     absent for only a brief period), the employing office may, \n     upon the employee's return to work, promptly (within two \n     business days of the employee's return to work) designate the \n     leave retroactively with appropriate notice to the employee. \n     If leave is taken for an FMLA reason but the employing office \n     was not aware of the reason, and the employee desires that \n     the leave be counted as FMLA leave, the employee must notify \n     the employing office within two business days of returning to \n     work of the reason for the leave. In the absence of such \n     timely notification by the employee, the employee may not \n     subsequently assert FMLA protections for the absence.\n       (2) If the employing office knows the reason for the leave \n     but has not been able to confirm that the leave qualifies \n     under FMLA, or where the employing office has requested \n     medical certification which has not yet been received or the \n     parties are in the process of obtaining a second or third \n     medical opinion, the employing office should make a \n     preliminary designation, and so notify the employee, at the \n     time leave begins, or as soon as the reason for the leave \n     becomes known. Upon receipt of the requisite information from \n     the employee or of the medical certification which confirms \n     the leave is for an FMLA reason, the preliminary designation \n     becomes final. If the medical certifications fail to confirm \n     that the reason for the absence was an FMLA reason, the \n     employing office must withdraw the designation (with written \n     notice to the employee).\n       (f) If, before beginning employment with an employing \n     office, an employee had been employed by another employing \n     office, the subsequent employing office may count against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement FMLA leave taken from the \n     prior employing office, except that, if the FMLA leave began \n     after the effective date of these regulations (or if the FMLA \n     leave was subject to other applicable requirement under which \n     the employing office was to have designated the leave as FMLA \n     leave), the prior employing office must have properly \n     designated the leave as FMLA under these regulations or other \n     applicable requirement.\n\n     Sec. 825.209 Is an employee entitled to benefits while using \n       FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) During any FMLA leave, the employing office must \n     maintain the employee's coverage under the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program or any group health plan (as defined \n     in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at 26 U.S.C. 5000(b)(1)) \n     on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided \n     if the employee had been continuously employed during the \n     entire leave period. All employing offices are subject to the \n     requirements of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to \n     maintain health coverage. The definition of ``group health \n     plan'' is set forth in Sec. 825.800. For purposes of FMLA, \n     the term ``group health plan'' shall not include an insurance \n     program providing health coverage under which employees \n     purchase individual policies from insurers provided that--\n       (1) no contributions are made by the employing office;\n       (2) participation in the program is completely voluntary \n     for employees;\n       (3) the sole functions of the employing office with respect \n     to the program are, without endorsing the program, to permit \n     the insurer to publicize the program to employees, to collect \n     premiums through payroll deductions and to remit them to the \n     insurer;\n       (4) the employing office receives no consideration in the \n     form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program, \n     other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for \n     administrative services actually rendered in connection with \n     payroll deduction; and\n       (5) the premium charged with respect to such coverage does \n     not increase in the event the employment relationship \n     terminates.\n       (b) The same group health plan benefits provided to an \n     employee prior to taking FMLA leave must be maintained during \n     the FMLA leave. For example, if family member coverage is \n     provided to an employee, family member coverage must be \n     maintained during the FMLA leave. Similarly, benefit coverage\n\n[[Page S4528]]\n\n     during FMLA leave for medical care, surgical care, hospital \n     care, dental care, eye care, mental health counseling, \n     substance abuse treatment, etc., must be maintained during \n     leave if provided in an employing office's group health plan, \n     including a supplement to a group health plan, whether or not \n     provided through a flexible spending account or other \n     component of a cafeteria plan.\n       (c) If an employing office provides a new health plan or \n     benefits or changes health benefits or plans while an \n     employee is on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to the \n     new or changed plan/benefits to the same extent as if the \n     employee were not on leave. For example, if an employing \n     office changes a group health plan so that dental care \n     becomes covered under the plan, an employee on FMLA leave \n     must be given the same opportunity as other employees to \n     receive (or obtain) the dental care coverage. Any other plan \n     changes (e.g., in coverage, premiums, deductibles, etc.) \n     which apply to all employees of the workforce would also \n     apply to an employee on FMLA leave.\n       (d) Notice of any opportunity to change plans or benefits \n     must also be given to an employee on FMLA leave. If the group \n     health plan permits an employee to change from single to \n     family coverage upon the birth of a child or otherwise add \n     new family members, such a change in benefits must be made \n     available while an employee is on FMLA leave. If the employee \n     requests the changed coverage it must be provided by the \n     employing office.\n       (e) An employee may choose not to retain group health plan \n     coverage during FMLA leave. However, when an employee returns \n     from leave, the employee is entitled to be reinstated on the \n     same terms as prior to taking the leave, including family or \n     dependent coverages, without any qualifying period, physical \n     examination, exclusion of pre-existing conditions, etc. See \n     Sec. 825.212(c).\n       (f) Except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, \n     whichever is applicable, and for ``key'' employees (as \n     discussed below), an employing office's obligation to \n     maintain health benefits during leave (and to restore the \n     employee to the same or equivalent employment) under FMLA \n     ceases if and when the employment relationship would have \n     terminated if the employee had not taken FMLA leave (e.g., if \n     the employee's position is eliminated as part of a \n     nondiscriminatory reduction in force and the employee would \n     not have been transferred to another position); an employee \n     informs the employing office of his or her intent not to \n     return from leave (including before starting the leave if the \n     employing office is so informed before the leave starts); or \n     the employee fails to return from leave or continues on leave \n     after exhausting his or her FMLA leave entitlement in the 12-\n     month period.\n       (g) If a ``key employee'' (see Sec. 825.218) does not \n     return from leave when notified by the employing office that \n     substantial or grievous economic injury will result from his \n     or her reinstatement, the employee's entitlement to group \n     health plan benefits continues unless and until the employee \n     advises the employing office that the employee does not \n     desire restoration to employment at the end of the leave \n     period, or FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted, or \n     reinstatement is actually denied.\n       (h) An employee's entitlement to benefits other than group \n     health benefits during a period of FMLA leave (e.g., holiday \n     pay) is to be determined by the employing office's \n     established policy for providing such benefits when the \n     employee is on other forms of leave (paid or unpaid, as \n     appropriate).\n\n     Sec. 825.210 How may employees on FMLA leave pay their share \n       of group health benefit premiums?\n\n       (a) Group health plan benefits must be maintained on the \n     same basis as coverage would have been provided if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. Therefore, any share of group health plan premiums \n     which had been paid by the employee prior to FMLA leave must \n     continue to be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave \n     period. If premiums are raised or lowered, the employee would \n     be required to pay the new premium rates. Maintenance of \n     health insurance policies which are not a part of the \n     employing office's group health plan, as described in \n     Sec. 825.209(a), are the sole responsibility of the employee. \n     The employee and the insurer should make necessary \n     arrangements for payment of premiums during periods of unpaid \n     FMLA leave.\n       (b) If the FMLA leave is substituted paid leave, the \n     employee's share of premiums must be paid by the method \n     normally used during any paid leave, presumably as a payroll \n     deduction.\n       (c) If FMLA leave is unpaid, the employing office has a \n     number of options for obtaining payment from the employee. \n     The employing office may require that payment be made to the \n     employing office or to the insurance carrier, but no \n     additional charge may be added to the employee's premium \n     payment for administrative expenses. The employing office may \n     require employees to pay their share of premium payments in \n     any of the following ways:\n       (1) Payment would be due at the same time as it would be \n     made if by payroll deduction;\n       (2) Payment would be due on the same schedule as payments \n     are made under COBRA or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is \n     applicable;\n       (3) Payment would be prepaid pursuant to a cafeteria plan \n     at the employee's option;\n       (4) The employing office's existing rules for payment by \n     employees on ``leave without pay'' would be followed, \n     provided that such rules do not require prepayment (i.e., \n     prior to the commencement of the leave) of the premiums that \n     will become due during a period of unpaid FMLA leave or \n     payment of higher premiums than if the employee had continued \n     to work instead of taking leave; or\n       (5) Another system voluntarily agreed to between the \n     employing office and the employee, which may include \n     prepayment of premiums (e.g., through increased payroll \n     deductions when the need for the FMLA leave is foreseeable).\n       (d) The employing office must provide the employee with \n     advance written notice of the terms and conditions under \n     which these payments must be made. (See Sec. 825.301.)\n       (e) An employing office may not require more of an employee \n     using FMLA leave than the employing office requires of other \n     employees on ``leave without pay''.\n       (f) An employee who is receiving payments as a result of a \n     workers' compensation injury must make arrangements with the \n     employing office for payment of group health plan benefits \n     when simultaneously taking unpaid FMLA leave. See paragraph \n     (c) of this section and Sec. 825.207(d)(2).\n\n     Sec. 825.211 What special health benefits maintenance rules \n       apply to multi-employer health plans?\n\n       (a) A multi-employer health plan is a plan to which more \n     than one employer is required to contribute, and which is \n     maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining \n     agreements between employee organization(s) and the \n     employers.\n       (b) An employing office under a multi-employer plan must \n     continue to make contributions on behalf of an employee using \n     FMLA leave as though the employee had been continuously \n     employed, unless the plan contains an explicit FMLA provision \n     for maintaining coverage such as through pooled contributions \n     by all employers party to the plan.\n       (c) During the duration of an employee's FMLA leave, \n     coverage by the group health plan, and benefits provided \n     pursuant to the plan, must be maintained at the level of \n     coverage and benefits which were applicable to the employee \n     at the time FMLA leave commenced.\n       (d) An employee using FMLA leave cannot be required to use \n     ``banked'' hours or pay a greater premium than the employee \n     would have been required to pay if the employee had been \n     continuously employed.\n       (e) As provided in Sec. 825.209(f), group health plan \n     coverage must be maintained for an employee on FMLA leave \n     until:\n       (1) the employee's FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted;\n       (2) the employing office can show that the employee would \n     have been laid off and the employment relationship \n     terminated; or\n       (3) the employee provides unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work.\n\n     Sec. 825.212 What are the consequences of an employee's \n       failure to make timely health plan premium payments?\n\n       (a)(1) In the absence of an established employing office \n     policy providing a longer grace period, an employing office's \n     obligations to maintain health insurance coverage cease under \n     FMLA if an employee's premium payment is more than 30 days \n     late. In order to drop the coverage for an employee whose \n     premium payment is late, the employing office must provide \n     written notice to the employee that the payment has not been \n     received. Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least \n     15 days before coverage is to cease, advising that coverage \n     will be dropped on a specified date at least 15 days after \n     the date of the letter unless the payment has been received \n     by that date. If the employing office has established \n     policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that provide \n     for the employing office to cease coverage retroactively to \n     the date the unpaid premium payment was due, the employing \n     office may drop the employee from coverage retroactively in \n     accordance with that policy, provided the 15-day notice was \n     given. In the absence of such a policy, coverage for the \n     employee may be terminated at the end of the 30-day grace \n     period, where the required 15-day notice has been provided.\n       (2) An employing office has no obligation regarding the \n     maintenance of a health insurance policy which is not a \n     ``group health plan''. See Sec. 825.209(a).\n       (3) All other obligations of an employing office under FMLA \n     would continue; for example, the employing office continues \n     to have an obligation to reinstate an employee upon return \n     from leave.\n       (b) The employing office may recover the employee's share \n     of any premium payments missed by the employee for any FMLA \n     leave period during which the employing office maintains \n     health coverage by paying the employee's share after the \n     premium payment is missed.\n       (c) If coverage lapses because an employee has not made \n     required premium payments, upon the employee's return from \n     FMLA leave the employing office must still restore the \n     employee to coverage/benefits equivalent to those the \n     employee would have had if leave had not been taken and the \n     premium payment(s) had not been missed, including family or \n     dependent coverage. See Sec. 825.215(d) (1)-(5). In such \n     case, an employee may not be required to meet any \n     qualification requirements imposed by the plan, including any\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\n     new preexisting condition waiting period, to wait for an open \n     season, or to pass a medical examination to obtain \n     reinstatement of coverage.\n\n     Sec. 825.213 May an employing office recover costs it \n       incurred for maintaining ``group health plan'' or other \n       non-health benefits coverage during FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) In addition to the circumstances discussed in \n     Sec. 825.212(b), the share of health plan premiums paid by or \n     on behalf of the employing office during a period of unpaid \n     FMLA leave may be recovered from an employee if the employee \n     fails to return to work after the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement has been exhausted or expires, unless the reason \n     the employee does not return is due to:\n       (1) The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious \n     health condition of the employee or the employee's family \n     member which would otherwise entitle the employee to leave \n     under FMLA;\n       (2) Other circumstances beyond the employee's control. \n     Examples of ``other circumstances beyond the employee's \n     control'' are necessarily broad. They include such situations \n     as where a parent chooses to stay home with a newborn child \n     who has a serious health condition; an employee's spouse is \n     unexpectedly transferred to a job location more than 75 miles \n     from the employee's worksite; a relative or individual other \n     than an immediate family member has a serious health \n     condition and the employee is needed to provide care; the \n     employee is laid off while on leave; or, the employee is a \n     ``key employee'' who decides not to return to work upon being \n     notified of the employing office's intention to deny \n     restoration because of substantial and grievous economic \n     injury to the employing office's operations and is not \n     reinstated by the employing office. Other circumstances \n     beyond the employee's control would not include a situation \n     where an employee desires to remain with a parent in a \n     distant city even though the parent no longer requires the \n     employee's care, or a parent chooses not to return to work to \n     stay home with a well, newborn child; or\n       (3) When an employee fails to return to work because of the \n     continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health \n     condition, thereby precluding the employing office from \n     recovering its (share of) health benefit premium payments \n     made on the employee's behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employing office may require medical certification \n     of the employee's or the family member's serious health \n     condition. Such certification is not required unless \n     requested by the employing office. The employee is required \n     to provide medical certification in a timely manner which, \n     for purposes of this section, is within 30 days from the date \n     of the employing office's request. For purposes of medical \n     certification, the employee may use the optional form \n     developed for this purpose (see Sec. 825.306(a) and Appendix \n     B of this part). If the employing office requests medical \n     certification and the employee does not provide such \n     certification in a timely manner (within 30 days), or the \n     reason for not returning to work does not meet the test of \n     other circumstances beyond the employee's control, the \n     employing office may recover 100 percent of the health \n     benefit premiums it paid during the period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave.\n       (b) Under some circumstances an employing office may elect \n     to maintain other benefits, e.g., life insurance, disability \n     insurance, etc., by paying the employee's (share of) premiums \n     during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. For example, to ensure \n     the employing office can meet its responsibilities to provide \n     equivalent benefits to the employee upon return from unpaid \n     FMLA leave, it may be necessary that premiums be paid \n     continuously to avoid a lapse of coverage. If the employing \n     office elects to maintain such benefits during the leave, at \n     the conclusion of leave, the employing office is entitled to \n     recover only the costs incurred for paying the employee's \n     share of any premiums whether or not the employee returns to \n     work.\n       (c) An employee who returns to work for at least 30 \n     calendar days is considered to have ``returned'' to work. An \n     employee who transfers directly from taking FMLA leave to \n     retirement, or who retires during the first 30 days after the \n     employee returns to work, is deemed to have returned to work.\n       (d) When an employee elects or an employing office requires \n     paid leave to be substituted for FMLA leave, the employing \n     office may not recover its (share of) health insurance or \n     other non-health benefit premiums for any period of FMLA \n     leave covered by paid leave. Because paid leave provided \n     under a plan covering temporary disabilities (including \n     workers' compensation) is not unpaid, recovery of health \n     insurance premiums does not apply to such paid leave.\n       (e) The amount that self-insured employing offices may \n     recover is limited to only the employing office's share of \n     allowable ``premiums'' as would be calculated under COBRA, \n     excluding the 2 percent fee for administrative costs.\n       (f) When an employee fails to return to work, any health \n     and non-health benefit premiums which this section of the \n     regulations permits an employing office to recover are a debt \n     owed by the non-returning employee to the employing office. \n     The existence of this debt caused by the employee's failure \n     to return to work does not alter the employing office's \n     responsibilities for health benefit coverage and, under a \n     self-insurance plan, payment of claims incurred during the \n     period of FMLA leave. To the extent recovery is allowed, the \n     employing office may recover the costs through deduction from \n     any sums due to the employee (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation \n     pay, etc.), provided such deductions do not otherwise violate \n     applicable wage payment or other laws. Alternatively, the \n     employing office may initiate legal action against the \n     employee to recover such costs.\n\n     Sec. 825.214 What are an employee's rights on returning to \n       work from FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) On return from FMLA leave, an employee is entitled to \n     be returned to the same position the employee held when leave \n     commenced, or to an equivalent position with equivalent \n     benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n     An employee is entitled to such reinstatement even if the \n     employee has been replaced or his or her position has been \n     restructured to accommodate the employee's absence. See also \n     Sec. 825.106(e) for the obligations of employing offices that \n     are joint employing offices.\n       (b) If the employee is unable to perform an essential \n     function of the position because of a physical or mental \n     condition, including the continuation of a serious health \n     condition, the employee has no right to restoration to \n     another position under the FMLA. However, the employing \n     office's obligations may be governed by the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by the CAA. See \n     Sec. 825.702.\n\n     Sec. 825.215 What is an equivalent position?\n\n       (a) An equivalent position is one that is virtually \n     identical to the employee's former position in terms of pay, \n     benefits and working conditions, including privileges, \n     perquisites and status. It must involve the same or \n     substantially similar duties and responsibilities, which must \n     entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, \n     responsibility, and authority.\n       (b) If an employee is no longer qualified for the position \n     because of the employee's inability to attend a necessary \n     course, renew a license, fly a minimum number of hours, etc., \n     as a result of the leave, the employee shall be given a \n     reasonable opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon \n     return to work.\n       (c) Equivalent Pay:\n       (1) An employee is entitled to any unconditional pay \n     increases which may have occurred during the FMLA leave \n     period, such as cost of living increases. Pay increases \n     conditioned upon seniority, length of service, or work \n     performed would not have to be granted unless it is the \n     employing office's policy or practice to do so with respect \n     to other employees on ``leave without pay''. In such case, \n     any pay increase would be granted based on the employee's \n     seniority, length of service, work performed, etc., excluding \n     the period of unpaid FMLA leave. An employee is entitled to \n     be restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay \n     premiums, such as a shift differential. If an employee \n     departed from a position averaging ten hours of overtime (and \n     corresponding overtime pay) each week, an employee is \n     ordinarily entitled to such a position on return from FMLA \n     leave.\n       (2) Many employing offices pay bonuses in different forms \n     to employees for job-related performance such as for perfect \n     attendance, safety (absence of injuries or accidents on the \n     job) and exceeding production goals. Bonuses for perfect \n     attendance and safety do not require performance by the \n     employee but rather contemplate the absence of occurrences. \n     To the extent an employee who takes FMLA leave had met all \n     the requirements for either or both of these bonuses before \n     FMLA leave began, the employee is entitled to continue this \n     entitlement upon return from FMLA leave, that is, the \n     employee may not be disqualified for the bonus(es) for the \n     taking of FMLA leave. See Sec. 825.220 (b) and (c). A monthly \n     production bonus, on the other hand, does require performance \n     by the employee. If the employee is on FMLA leave during any \n     part of the period for which the bonus is computed, the \n     employee is entitled to the same consideration for the bonus \n     as other employees on paid or unpaid leave (as appropriate). \n     See paragraph (d)(2) of this section.\n       (d) Equivalent Benefits. ``Benefits'' include all benefits \n     provided or made available to employees by an employing \n     office, including group life insurance, health insurance, \n     disability insurance, sick leave, annual leave, educational \n     benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether such benefits \n     are provided by a practice or written policy of an employing \n     office through an employee benefit plan.\n       (1) At the end of an employee's FMLA leave, benefits must \n     be resumed in the same manner and at the same levels as \n     provided when the leave began, and subject to any changes in \n     benefit levels that may have taken place during the period of \n     FMLA leave affecting the entire workforce, unless otherwise \n     elected by the employee. Upon return from FMLA leave, an \n     employee cannot be required to requalify for any benefits the \n     employee enjoyed before FMLA leave began (including family or \n     dependent coverages). For example, if an employee was covered \n     by a life insurance policy before taking leave but is not \n     covered or coverage lapses during the period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employee cannot be required to meet any \n     qualifications, such as taking a physical examination, in \n     order to requalify for life insurance upon return from leave. \n     Accordingly, some employing offices may find it necessary to \n     modify life insurance and other benefits programs in order to \n     restore employees to equivalent benefits upon return from \n     FMLA leave, make arrangements for continued\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\n     payment of costs to maintain such benefits during unpaid FMLA \n     leave, or pay these costs subject to recovery from the \n     employee on return from leave. See Sec. 825.213(b).\n       (2) An employee may, but is not entitled to, accrue any \n     additional benefits or seniority during unpaid FMLA leave. \n     Benefits accrued at the time leave began, however, (e.g., \n     paid vacation, sick or personal leave to the extent not \n     substituted for FMLA leave) must be available to an employee \n     upon return from leave.\n       (3) If, while on unpaid FMLA leave, an employee desires to \n     continue life insurance, disability insurance, or other types \n     of benefits for which he or she typically pays, the employing \n     office is required to follow established policies or \n     practices for continuing such benefits for other instances of \n     leave without pay. If the employing office has no established \n     policy, the employee and the employing office are encouraged \n     to agree upon arrangements before FMLA leave begins.\n       (4) With respect to pension and other retirement plans, any \n     period of unpaid FMLA leave shall not be treated as or \n     counted toward a break in service for purposes of vesting and \n     eligibility to participate. Also, if the plan requires an \n     employee to be employed on a specific date in order to be \n     credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions or \n     participation purposes, an employee on unpaid FMLA leave on \n     that date shall be deemed to have been employed on that date. \n     However, unpaid FMLA leave periods need not be treated as \n     credited service for purposes of benefit accrual, vesting and \n     eligibility to participate.\n       (5) Employees on unpaid FMLA leave are to be treated as if \n     they continued to work for purposes of changes to benefit \n     plans. They are entitled to changes in benefits plans, except \n     those which may be dependent upon seniority or accrual during \n     the leave period, immediately upon return from leave or to \n     the same extent they would have qualified if no leave had \n     been taken. For example if the benefit plan is predicated on \n     a pre-established number of hours worked each year and the \n     employee does not have sufficient hours as a result of taking \n     unpaid FMLA leave, the benefit is lost. (In this regard, \n     Sec. 825.209 addresses health benefits.)\n       (e) Equivalent Terms and Conditions of Employment. An \n     equivalent position must have substantially similar duties, \n     conditions, responsibilities, privileges and status as the \n     employee's original position.\n       (1) The employee must be reinstated to the same or a \n     geographically proximate worksite (i.e., one that does not \n     involve a significant increase in commuting time or distance) \n     from where the employee had previously been employed. If the \n     employee's original worksite has been closed, the employee is \n     entitled to the same rights as if the employee had not been \n     on leave when the worksite closed. For example, if an \n     employing office transfers all employees from a closed \n     worksite to a new worksite in a different city, the employee \n     on leave is also entitled to transfer under the same \n     conditions as if he or she had continued to be employed.\n       (2) The employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the \n     same shift or the same or an equivalent work schedule.\n       (3) The employee must have the same or an equivalent \n     opportunity for bonuses and other similar discretionary and \n     non-discretionary payments.\n       (4) FMLA does not prohibit an employing office from \n     accommodating an employee's request to be restored to a \n     different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the \n     employee's personal needs on return from leave, or to offer a \n     promotion to a better position. However, an employee cannot \n     be induced by the employing office to accept a different \n     position against the employee's wishes.\n       (f) The requirement that an employee be restored to the \n     same or equivalent job with the same or equivalent pay, \n     benefits, and terms and conditions of employment does not \n     extend to de minimis or intangible, unmeasurable aspects of \n     the job. However, restoration to a job slated for lay-off, \n     when the employee's original position is not, would not meet \n     the requirements of an equivalent position.\n\n     Sec. 825.216 Are there any limitations on an employing \n       office's obligation to reinstate an employee?\n\n       (a) An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to \n     other benefits and conditions of employment than if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. An employing office must be able to show that an \n     employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time \n     reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to \n     employment. For example:\n       (1) If an employee is laid off during the course of taking \n     FMLA leave and employment is terminated, the employing \n     office's responsibility to continue FMLA leave, maintain \n     group health plan benefits and restore the employee ceases at \n     the time the employee is laid off, provided the employing \n     office has no continuing obligations under a collective \n     bargaining agreement or otherwise. An employing office would \n     have the burden of proving that an employee would have been \n     laid off during the FMLA leave period and, therefore, would \n     not be entitled to restoration.\n       (2) If a shift has been eliminated, or overtime has been \n     decreased, an employee would not be entitled to return to \n     work that shift or the original overtime hours upon \n     restoration. However, if a position on, for example, a night \n     shift has been filled by another employee, the employee is \n     entitled to return to the same shift on which employed before \n     taking FMLA leave.\n       (b) If an employee was hired for a specific term or only to \n     perform work on a discrete project, the employing office has \n     no obligation to restore the employee if the employment term \n     or project is over and the employing office would not \n     otherwise have continued to employ the employee.\n       (c) In addition to the circumstances explained above, an \n     employing office may deny job restoration to salaried \n     eligible employees (``key employees'', as defined in \n     paragraph (c) of Sec. 825.217) if such denial is necessary to \n     prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the \n     operations of the employing office; or may delay restoration \n     to an employee who fails to provide a fitness for duty \n     certificate to return to work under the conditions described \n     in Sec. 825.310.\n       (d) If the employee has been on a workers' compensation \n     absence during which FMLA leave has been taken concurrently, \n     and after 12 weeks of FMLA leave the employee is unable to \n     return to work, the employee no longer has the protections of \n     FMLA and must look to the workers' compensation statute or \n     ADA, as made applicable by the CAA, for any relief or \n     protections.\n\n     Sec. 825.217 What is a ``key employee''?\n\n       (a) A ``key employee'' is a salaried FMLA-eligible employee \n     who is among the highest paid 10 percent of all the employees \n     employed by the employing office within 75 miles of the \n     employee's worksite.\n       (b) The term ``salaried'' means paid on a salary basis, \n     within the meaning of the Board's regulations at part 541, \n     implementing section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313) \n     (regarding employees who may qualify as exempt from the \n     minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, as executive, administrative, and \n     professional employees).\n       (c) A ``key employee'' must be ``among the highest paid 10 \n     percent'' of all the employees ``both salaried and non-\n     salaried, eligible and ineligible ``who are employed by the \n     employing office within 75 miles of the worksite'':\n       (1) In determining which employees are among the highest \n     paid 10 percent, year-to-date earnings are divided by weeks \n     worked by the employee (including weeks in which paid leave \n     was taken). Earnings include wages, premium pay, incentive \n     pay, and non-discretionary and discretionary bonuses. \n     Earnings do not include incentives whose value is determined \n     at some future date, e.g., benefits or perquisites.\n       (2) The determination of whether a salaried employee is \n     among the highest paid 10 percent shall be made at the time \n     the employee gives notice of the need for leave. No more than \n     10 percent of the employing office's employees within 75 \n     miles of the worksite may be ``key employees''.\n\n     Sec. 825.218 What does ``substantial and grievous economic \n       injury'' mean?\n\n       (a) In order to deny restoration to a key employee, an \n     employing office must determine that the restoration of the \n     employee to employment will cause ``substantial and grievous \n     economic injury'' to the operations of the employing office, \n     not whether the absence of the employee will cause such \n     substantial and grievous injury.\n       (b) An employing office may take into account its ability \n     to replace on a temporary basis (or temporarily do without) \n     the employee on FMLA leave. If permanent replacement is \n     unavoidable, the cost of then reinstating the employee can be \n     considered in evaluating whether substantial and grievous \n     economic injury will occur from restoration; in other words, \n     the effect on the operations of the employing office of \n     reinstating the employee in an equivalent position.\n       (c) A precise test cannot be set for the level of hardship \n     or injury to the employing office which must be sustained. If \n     the reinstatement of a ``key employee'' threatens the \n     economic viability of the employing office, that would \n     constitute ``substantial and grievous economic injury''. A \n     lesser injury which causes substantial, long-term economic \n     injury would also be sufficient. Minor inconveniences and \n     costs that the employing office would experience in the \n     normal course would certainly not constitute ``substantial \n     and grievous economic injury''.\n       (d) FMLA's ``substantial and grievous economic injury'' \n     standard is different from and more stringent than the \n     ``undue hardship'' test under the ADA (see, also \n     Sec. 825.702).\n\n     Sec. 825.219 What are the rights of a key employee?\n\n       (a) An employing office which believes that reinstatement \n     may be denied to a key employee, must give written notice to \n     the employee at the time the employee gives notice of the \n     need for FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if \n     earlier) that he or she qualifies as a key employee. At the \n     same time, the employing office must also fully inform the \n     employee of the potential consequences with respect to \n     reinstatement and maintenance of health benefits if the \n     employing office should determine that substantial and \n     grievous economic injury to the employing office's operations \n     will result if the employee is reinstated from FMLA leave. If \n     such notice cannot be given immediately because of the need \n     to determine whether the employee is a key employee, it shall \n     be given as soon as practicable after being notified of a \n     need for leave (or the commencement of leave, if earlier). It \n     is expected that in most circumstances there will\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\n     be no desire that an employee be denied restoration after \n     FMLA leave and, therefore, there would be no need to provide \n     such notice. However, an employing office who fails to \n     provide such timely notice will lose its right to deny \n     restoration even if substantial and grievous economic injury \n     will result from reinstatement.\n       (b) As soon as an employing office makes a good faith \n     determination, based on the facts available, that substantial \n     and grievous economic injury to its operations will result if \n     a key employee who has given notice of the need for FMLA \n     leave or is using FMLA leave is reinstated, the employing \n     office shall notify the employee in writing of its \n     determination, that it cannot deny FMLA leave, and that it \n     intends to deny restoration to employment on completion of \n     the FMLA leave. It is anticipated that an employing office \n     will ordinarily be able to give such notice prior to the \n     employee starting leave. The employing office must serve this \n     notice either in person or by certified mail. This notice \n     must explain the basis for the employing office's finding \n     that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, \n     and, if leave has commenced, must provide the employee a \n     reasonable time in which to return to work, taking into \n     account the circumstances, such as the length of the leave \n     and the urgency of the need for the employee to return.\n       (c) If an employee on leave does not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notification of intent to \n     deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to \n     maintenance of health benefits and the employing office may \n     not recover its cost of health benefit premiums. A key \n     employee's rights under FMLA continue unless and until either \n     the employee gives notice that he or she no longer wishes to \n     return to work, or the employing office actually denies \n     reinstatement at the conclusion of the leave period.\n       (d) After notice to an employee has been given that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result if the \n     employee is reinstated to employment, an employee is still \n     entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave \n     period even if the employee did not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notice. The employing \n     office must then again determine whether there will be \n     substantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, \n     based on the facts at that time. If it is determined that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result, the \n     employing office shall notify the employee in writing (in \n     person or by certified mail) of the denial of restoration.\n\n     Sec. 825.220 How are employees protected who request leave or \n       otherwise assert FMLA rights?\n\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, prohibits \n     interference with an employee's rights under the law, and \n     with legal proceedings or inquiries relating to an employee's \n     rights. More specifically, the law contains the following \n     employee protections:\n       (1) An employing office is prohibited from interfering \n     with, restraining, or denying the exercise of (or attempts to \n     exercise) any rights provided by the FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA.\n       (2) An employing office is prohibited from discharging or \n     in any other way discriminating against any covered employee \n     (whether or not an eligible employee) for opposing or \n     complaining about any unlawful practice under the FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (3) All employing offices are prohibited from discharging \n     or in any other way discriminating against any covered \n     employee (whether or not an eligible employee) because that \n     covered employee has--\n       (i) Filed any charge, or has instituted (or caused to be \n     instituted) any proceeding under or related to the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA;\n       (ii) Given, or is about to give, any information in \n     connection with an inquiry or proceeding relating to a right \n     under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA;\n       (iii) Testified, or is about to testify, in any inquiry or \n     proceeding relating to a right under the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (b) Any violations of the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, or of these regulations constitute interfering with, \n     restraining, or denying the exercise of rights provided by \n     the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA. ``Interfering with'' \n     the exercise of an employee's rights would include, for \n     example, not only refusing to authorize FMLA leave, but \n     discouraging an employee from using such leave. It would also \n     include manipulation by an employing office to avoid \n     responsibilities under FMLA, for example--\n       (1) [Reserved];\n       (2) changing the essential functions of the job in order to \n     preclude the taking of leave;\n       (3) reducing hours available to work in order to avoid \n     employee eligibility.\n       (c) An employing office is prohibited from discriminating \n     against employees or prospective employees who have used FMLA \n     leave. For example, if an employee on leave without pay would \n     otherwise be entitled to full benefits (other than health \n     benefits), the same benefits would be required to be provided \n     to an employee on unpaid FMLA leave. By the same token, \n     employing offices cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a \n     negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, \n     promotions or disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA leave be \n     counted under ``no fault'' attendance policies.\n       (d) Employees cannot waive, nor may employing offices \n     induce employees to waive, their rights under FMLA. For \n     example, employees (or their collective bargaining \n     representatives) cannot ``trade off'' the right to take FMLA \n     leave against some other benefit offered by the employing \n     office. This does not prevent an employee's voluntary and \n     uncoerced acceptance (not as a condition of employment) of a \n     ``light duty'' assignment while recovering from a serious \n     health condition (see Sec. 825.702(d)). In such a \n     circumstance the employee's right to restoration to the same \n     or an equivalent position is available until 12 weeks have \n     passed within the 12-month period, including all FMLA leave \n     taken and the period of ``light duty''.\n       (e) Covered employees, and not merely eligible employees, \n     are protected from retaliation for opposing (e.g., file a \n     complaint about) any practice which is unlawful under the \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. They are similarly \n     protected if they oppose any practice which they reasonably \n     believe to be a violation of the FMLA, as made applicable by \n     the CAA or regulations.\n\nSubpart C--How do Employees Learn of Their Rights and Obligations under \n  the FMLA, as Made Applicable by the CAA, and What Can an Employing \n                     Office Require of an Employee?\n\n     Sec. 825.300 [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.301 What notices to employees are required of \n       employing offices under the FMLA as made applicable by the \n       CAA?\n\n       (a)(1) If an employing office has any eligible employees \n     and has any written guidance to employees concerning employee \n     benefits or leave rights, such as in an employee handbook, \n     information concerning both entitlements and employee \n     obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     must be included in the handbook or other document. For \n     example, if an employing office provides an employee handbook \n     to all employees that describes the employing office's \n     policies regarding leave, wages, attendance, and similar \n     matters, the handbook must incorporate information on FMLA \n     rights and responsibilities and the employing office's \n     policies regarding the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. \n     Informational publications describing the provisions of the \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA are available from the \n     Office of Compliance and may be incorporated in such \n     employing office handbooks or written policies.\n       (2) If such an employing office does not have written \n     policies, manuals, or handbooks describing employee benefits \n     and leave provisions, the employing office shall provide \n     written guidance to an employee concerning all the employee's \n     rights and obligations under the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA. This notice shall be provided to employees each time \n     notice is given pursuant to paragraph (b), and in accordance \n     with the provisions of that paragraph. Employing offices may \n     duplicate and provide the employee a copy of the FMLA Fact \n     Sheet available from the Office of Compliance to provide such \n     guidance.\n       (b)(1) The employing office shall also provide the employee \n     with written notice detailing the specific expectations and \n     obligations of the employee and explaining any consequences \n     of a failure to meet these obligations. The written notice \n     must be provided to the employee in a language in which the \n     employee is literate. Such specific notice must include, as \n     appropriate--\n       (i) that the leave will be counted against the employee's \n     annual FMLA leave entitlement (see Sec. 825.208);\n       (ii) any requirements for the employee to furnish medical \n     certification of a serious health condition and the \n     consequences of failing to do so (see Sec. 825.305);\n       (iii) the employee's right to substitute paid leave and \n     whether the employing office will require the substitution of \n     paid leave, and the conditions related to any substitution;\n       (iv) any requirement for the employee to make any premium \n     payments to maintain health benefits and the arrangements for \n     making such payments (see Sec. 825.210), and the possible \n     consequences of failure to make such payments on a timely \n     basis (i.e., the circumstances under which coverage may \n     lapse);\n       (v) any requirement for the employee to present a fitness-\n     for-duty certificate to be restored to employment (see \n     Sec. 825.310);\n       (vi) the employee's status as a ``key employee'' and the \n     potential consequence that restoration may be denied \n     following FMLA leave, explaining the conditions required for \n     such denial (see Sec. 825.218);\n       (vii) the employee's right to restoration to the same or an \n     equivalent job upon return from leave (see Sec. Sec.  825.214 \n     and 825.604); and\n       (viii) the employee's potential liability for payment of \n     health insurance premiums paid by the employing office during \n     the employee's unpaid FMLA leave if the employee fails to \n     return to work after taking FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.213).\n       (2) The specific notice may include other information--\n     e.g., whether the employing office will require periodic \n     reports of the employee's status and intent to return to \n     work, but is not required to do so. A prototype notice is \n     contained in Appendix D of this part, or may be obtained from \n     the Office of Compliance, which employing offices may adapt \n     for their use to meet these specific notice requirements.\n       (c) Except as provided in this subparagraph, the written \n     notice required by paragraph (b) (and by subparagraph (a)(2) \n     where applicable) must be provided to the employee no less \n     often than the first time in each six-\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\n     month period that an employee gives notice of the need for \n     FMLA leave (if FMLA leave is taken during the six-month \n     period). The notice shall be given within a reasonable time \n     after notice of the need for leave is given by the employee--\n     within one or two business days if feasible. If leave has \n     already begun, the notice should be mailed to the employee's \n     address of record.\n       (1) If the specific information provided by the notice \n     changes with respect to a subsequent period of FMLA leave \n     during the six-month period, the employing office shall, \n     within one or two business days of receipt of the employee's \n     notice of need for leave, provide written notice referencing \n     the prior notice and setting forth any of the information in \n     subparagraph (b) which has changed. For example, if the \n     initial leave period were paid leave and the subsequent leave \n     period would be unpaid leave, the employing office may need \n     to give notice of the arrangements for making premium \n     payments.\n       (2)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii), if the \n     employing office is requiring medical certification or a \n     ``fitness-for-duty'' report, written notice of the \n     requirement shall be given with respect to each employee \n     notice of a need for leave.\n       (ii) Subsequent written notification shall not be required \n     if the initial notice in the six-month period and the \n     employing office handbook or other written documents (if any) \n     describing the employing office's leave policies, clearly \n     provided that certification or a ``fitness-for-duty'' report \n     would be required (e.g., by stating that certification would \n     be required in all cases, by stating that certification would \n     be required in all cases in which leave of more than a \n     specified number of days is taken, or by stating that a \n     ``fitness-for-duty'' report would be required in all cases \n     for back injuries for employees in a certain occupation). \n     Where subsequent written notice is not required, at least \n     oral notice shall be provided. (See Sec. 825.305(a).)\n       (d) Employing offices are also expected to responsively \n     answer questions from employees concerning their rights and \n     responsibilities under the FMLA as made applicable under the \n     CAA.\n       (e) Employing offices furnishing FMLA-required notices to \n     sensory impaired individuals must also comply with all \n     applicable requirements under law.\n       (f) If an employing office fails to provide notice in \n     accordance with the provisions of this section, the employing \n     office may not take action against an employee for failure to \n     comply with any provision required to be set forth in the \n     notice.\n\n     Sec. 825.302 What notice does an employee have to give an \n       employing office when the need for FMLA leave is \n       foreseeable?\n\n       (a) An employee must provide the employing office at least \n     30 days advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if the \n     need for the leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth, \n     placement for adoption or foster care, or planned medical \n     treatment for a serious health condition of the employee or \n     of a family member. If 30 days notice is not practicable, \n     such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when \n     leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, \n     or a medical emergency, notice must be given as soon as \n     practicable. For example, an employee's health condition may \n     require leave to commence earlier than anticipated before the \n     birth of a child. Similarly, little opportunity for notice \n     may be given before placement for adoption. Whether the leave \n     is to be continuous or is to be taken intermittently or on a \n     reduced schedule basis, notice need only be given one time, \n     but the employee shall advise the employing office as soon as \n     practicable if dates of scheduled leave change or are \n     extended, or were initially unknown.\n       (b) ``As soon as practicable'' means as soon as both \n     possible and practical, taking into account all of the facts \n     and circumstances in the individual case. For foreseeable \n     leave where it is not possible to give as much as 30 days \n     notice, ``as soon as practicable'' ordinarily would mean at \n     least verbal notification to the employing office within one \n     or two business days of when the need for leave becomes known \n     to the employee.\n       (c) An employee shall provide at least verbal notice \n     sufficient to make the employing office aware that the \n     employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated \n     timing and duration of the leave. The employee need not \n     expressly assert rights under the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA, or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that \n     leave is needed for an expected birth or adoption, for \n     example. The employing office should inquire further of the \n     employee if it is necessary to have more information about \n     whether FMLA leave is being sought by the employee, and \n     obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken. In the \n     case of medical conditions, the employing office may find it \n     necessary to inquire further to determine if the leave is \n     because of a serious health condition and may request medical \n     certification to support the need for such leave (see \n     Sec. 825.305).\n       (d) An employing office may also require an employee to \n     comply with the employing office's usual and customary notice \n     and procedural requirements for requesting leave. For \n     example, an employing office may require that written notice \n     set forth the reasons for the requested leave, the \n     anticipated duration of the leave, and the anticipated start \n     of the leave. However, failure to follow such internal \n     employing office procedures will not permit an employing \n     office to disallow or delay an employee's taking FMLA leave \n     if the employee gives timely verbal or other notice.\n       (e) When planning medical treatment, the employee must \n     consult with the employing office and make a reasonable \n     effort to schedule the leave so as not to disrupt unduly the \n     employing office's operations, subject to the approval of the \n     health care provider. Employees are ordinarily expected to \n     consult with their employing offices prior to the scheduling \n     of treatment in order to work out a treatment schedule which \n     best suits the needs of both the employing office and the \n     employee. If an employee who provides notice of the need to \n     take FMLA leave on an intermittent basis for planned medical \n     treatment neglects to consult with the employing office to \n     make a reasonable attempt to arrange the schedule of \n     treatments so as not to unduly disrupt the employing office's \n     operations, the employing office may initiate discussions \n     with the employee and require the employee to attempt to make \n     such arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care \n     provider.\n       (f) In the case of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule which is medically necessary, an employee \n     shall advise the employing office, upon request, of the \n     reasons why the intermittent/reduced leave schedule is \n     necessary and of the schedule for treatment, if applicable. \n     The employee and employing office shall attempt to work out a \n     schedule which meets the employee's needs without unduly \n     disrupting the employing office's operations, subject to the \n     approval of the health care provider.\n       (g) An employing office may waive employees' FMLA notice \n     requirements. In addition, an employing office may not \n     require compliance with stricter FMLA notice requirements \n     where the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or \n     applicable leave plan allow less advance notice to the \n     employing office. For example, if an employee (or employing \n     office) elects to substitute paid vacation leave for unpaid \n     FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.207), and the employing office's \n     paid vacation leave plan imposes no prior notification \n     requirements for taking such vacation leave, no advance \n     notice may be required for the FMLA leave taken in these \n     circumstances. On the other hand, FMLA notice requirements \n     would apply to a period of unpaid FMLA leave, unless the \n     employing office imposes lesser notice requirements on \n     employees taking leave without pay.\n\n     Sec. 825.303  What are the requirements for an employee to \n       furnish notice to an employing office where the need for \n       FMLA leave is not foreseeable?\n\n       (a) When the approximate timing of the need for leave is \n     not foreseeable, an employee should give notice to the \n     employing office of the need for FMLA leave as soon as \n     practicable under the facts and circumstances of the \n     particular case. It is expected that an employee will give \n     notice to the employing office within no more than one or two \n     working days of learning of the need for leave, except in \n     extraordinary circumstances where such notice is not \n     feasible. In the case of a medical emergency requiring leave \n     because of an employee's own serious health condition or to \n     care for a family member with a serious health condition, \n     written advance notice pursuant to an employing office's \n     internal rules and procedures may not be required when FMLA \n     leave is involved.\n       (b) The employee should provide notice to the employing \n     office either in person or by telephone, telegraph, facsimile \n     (``fax'') machine or other electronic means. Notice may be \n     given by the employee's spokesperson (e.g., spouse, adult \n     family member or other responsible party) if the employee is \n     unable to do so personally. The employee need not expressly \n     assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that leave is \n     needed. The employing office will be expected to obtain any \n     additional required information through informal means. The \n     employee or spokesperson will be expected to provide more \n     information when it can readily be accomplished as a \n     practical matter, taking into consideration the exigencies of \n     the situation.\n\n     Sec. 825.304  What recourse do employing offices have if \n       employees fail to provide the required notice?\n\n       (a) An employing office may waive employees' FMLA notice \n     obligations or the employing office's own internal rules on \n     leave notice requirements.\n       (b) If an employee fails to give 30 days notice for \n     foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, \n     the employing office may delay the taking of FMLA leave until \n     at least 30 days after the date the employee provides notice \n     to the employing office of the need for FMLA leave.\n       (c) In all cases, in order for the onset of an employee's \n     FMLA leave to be delayed due to lack of required notice, it \n     must be clear that the employee had actual notice of the FMLA \n     notice requirements. This condition would be satisfied by the \n     employing office's proper posting, at the worksite where the \n     employee is employed, of the information regarding the FMLA \n     provided (pursuant to section 301(h)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     1381(h)(2)) by the Office of Compliance to the employing \n     office in a manner suitable for posting. Furthermore, the \n     need for leave and the approximate date leave would be taken \n     must have been clearly foreseeable to the employee 30 days in \n     advance of the leave. For example, knowledge that an employee \n     would receive a\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\n     telephone call about the availability of a child for adoption \n     at some unknown point in the future would not be sufficient.\n\n     Sec. 825.305  When must an employee provide medical \n       certification to support FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) An employing office may require that an employee's \n     leave to care for the employee's seriously ill spouse, son, \n     daughter, or parent, or due to the employee's own serious \n     health condition that makes the employee unable to perform \n     one or more of the essential functions of the employee's \n     position, be supported by a certification issued by the \n     health care provider of the employee or the employee's ill \n     family member. An employing office must give notice of a \n     requirement for medical certification each time a \n     certification is required; such notice must be written notice \n     whenever required by Sec. 825.301. An employing office's oral \n     request to an employee to furnish any subsequent medical \n     certification is sufficient.\n       (b) When the leave is foreseeable and at least 30 days \n     notice has been provided, the employee should provide the \n     medical certification before the leave begins. When this is \n     not possible, the employee must provide the requested \n     certification to the employing office within the time frame \n     requested by the employing office (which must allow at least \n     15 calendar days after the employing office's request), \n     unless it is not practicable under the particular \n     circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good \n     faith efforts.\n       (c) In most cases, the employing office should request that \n     an employee furnish certification from a health care provider \n     at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave \n     or within two business days thereafter, or, in the case of \n     unforeseen leave, within two business days after the leave \n     commences. The employing office may request certification at \n     some later date if the employing office later has reason to \n     question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration.\n       (d) At the time the employing office requests \n     certification, the employing office must also advise an \n     employee of the anticipated consequences of an employee's \n     failure to provide adequate certification. The employing \n     office shall advise an employee whenever the employing office \n     finds a certification incomplete, and provide the employee a \n     reasonable opportunity to cure any such deficiency.\n       (e) If the employing office's sick or medical leave plan \n     imposes medical certification requirements that are less \n     stringent than the certification requirements of these \n     regulations, and the employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid sick, vacation, personal or family leave for \n     unpaid FMLA leave where authorized (see Sec. 825.207), only \n     the employing office's less stringent sick leave \n     certification requirements may be imposed.\n\n     Sec. 825.306  How much information may be required in medical \n       certifications of a serious health condition?\n\n       (a) The Office of Compliance has made available an optional \n     form (``Certification of Physician or Practitioner'') for \n     employees' (or their family members') use in obtaining \n     medical certification, including second and third opinions, \n     from health care providers that meets FMLA's certification \n     requirements. (See Appendix B to these regulations.) This \n     optional form reflects certification requirements so as to \n     permit the health care provider to furnish appropriate \n     medical information within his or her knowledge.\n       (b) The Certification of Physician or Practitioner form is \n     modeled closely on Form WH-380, as revised, which was \n     developed by the Department of Labor (see 29 C.F.R. Part 825, \n     Appendix B). The employing office may use the Office of \n     Compliance's form, or Form WH-380, as revised, or another \n     form containing the same basic information; however, no \n     additional information may be required. In all instances the \n     information on the form must relate only to the serious \n     health condition for which the current need for leave exists. \n     The form identifies the health care provider and type of \n     medical practice (including pertinent specialization, if \n     any), makes maximum use of checklist entries for ease in \n     completing the form, and contains required entries for:\n       (1) A certification as to which part of the definition of \n     ``serious health condition'' (see Sec. 825.114), if any, \n     applies to the patient's condition, and the medical facts \n     which support the certification, including a brief statement \n     as to how the medical facts meet the criteria of the \n     definition.\n       (2)(i) The approximate date the serious health condition \n     commenced, and its probable duration, including the probable \n     duration of the patient's present incapacity (defined to mean \n     inability to work, attend school or perform other regular \n     daily activities due to the serious health condition, \n     treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom) if different.\n       (ii) Whether it will be necessary for the employee to take \n     leave intermittently or to work on a reduced leave schedule \n     basis (i.e., part-time) as a result of the serious health \n     condition (see Sec. 825.117 and Sec. 825.203), and if so, the \n     probable duration of such schedule.\n       (iii) If the condition is pregnancy or a chronic condition \n     within the meaning of Sec. 825.114(a)(2)(iii), whether the \n     patient is presently incapacitated and the likely duration \n     and frequency of episodes of incapacity.\n       (3)(i)(A) If additional treatments will be required for the \n     condition, an estimate of the probable number of such \n     treatments.\n       (B) If the patient's incapacity will be intermittent, or \n     will require a reduced leave schedule, an estimate of the \n     probable number and interval between such treatments, actual \n     or estimated dates of treatment if known, and period required \n     for recovery if any.\n       (ii) If any of the treatments referred to in subparagraph \n     (i) will be provided by another provider of health services \n     (e.g., physical therapist), the nature of the treatments.\n       (iii) If a regimen of continuing treatment by the patient \n     is required under the supervision of the health care \n     provider, a general description of the regimen (see \n     Sec. 825.114(b)).\n       (4) If medical leave is required for the employee's absence \n     from work because of the employee's own condition (including \n     absences due to pregnancy or a chronic condition), whether \n     the employee--\n       (i) is unable to perform work of any kind;\n       (ii) is unable to perform any one or more of the essential \n     functions of the employee's position, including a statement \n     of the essential functions the employee is unable to perform \n     (see Sec. 825.115), based on either information provided on a \n     statement from the employing office of the essential \n     functions of the position or, if not provided, discussion \n     with the employee about the employee's job functions; or\n       (iii) must be absent from work for treatment.\n       (5)(i) If leave is required to care for a family member of \n     the employee with a serious health condition, whether the \n     patient requires assistance for basic medical or personal \n     needs or safety, or for transportation; or if not, whether \n     the employee's presence to provide psychological comfort \n     would be beneficial to the patient or assist in the patient's \n     recovery. The employee is required to indicate on the form \n     the care he or she will provide and an estimate of the time \n     period.\n       (ii) If the employee's family member will need care only \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule basis (i.e., \n     part-time), the probable duration of the need.\n       (c) If the employing office's sick or medical leave plan \n     requires less information to be furnished in medical \n     certifications than the certification requirements of these \n     regulations, and the employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid sick, vacation, personal or family leave for \n     unpaid FMLA leave where authorized (see Sec. 825.207), only \n     the employing office's lesser sick leave certification \n     requirements may be imposed.\n\n     Sec. 825.307 What may an employing office do if it questions \n       the adequacy of a medical certification?\n\n       (a) If an employee submits a complete certification signed \n     by the health care provider, the employing office may not \n     request additional information from the employee's health \n     care provider. However, a health care provider representing \n     the employing office may contact the employee's health care \n     provider, with the employee's permission, for purposes of \n     clarification and authenticity of the medical certification.\n       (1) If an employee is on FMLA leave running concurrently \n     with a workers' compensation absence, and the provisions of \n     the workers' compensation statute permit the employing office \n     or the employing office's representative to have direct \n     contact with the employee's workers' compensation health care \n     provider, the employing office may follow the workers' \n     compensation provisions.\n       (2) An employing office that has reason to doubt the \n     validity of a medical certification may require the employee \n     to obtain a second opinion at the employing office's expense. \n     Pending receipt of the second (or third) medical opinion, the \n     employee is provisionally entitled to the benefits of the \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA, including maintenance of \n     group health benefits. If the certifications do not \n     ultimately establish the employee's entitlement to FMLA \n     leave, the leave shall not be designated as FMLA leave and \n     may be treated as paid or unpaid leave under the employing \n     office's established leave policies. The employing office is \n     permitted to designate the health care provider to furnish \n     the second opinion, but the selected health care provider may \n     not be employed on a regular basis by the employing office. \n     See also paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.\n       (b) The employing office may not regularly contract with or \n     otherwise regularly utilize the services of the health care \n     provider furnishing the second opinion unless the employing \n     office is located in an area where access to health care is \n     extremely limited (e.g., a rural area where no more than one \n     or two doctors practice in the relevant specialty in the \n     vicinity).\n       (c) If the opinions of the employee's and the employing \n     office's designated health care providers differ, the \n     employing office may require the employee to obtain \n     certification from a third health care provider, again at the \n     employing office's expense. This third opinion shall be final \n     and binding. The third health care provider must be \n     designated or approved jointly by the employing office and \n     the employee. The employing office and the employee must each \n     act in good faith to attempt to reach agreement on whom to \n     select for the third opinion provider. If the employing \n     office does not attempt in good faith to reach agreement, the \n     employing office will be bound by the first certification. If \n     the employee does not attempt in good faith to reach \n     agreement, the employee will be bound by the second \n     certification. For example, an employee who refuses to agree \n     to see a doctor in the specialty in question may be failing \n     to act in good faith. On the other hand,\n\n[[Page S4534]]\n\n     an employing office that refuses to agree to any doctor on a \n     list of specialists in the appropriate field provided by the \n     employee and whom the employee has not previously consulted \n     may be failing to act in good faith.\n       (d) The employing office is required to provide the \n     employee with a copy of the second and third medical \n     opinions, where applicable, upon request by the employee. \n     Requested copies are to be provided within two business days \n     unless extenuating circumstances prevent such action.\n       (e) If the employing office requires the employee to obtain \n     either a second or third opinion the employing office must \n     reimburse an employee or family member for any reasonable \n     ``out of pocket'' travel expenses incurred to obtain the \n     second and third medical opinions. The employing office may \n     not require the employee or family member to travel outside \n     normal commuting distance for purposes of obtaining the \n     second or third medical opinions except in very unusual \n     circumstances.\n       (f) In circumstances when the employee or a family member \n     is visiting in another country, or a family member resides in \n     a another country, and a serious health condition develops, \n     the employing office shall accept a medical certification as \n     well as second and third opinions from a health care provider \n     who practices in that country.\n\n     Sec. 825.308 Under what circumstances may an employing office \n       request subsequent recertifications of medical conditions?\n\n       (a) For pregnancy, chronic, or permanent/long-term \n     conditions under continuing supervision of a health care \n     provider (as defined in Sec. 825.114(a)(2) (ii), (iii) or \n     (iv)), an employing office may request recertification no \n     more often than every 30 days and only in connection with an \n     absence by the employee, unless:\n       (1) Circumstances described by the previous certification \n     have changed significantly (e.g., the duration or frequency \n     of absences, the severity of the condition, complications); \n     or\n       (2) The employing office receives information that casts \n     doubt upon the employee's stated reason for the absence.\n       (b)(1) If the minimum duration of the period of incapacity \n     specified on a certification furnished by the health care \n     provider is more than 30 days, the employing office may not \n     request recertification until that minimum duration has \n     passed unless one of the conditions set forth in paragraph \n     (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section is met.\n       (2) For FMLA leave taken intermittently or on a reduced \n     leave schedule basis, the employing office may not request \n     recertification in less than the minimum period specified on \n     the certification as necessary for such leave (including \n     treatment) unless one of the conditions set forth in \n     paragraph (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section is met.\n       (c) For circumstances not covered by paragraphs (a) or (b) \n     of this section, an employing office may request \n     recertification at any reasonable interval, but not more \n     often than every 30 days, unless:\n       (1) The employee requests an extension of leave;\n       (2) Circumstances described by the previous certification \n     have changed significantly (e.g., the duration of the \n     illness, the nature of the illness, complications); or\n       (3) The employing office receives information that casts \n     doubt upon the continuing validity of the certification.\n       (d) The employee must provide the requested recertification \n     to the employing office within the time frame requested by \n     the employing office (which must allow at least 15 calendar \n     days after the employing office's request), unless it is not \n     practicable under the particular circumstances to do so \n     despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts.\n       (e) Any recertification requested by the employing office \n     shall be at the employee's expense unless the employing \n     office provides otherwise. No second or third opinion on \n     recertification may be required.\n\n     Sec. 825.309 What notice may an employing office require \n       regarding an employee's intent to return to work?\n\n       (a) An employing office may require an employee on FMLA \n     leave to report periodically on the employee's status and \n     intent to return to work. The employing office's policy \n     regarding such reports may not be discriminatory and must \n     take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances \n     related to the individual employee's leave situation.\n       (b) If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work, the employing office's obligations under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to maintain health \n     benefits (subject to requirements of COBRA or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, \n     whichever is applicable) and to restore the employee cease. \n     However, these obligations continue if an employee indicates \n     he or she may be unable to return to work but expresses a \n     continuing desire to do so.\n       (c) It may be necessary for an employee to take more leave \n     than originally anticipated. Conversely, an employee may \n     discover after beginning leave that the circumstances have \n     changed and the amount of leave originally anticipated is no \n     longer necessary. An employee may not be required to take \n     more FMLA leave than necessary to resolve the circumstance \n     that precipitated the need for leave. In both of these \n     situations, the employing office may require that the \n     employee provide the employing office reasonable notice \n     (i.e., within two business days) of the changed circumstances \n     where foreseeable. The employing office may also obtain \n     information on such changed circumstances through requested \n     status reports.\n\n     Sec. 825.310 Under what circumstances may an employing office \n       require that an employee submit a medical certification \n       that the employee is able (or unable) to return to work \n       (i.e., a ``fitness-for-duty'' report)?\n\n       (a) As a condition of restoring an employee whose FMLA \n     leave was occasioned by the employee's own serious health \n     condition that made the employee unable to perform the \n     employee's job, an employing office may have a uniformly-\n     applied policy or practice that requires all similarly-\n     situated employees (i.e., same occupation, same serious \n     health condition) who take leave for such conditions to \n     obtain and present certification from the employee's health \n     care provider that the employee is able to resume work.\n       (b) If the terms of a collective bargaining agreement \n     govern an employee's return to work, those provisions shall \n     be applied. Similarly, requirements under the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by the CAA, that \n     any return-to-work physical be job-related and consistent \n     with business necessity apply. For example, an attorney could \n     not be required to submit to a medical examination or inquiry \n     just because her leg had been amputated. The essential \n     functions of an attorney's job do not require use of both \n     legs; therefore such an inquiry would not be job related. An \n     employing office may require a warehouse laborer, whose back \n     impairment affects the ability to lift, to be examined by an \n     orthopedist, but may not require this employee to submit to \n     an HIV test where the test is not related to either the \n     essential functions of his/her job or to his/her impairment.\n       (c) An employing office may seek fitness-for-duty \n     certification only with regard to the particular health \n     condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave. The \n     certification itself need only be a simple statement of an \n     employee's ability to return to work. A health care provider \n     employed by the employing office may contact the employee's \n     health care provider with the employee's permission, for \n     purposes of clarification of the employee's fitness to return \n     to work. No additional information may be acquired, and \n     clarification may be requested only for the serious health \n     condition for which FMLA leave was taken. The employing \n     office may not delay the employee's return to work while \n     contact with the health care provider is being made.\n       (d) The cost of the certification shall be borne by the \n     employee and the employee is not entitled to be paid for the \n     time or travel costs spent in acquiring the certification.\n       (e) The notice that employing offices are required to give \n     to each employee giving notice of the need for FMLA leave \n     regarding their FMLA rights and obligations as made \n     applicable by the CAA (see Sec. 825.301) shall advise the \n     employee if the employing office will require fitness-for-\n     duty certification to return to work. If the employing office \n     has a handbook explaining employment policies and benefits, \n     the handbook should explain the employing office's general \n     policy regarding any requirement for fitness-for-duty \n     certification to return to work. Specific notice shall also \n     be given to any employee from whom fitness-for-duty \n     certification will be required either at the time notice of \n     the need for leave is given or immediately after leave \n     commences and the employing office is advised of the medical \n     circumstances requiring the leave, unless the employee's \n     condition changes from one that did not previously require \n     certification pursuant to the employing office's practice or \n     policy. No second or third fitness-for-duty certification may \n     be required.\n       (f) An employing office may delay restoration to employment \n     until an employee submits a required fitness-for-duty \n     certification unless the employing office has failed to \n     provide the notices required in paragraph (e) of this \n     section.\n       (g) An employing office is not entitled to certification of \n     fitness to return to duty when the employee takes \n     intermittent leave as described in Sec. 825.203.\n       (h) When an employee is unable to return to work after FMLA \n     leave because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of \n     the employee's or family member's serious health condition, \n     thereby preventing the employing office from recovering its \n     share of health benefit premium payments made on the \n     employee's behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA leave, the \n     employing office may require medical certification of the \n     employee's or the family member's serious health condition. \n     (See Sec. 825.213(a)(3).) The cost of the certification shall \n     be borne by the employee and the employee is not entitled to \n     be paid for the time or travel costs spent in acquiring the \n     certification.\n\n     Sec. 825.311 What happens if an employee fails to satisfy the \n       medical certification and/or recertification requirements?\n\n       (a) In the case of foreseeable leave, an employing office \n     may delay the taking of FMLA leave to an employee who fails \n     to provide timely certification after being requested by the \n     employing office to furnish such certification (i.e., within \n     15 calendar days, if practicable), until the required \n     certification is provided.\n       (b) When the need for leave is not foreseeable, or in the \n     case of recertification, an employee must provide \n     certification (or recertification) within the time frame \n     requested by the employing office (which must allow at\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\n     least 15 days after the employing office's request) or as \n     soon as reasonably possible under the particular facts and \n     circumstances. In the case of a medical emergency, it may not \n     be practicable for an employee to provide the required \n     certification within 15 calendar days. If an employee fails \n     to provide a medical certification within a reasonable time \n     under the pertinent circumstances, the employing office may \n     delay the employee's continuation of FMLA leave. If the \n     employee never produces the certification, the leave is not \n     FMLA leave.\n       (c) When requested by the employing office pursuant to a \n     uniformly applied policy for similarly-situated employees, \n     the employee must provide medical certification at the time \n     the employee seeks reinstatement at the end of FMLA leave \n     taken for the employee's serious health condition, that the \n     employee is fit for duty and able to return to work (see \n     Sec. 825.310(a)) if the employing office has provided the \n     required notice (see Sec. 825.301(c)); the employing office \n     may delay restoration until the certification is provided. In \n     this situation, unless the employee provides either a \n     fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical certification \n     for a serious health condition at the time FMLA leave is \n     concluded, the employee may be terminated. See also \n     Sec. 825.213(a)(3).\n\n     Sec. 825.312 Under what circumstances may an employing office \n       refuse to provide FMLA leave or reinstatement to eligible \n       employees?\n\n       (a) If an employee fails to give timely advance notice when \n     the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, the employing office \n     may delay the taking of FMLA leave until 30 days after the \n     date the employee provides notice to the employing office of \n     the need for FMLA leave. (See Sec. 825.302.)\n       (b) If an employee fails to provide in a timely manner a \n     requested medical certification to substantiate the need for \n     FMLA leave due to a serious health condition, an employing \n     office may delay continuation of FMLA leave until an employee \n     submits the certificate. (See Sec. Sec.  825.305 and \n     825.311.) If the employee never produces the certification, \n     the leave is not FMLA leave.\n       (c) If an employee fails to provide a requested fitness-\n     for-duty certification to return to work, an employing office \n     may delay restoration until the employee submits the \n     certificate. (See Sec. Sec.  825.310 and 825.311.)\n       (d) An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to \n     other benefits and conditions of employment than if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. Thus, an employee's rights to continued leave, \n     maintenance of health benefits, and restoration cease under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, if and when the \n     employment relationship terminates (e.g., layoff), unless \n     that relationship continues, for example, by the employee \n     remaining on paid FMLA leave. If the employee is recalled or \n     otherwise re-employed, an eligible employee is immediately \n     entitled to further FMLA leave for an FMLA-qualifying reason. \n     An employing office must be able to show, when an employee \n     requests restoration, that the employee would not otherwise \n     have been employed if leave had not been taken in order to \n     deny restoration to employment. (See Sec. 825.216.)\n       (e) An employing office may require an employee on FMLA \n     leave to report periodically on the employee's status and \n     intention to return to work. (See Sec. 825.309.) If an \n     employee unequivocally advises the employing office either \n     before or during the taking of leave that the employee does \n     not intend to return to work, and the employment relationship \n     is terminated, the employee's entitlement to continued leave, \n     maintenance of health benefits, and restoration ceases unless \n     the employment relationship continues, for example, by the \n     employee remaining on paid leave. An employee may not be \n     required to take more leave than necessary to address the \n     circumstances for which leave was taken. If the employee is \n     able to return to work earlier than anticipated, the employee \n     shall provide the employing office two business days notice \n     where feasible; the employing office is required to restore \n     the employee once such notice is given, or where such prior \n     notice was not feasible.\n       (f) An employing office may deny restoration to employment, \n     but not the taking of FMLA leave and the maintenance of \n     health benefits, to an eligible employee only under the terms \n     of the ``key employee'' exemption. Denial of reinstatement \n     must be necessary to prevent ``substantial and grievous \n     economic injury'' to the employing office's operations. The \n     employing office must notify the employee of the employee's \n     status as a ``key employee'' and of the employing office's \n     intent to deny reinstatement on that basis when the employing \n     office makes these determinations. If leave has started, the \n     employee must be given a reasonable opportunity to return to \n     work after being so notified. (See Sec. 825.219.)\n       (g) An employee who fraudulently obtains FMLA leave from an \n     employing office is not protected by job restoration or \n     maintenance of health benefits provisions of the FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (h) If the employing office has a uniformly-applied policy \n     governing outside or supplemental employment, such a policy \n     may continue to apply to an employee while on FMLA leave. An \n     employing office which does not have such a policy may not \n     deny benefits to which an employee is entitled under FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA on this basis unless the FMLA \n     leave was fraudulently obtained as in paragraph (g) of this \n     section.\n\n      Subpart D--What Enforcement Mechanisms Does the CAA Provide?\n\n     Sec. 825.400 What can employees do who believe that their \n       rights under the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA have \n       been violated?\n\n       (a) To commence a proceeding, a covered employee alleging a \n     violation of the rights and protections of the FMLA made \n     applicable by the CAA must request counseling by the Office \n     of Compliance not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     alleged violation. If a covered employee misses this \n     deadline, the covered employee will be unable to obtain a \n     remedy under the CAA.\n       (b) The following procedures are available under title IV \n     of the CAA for covered employees who believe that their \n     rights under FMLA as made applicable by the CAA have been \n     violated--\n       (1) counseling;\n       (2) mediation; and\n       (3) election of either--\n       (A) a formal complaint, filed with the Office of \n     Compliance, and a hearing before a hearing officer, subject \n     to review by the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance, and judicial review in the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit; or\n       (B) a civil action in a district court of the United \n     States.\n       (c) Regulations of the Office of Compliance describing and \n     governing these procedures are found at [proposed rules can \n     be found at 141 Cong. Rec. S17012 (November 14, 1995)].\n\n     Sec. 825.401 [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.402 [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.403 [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.404 [Reserved]\n\n                         Subpart E--[Reserved]\n\n      Subpart F--What Special Rules Apply to Employees of Schools?\n\n     Sec. 825.600 To whom do the special rules apply?\n\n       (a) Certain special rules apply to employees of ``local \n     educational agencies'', including public school boards and \n     elementary schools under their jurisdiction, and private \n     elementary and secondary schools. The special rules do not \n     apply to other kinds of educational institutions, such as \n     colleges and universities, trade schools, and preschools.\n       (b) Educational institutions are covered by FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA (and these special rules). The usual \n     requirements for employees to be ``eligible'' apply.\n       (c) The special rules affect the taking of intermittent \n     leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule, or leave near the \n     end of an academic term (semester), by instructional \n     employees. ``Instructional employees'' are those whose \n     principal function is to teach and instruct students in a \n     class, a small group, or an individual setting. This term \n     includes not only teachers, but also athletic coaches, \n     driving instructors, and special education assistants such as \n     signers for the hearing impaired. It does not include, and \n     the special rules do not apply to, teacher assistants or \n     aides who do not have as their principal job actual teaching \n     or instructing, nor does it include auxiliary personnel such \n     as counselors, psychologists, or curriculum specialists. It \n     also does not include cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, \n     or bus drivers.\n       (d) Special rules which apply to restoration to an \n     equivalent position apply to all employees of local \n     educational agencies.\n\n     Sec. 825.601 What limitations apply to the taking of \n       intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule?\n\n       (a) Leave taken for a period that ends with the school year \n     and begins the next semester is leave taken consecutively \n     rather than intermittently. The period during the summer \n     vacation when the employee would not have been required to \n     report for duty is not counted against the employee's FMLA \n     leave entitlement. An instructional employee who is on FMLA \n     leave at the end of the school year must be provided with any \n     benefits over the summer vacation that employees would \n     normally receive if they had been working at the end of the \n     school year.\n       (1) If an eligible instructional employee needs \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule to \n     care for a family member, or for the employee's own serious \n     health condition, which is foreseeable based on planned \n     medical treatment, and the employee would be on leave for \n     more than 20 percent of the total number of working days over \n     the period the leave would extend, the employing office may \n     require the employee to choose either to:\n       (i) Take leave for a period or periods of a particular \n     duration, not greater than the duration of the planned \n     treatment; or\n       (ii) Transfer temporarily to an available alternative \n     position for which the employee is qualified, which has \n     equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates \n     recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular \n     position.\n       (2) These rules apply only to a leave involving more than \n     20 percent of the working days during the period over which \n     the leave extends. For example, if an instructional employee \n     who normally works five days each week needs to take two days \n     of FMLA leave per week over a period of several weeks, the\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\n     special rules would apply. Employees taking leave which \n     constitutes 20 percent or less of the working days during the \n     leave period would not be subject to transfer to an \n     alternative position. ``Periods of a particular duration'' \n     means a block, or blocks, of time beginning no earlier than \n     the first day for which leave is needed and ending no later \n     than the last day on which leave is needed, and may include \n     one uninterrupted period of leave.\n       (b) If an instructional employee does not give required \n     notice of foreseeable FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.302) to be \n     taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, the \n     employing office may require the employee to take leave of a \n     particular duration, or to transfer temporarily to an \n     alternative position. Alternatively, the employing office may \n     require the employee to delay the taking of leave until the \n     notice provision is met. See Sec. 825.207(h).\n\n     Sec. 825.602 What limitations apply to the taking of leave \n       near the end of an academic term?\n\n       (a) There are also different rules for instructional \n     employees who begin leave more than five weeks before the end \n     of a term, less than five weeks before the end of a term, and \n     less than three weeks before the end of a term. Regular rules \n     apply except in circumstances when:\n       (1) An instructional employee begins leave more than five \n     weeks before the end of a term. The employing office may \n     require the employee to continue taking leave until the end \n     of the term if--\n       (i) the leave will last at least three weeks, and\n       (ii) the employee would return to work during the three-\n     week period before the end of the term.\n       (2) The employee begins leave for a purpose other than the \n     employee's own serious health condition during the five-week \n     period before the end of a term. The employing office may \n     require the employee to continue taking leave until the end \n     of the term if--\n       (i) the leave will last more than two weeks, and\n       (ii) the employee would return to work during the two-week \n     period before the end of the term.\n       (3) The employee begins leave for a purpose other than the \n     employee's own serious health condition during the three-week \n     period before the end of a term, and the leave will last more \n     than five working days. The employing office may require the \n     employee to continue taking leave until the end of the term.\n        (b) For purposes of these provisions, ``academic term'' \n     means the school semester, which typically ends near the end \n     of the calendar year and the end of spring each school year. \n     In no case may a school have more than two academic terms or \n     semesters each year for purposes of FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA. An example of leave falling within these \n     provisions would be where an employee plans two weeks of \n     leave to care for a family member which will begin three \n     weeks before the end of the term. In that situation, the \n     employing office could require the employee to stay out on \n     leave until the end of the term.\n\n     Sec. 825.603 Is all leave taken during ``periods of a \n       particular duration'' counted against the FMLA leave \n       entitlement?\n\n       (a) If an employee chooses to take leave for ``periods of a \n     particular duration'' in the case of intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave, the entire period of leave taken will count \n     as FMLA leave.\n       (b) In the case of an employee who is required to take \n     leave until the end of an academic term, only the period of \n     leave until the employee is ready and able to return to work \n     shall be charged against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement. The employing office has the option not to \n     require the employee to stay on leave until the end of the \n     school term. Therefore, any additional leave required by the \n     employing office to the end of the school term is not counted \n     as FMLA leave; however, the employing office shall be \n     required to maintain the employee's group health insurance \n     and restore the employee to the same or equivalent job \n     including other benefits at the conclusion of the leave.\n\n     Sec. 825.604 What special rules apply to restoration to ``an \n       equivalent position''?\n\n       The determination of how an employee is to be restored to \n     ``an equivalent position'' upon return from FMLA leave will \n     be made on the basis of ``established school board policies \n     and practices, private school policies and practices, and \n     collective bargaining agreements''. The ``established \n     policies'' and collective bargaining agreements used as a \n     basis for restoration must be in writing, must be made known \n     to the employee prior to the taking of FMLA leave, and must \n     clearly explain the employee's restoration rights upon return \n     from leave. Any established policy which is used as the basis \n     for restoration of an employee to ``an equivalent position'' \n     must provide substantially the same protections as provided \n     in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, for reinstated \n     employees. See Sec. 825.215. In other words, the policy or \n     collective bargaining agreement must provide for restoration \n     to an ``equivalent position'' with equivalent employment \n     benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n     For example, an employee may not be restored to a position \n     requiring additional licensure or certification.\n\n     Subpart G--How Do Other Laws, Employing Office Practices, and \nCollective Bargaining Agreements Affect Employee Rights Under the FMLA \n                     as Made Applicable by the CAA?\n\n     Sec. 825.700 What if an employing office provides more \n       generous benefits than required by FMLA as made applicable \n       by the CAA?\n\n       (a) An employing office must observe any employment benefit \n     program or plan that provides greater family or medical leave \n     rights to employees than the rights established by the FMLA. \n     Conversely, the rights established by the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, may not be diminished by any \n     employment benefit program or plan. For example, a provision \n     of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) which provides for \n     reinstatement to a position that is not equivalent because of \n     seniority (e.g., provides lesser pay) is superseded by FMLA. \n     If an employing office provides greater unpaid family leave \n     rights than are afforded by FMLA, the employing office is not \n     required to extend additional rights afforded by FMLA, such \n     as maintenance of health benefits (other than through COBRA \n     or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is applicable), to the \n     additional leave period not covered by FMLA. If an employee \n     takes paid or unpaid leave and the employing office does not \n     designate the leave as FMLA leave, the leave taken does not \n     count against an employee's FMLA entitlement.\n       (b) Nothing in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     prevents an employing office from amending existing leave and \n     employee benefit programs, provided they comply with FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA. However, nothing in the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, is intended to discourage \n     employing offices from adopting or retaining more generous \n     leave policies.\n       (c) [Reserved].\n\n     Sec. 825.701 [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.702 How does FMLA affect anti-discrimination laws as \n       applied by section 201 of the CAA?\n\n       (a) Nothing in FMLA modifies or affects any applicable law \n     prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, religion, \n     color, national origin, sex, age, or disability (e.g., title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the \n     Pregnancy Discrimination Act), as made applicable by the CAA. \n     FMLA's legislative history explains that FMLA is ``not \n     intended to modify or affect the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n     as amended, the regulations concerning employment which have \n     been promulgated pursuant to that statute, or the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the regulations issued \n     under that Act. Thus, the leave provisions of the [FMLA] are \n     wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations \n     of employers covered under the [ADA] * * * or the Federal \n     government itself. The purpose of the FMLA is to make leave \n     available to eligible employees and employing offices within \n     its coverage, and not to limit already existing rights and \n     protection''. S. Rep. No. 3, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 38 (1993). \n     An employing office must therefore provide leave under \n     whichever statutory provision provides the greater rights to \n     employees.\n       (b) If an employee is a qualified individual with a \n     disability within the meaning of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), the employing office must make \n     reasonable accommodations, etc., barring undue hardship, in \n     accordance with the ADA. At the same time, the employing \n     office must afford an employee his or her FMLA rights. ADA's \n     ``disability'' and FMLA's ``serious health condition'' are \n     different concepts, and must be analyzed separately. FMLA \n     entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of leave in any 12-\n     month period, whereas the ADA allows an indeterminate amount \n     of leave, barring undue hardship, as a reasonable \n     accommodation. FMLA requires employing offices to maintain \n     employees' group health plan coverage during FMLA leave on \n     the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if \n     the employee had been continuously employed during the leave \n     period, whereas ADA does not require maintenance of health \n     insurance unless other employees receive health insurance \n     during leave under the same circumstances.\n       (c)(1) A reasonable accommodation under the ADA might be \n     accomplished by providing an individual with a disability \n     with a part-time job with no health benefits, assuming the \n     employing office did not ordinarily provide health insurance \n     for part-time employees. However, FMLA would permit an \n     employee to work a reduced leave schedule until the \n     equivalent of 12 workweeks of leave were used, with group \n     health benefits maintained during this period. FMLA permits \n     an employing office to temporarily transfer an employee who \n     is taking leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule \n     to an alternative position, whereas the ADA allows an \n     accommodation of reassignment to an equivalent, vacant \n     position only if the employee cannot perform the essential \n     functions of the employee's present position and an \n     accommodation is not possible in the employee's present \n     position, or an accommodation in the employee's present \n     position would cause an undue hardship. The examples in the \n     following paragraphs of this section demonstrate how the two \n     laws would interact with respect to a qualified individual \n     with a disability.\n       (2) A qualified individual with a disability who is also an \n     ``eligible employee'' entitled to FMLA leave requests 10 \n     weeks of medical leave as a reasonable accommodation, which\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\n     the employing office grants because it is not an undue \n     hardship. The employing office advises the employee that the \n     10 weeks of leave is also being designated as FMLA leave and \n     will count towards the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. \n     This designation does not prevent the parties from also \n     treating the leave as a reasonable accommodation and \n     reinstating the employee into the same job, as required by \n     the ADA, rather than an equivalent position under FMLA, if \n     that is the greater right available to the employee. At the \n     same time, the employee would be entitled under FMLA to have \n     the employing office maintain group health plan coverage \n     during the leave, as that requirement provides the greater \n     right to the employee.\n       (3) If the same employee needed to work part-time (a \n     reduced leave schedule) after returning to his or her same \n     job, the employee would still be entitled under FMLA to have \n     group health plan coverage maintained for the remainder of \n     the two-week equivalent of FMLA leave entitlement, \n     notwithstanding an employing office policy that part-time \n     employees do not receive health insurance. This employee \n     would be entitled under the ADA to reasonable accommodations \n     to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of \n     the part-time position. In addition, because the employee is \n     working a part-time schedule as a reasonable accommodation, \n     the employee would be shielded from FMLA's provision for \n     temporary assignment to a different alternative position. \n     Once the employee has exhausted his or her remaining FMLA \n     leave entitlement while working the reduced (part-time) \n     schedule, if the employee is a qualified individual with a \n     disability, and if the employee is unable to return to the \n     same full-time position at that time, the employee might \n     continue to work part-time as a reasonable accommodation, \n     barring undue hardship; the employee would then be entitled \n     to only those employment benefits ordinarily provided by the \n     employing office to part-time employees.\n       (4) At the end of the FMLA leave entitlement, an employing \n     office is required under FMLA to reinstate the employee in \n     the same or an equivalent position, with equivalent pay and \n     benefits, to that which the employee held when leave \n     commenced. The employing office's FMLA obligations would be \n     satisfied if the employing office offered the employee an \n     equivalent full-time position. If the employee were unable to \n     perform the essential functions of that equivalent position \n     even with reasonable accommodation, because of a disability, \n     the ADA may require the employing office to make a reasonable \n     accommodation at that time by allowing the employee to work \n     part-time or by reassigning the employee to a vacant \n     position, barring undue hardship.\n       (d)(1) If FMLA entitles an employee to leave, an employing \n     office may not, in lieu of FMLA leave entitlement, require an \n     employee to take a job with a reasonable accommodation. \n     However, ADA may require that an employing office offer an \n     employee the opportunity to take such a position. An \n     employing office may not change the essential functions of \n     the job in order to deny FMLA leave. See Sec. 825.220(b).\n       (2) An employee may be on a workers' compensation absence \n     due to an on-the-job injury or illness which also qualifies \n     as a serious health condition under FMLA. The workers' \n     compensation absence and FMLA leave may run concurrently \n     (subject to proper notice and designation by the employing \n     office). At some point the health care provider providing \n     medical care pursuant to the workers' compensation injury may \n     certify the employee is able to return to work in a ``light \n     duty'' position. If the employing office offers such a \n     position, the employee is permitted but not required to \n     accept the position (see Sec. 825.220(d)). As a result, the \n     employee may no longer qualify for payments from the workers' \n     compensation benefit plan, but the employee is entitled to \n     continue on unpaid FMLA leave either until the employee is \n     able to return to the same or equivalent job the employee \n     left or until the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement is \n     exhausted. See Sec. 825.207(d)(2). If the employee returning \n     from the workers' compensation injury is a qualified \n     individual with a disability, he or she will have rights \n     under the ADA.\n       (e) If an employing office requires certifications of an \n     employee's fitness for duty to return to work, as permitted \n     by FMLA under a uniform policy, it must comply with the ADA \n     requirement that a fitness for duty physical be job-related \n     and consistent with business necessity.\n       (f) Under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as \n     amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and as made \n     applicable by the CAA, an employing office should provide the \n     same benefits for women who are pregnant as the employing \n     office provides to other employees with short-term \n     disabilities. Because title VII does not require employees to \n     be employed for a certain period of time to be protected, an \n     employee employed for less than 12 months by any employing \n     office (and, therefore, not an ``eligible'' employee under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA) may not be denied \n     maternity leave if the employing office normally provides \n     short-term disability benefits to employees with the same \n     tenure who are experiencing other short-term disabilities.\n       (g) For further information on Federal anti-discrimination \n     laws applied by section 201 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311), \n     including title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA, \n     individuals are encouraged to contact the Office of \n     Compliance.\n\n                         Subpart H--Definitions\n\n     Sec. 825.800 Definitions.\n\n       For purposes of this part:\n       ADA means the Americans With Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \n     12101 et seq.).\n       CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (Pub.

The term does not include non-\n     employment related obligations paid by employees through \n     voluntary deductions such as supplemental insurance coverage. \n     (See Sec. 825.209(a)).\n       FLSA means the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 201 et \n     seq.).\n       FMLA means the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, Public \n     Law 103-3 (February 5, 1993), 107 Stat. 6 (29 U.S.C. 2601 et \n     seq.).\n       Group health plan means the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Program and any other plan of, or contributed to by, \n     an employing office (including a self-insured plan) to \n     provide health care (directly or otherwise) to the employing \n     office's employees, former employees, or the families of such \n     employees or former employees. For purposes of FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, the term ``group health plan'' shall \n     not include an insurance program providing health coverage \n     under which employees purchase individual policies from \n     insurers provided that--\n       (1) no contributions are made by the employing office;\n       (2) participation in the program is completely voluntary \n     for employees;\n       (3) the sole functions of the employing office with respect \n     to the program are, without endorsing the program, to permit \n     the insurer to publicize the program to employees, to collect \n     premiums through payroll deductions and to remit them to the \n     insurer;\n       (4) the employing office receives no consideration in the \n     form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program, \n     other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for \n     administrative services actually rendered in connection with \n     payroll deduction; and\n       (5) the premium charged with respect to such coverage does \n     not increase in the event the employment relationship \n     terminates.\n       Health care provider means:\n       (1) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to \n     practice medicine or surgery by the State in which the doctor \n     practices; or\n       (2) Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, \n     optometrists, and chiropractors (limited to treatment \n     consisting of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a \n     subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist) authorized to \n     practice in the State and performing within the scope of \n     their practice as defined under State law; and\n       (3) Nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives and clinical social \n     workers who are authorized to practice under State law and \n     who are performing within the scope of their practice as \n     defined under State law; and\n       (4) Christian Science practitioners listed with the First \n     Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts.\n       (5) Any health care provider from whom an employing office \n     or a group health plan's benefits manager will accept \n     certification of the existence of a serious health condition \n     to substantiate a claim for benefits.\n       (6) A health care provider as defined above who practices \n     in a country other than the United States, who is licensed to \n     practice in accordance with the laws and regulations of that \n     country.\n       ``Incapable of self-care'' means that the individual \n     requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily \n     self-care in several of the ``activities of daily living'' \n     (ADLs) or ``instrumental activities of daily living'' \n     (IADLs).

A \n     serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a \n     health care provider includes:\n       (A) A period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend \n     school or perform other regular daily activities due to the \n     serious health condition, treatment therefor, or recovery \n     therefrom) of more than three consecutive calendar days, \n     including any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity \n     relating to the same condition, that also involves:\n\n       (1) Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, \n     by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision \n     of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care \n     services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider; or\n       (2) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment \n     under the supervision of the health care provider.\n\n       (B) Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for \n     prenatal care.\n       (C) Any period of incapacity or treatment for such \n     incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A \n     chronic serious health condition is one which:\n\n       (1) Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care \n     provider, or by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct \n     supervision of a health care provider;\n       (2) Continues over an extended period of time (including \n     recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n       (3) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of \n     incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n\n       (D) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term \n     due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. \n     The employee or family member must be under the continuing \n     supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment \n     by, a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a \n     severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (E) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments \n     (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care \n     provider or by a provider of health care services under \n     orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either \n     for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or \n     for a condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in \n     the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (2) Treatment for purposes of paragraph (1) of this \n     definition includes (but is not limited to) examinations to \n     determine if a serious health condition exists and \n     evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not include \n     routine physical examinations, eye examinations, or dental \n     examinations. Under paragraph (1)(ii)(A)(2) of this \n     definition, a regimen of continuing treatment includes, for \n     example, a course of prescription medication (e.g., an \n     antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment to resolve \n     or alleviate the health condition (e.g., oxygen). A regimen \n     of continuing treatment that includes the taking of over-the-\n     counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, or \n     salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other \n     similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a \n     health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to \n     constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of \n     FMLA leave.\n       (3) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are \n     administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic \n     surgery) are not ``serious health conditions'' unless \n     inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications \n     develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common \n     cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, \n     headaches other than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia \n     problems, periodontal disease, etc., are examples of \n     conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious \n     health condition and do not qualify for FMLA leave. \n     Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or \n     removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions \n     provided all the other conditions of this regulation are met. \n     Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies may be \n     serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of \n     this section are met.\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\n       (4) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if \n     the conditions of this section are met. However, FMLA leave \n     may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a \n     health care provider or by a provider of health care services \n     on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand, \n     absence because of the employee's use of the substance, \n     rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.\n       (5) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (1)(ii) (B) or (C) of this definition qualify for FMLA leave \n     even though the employee or the immediate family member does \n     not receive treatment from a health care provider during the \n     absence, and even if the absence does not last more than \n     three days. For example, an employee with asthma may be \n     unable to report for work due to the onset of an asthma \n     attack or because the employee's health care provider has \n     advised the employee to stay home when the pollen count \n     exceeds a certain level. An employee who is pregnant may be \n     unable to report to work because of severe morning sickness.\n       Son or daughter means a biological, adopted, or foster \n     child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person \n     standing in loco parentis, who is under 18 years of age or 18 \n     years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of a \n     mental or physical disability.\n       Spouse means a husband or wife as defined or recognized \n     under State law for purposes of marriage in the State where \n     the employee resides, including common law marriage in States \n     where it is recognized.\n       State means any State of the United States or the District \n     of Columbia or any Territory or possession of the United \n     States.\n       Teacher (or employee employed in an instructional capacity, \n     or instructional employee) means an employee employed \n     principally in an instructional capacity by an educational \n     agency or school whose principal function is to teach and \n     instruct students in a class, a small group, or an individual \n     setting, and includes athletic coaches, driving instructors, \n     and special education assistants such as signers for the \n     hearing impaired. The term does not include teacher \n     assistants or aides who do not have as their principal \n     function actual teaching or instructing, nor auxiliary \n     personnel such as counselors, psychologists, curriculum \n     specialists, cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, bus \n     drivers, or other primarily noninstructional employees.\n\n                   Appendix A to Part 825--[Reserved]\n\n   Appendix B to Part 825--Certification of Physician or Practitioner\n\n                 Certification of Health Care Provider\n\n    (family and medical leave act of 1993 as made applicable by the \n               congressional accountability act of 1995)\n\n     1.

If \n     paid leave will be used the following conditions will apply: \n     (Explain)\n\n     5(a). If you normally pay a portion of the premiums for your \n     health insurance, these payments will continue during the \n     period of FMLA leave. Arrangements for payment have been \n     discussed with you and it is agreed that you will make \n     premium payments as follows: (Set forth dates, e.g., the 10th \n     of each month, or pay periods, etc. that specifically cover \n     the agreement with the employee.).\n\n     (b). You have a minimum 30-day (or, indicate longer period, \n     if applicable) grace period in which to make premium \n     payments. If payment is not made timely, your group health \n     insurance may be cancelled: Provided, That we notify you in \n     writing at least 15 days before the date that your health \n     coverage will lapse, or, at our option, we may pay your share \n     of the premiums during FMLA leave, and recover these payments \n     from you upon your return to work.

If you are a ``key employee'', restoration \n     to employment may be denied following FMLA leave on the \n     grounds that such restoration will cause substantial and \n     grievous economic injury to us.\n\n     (b). We  {time}  have   {time}  have not  determined that \n     restoring you to employment at the conclusion of FMLA leave \n     will cause substantial and grievous economic harm to us. \n     (Explain (a) and/or (b) below.

C501.101  Purpose and scope\n\n       (a) Section 203 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) provides that the rights and protections of subsections \n     (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 206(a)(1) and (d), 207, 212(c)) shall apply to \n     covered employees of the legislative branch of the Federal \n     Government. Section 301 of the CAA creates the Office of \n     Compliance as an independent office in the legislative branch \n     for enforcing the rights and protections of the FLSA, as \n     applied by the CAA.\n       (b) The FLSA as applied by the CAA provides for minimum \n     standards for both wages and overtime entitlements, and \n     delineates administrative procedures by which covered \n     worktime must be compensated. Included also in the FLSA are \n     provisions related to child labor, equal pay, and portal-to-\n     portal activities. In addition, the FLSA exempts specified \n     employees or groups of employees from the application of \n     certain of its provisions.\n       (c) This chapter contains the substantive regulations with \n     respect to the FLSA that the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance has adopted pursuant to sections\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\n     203(c) and 304 of the CAA, which requires that the Board \n     promulgate regulations that are ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) [of Sec. 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section''.\n       (d) These regulations are issued by the Board of Directors, \n     Office of Compliance, pursuant to sections 203(c) and 304 of \n     the CAA, which directs the Board to promulgate regulations \n     implementing section 203 that are ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) [of section 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board \n     may determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification \n     of such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section''. The regulations issued by the Board herein are on \n     all matters for which section 203 of the CAA requires \n     regulations to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment, based on the information available to it \n     at the time of the promulgation of these regulations, that, \n     with the exception of regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     section 203 of the CAA]''.\n       (e) In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n\n     Sec. C501.102 Definitions\n\n       For purposes of this chapter:\n       (a) ``CAA'' means the Congressional Accountability Act of \n     1995 (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438).\n       (b) ``FLSA'' or ``Act'' means the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938, as amended (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 et seq.), as applied \n     by section 203 of the CAA to covered employees and employing \n     offices.\n       (c) ``Covered employee'' means any employee, including an \n     applicant for employment and a former employee, of the (1) \n     the Capitol Guide Service; (2) the Capitol Police; (3) the \n     Congressional Budget Office; (4) the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol; (5) the Office of the Attending Physician; \n     (6) the Office of Compliance; or (7) the Office of Technology \n     Assessment, but shall not include an intern.\n       (d)(1) ``Employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol'' includes any employee of the Architect of the \n     Capitol, the Botanic Garden, or the Senate Restaurants;\n       (2) ``Employee of the Capitol Police'' includes any member \n     or officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (e) ``Employing office'' and ``employer'' mean (1) the \n     Capitol Guide Service; (2) the Capitol Police; (3) the \n     Congressional Budget Office; (4) the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol; (5) the Office of the Attending Physician; \n     (6) the Office of Compliance; or (7) the Office of Technology \n     Assessment.\n       (f) ``Board'' means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (g) ``Office'' means the Office of Compliance.\n       (h) ``Intern'' is an individual who (a) is performing \n     services in an employing office as part of a demonstrated \n     educational plan, and (b) is appointed on a temporary basis \n     for a period not to exceed 12 months: Provided, That if an \n     intern is appointed for a period shorter than 12 months, the \n     intern may be reappointed for additional periods as long as \n     the total length of the internship does not exceed 12 months: \n     Provided further, That the defintion of ``intern'' does not \n     include volunteers, fellows or pages.\n\n     Sec. C501.103 Coverage\n\n       The coverage of section 203 of the CAA extends to any \n     covered employee of an employing office without regard to \n     whether the covered employee is engaged in commerce or the \n     production of goods for interstate commerce and without \n     regard to size, number of employees, amount of business \n     transacted, or other measure.\n\n     Sec. C501.104 Administrative authority\n\n       (a) The Office of Compliance is authorized to administer \n     the provisions of section 203 of the Act with respect to any \n     covered employee or covered employer.\n       (b) The Board is authorized to promulgate substantive \n     regulations in accordance with the provisions of sections \n     203(c) and 304 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. C501.105 Effect of interpretations of the Department of \n       Labor\n\n       (a) In administering the FLSA, the Wage and Hour Division \n     of the Department of Labor has issued not only substantive \n     regulations but also interpretative bulletins. Substantive \n     regulations represent an exercise of statutorily-delegated \n     lawmaking authority from the legislative branch to an \n     administrative agency. Generally, they are proposed in \n     accordance with the notice-and-comment procedures of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553. Once \n     promulgated, such regulations are considered to have the \n     force and effect of law, unless set aside upon judicial \n     review as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n     otherwise not in accordance with law. See Batterton v. \n     Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). See also 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 790.17(b) (1994). Unlike substantive regulations, \n     interpretative statements, including bulletins and other \n     releases of the Wage and Hour Division, are not issued \n     pursuant to the provisions of the APA and may not have the \n     force and effect of law. Rather, they may only constitute \n     official interpretations of the Department of Labor with \n     respect to the meaning and application of the minimum wage, \n     maximum hour, and overtime pay requirements of the FLSA. See \n     29 C.F.R. Sec. 790.17(c) (citing Final Report of the Attorney \n     General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, Senate \n     Document No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 27 (1941)). The \n     purpose of such statements is to make available in one place \n     the interpretations of the FLSA which will guide the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Wage and Hour Administrator in the \n     performance of their duties unless and until they are \n     otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts \n     or conclude, upon reexamination of an interpretation, that it \n     is incorrect. The Supreme Court has observed: ``[T]he \n     rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator \n     under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by \n     reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience \n     and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may \n     properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment \n     in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness \n     evident in the consideration, the validity of its reasoning, \n     its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and \n     all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking \n     power to control.''. Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 140 \n     (1944).\n       (b) Section 203(c) of the CAA provides that the substantive \n     regulations implementing section 203 of the CAA shall be \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor'' except where the Board finds, for good \n     cause shown, that a modification would more effectively \n     implement the rights and protections established by the FLSA. \n     Thus, the CAA by its terms does not mandate that the Board \n     adopt the interpretative statements of the Department of \n     Labor or its Wage and Hour Division. The Board is thus not \n     adopting such statements as part of its substantive \n     regulations.\n\n     Sec. C501.106 Application of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947\n\n       (a) Consistent with section 225 of the CAA, the Portal-to-\n     Portal Act (PPA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 216 and 251 et seq., is \n     applicable in defining and delimiting the rights and \n     protections of the FLSA that are prescribed by the CAA. \n     Section 10 of the PPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 259, provides in \n     pertinent part: ``[N]o employer shall be subject to any \n     liability or punishment for or on account of the failure of \n     the employer to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation \n     under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, . . . \n     if he pleads and proves that the act or omission complained \n     of was in good faith in conformity with and reliance on any \n     written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or \n     interpretation of [the Administrator of the Wage and Hour \n     Division of the Department of Labor] . . . or any \n     administrative practice or enforcement policy of such agency \n     with respect to the class of employers to which he belonged. \n     Such a defense, if established shall be a bar to the action \n     or proceeding, notwithstanding that after such act or \n     omission, such administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval, interpretation, practice or enforcement policy is \n     modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority \n     to be invalid or of no legal effect.''.\n       (b) In defending any action or proceeding based on any act \n     or omission arising out of section 203 of the CAA, an \n     employing office may satisfy the standards set forth in \n     subsection (a) by pleading and proving good faith reliance \n     upon any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval or interpretation, of the Administrator of the Wage \n     and Hour Division of the Department of Labor: Provided, That \n     such regulation, order, ruling, approval or interpretation \n     had not been superseded at the time of reliance by any \n     regulation, order, decision, or ruling of the Board or the \n     courts.\n\n     Sec.

C531.1 Definitions\n\n       (a) ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of the Wage \n     and Hour Division or his authorized representative. The \n     Secretary of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the \n     functions vested in him under section 3(m) of the Act.\n       (b) ``Act'' means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended.\n\n     Sec. C531.2 Purpose and scope\n\n       (a) Section 3(m) of the Act defines the term ``wage'' to \n     include the ``reasonable cost'', as determined by the \n     Secretary of Labor, to an employer of furnishing any employee \n     with board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, \n     lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by the \n     employer to his employees. In addition, section 3(m) gives \n     the Secretary authority to determine the ``fair value'' of \n     such facilities on the basis of average cost to the employer \n     or to groups of employers similarly situated, on average \n     value to groups of employees, or other appropriate measures \n     of ``fair value''. Whenever so determined and when applicable \n     and pertinent, the ``fair value'' of the facilities involved \n     shall be includable as part of ``wages'' instead of the \n     actual measure of the costs of those facilities. The section \n     provides, however, that the cost of board, lodging, or other \n     facilities shall not be included as part of ``wages'' if \n     excluded therefrom by a bona fide collective bargaining \n     agreement. Section 3(m) also provides a method for \n     determining the wage of a tipped employee.\n       (b) This part 531 contains any determinations made as to \n     the ``reasonable cost'' and ``fair value'' of board, lodging, \n     or other facilities having general application.\n\n Subpart B--Determinations of ``Reasonable Cost'' and ``Fair Value''; \n              Effects of Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\n     Sec. C531.3 General determinations of ``reasonable cost''\n\n       (a) The term ``reasonable cost'' as used in section 3(m) of \n     the Act is hereby determined to be not more than the actual \n     cost to the employer of the board, lodging, or other \n     facilities customarily furnished by him to his employees.\n       (b) Reasonable cost does not include a profit to the \n     employer or to any affiliated person.\n       (c) The reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing the \n     employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including \n     housing) is the cost of operation and maintenance including \n     adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance (not more \n     than 5\\1/2\\ percent) for interest on the depreciated amount \n     of capital invested by the employer: Provided, That if the \n     total so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the \n     fair price of the commodities or facilities offered for \n     sale), the fair rental value (or the fair price of the \n     commodities or facilities offered for sale) shall be the \n     reasonable cost. The cost of operation and maintenance, the \n     rate of depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital \n     invested by the employer shall be those arrived at under good \n     accounting practices. As used in this paragraph, the term \n     ``good accounting practices'' does not include accounting \n     practices which have been rejected by the Internal Revenue \n     Service for tax purposes, and the term ``depreciation'' \n     includes obsolescence.\n       (d)(1) The cost of furnishing ``facilities'' found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit or convenience \n     of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may \n     not therefore be included in computing wages.\n       (2) The following is a list of facilities found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit of convenience \n     of the employer. The list is intended to be illustrative \n     rather than exclusive: (i) Tools of the trade and other \n     materials and services incidental to carrying on the \n     employer's business; (ii) the cost of any construction by and \n     for the employer; (iii) the cost of uniforms and of their \n     laundering, where the nature of the business requires the \n     employee to wear a uniform.\n\n     Sec. C531.6 Effects of collective bargaining agreements\n\n       (a) The cost of board, lodging, or other facilities shall \n     not be included as part of the wage paid to any employee to \n     the extent it is excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona \n     fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to the \n     particular employee.\n       (b) A collective bargaining agreement shall be deemed to be \n     ``bona fide'' when pursuant to the provisions of section \n     7(b)(1) or 7(b)(2) of the FLSA it is made with the certified \n     representative of the employees under the provisions of the \n     CAA.\n\n PART C541--DEFINING AND DELIMITING THE TERMS ``BONA FIDE EXECUTIVE'', \n    ``ADMINISTRATIVE'', OR ``PROFESSIONAL'' CAPACITY (INCLUDING ANY \nEMPLOYEE EMPLOYED IN THE CAPACITY OF ACADEMIC ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL \n                    OR TEACHER IN SECONDARY SCHOOL)\n\n                     Subpart A--General Regulations\n\nSec.\nC541.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nC541.01 Application of the exemptions of section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA.\nC541.1 Executive.\nC541.2 Administrative.\nC541.3 Professional.\nC541.5b Equal pay provisions of section 6(d) of the FLSA as applied by \n              the CAA extend to executive, administrative, and \n              professional employees.\nC541.5d Special provisions applicable to employees of public agencies.\n\n                     Subpart A--General Regulations\n\n     Sec.

C541.1 Executive\n\n       The term ``employee employed in a bona fide executive * * * \n     capacity'' in section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA as applied by the \n     CAA shall mean any employee:\n       (a) Whose primary duty consists of the management of an \n     employing office in which he is employed or of a customarily \n     recognized department or subdivision thereof; and\n       (b) Who customarily and regularly directs the work of two \n     or more other employees therein; and\n       (c) Who has the authority to hire or fire other employees \n     or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring or \n     firing and as to the advancement and promotion or any other \n     change of status of other employees will be given particular \n     weight; and\n       (d) Who customarily and regularly exercises discretionary \n     powers; and\n       (e) Who does not devote more than 20 percent, or, in the \n     case of an employee of a retail or service establishment who \n     does not devote as much as 40 percent, of his hours of work \n     in the workweek to activities which are not directly and \n     closely related to the performance of the work described in \n     paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section: Provided, That \n     this paragraph shall not apply in the case of an employee who \n     is in sole charge of an independent establishment or a \n     physically separated branch establishment; and\n       (f) Who is compensated for his services on a salary basis \n     at a rate of not less than $155 per week, exclusive of board, \n     lodging or other facilities: Provided, That an employee who \n     is compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than \n     $250 per week, exclusive of board, lodging or other \n     facilities, and whose primary duty consists of the management \n     of the employing office in which the employee is employed or \n     of a customarily recognized department or subdivision \n     thereof, and includes the customary and regular direction of \n     the work of two or more other employees therein, shall be \n     deemed to meet all the requirements of this section.\n\n     Sec. C541.2 Administrative\n\n       The term ``employee employed in a bona fide * * * \n     administrative * * * capacity'' in section 13(a)(1) of the \n     FLSA as applied by the CAA shall mean any employee:\n       (a) Whose primary duty consists of either:\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\n       (1) The performance of office or nonmanual work directly \n     related to management policies or general operations of his \n     employer or his employer's customers, or\n       (2) The performance of functions in the administration of a \n     school system, or educational establishment or institution, \n     or of a department or subdivision thereof, in work directly \n     related to the academic instruction or training carried on \n     therein; and\n       (b) Who customarily and regularly exercises discretion and \n     independent judgment; and\n       (c)(1) Who regularly and directly assists the head of an \n     employing office, or an employee employed in a bona fide \n     executive or administrative capacity (as such terms are \n     defined in the regulations of this subpart), or\n       (2) Who performs under only general supervision work along \n     specialized or technical lines requiring special training, \n     experience, or knowledge, or\n       (3) Who executes under only general supervision special \n     assignments and tasks; and\n       (d) Who does not devote more than 20 percent, or, in the \n     case of an employee of a retail or service establishment who \n     does not devote as much as 40 percent, of his hours worked in \n     the workweek to activities which are not directly and closely \n     related to the performance of the work described in \n     paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section; and\n       (e)(1) Who is compensated for his services on a salary or \n     fee basis at a rate of not less than $155 per week, exclusive \n     of board, lodging or other facilities, or\n       (2) Who, in the case of academic administrative personnel, \n     is compensated for services as required by paragraph (e)(1) \n     of this section, or on a salary basis which is at least equal \n     to the entrance salary for teachers in the school system, \n     educational establishment or institution by which employed: \n     Provided, That an employee who is compensated on a salary or \n     fee basis at a rate of not less than $250 per week, exclusive \n     of board, lodging or other facilities, and whose primary duty \n     consists of the performance of work described in paragraph \n     (a) of this section, which includes work requiring the \n     exercise of discretion and independent judgment, shall be \n     deemed to meet all the requirements of this section.\n\n     Sec.

In determining the \n     total remuneration for employment which section 7(e) of the \n     FLSA requires to be included in the regular rate at which an \n     employee is employed, it is not necessary to include any sums \n     paid to or on behalf of such employee, in recognition of \n     services performed by him during a given period, which are \n     paid pursuant to a bona fide thrift or savings plan meeting \n     the requirements set forth herein. In the formulation of \n     these regulations due regard has been given to the factors \n     and standards set forth in section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act.\n       (b) Where a thrift or savings plan is combined in a single \n     program (whether in one or more documents) with a plan or \n     trust for providing old age, retirement, life, accident or \n     health insurance or similar benefits for employees, \n     contributions made by the employer pursuant to such thrift or \n     savings plan may be excluded from the regular rate if the \n     plan meets the requirements of the regulation in this part \n     and the contributions made for the other purposes may be \n     excluded from the regular rate if they meet the tests set \n     forth in regulations.\n\n     Sec.

Eligibility may not be based on such factors as \n     hours of work, production, or efficiency of the employees: \n     Provided, however, That hours of work may be used to \n     determine eligibility of part-time or casual employees.\n       (d) The amount any employee may save under the plan shall \n     be specified in the plan or determined in accordance with a \n     definite formula specified in the plan, which formula may be \n     based on one or more factors such as the straight-time \n     earnings or total earnings, base rate of pay, or length of \n     service of the employee.\n       (e) The employer's total contribution in any year may not \n     exceed 15 percent of the participating employees' total \n     earnings during that year. In addition, the employer's total \n     contribution in any year may not exceed the total amount \n     saved or invested by the participating employees during that \n     year.\n       (f) The employer's contributions shall be apportioned among \n     the individual employees in accordance with a definite \n     formula or method of calculation specified in the plan, which \n     formula or method of calculation is based on the amount saved \n     or the length of time the individual employee retains his \n     savings or investment in the plan: Provided, That no \n     employee's share determined in accordance with the plan may \n     be diminished because of any other remuneration received by \n     him.\n\n     Sec. C547.2 Disqualifying provisions\n\n       (a) No employee's participation in the plan shall be on \n     other than a voluntary basis.\n       (b) No employee's wages or salary shall be dependent upon \n     or influenced by the existence of such thrift or savings plan \n     or the employer's contributions thereto.\n       (c) The amounts any employee may save under the plan, or \n     the amounts paid by the employer under the plan may not be \n     based upon the employee's hours of work, production or \n     efficiency.\n\n   PART C553--OVERTIME COMPENSATION: PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYEES \n     ENGAGED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE PROTECTION; OVERTIME AND \n   COMPENSATORY TIME-OFF FOR EMPLOYEES WHOSE WORK SCHEDULE DIRECTLY \n                 DEPENDS UPON THE SCHEDULE OF THE HOUSE\n\n                              introduction\n\nSec.\nC553.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nC553.1 Definitions.\nC553.2 Purpose and scope.\n\n Subpart C--Partial Exemption for Employees Engaged in Law Enforcement \n                          and Fire Protection\n\nC553.201 Statutory provisions: section 7(k).\nC553.202 Limitations.\nC553.211 Law enforcement activities.\nC553.212 Twenty percent limitation on nonexempt work.\nC553.213 Public agency employees engaged in both fire protection and \n              law enforcement activities.\nC553.214 Trainees.\nC553.215 Ambulance and rescue service employees.\nC553.216 Other exemptions.\nC553.220 ``Tour of duty'' defined.\nC553.221 Compensable hours of work.\nC553.222 Sleep time.\nC553.223 Meal time.\nC553.224 ``Work period'' defined.\nC553.225 Early relief.\nC553.226 Training time.\nC553.227 Outside employment.\nC553.230 Maximum hours standards for work periods of 7 to 28 days--\n              section 7(k).\nC553.231 Compensatory time off.\nC553.232 Overtime pay requirements.\nC553.233 ``Regular rate'' defined.\n\nSubpart D--Compensatory Time-off for Overtime Earned by Employees Whose \n     Work Schedule Directly Depends Upon the Schedule of the House\n\nC553.301 Definition of ``directly depends''.\nC553.302 Overtime compensation and compensatory time off for an \n              employee whose work schedule directly depends upon the \n              schedule of the House.\nC553.303 Using compensatory time off.\nC553.304 Payment of overtime compensation for accrued compensatory time \n              off as of termination of service.\n\n                              introduction\n\n     Sec.

C553.1 Definitions\n\n       (a) ``Act'' or ``FLSA'' means the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938, as amended (52 Stat. 1060, as amended; 29 U.S.C. \n     201-219), as applied by the CAA.\n       (b) ``1985 Amendments'' means the Fair Labor Standards \n     Amendments of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-150).\n       (c) ``Public agency'' means an employing office as the term \n     is defined in Sec. 501.102 of this chapter, including the \n     Capitol Police.\n       (d) Section 7(k) means the provisions of Sec. 7(k) of the \n     FLSA as applied to covered employees and employing offices by \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. C553.2 Purpose and scope\n\n       The purpose of part C553 is to adopt with appropriate \n     modifications the regulations of the Secretary of Labor to \n     carry out those provisions of the FLSA relating to public \n     agency employees as they are applied to covered employees and \n     employing offices of the CAA. In particular, these \n     regulations apply section 7(k) as it relates to fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees of public agencies.\n\n Subpart C--Partial Exemption for Employees Engaged in Law Enforcement \n                          and Fire Protection\n\n     Sec. C553.201 Statutory provisions: section 7(k).\n\n       Section 7(k) of the Act provides a partial overtime pay \n     exemption for fire protection and law enforcement personnel \n     (including security personnel in correctional institutions) \n     who are employed by public agencies on a work period basis. \n     This section of the Act formerly permitted public agencies to \n     pay overtime compensation to such employees in work periods \n     of 28 consecutive days only after 216 hours of work. As \n     further set forth in Sec. C553.230 of this part, the 216-hour \n     standard has been replaced, pursuant to the study mandated by \n     the statute, by 212 hours for fire protection employees and \n     171 hours for law enforcement employees. In the case of such \n     employees who have a work period of at least 7 but less than \n     28 consecutive days, overtime compensation is required when \n     the ratio of the number of hours worked to the number of days \n     in the work period exceeds the ratio of 212 (or 171) hours to \n     28 days.\n\n     Sec. C553.202 Limitations\n\n       The application of Sec. 7(k), by its terms, is limited to \n     public agencies, and does not apply to any private \n     organization engaged in furnishing fire protection or law \n     enforcement services. This is so even if the services are \n     provided under contract with a public agency.\n\n                         exemption requirements\n\n     Sec. C553.211 Law enforcement activities\n\n       (a) As used in Sec. 7(k) of the Act, the term ``any \n     employee . . . in law enforcement activities'' refers to any \n     employee (1) who is a uniformed or plainclothed member of a \n     body of officers and subordinates who are empowered by law to \n     enforce laws designed to maintain public peace and order and \n     to protect both life and property from accidental or willful \n     injury, and to prevent and detect crimes, (2) who has the \n     power to arrest, and (3) who is presently undergoing or has \n     undergone or will undergo on-the-job training and/or a course \n     of instruction and study which typically includes physical \n     training, self-defense, firearm proficiency, criminal and \n     civil law principles, investigative and law enforcement \n     techniques, community relations, medical aid and ethics.\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\n       (b) Employees who meet these tests are considered to be \n     engaged in law enforcement activities regardless of their \n     rank, or of their status as ``trainee'', ``probationary'', or \n     ``permanent'', and regardless of their assignment to duties \n     incidental to the performance of their law enforcement \n     activities such as equipment maintenance, and lecturing, or \n     to support activities of the type described in paragraph (g) \n     of this section, whether or not such assignment is for \n     training or familiarization purposes, or for reasons of \n     illness, injury or infirmity. The term would also include \n     rescue and ambulance service personnel if such personnel form \n     an integral part of the public agency's law enforcement \n     activities. See section C553.215.\n       (c) Typically, employees engaged in law enforcement \n     activities include police who are regularly employed and paid \n     as such. Other agency employees with duties not specifically \n     mentioned may, depending upon the particular facts and \n     pertinent statutory provisions in that jurisdiction, meet the \n     three tests described above. If so, they will also qualify as \n     law enforcement officers. Such employees might include, for \n     example, any law enforcement employee within the legislative \n     branch concerned with keeping public peace and order and \n     protecting life and property.\n       (d) Employees who do not meet each of the three tests \n     described above are not engaged in (law enforcement \n     activities' as that term is used in section 7(k). Employees \n     who normally would not meet each of these tests include:\n       (1) Building inspectors (other than those defined in \n     section C553.213(a)),\n       (2) Health inspectors,\n       (3) Sanitarians,\n       (4) Civilian traffic employees who direct vehicular and \n     pedestrian traffic at specified intersections or other \n     control points,\n       (5) Civilian parking checkers who patrol assigned areas for \n     the purpose of discovering parking violations and issuing \n     appropriate warnings or appearance notices,\n       (6) Wage and hour compliance officers,\n       (7) Equal employment opportunity compliance officers, and\n       (8) Building guards whose primary duty is to protect the \n     lives and property of persons within the limited area of the \n     building.\n       (e) The term ``any employee in law enforcement activities'' \n     also includes, by express reference, ``security personnel in \n     correctional institutions''. Typically, such facilities may \n     include precinct house lockups. Employees of correctional \n     institutions who qualify as security personnel for purposes \n     of the section 7(k) exemption are those who have \n     responsibility for controlling and maintaining custody of \n     inmates and of safeguarding them from other inmates or for \n     supervising such functions, regardless of whether their \n     duties are performed inside the correctional institution or \n     outside the institution. These employees are considered to be \n     engaged in law enforcement activities regardless of their \n     rank or of their status as ``trainee'', ``probationary'', or \n     ``permanent'', and regardless of their assignment to duties \n     incidental to the performance of their law enforcement \n     activities, or to support activities of the type described in \n     paragraph (f) of this section, whether or not such assignment \n     is for training or familiarization purposes or for reasons of \n     illness, injury or infirmity.\n       (f) Not included in the term ``employee in law enforcement \n     activities'' are the so-called ``civilian'' employees of law \n     enforcement agencies or correctional institutions who engage \n     in such support activities as those performed by dispatcher, \n     radio operators, apparatus and equipment maintenance and \n     repair workers, janitors, clerks and stenographers. Nor does \n     the term include employees in correctional institutions who \n     engage in building repair and maintenance, culinary services, \n     teaching, or in psychological, medical and paramedical \n     services. This is so even though such employees may, when \n     assigned to correctional institutions, come into regular \n     contact with the inmates in the performance of their duties.\n\n     Sec. C553.212 Twenty percent limitation on nonexempt work\n\n       (a) Employees engaged in fire protection or law enforcement \n     activities as described in sections C553.210 and C553.211, \n     may also engage in some nonexempt work which is not performed \n     as an incident to or in conjunction with their fire \n     protection or law enforcement activities. For example, \n     firefighters who work for forest conservation agencies may, \n     during slack times, plant trees and perform other \n     conservation activities unrelated to their firefighting \n     duties. The performance of such nonexempt work will not \n     defeat the Sec. 7(k) exemption unless it exceeds 20 percent \n     of the total hours worked by that employee during the \n     workweek or applicable work period. A person who spends more \n     than 20 percent of his/her working time in nonexempt \n     activities is not considered to be an employee engaged in \n     fire protection or law enforcement activities for purposes of \n     this part.\n       (b) Public agency fire protection and law enforcement \n     personnel may, at their own option, undertake employment for \n     the same employer on an occasional or sporadic and part-time \n     basis in a different capacity from their regular employment. \n     The performance of such work does not affect the application \n     of the Sec. 7(k) exemption with respect to the regular \n     employment. In addition, the hours of work in the different \n     capacity need not be counted as hours worked for overtime \n     purposes on the regular job, nor are such hours counted in \n     determining the 20 percent tolerance for nonexempt work \n     discussed in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n     Sec. C553.213  Public agency employees engaged in both fire \n       protection and law enforcement activities\n\n       (a) Some public agencies have employees (often called \n     ``public safety officers'') who engage in both fire \n     protection and law enforcement activities, depending on the \n     agency needs at the time. This dual assignment would not \n     defeat the section 7(k) exemption, provided that each of the \n     activities performed meets the appropriate tests set forth in \n     sections C553.210 and C553.211. This is so regardless of how \n     the employee's time is divided between the two activities. \n     However, all time spent in nonexempt activities by public \n     safety officers within the work period, whether performed in \n     connection with fire protection or law enforcement functions, \n     or with neither, must be combined for purposes of the 20 \n     percent limitation on nonexempt work discussed in section \n     C553.212.\n       (b) As specified in section C553.230, the maximum hours \n     standards under section 7(k) are different for employees \n     engaged in fire protection and for employees engaged in law \n     enforcement. For those employees who perform both fire \n     protection and law enforcement activities, the applicable \n     standard is the one which applies to the activity in which \n     the employee spends the majority of work time during the work \n     period.\n\n     Sec. C553.214  Trainees\n\n       The attendance at a bona fide fire or police academy or \n     other training facility, when required by the employing \n     agency, constitutes engagement in activities under section \n     7(k) only when the employee meets all the applicable tests \n     described in section C553.210 or section C553.211 (except for \n     the power of arrest for law enforcement personnel), as the \n     case may be. If the applicable tests are met, then basic \n     training or advanced training is considered incidental to, \n     and part of, the employee's fire protection or law \n     enforcement activities.\n\n     Sec. C553.215  Ambulance and rescue service employees\n\n       Ambulance and rescue service employees of a public agency \n     other than a fire protection or law enforcement agency may be \n     treated as employees engaged in fire protection or law \n     enforcement activities of the type contemplated by Sec. 7(k) \n     if their services are substantially related to firefighting \n     or law enforcement activities in that (1) the ambulance and \n     rescue service employees have received training in the rescue \n     of fire, crime, and accident victims or firefighters or law \n     enforcement personnel injured in the performance of their \n     respective duties, and (2) the ambulance and rescue service \n     employees are regularly dispatched to fires, crime scenes, \n     riots, natural disasters and accidents. As provided in \n     section C553.213(b), where employees perform both fire \n     protection and law enforcement activities, the applicable \n     standard is the one which applies to the activity in which \n     the employee spends the majority of work time during the work \n     period.\n\n     Sec. C553.216  Other exemptions\n\n       Although the 1974 Amendments to the FLSA as applied by the \n     CAA provide special exemptions for employees of public \n     agencies engaged in fire protection and law enforcement \n     activities, such workers may also be subject to other \n     exemptions in the Act, and public agencies may claim such \n     other applicable exemptions in lieu of Sec. 7(k). For \n     example, section 13(a)(1) as applied by the CAA provides a \n     complete minimum wage and overtime pay exemption for any \n     employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, \n     or professional capacity, as those terms are defined and \n     delimited in part C541. The section 13(a)(1) exemption can be \n     claimed for any fire protection or law enforcement employee \n     who meets all of the tests specified in part C541 relating to \n     duties, responsibilities, and salary. Thus, high ranking \n     police officials who are engaged in law enforcement \n     activities, may also, depending on the facts, qualify for the \n     section 13(a)(1) exemption as ``executive'' employees. \n     Similarly, certain criminal investigative agents may qualify \n     as ``administrative'' employees under section 13(a)(1).\n\n            tour of duty and compensable hours of work rules\n\n     Sec. C553.220  ``Tour of duty'' defined\n\n       (a) The term ``tour of duty'' is a unique concept \n     applicable only to employees for whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed. This term, as used in section 7(k), \n     means the period of time during which an employee is \n     considered to be on duty for purposes of determining \n     compensable hours. It may be a scheduled or unscheduled \n     period. Such periods include ``shifts'' assigned to employees \n     often days in advance of the performance of the work. \n     Scheduled periods also include time spent in work outside the \n     ``shift'' which the public agency employer assigns. For \n     example, a police officer may be assigned to crowd control \n     during a parade or other special event outside of his or her \n     shift.\n       (b) Unscheduled periods include time spent in court by \n     police officers, time spent handling emergency situations, \n     and time spent working after a shift to complete an \n     assignment. Such time must be included in the compensable \n     tour of duty even though the specific work performed may not \n     have been assigned in advance.\n       (c) The tour of duty does not include time spent working \n     for a separate and independent employer in certain types of \n     special details as provided in section C553.227.\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\n     Sec. C553.221  Compensable hours of work\n\n       (a) The rules under the FLSA as applied by the CAA on \n     compensable hours of work are applicable to employees for \n     whom the section 7(k) exemption is claimed. Special rules for \n     sleep time (section C553.222) apply to both law enforcement \n     and firefighting employees for whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed. Also, special rules for meal time apply \n     in the case of firefighters (section C553.223).\n       (b) Compensable hours of work generally include all of the \n     time during which an employee is on duty on the employer's \n     premises or at a prescribed workplace, as well as all other \n     time during which the employee is suffered or permitted to \n     work for the employer. Such time includes all pre-shift and \n     post-shift activities which are an integral part of the \n     employee's principal activity or which are closely related to \n     the performance of the principal activity, such as attending \n     roll call, writing up and completing tickets or reports, and \n     washing and re-racking fire hoses.\n       (c) Time spent away from the employer's premises under \n     conditions that are so circumscribed that they restrict the \n     employee from effectively using the time for personal \n     pursuits also constitutes compensable hours of work. For \n     example, where a police station must be evacuated because of \n     an electrical failure and the employees are expected to \n     remain in the vicinity and return to work after the emergency \n     has passed, the entire time spent away from the premises is \n     compensable. The employees in this example cannot use the \n     time for their personal pursuits.\n       (d) An employee who is not required to remain on the \n     employer's premises but is merely required to leave word at \n     home or with company officials where he or she may be reached \n     is not working while on call. Time spent at home on call may \n     or may not be compensable depending on whether the \n     restrictions placed on the employee preclude using the time \n     for personal pursuits. Where, for example, a firefighter has \n     returned home after the shift, with the understanding that he \n     or she is expected to return to work in the event of an \n     emergency in the night, such time spent at home is normally \n     not compensable. On the other hand, where the conditions \n     placed on the employee's activities are so restrictive that \n     the employee cannot use the time effectively for personal \n     pursuits, such time spent on call is compensable.\n       (e) Normal home to work travel is not compensable, even \n     where the employee is expected to report to work at a \n     location away from the location of the employer's premises.\n       (f) A police officer, who has completed his or her tour of \n     duty and who is given a patrol car to drive home and use on \n     personal business, is not working during the travel time even \n     where the radio must be left on so that the officer can \n     respond to emergency calls. Of course, the time spent in \n     responding to such calls is compensable.\n\n     Sec. C553.222 Sleep time\n\n       (a) Where a public agency elects to pay overtime \n     compensation to firefighters and/or law enforcement personnel \n     in accordance with section 7(a)(1) of the Act, the public \n     agency may exclude sleep time from hours worked if all the \n     conditions for the exclusion of such time are met.\n       (b) Where the employer has elected to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption, sleep time cannot be excluded from the compensable \n     hours of work where--\n       (1) the employee is on a tour of duty of less than 24 \n     hours, and\n       (2) the employee is on a tour of duty of exactly 24 hours.\n       (c) Sleep time can be excluded from compensable hours of \n     work, however, in the case of police officers or firefighters \n     who are on a tour of duty of more than 24 hours, but only if \n     there is an expressed or implied agreement between the \n     employer and the employees to exclude such time. In the \n     absence of such an agreement, the sleep time is compensable. \n     In no event shall the time excluded as sleep time exceed 8 \n     hours in a 24-hour period. If the sleep time is interrupted \n     by a call to duty, the interruption must be counted as hours \n     worked. If the sleep period is interrupted to such an extent \n     that the employee cannot get a reasonable night's sleep \n     (which, for enforcement purposes means at least 5 hours), the \n     entire time must be counted as hours of work.\n\n     Sec. C553.223 Meal time\n\n       (a) If a public agency elects to pay overtime compensation \n     to firefighters and law enforcement personnel in accordance \n     with section 7(a)(1) of the Act, the public agency may \n     exclude meal time from hours worked if all the statutory \n     tests for the exclusion of such time are met.\n       (b) If a public agency elects to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption, the public agency may, in the case of law \n     enforcement personnel, exclude meal time from hours worked on \n     tours of duty of 24 hours or less: Provided, That the \n     employee is completely relieved from duty during the meal \n     period, and all the other statutory tests for the exclusion \n     of such time are met. On the other hand, where law \n     enforcement personnel are required to remain on call in \n     barracks or similar quarters, or are engaged in extended \n     surveillance activities (e.g., stakeouts), they are not \n     considered to be completely relieved from duty, and any such \n     meal periods would be compensable.\n       (c) With respect to firefighters employed under section \n     7(k), who are confined to a duty station, the legislative \n     history of the Act indicates congressional intent to mandate \n     a departure from the usual FLSA ``hours of work'' rules and \n     adoption of an overtime standard keyed to the unique concept \n     of ``tour of duty'' under which firefighters are employed. \n     Where the public agency elects to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption for firefighters, meal time cannot be excluded from \n     the compensable hours of work where (1) the firefighter is on \n     a tour of duty of less than 24 hours, and (2) where the \n     firefighter is on a tour of duty of exactly 24 hours.\n       (d) In the case of police officers or firefighters who are \n     on a tour of duty of more than 24 hours, meal time may be \n     excluded from compensable hours of work provided that the \n     statutory tests for exclusion of such hours are met.\n\n     Sec. C553.224 ``Work period'' defined\n\n       (a) As used in section 7(k), the term ``work period'' \n     refers to any established and regularly recurring period of \n     work which, under the terms of the Act and legislative \n     history, cannot be less than 7 consecutive days nor more than \n     28 consecutive days. Except for this limitation, the work \n     period can be of any length, and it need not coincide with \n     the duty cycle or pay period or with a particular day of the \n     week or hour of the day. Once the beginning and ending time \n     of an employee's work period is established, however, it \n     remains fixed regardless of how many hours are worked within \n     the period. The beginning and ending of the work period may \n     be changed: Provided, That the change is intended to be \n     permanent and is not designed to evade the overtime \n     compensation requirements of the Act.\n       (b) An employer may have one work period applicable to all \n     employees, or different work periods for different employees \n     or groups of employees.\n\n     Sec. C553.225 Early relief\n\n       It is a common practice among employees engaged in fire \n     protection activities to relieve employees on the previous \n     shift prior to the scheduled starting time. Such early relief \n     time may occur pursuant to employee agreement, either \n     expressed or implied. This practice will not have the effect \n     of increasing the number of compensable hours of work for \n     employees employed under section 7(k) where it is voluntary \n     on the part of the employees and does not result, over a \n     period of time, in their failure to receive proper \n     compensation for all hours actually worked. On the other \n     hand, if the practice is required by the employer, the time \n     involved must be added to the employee's tour of duty and \n     treated as compensable hours of work.\n\n     Sec. C553.226 Training time\n\n       (a) The general rules for determining the compensability of \n     training time under the FLSA apply to employees engaged in \n     law enforcement or fire protection activities.\n       (b) While time spent in attending training required by an \n     employer is normally considered compensable hours of work, \n     following are situations where time spent by employees in \n     required training is considered to be noncompensable:\n       (1) Attendance outside of regular working hours at \n     specialized or follow-up training, which is required by law \n     for certification of public and private sector employees \n     within a particular governmental jurisdiction (e.g., \n     certification of public and private emergency rescue \n     workers), does not constitute compensable hours of work for \n     public employees within that jurisdiction and subordinate \n     jurisdictions.\n       (2) Attendance outside of regular working hours at \n     specialized or follow-up training, which is required for \n     certification of employees of a governmental jurisdiction by \n     law of a higher level of government, does not constitute \n     compensable hours of work.\n       (3) Time spent in the training described in paragraphs (b) \n     (1) or (2) of this section is not compensable, even if all or \n     part of the costs of the training is borne by the employer.\n       (c) Police officers or firefighters, who are in attendance \n     at a police or fire academy or other training facility, are \n     not considered to be on duty during those times when they are \n     not in class or at a training session, if they are free to \n     use such time for personal pursuits. Such free time is not \n     compensable.\n\n     Sec. C553.227 Outside employment\n\n       (a) Section 7(p)(1) makes special provision for fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees of public agencies \n     who, at their own option, perform special duty work in fire \n     protection, law enforcement or related activities for a \n     separate and independent employer (public or private) during \n     their off-duty hours. The hours of work for the separate and \n     independent employer are not combined with the hours worked \n     for the primary public agency employer for purposes of \n     overtime compensation.\n       (b) Section 7(p)(1) applies to such outside employment \n     provided (1) the special detail work is performed solely at \n     the employee's option, and (2) the two employers are in fact \n     separate and independent.\n       (c) Whether two employers are, in fact, separate and \n     independent can only be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n       (d) The primary employer may facilitate the employment or \n     affect the conditions of employment of such employees. For \n     example, a police department may maintain a roster of \n     officers who wish to perform such work. The department may \n     also select the officers for special details from a list of \n     those wishing to participate, negotiate their pay, and retain \n     a fee for administrative expenses. The department may require \n     that the\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\n     separate and independent employer pay the fee for such \n     services directly to the department, and establish procedures \n     for the officers to receive their pay for the special details \n     through the agency's payroll system. Finally, the department \n     may require that the officers observe their normal standards \n     of conduct during such details and take disciplinary action \n     against those who fail to do so.\n       (e) Section 7(p)(1) applies to special details even where a \n     State law or local ordinance requires that such work be \n     performed and that only law enforcement or fire protection \n     employees of a public agency in the same jurisdiction perform \n     the work. For example, a city ordinance may require the \n     presence of city police officers at a convention center \n     during concerts or sports events. If the officers perform \n     such work at their own option, the hours of work need not be \n     combined with the hours of work for their primary employer in \n     computing overtime compensation.\n       (f) The principles in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this \n     section with respect to special details of public agency fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees under section \n     7(p)(1) are exceptions to the usual rules on joint employment \n     set forth in part 791 of this title.\n       (g) Where an employee is directed by the public agency to \n     perform work for a second employer, section 7(p)(1) does not \n     apply. Thus, assignments of police officers outside of their \n     normal work hours to perform crowd control at a parade, where \n     the assignments are not solely at the option of the officers, \n     would not qualify as special details subject to this \n     exception. This would be true even if the parade organizers \n     reimburse the public agency for providing such services.\n       (h) Section 7(p)(1) does not prevent a public agency from \n     prohibiting or restricting outside employment by its \n     employees.\n\n                      overtime compensation rules\n\n     Sec. C553.230 Maximum hours standards for work periods of 7 \n       to 28 days--section 7(k)\n\n       (a) For those employees engaged in fire protection \n     activities who have a work period of at least 7 but less than \n     28 consecutive days, no overtime compensation is required \n     under section 7(k) until the number of hours worked exceeds \n     the number of hours which bears the same relationship to 212 \n     as the number of days in the work period bears to 28.\n       (b) For those employees engaged in law enforcement \n     activities (including security personnel in correctional \n     institutions) who have a work period of at least 7 but less \n     than 28 consecutive days, no overtime compensation is \n     required under section 7(k) until the number of hours worked \n     exceeds the number of hours which bears the same relationship \n     to 171 as the number of days in the work period bears to 28.\n       (c) The ratio of 212 hours to 28 days for employees engaged \n     in fire protection activities is 7.57 hours per day (rounded) \n     and the ratio of 171 hours to 28 days for employees engaged \n     in law enforcement activities is 6.11 hours per day \n     (rounded). Accordingly, overtime compensation (in premium pay \n     or compensatory time) is required for all hours worked in \n     excess of the following maximum hours standards (rounded to \n     the nearest whole hour):\n\n                         MAXIMUM HOURS STANDARDS                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Fire         Law    \n              Work period (days)                 protection  enforcement\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n28............................................          212          171\n27............................................          204          165\n26............................................          197          159\n25............................................          189          153\n24............................................          182          147\n23............................................          174          141\n22............................................          167          134\n21............................................          159          128\n20............................................          151          122\n19............................................          144          116\n18............................................          136          110\n17............................................          129          104\n16............................................          121           98\n15............................................          114           92\n14............................................          106           86\n13............................................           98           79\n12............................................           91           73\n11............................................           83           67\n10............................................           76           61\n9.............................................           68           55\n8.............................................           61           49\n7.............................................           53           43\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Sec. C553.231 Compensatory time off\n\n       (a) Law enforcement and fire protection employees who are \n     subject to the section 7(k) exemption may receive \n     compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay for hours \n     worked in excess of the maximum for their work period as set \n     forth in section C553.230.\n       (b) Section 7(k) permits public agencies to balance the \n     hours of work over an entire work period for law enforcement \n     and fire protection employees. For example, if a \n     firefighter's work period is 28 consecutive days, and he or \n     she works 80 hours in each of the first two weeks, but only \n     52 hours in the third week, and does not work in the fourth \n     week, no overtime compensation (in cash wages or compensatory \n     time) would be required since the total hours worked do not \n     exceed 212 for the work period. If the same firefighter had a \n     work period of only 14 days, overtime compensation or \n     compensatory time off would be due for 54 hours (160 minus \n     106 hours) in the first 14 day work period.\n\n     Sec. C553.232 Overtime pay requirements\n\n       If a public agency pays employees subject to section 7(k) \n     for overtime hours worked in cash wages rather than \n     compensatory time off, such wages must be paid at one and \n     one-half times the employees' regular rates of pay.\n\n     Sec. C553.233 ``Regular rate'' defined\n\n       The statutory rules for computing an employee's ``regular \n     rate'', for purposes of the Act's overtime pay requirements \n     are applicable to employees or whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed when overtime compensation is provided \n     in cash wages.\n\nSubpart D--Compensatory Time-off for Overtime Earned by Employees Whose \n Work Schedule Directly Depends Upon the Schedule of the House and the \n                                 Senate\n\n     Sec. C553.301 Definition of ``directly depends''\n\n       For the purposes of this Part, a covered employee's work \n     schedule ``directly depends'' on the schedule of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate only if the eligible employee \n     performs work that directly supports the conduct of \n     legislative or other business in the chamber and works hours \n     that regularly change in response to the schedule of the \n     House and the Senate.\n\n     Sec. C553.302 Overtime compensation and compensatory time off \n       for an employee whose work schedule directly depends upon \n       the schedule of the House and Senate\n\n       No employing office shall be deemed to have violated \n     section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, which applies the protections \n     of section 7(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (``FLSA'') to \n     covered employees and employing office, by employing any \n     employee for a workweek in excess of the maximum workweek \n     applicable to such employee under section 7(a) of the FLSA \n     where the employee's work schedule directly depends on the \n     schedule of the House of Representatives or the Senate within \n     the meaning of Sec. C553.301, and: (a) the employee is \n     compensated at the rate of time-and-a-half in pay for all \n     hours in excess of 40 and up to 60 hours in a workweek, and \n     (b) the employee is compensated at the rate of time-and-a-\n     half in either pay or in time off for all hours in excess of \n     60 hours in a workweek.\n\n     Sec. C553.303 Using compensatory time off\n\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time off under \n     Sec. C553.302 upon his or her request, shall be permitted by \n     the employing office to use such time within a reasonable \n     period after making the request, unless the employing office \n     makes a bona fide determination that the needs of the \n     operations of the office do not allow the taking of \n     compensatory time off at the time of the request. An employee \n     may renew the request at a subsequent time. An employing \n     office may also, upon reasonable notice, require an employee \n     to use accrued compensatory time-off.\n\n     Sec. C553.304 Payment of overtime compensation for accrued \n       compensatory time off as of termination of service\n\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time authorized by \n     this regulation shall, upon termination of employment, be \n     paid for the unused compensatory time at the rate earned by \n     the employee at the time the employee receives such payment.\n\n                   PART C570--CHILD LABOR REGULATIONS\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\nSec.\nC570.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nC570.1 Definitions.\nC570.2 Minimum age standards.\n\n                          Subpart B [Reserved]\n\n Subpart C--Employment of Minors Between 14 and 16 Years of Age (Child \n                             Labor Reg. 3)\n\nC570.31 Determination.\nC570.32 Effect of this subpart.\nC570.33 Occupations.\nC570.35 Periods and conditions of employment.\n\n                          Subpart D [Reserved]\n\n  Subpart E--Occupations Particularly Hazardous for the Employment of \nMinors Between 16 and 18 Years of Age or Detrimental to Their Health or \n                               Well-being\n\nC570.50 General.\nC570.51 Occupations in or about plants or establishments manufacturing \n              or storing explosives or articles containing explosive \n              components (Order 1).\nC570.52 Occupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper (Order \n              2).\nC570.55 Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven \n              woodworking machines (Order 5).\nC570.58 Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven hoisting \n              apparatus (Order 7).\nC570.59 Occupations involved in the operations of power-driven metal \n              forming, punching, and shearing machines (Order 8).\nC570.62 Occupations involved in the operation of bakery machines (Order \n              11).\nC570.63 Occupations involved in the operation of paper-products \n              machines (Order 12).\nC570.65 Occupations involved in the operations of circular saws, band \n              saws, and guillotine shears (Order 14).\nC570.66 Occupations involved in wrecking and demolition operations \n              (Order 15).\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\nC570.67 Occupations in roofing operations (Order 16).\nC570.68 Occupations in excavation operations (Order 17).\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n     Sec.

Section 204(a) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1314(a) provides that no employing office may require \n     any covered employee (including a covered employee who does \n     not work in that employing office) to take a lie detector \n     test where such test would be prohibited if required by an \n     employer under paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of section 3 of the \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (EPPA), 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2002 (1), (2) or (3). The purpose of this Part is to set \n     forth the regulations to carry out the provisions of section \n     204 of the CAA.\n       Subpart A contains the provisions generally applicable to \n     covered employers, including the requirements relating to the \n     prohibitions on lie detector use. Subpart B sets forth rules \n     regarding the statutory exemptions from application of \n     section 204 of the CAA. Subpart C sets forth the restrictions \n     on polygraph usage under such exemptions. Subpart D sets \n     forth the rules on recordkeeping and the disclosure of \n     polygraph test information.\n\n     SEC. 1.2  DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this part:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) EPPA means the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of \n     1988 (Pub. L. 100-347, 102 Stat. 646, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 2001-2009) as applied to covered employees and \n     employing offices by section 204 of the CAA.\n       (c) The term covered employee means any employee of (1) the \n     House of Representatives; (2) the Senate; (3) the Capitol \n     Guide Service; (4) the Congressional Budget Office; (5) the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (6) the Office of the \n     Attending Physician; (7) the Office of Compliance; or (8) the \n     Office of Technology Assessment.\n       (d) The term employee includes an applicant for employment \n     and a former employee.\n       (e) The term employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol includes any employee of the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol, the Botanic Gardens, or the Senate \n     Restaurants.\n       (f) The term employee of the Capitol Police includes any \n     member or officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (g) The term employee of the House of Representatives \n     includes an individual occupying a position the pay for which \n     is disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     another official designated by the House of Representatives, \n     or any employment position in an entity that is paid with \n     funds derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by any \n     entity listed in subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph \n     (c) above.\n       (h) The term employee of the Senate includes any employee \n     whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but \n     not any such individual employed by any entity listed in \n     subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph (c) above.\n       (i) The term employing office means (1) the personal office \n     of a Member of the House of Representatives or of a Senator; \n     (2) a committee of the House of Representatives or the Senate \n     or a joint committee; (3) any other office headed by a person \n     with the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set \n     the terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the House of Representatives or the Senate; or \n     (4) the Capitol Guide Board, the Congressional Budget Office, \n     the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the Office of the \n     Attending Physician, the Office of Compliance, and the Office \n     of Technology Assessment. The term employing office includes \n     any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of \n     an employing office in relation to an employee or prospective \n     employee. A polygraph examiner either employed for or whose \n     services are retained for the sole purpose of administering \n     polygraph tests ordinarily would not be deemed an employing \n     office with respect\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\n     to the examinees. Any reference to ``employer'' in these \n     regulations includes employing offices.\n       (j)(1) The term lie detector means a polygraph, \n     deceptograph, voice stress analyzer, psychological stress \n     evaluator, or any other similar device (whether mechanical or \n     electrical) that is used, or the results of which are used, \n     for the purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding \n     the honesty or dishonesty of an individual. Voice stress \n     analyzers, or psychological stress evaluators, include any \n     systems that utilize voice stress analysis, whether or not an \n     opinion on honesty or dishonesty is specifically rendered.\n       (2) The term lie detector does not include medical tests \n     used to determine the presence or absence of controlled \n     substances or alcohol in bodily fluids. Also not included in \n     the definition of lie detector are written or oral tests \n     commonly referred to as ``honesty'' or ``paper and pencil'' \n     tests, machine-scored or otherwise; and graphology tests \n     commonly referred to as handwriting tests.\n       (k) The term polygraph means an instrument that--\n       (1) records continuously, visually, permanently, and \n     simultaneously changes in cardiovascular, respiratory, and \n     electrodermal patterns as minimum instrumentation standards; \n     and\n       (2) is used, or the results of which are used, for the \n     purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding the \n     honesty or dishonesty of an individual.\n       (l) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (m) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n\n     SEC. 1.3 COVERAGE.\n\n       The coverage of section 204 of the Act extends to any \n     ``covered employee'' or ``covered employing office'' without \n     regard to the number of employees or the employing office's \n     effect on interstate commerce.\n\n     SEC. 1.4 PROHIBITIONS ON LIE DETECTOR USE.\n\n       (a) Section 204 of the CAA provides that, subject to the \n     exemptions of the EPPA incorporated into the CAA under \n     section 225(f) of the CAA, as set forth in section 1.10 \n     through 1.12 of this Part, employing offices are prohibited \n     from:\n       (1) Requiring, requesting, suggesting or causing, directly \n     or indirectly, any covered employee or prospective employee \n     to take or submit to a lie detector test;\n       (2) Using, accepting, or inquiring about the results of a \n     lie detector test of any covered employee or prospective \n     employee; and\n       (3) Discharging, disciplining, discriminating against, \n     denying employment or promotion, or threatening any covered \n     employee or prospective employee to take such action for \n     refusal or failure to take or submit to such test, or on the \n     basis of the results of a test.\n       The above prohibitions apply irrespective of whether the \n     covered employee referred to in paragraphs (1), (2) or (3), \n     above, works in that employing office.\n       (b) An employing office that reports a theft or other \n     incident involving economic loss to police or other law \n     enforcement authorities is not engaged in conduct subject to \n     the prohibitions under paragraph (a) of this section if, \n     during the normal course of a subsequent investigation, such \n     authorities deem it necessary to administer a polygraph test \n     to a covered employee(s) suspected of involvement in the \n     reported incident. Employing offices that cooperate with \n     police authorities during the course of their investigations \n     into criminal misconduct are likewise not deemed engaged in \n     prohibitive conduct: Provided, That such cooperation is \n     passive in nature. For example, it is not uncommon for police \n     authorities to request employees suspected of theft or \n     criminal activity to submit to a polygraph test during the \n     employee's tour of duty since, as a general rule, suspect \n     employees are often difficult to locate away from their place \n     of employment. Allowing a test on the employing office's \n     premises, releasing a covered employee during working hours \n     to take a test at police headquarters, and other similar \n     types of cooperation at the request of the police authorities \n     would not be construed as ``requiring, requesting, \n     suggesting, or causing, directly or indirectly, any covered \n     employee * * * to take or submit to a lie detector test''. \n     Cooperation of this type must be distinguished from actual \n     participation in the testing of employees suspected of \n     wrongdoing, either through the administration of a test by \n     the employing office at the request or direction of police \n     authorities, or through reimbursement by the employing office \n     of tests administered by police authorities to employees. In \n     some communities, it may be a practice of police authorities \n     to request testing by employing offices of employees before a \n     police investigation is initiated on a reported incident. In \n     other communities, police examiners are available to covered \n     employing offices, on a cost reimbursement basis, to conduct \n     tests on employees suspected by an employing office of \n     wrongdoing. All such conduct on the part of employing offices \n     is deemed within the prohibitions of section 204 of the CAA.\n       (c) The receipt by an employing office of information from \n     a polygraph test administered by police authorities pursuant \n     to an investigation is prohibited by section 3(2) of the \n     EPPA. (See paragraph (a)(2) of this section.)\n       (d) The simulated use of a polygraph instrument so as to \n     lead an individual to believe that an actual test is being or \n     may be performed (e.g., to elicit confessions or admissions \n     of guilt) constitutes conduct prohibited by paragraph (a) of \n     this section. Such use includes the connection of a covered \n     employee or prospective employee to the instrument without \n     any intention of a diagnostic purpose, the placement of the \n     instrument in a room used for interrogation unconnected to \n     the covered employee or prospective employee, or the mere \n     suggestion that the instrument may be used during the course \n     of the interview.\n       (e) The Capitol Police may not require a covered employee \n     not employed by the Capitol Police to take a lie detector \n     test (on its own initiative or at the request of another \n     employing office) except where the Capitol Police administers \n     such lie detector test as part of an ``ongoing \n     investigation'' by the Capitol Police. For the purpose of \n     this subsection, the definition of ``ongoing investigation'' \n     contained in section 1.12(b) shall apply.\n\n     SEC. 1.5  EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS OR AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Section 204 of the CAA does not preempt any otherwise \n     applicable provision of Federal law or any rule or regulation \n     of the House or Senate or any negotiated collective \n     bargaining agreement that prohibits lie detector tests or is \n     more restrictive with respect to the use of lie detector \n     tests.\n       (b)(1) This provision applies to all aspects of the use of \n     lie detector tests, including procedural safeguards, the use \n     of test results, the rights and remedies provided examinees, \n     and the rights, remedies, and responsibilities of examiners \n     and employing offices.\n       (2) For example, a collective bargaining agreement that \n     provides greater protection to an examinee would apply in \n     addition to the protection provided in section 204 of the \n     CAA.\n\n     SEC. 1.6  NOTICE OF PROTECTION.\n\n       Pursuant to section 301(h) of the CAA, the Office shall \n     prepare, in a manner suitable for posting, a notice \n     explaining the provisions of section 204 of the CAA. Copies \n     of such notice may be obtained from the Office of Compliance.\n\n     SEC. 1.7  AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD.\n\n       Pursuant to sections 204 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections of the EPPA. Section 204(c) directs the Board to \n     promulgate regulations implementing section 204 that are \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsections (a) and (b) [of section 204 of the \n     CAA] except insofar as the Board may determine, for good \n     cause shown . . . that a modification of such regulations \n     would be more effective for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections under this section''. The regulations issued \n     by the Board herein are on all matters for which section 204 \n     of the CAA requires a regulation to be issued. Specifically, \n     it is the Board's considered judgment, based on the \n     information available to it at the time of promulgation of \n     these regulations, that, with the exception of the \n     regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no other \n     ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Labor to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     subsections (a) and (b) [of section 204 of the CAA]''.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover such changes, \n     in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute an \n     interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n\n     SEC. 1.8  EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP.\n\n       Subject to the exemptions incorporated into the CAA by \n     section 225(f), section 204 applies the prohibitions on the \n     use of lie detectors by employing offices with respect to \n     covered employees irrespective of whether a covered employee \n     works in that employing office. Sections 101 (3), (4) and 204 \n     of the CAA also apply EPPA prohibitions against \n     discrimination to applicants for employment and former \n     employees of a covered employing office. For example, an \n     employee may quit rather than take a lie detector test. The \n     employing office cannot discriminate or threaten to \n     discriminate in any manner against that person (such as by \n     providing bad references in the future) because of that \n     person's refusal to be tested. Similarly, an employing office \n     cannot discriminate or threaten to discriminate in any manner \n     against that person because that person files a complaint, \n     institutes a proceeding, testifies in a proceeding, or \n     exercises any right under section 204 of the CAA.

Sec. 2006(a).\n       (b) Section 7(b)(1) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA \n     under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides that nothing in the \n     EPPA shall be construed to prohibit the administration of any \n     lie detector test by the Federal Government, in the \n     performance of any counterintelligence function, to any \n     expert, consultant or employee of any contractor under \n     contract with the Department of Defense; or with the \n     Department of Energy, in connection with the atomic energy \n     defense activities of such Department.\n       (c) Section 7(b)(2)(A) of the EPPA, incorporated into the \n     CAA under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides that nothing in \n     the EPPA shall be construed to prohibit the administration of \n     any lie detector test by the Federal Government, in the \n     performance of any intelligence or counterintelligence \n     function of the National Security Agency, the Defense \n     Intelligence Agency, or the Central Intelligence Agency, to \n     any individual employed by, assigned to, or detailed to any \n     such agency; or any expert or consultant under contract to \n     any such agency; or any employee of a contractor to such \n     agency; or any individual applying for a position in any such \n     agency; or any individual assigned to a space where sensitive \n     cryptologic information is produced, processed, or stored for \n     any such agency.\n       (d) Section 7(b)(2)(B) of the EPPA, incorporated into the \n     CAA under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides that nothing in \n     the EPPA shall be construed to prohibit the administration of \n     any lie detector test by the Federal Government, in the \n     performance of any intelligence or counterintelligence \n     function, to any covered employee whose duties involve access \n     to information that has been classified at the level of top \n     secret or designated as being within a special access program \n     under section 4.2 (a) of Executive Order 12356 (or a \n     successor Executive order).\n       (e) Counterintelligence for purposes of the above \n     paragraphs means information gathered and activities \n     conducted to protect against espionage and other clandestine \n     intelligence activities, sabotage, terrorist activities, or \n     assassinations conducted for or on behalf of foreign \n     governments, or foreign or domestic organizations or persons.\n       (f) Lie detector tests of persons described in the above \n     paragraphs will be administered in accordance with applicable \n     Department of Defense directives and regulations, or other \n     regulations and directives governing the use of such tests by \n     the United States Government, as applicable.\n\n     SEC. 1.12  EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYING OFFICES CONDUCTING \n                   INVESTIGATIONS OF ECONOMIC LOSS OR INJURY.\n\n       (a) Section 7(d) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA \n     under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides a limited exemption \n     from the general prohibition on lie detector use for \n     employers conducting ongoing investigations of economic loss \n     or injury to the employer's business. An employing office may \n     request an employee, subject to the conditions set forth in \n     sections 8 and 10 of the EPPA and sections 1.20, 1.22, 1.23, \n     1.24, 1.25, 1.26 and 1.35 of this part, to submit to a \n     polygraph test, but no other type of lie detector test, only \n     if--\n       (1) The test is administered in connection with an ongoing \n     investigation involving economic loss or injury to the \n     employing office's operations, such as theft, embezzlement, \n     misappropriation or an act of unlawful industrial espionage \n     or sabotage;\n       (2) The employee had access to the property that is the \n     subject of the investigation;\n       (3) The employing office has a reasonable suspicion that \n     the employee was involved in the incident or activity under \n     investigation;\n       (4) The employing office provides the examinee with a \n     statement, in a language understood by the examinee, prior to \n     the test which fully explains with particularity the specific \n     incident or activity being investigated and the basis for \n     testing particular employees and which contains, at a \n     minimum:\n       (i) An identification with particularity of the specific \n     economic loss or injury to the operations of the employing \n     office;\n       (ii) A description of the employee's access to the property \n     that is the subject of the investigation;\n       (iii) A description in detail of the basis of the employing \n     office's reasonable suspicion that the employee was involved \n     in the incident or activity under investigation; and\n       (iv) Signature of a person (other than a polygraph \n     examiner) authorized to legally bind the employing office; \n     and\n       (5) The employing office retains a copy of the statement \n     and proof of service described in paragraph (a)(4) of this \n     section for at least 3 years.\n       (b) For the exemption to apply, the condition of an \n     ``ongoing investigation'' must be met. As used in section \n     7(d) of the EPPA, the ongoing investigation must be of a \n     specific incident or activity. Thus, for example, an \n     employing office may not request that an employee or \n     employees submit to a polygraph test in an effort to \n     determine whether or not any thefts have occurred. Such \n     random testing by an employing office is precluded by the \n     EPPA. Further, because the exemption is limited to a specific \n     incident or activity, an employing office is precluded from \n     using the exemption in situations where the so-called \n     ``ongoing investigation'' is continuous. For example, the \n     fact that items are frequently missing would not be a \n     sufficient basis, standing alone, for administering a \n     polygraph test. Even if the employing office can establish \n     that unusually high amounts of property are missing in a \n     given month, this, in and of itself, would not be a \n     sufficient basis to meet the specific incident requirement. \n     On the other hand, polygraph testing in response to missing \n     property would be permitted where additional evidence is \n     obtained through subsequent investigation of specific items \n     missing through intentional wrongdoing, and a reasonable \n     suspicion that the employee to be polygraphed was involved in \n     the incident under investigation. Administering a polygraph \n     test in circumstances where the missing property is merely \n     unspecified, statistical shortages, without identification of \n     a specific incident or activity that produced the missing \n     property and a ``reasonable suspicion that the employee was \n     involved'', would amount to little more than a fishing \n     expedition and is prohibited by the EPPA as applied to \n     covered employees and employing offices by the CAA.\n       (c)(1)(i) The terms economic loss or injury to the \n     employing office's operations include both direct and \n     indirect economic loss or injury.\n       (ii) Direct loss or injury includes losses or injuries \n     resulting from theft, embezzlement, misappropriation, \n     espionage or sabotage. These examples, cited in the EPPA, are \n     intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. Another \n     specific incident which would constitute direct economic loss \n     or injury is the misappropriation of confidential or trade \n     secret information.\n       (iii) Indirect loss or injury includes the use of an \n     employing office's operations to commit a crime, such as \n     check-kiting or money laundering. In such cases, the ongoing \n     investigation must be limited to criminal activity that has \n     already occurred, and to use of the employing office's \n     operations (and not simply the use of the premises) for such \n     activity. For example, the use of an employing office's \n     vehicles, warehouses, computers or equipment to smuggle or \n     facilitate the importing of illegal substances constitutes an \n     indirect loss or injury to the employing office's business \n     operations. Conversely, the mere fact that an illegal act \n     occurs on the employing office's premises (such as a drug \n     transaction that takes place in the employing office's \n     parking lot or rest room) does not constitute an indirect \n     economic loss or injury to the employing office.\n       (iv) Indirect loss or injury also includes theft or injury \n     to property of another for which the employing office \n     exercises fiduciary, managerial or security responsibility, \n     or where the office has custody of the property (but not \n     property of other offices to which the employees have access \n     by virtue of the employment relationship). For example, if a \n     maintenance employee of the manager of an apartment building \n     steals jewelry from a tenant's apartment, the theft results \n     in an indirect economic loss or injury to the employer \n     because of the manager's management responsibility with \n     respect to the tenant's apartment. A messenger on a delivery \n     of confidential business reports for a client firm who steals \n     the reports causes an indirect economic loss or injury to the \n     messenger service because the messenger service is custodian \n     of the client firm's reports, and therefore is responsible \n     for their security. Similarly, the theft of property \n     protected by a security service employer is considered an \n     economic loss or injury to that employer.\n       (v) A theft or injury to a client firm does not constitute \n     an indirect loss or injury to an employing office unless that \n     employing office has custody of, or management, or security \n     responsibility for, the property of the client that was lost \n     or stolen or injured. For example, a cleaning contractor has \n     no responsibility for the money at a client bank. If money is \n     stolen from the bank by one of the cleaning contractor's \n     employees, the cleaning contractor does not suffer an \n     indirect loss or injury.\n       (vi) Indirect loss or injury does not include loss or \n     injury which is merely threatened or potential, e.g., a \n     threatened or potential loss of an advantageous business \n     relationship.\n       (2) Economic losses or injuries which are the result of \n     unintentional or lawful conduct would not serve as a basis \n     for the administration of a polygraph test. Thus, apparently \n     unintentional losses or injuries stemming from truck, car, \n     workplace, or other similar type accidents or routine \n     inventory or cash register shortages would not meet the \n     economic loss or injury requirement. Any economic loss \n     incident to lawful union or employee activity also would not \n     satisfy this requirement.\n       (3) It is the operations of the employing office which must \n     suffer the economic loss or injury. Thus, a theft committed \n     by one employee against another employee of the same \n     employing office would not satisfy the requirement.\n       (d) While nothing in the EPPA as applied by the CAA \n     prohibits the use of medical tests to determine the presence \n     of controlled substances or alcohol in bodily fluids, the \n     section 7(d) exemption of the EPPA does not permit the use of \n     a polygraph test to learn whether an employee has used drugs \n     or alcohol, even where such possible use may have contributed \n     to an economic loss to the employing office (e.g., an \n     accident involving an employing office's vehicle).\n       (e) Section 7(d)(2) of the EPPA provides that, as a \n     condition for the use of the exemption, the employee must \n     have had access to the property that is the subject of the \n     investigation.\n       (1) The word access, as used in section 7(d)(2), refers to \n     the opportunity which an\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\n     employee had to cause, or to aid or abet in causing, the \n     specific economic loss or injury under investigation. The \n     term ``access'', thus, includes more than direct or physical \n     contact during the course of employment. For example, as a \n     general matter, all employees working in or with authority to \n     enter a property storage area have ``access'' to unsecured \n     property in the area. All employees with the combination to a \n     safe have ``access'' to the property in a locked safe. \n     Employees also have ``access'' who have the ability to divert \n     possession or otherwise affect the disposition of the \n     property that is the subject of investigation. For example, a \n     bookkeeper in a jewelry store with access to inventory \n     records may aid or abet a clerk who steals an expensive watch \n     by removing the watch from the employing office's inventory \n     records. In such a situation, it is clear that the bookkeeper \n     effectively has ``access'' to the property that is the \n     subject of the investigation.\n       (2) As used in section 7(d)(2), property refers to \n     specifically identifiable property, but also includes such \n     things of value as security codes and computer data, and \n     proprietary, financial or technical information, such as \n     trade secrets, which by its availability to competitors or \n     others would cause economic harm to the employing office.\n       (f)(1) As used in section 7(d)(3), the term reasonable \n     suspicion refers to an observable, articulable basis in fact \n     which indicates that a particular employee was involved in, \n     or responsible for, an economic loss. Access in the sense of \n     possible or potential opportunity, standing alone, does not \n     constitute a basis for ``reasonable suspicion''. Information \n     from a co-worker, or an employee's behavior, demeanor, or \n     conduct may be factors in the basis for reasonable suspicion. \n     Likewise, inconsistencies between facts, claims, or \n     statements that surface during an investigation can serve as \n     a sufficient basis for reasonable suspicion. While access or \n     opportunity, standing alone, does not constitute a basis for \n     reasonable suspicion, the totality of circumstances \n     surrounding the access or opportunity (such as its \n     unauthorized or unusual nature or the fact that access was \n     limited to a single individual) may constitute a factor in \n     determining whether there is a reasonable suspicion.\n       (2) For example, in an investigation of a theft of an \n     expensive piece of jewelry, an employee authorized to open \n     the establishment's safe no earlier than 9 a.m., in order to \n     place the jewelry in a window display case, is observed \n     opening the safe at 7:30 a.m. In such a situation, the \n     opening of the safe by the employee one and one-half hours \n     prior to the specified time may serve as the basis for \n     reasonable suspicion. On the other hand, in the example \n     given, if the employee is asked to bring the piece of jewelry \n     to his or her office at 7:30 a.m., and the employee then \n     opened the safe and reported the jewelry missing, such \n     access, standing alone, would not constitute a basis for \n     reasonable suspicion that the employee was involved in the \n     incident unless access to the safe was limited solely to the \n     employee. If no one other than the employee possessed the \n     combination to the safe, and all other possible explanations \n     for the loss are ruled out, such as a break-in, a basis for \n     reasonable suspicion may be formulated based on sole access \n     by one employee.\n       (3) The employing office has the burden of establishing \n     that the specific individual or individuals to be tested are \n     ``reasonably suspected'' of involvement in the specific \n     economic loss or injury for the requirement in section \n     7(d)(3) of the EPPA to be met.\n       (g)(1) As discussed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, \n     section 7(d)(4) of the EPPA sets forth what information, at a \n     minimum, must be provided to an employee if the employing \n     office wishes to claim the exemption.\n       (2) The statement required under paragraph (a)(4) of this \n     section must be received by the employee at least 48 hours, \n     excluding weekend days and holidays, prior to the time of the \n     examination. The statement must set forth the time and date \n     of receipt by the employee and be verified by the employee's \n     signature. This will provide the employee with adequate pre-\n     test notice of the specific incident or activity being \n     investigated and afford the employee sufficient time prior to \n     the test to obtain and consult with legal counsel or an \n     employee representative.\n       (3) The statement to be provided to the employee must set \n     forth with particularity the specific incident or activity \n     being investigated and the basis for testing particular \n     employees. Section 7(d)(4)(A) of the EPPA requires \n     specificity beyond the mere assertion of general statements \n     regarding economic loss, employee access, and reasonable \n     suspicion. For example, an employing office's assertion that \n     an expensive watch was stolen, and that the employee had \n     access to the watch and is therefore a suspect, would not \n     meet the ``with particularity'' criterion. If the basis for \n     an employing office's requesting an employee (or employees) \n     to take a polygraph test is not articulated with \n     particularity, and reduced to writing, then the standard is \n     not met. The identity of a co-worker or other individual \n     providing information used to establish reasonable suspicion \n     need not be revealed in the statement.\n       (4) It is further required that the statement provided to \n     the examinee be signed by the employing office, or an \n     employee or other representative of the employing office with \n     authority to legally bind the employing office. The person \n     signing the statement must not be a polygraph examiner unless \n     the examiner is acting solely in the capacity of an employing \n     office with respect to his or her own employees and does not \n     conduct the examination. The standard would not be met, and \n     the exemption would not apply if the person signing the \n     statement is not authorized to legally bind the employing \n     office.\n       (h) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption \n     are subject to the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 \n     of the EPPA, as discussed in sections 1.20, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, \n     1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part. As provided in these \n     sections, the exemption will apply only if certain \n     requirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified \n     requirements nullifies the statutory authority for polygraph \n     test administration and may subject the employing office to \n     remedial actions, as provided for in section 6(c) of the \n     EPPA.\n\n     SEC. 1.13  EXEMPTION OF EMPLOYING OFFICES AUTHORIZED TO \n                   MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE, OR DISPENSE CONTROLLED \n                   SUBSTANCES.\n\n       (a) Section 7(f) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA by \n     section 225(f) of the CAA, provides an exemption from the \n     EPPA's general prohibition regarding the use of polygraph \n     tests for employers authorized to manufacture, distribute, or \n     dispense a controlled substance listed in schedule I, II, \n     III, or IV of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act \n     (21 U.S.C. Sec. 812). This exemption permits the \n     administration of polygraph tests, subject to the conditions \n     set forth in sections 8 and 10 of the EPPA and sections 1.21, \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part, to:\n       (1) A prospective employee who would have direct access to \n     the manufacture, storage, distribution, or sale of any such \n     controlled substance; or\n       (2) A current employee if the following conditions are met:\n       (i) The test is administered in connection with an ongoing \n     investigation of criminal or other misconduct involving, or \n     potentially involving, loss or injury to the manufacture, \n     distribution, or dispensing of any such controlled substance \n     by such employing office; and\n       (ii) The employee had access to the person or property that \n     is the subject of the investigation.\n        (b)(1) The terms manufacture, distribute, distribution, \n     dispense, storage, and sale, for the purposes of this \n     exemption, are construed within the meaning of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 812 et seq.), as administered \n     by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), United States \n     Department of Justice.\n       (2) The exemption in section 7(f) of the EPPA applies only \n     to employing offices that are authorized by DEA to \n     manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance. \n     Section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 812) requires every person who manufactures, \n     distributes, or dispenses any controlled substance to \n     register with the Attorney General (i.e., with DEA). Common \n     or contract carriers and warehouses whose possession of the \n     controlled substance is in the usual course of their business \n     or employment are not required to register. Truck drivers and \n     warehouse employees of the persons or entities registered \n     with DEA and authorized to manufacture, distribute, or \n     dispense controlled substances, are within the scope of the \n     exemption where they have direct access or access to the \n     controlled substances, as discussed below.\n       (c) In order for a polygraph examination to be performed, \n     section 7(f) of the Act requires that a prospective employee \n     have ``direct access'' to the controlled substance(s) \n     manufactured, dispensed, or distributed by the employing \n     office. Where a current employee is to be tested as a part of \n     an ongoing investigation, section 7(f) requires that the \n     employee have ``access'' to the person or property that is \n     the subject of the investigation.\n       (1) A prospective employee would have ``direct access'' if \n     the position being applied for has responsibilities which \n     include contact with or which affect the disposition of a \n     controlled substance, including participation in the process \n     of obtaining, dispensing, or otherwise distributing a \n     controlled substance. This includes contact or direct \n     involvement in the manufacture, storage, testing, \n     distribution, sale or dispensing of a controlled substance \n     and may include, for example, packaging, repackaging, \n     ordering, licensing, shipping, receiving, taking inventory, \n     providing security, prescribing, and handling of a controlled \n     substance. A prospective employee would have ``direct \n     access'' if the described job duties would give such person \n     access to the products in question, whether such employee \n     would be in physical proximity to controlled substances or \n     engaged in activity which would permit the employee to divert \n     such substances to his or her possession.\n       (2) A current employee would have ``access'' within the \n     meaning of section 7(f) if the employee had access to the \n     specific person or property which is the subject of the on-\n     going investigation, as discussed in section 1.12(e) of this \n     part. Thus, to test a current employee, the employee need not \n     have had ``direct'' access to the controlled substance, but \n     may have had only infrequent, random, or opportunistic \n     access. Such access would be sufficient to test the employee \n     if the employee could have caused, or could have aided or \n     abetted in causing, the loss of the specific property which \n     is the subject of the investigation. For example, a \n     maintenance worker in a drug warehouse, whose job duties \n     include the cleaning of areas where the controlled substances \n     which are the subject of the investigation were present, but \n     whose job duties do not include the handling of controlled \n     substances, would be deemed to\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\n     have ``access'', but normally not ``direct access'', to the \n     controlled substances. On the other hand, a drug warehouse \n     truck loader, whose job duties include the handling of \n     outgoing shipment orders which contain controlled substances, \n     would have ``direct access'' to such controlled substances. A \n     pharmacy department in a supermarket is another common \n     situation which is useful in illustrating the distinction \n     between ``direct access'' and ``access''. Store personnel \n     receiving pharmaceutical orders, i.e., the pharmacist, \n     pharmacy intern, and other such employees working in the \n     pharmacy department, would ordinarily have ``direct access'' \n     to controlled substances. Other store personnel whose job \n     duties and responsibilities do not include the handling of \n     controlled substances but who had occasion to enter the \n     pharmacy department where the controlled substances which are \n     the subject of the investigation were stored, such as \n     maintenance personnel or pharmacy cashiers, would have \n     ``access''. Certain other store personnel whose job duties do \n     not permit or require entrance into the pharmacy department \n     for any reason, such as produce or meat clerks, checkout \n     cashiers, or baggers, would not ordinarily have ``access''. \n     However, any current employee, regardless of described job \n     duties, may be polygraphed if the employing office's \n     investigation of criminal or other misconduct discloses that \n     such employee in fact took action to obtain ``access'' to the \n     person or property that is the subject of the investigation--\n     e.g., by actually entering the drug storage area in violation \n     of company rules. In the case of ``direct access'', the \n     prospective employee's access to controlled substances would \n     be as a part of the manufacturing, dispensing or distribution \n     process, while a current employee's ``access'' to the \n     controlled substances which are the subject of the \n     investigation need only be opportunistic.\n       (d) The term prospective employee, for the purposes of this \n     section, includes a current employee who presently holds a \n     position which does not entail direct access to controlled \n     substances, and therefore is outside the scope of the \n     exemption's provisions for preemployment polygraph testing, \n     provided the employee has applied for and is being considered \n     for transfer or promotion to another position which entails \n     such direct access. For example, an office secretary may \n     apply for promotion to a position in the vault or cage areas \n     of a drug warehouse, where controlled substances are kept. In \n     such a situation, the current employee would be deemed a \n     ``prospective employee'' for the purposes of this exemption, \n     and thus could be subject to preemployment polygraph \n     screening, prior to such a change in position. However, any \n     adverse action which is based in part on a polygraph test \n     against a current employee who is considered a ``prospective \n     employee'' for purposes of this section may be taken only \n     with respect to the prospective position and may not affect \n     the employee's employment in the current position.\n       (e) Section 7(f) of the EPPA, as applied by the CAA, makes \n     no specific reference to a requirement that employing offices \n     provide current employees with a written statement prior to \n     polygraph testing. Thus, employing offices to whom this \n     exemption is available are not required to furnish a written \n     statement such as that specified in section 7(d) of the EPPA \n     and section 1.12(a)(4) of this part.\n       (f) For the section 7(f) exemption to apply, the polygraph \n     testing of current employees must be administered in \n     connection with an ongoing investigation of criminal or other \n     misconduct involving, or potentially involving, loss or \n     injury to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of any \n     such controlled substance by such employing office.\n       (1) Current employees may only be administered polygraph \n     tests in connection with an ongoing investigation of criminal \n     or other misconduct, relating to a specific incident or \n     activity, or potential incident or activity. Thus, an \n     employing office is precluded from using the exemption in \n     connection with continuing investigations or on a random \n     basis to determine if thefts are occurring. However, unlike \n     the exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for employing \n     offices conducting ongoing investigations of economic loss or \n     injury, the section 7(f) exemption includes ongoing \n     investigations of misconduct involving potential drug losses. \n     Nor does the latter exemption include the requirement for \n     ``reasonable suspicion'' contained in the section 7(d) \n     exemption. Thus, a drug store operator is permitted to \n     polygraph all current employees who have access to a \n     controlled substance stolen from the inventory, or where \n     there is evidence that such a theft is planned. Polygraph \n     testing based on an inventory shortage of the drug during a \n     particular accounting period would not be permitted unless \n     there is extrinsic evidence of misconduct.\n       (2) In addition, the test must be administered in \n     connection with loss or injury, or potential loss or injury, \n     to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of a \n     controlled substance.\n       (i) Retail drugstores and wholesale drug warehouses \n     typically carry inventory of so-called health and beauty \n     aids, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs, and a variety of \n     other similar products, in addition to their product lines of \n     controlled drugs. The noncontrolled products usually \n     constitute the majority of such firms' sales volumes. An \n     economic loss or injury related to such noncontrolled \n     substances would not constitute a basis of applicability of \n     the section 7(f) exemption. For example, an investigation \n     into the theft of a gross of cosmetic products could not be a \n     basis for polygraph testing under section 7(f), but the theft \n     of a container of valium could be.\n       (ii) Polygraph testing, with respect to an ongoing \n     investigation concerning products other than controlled \n     substances might be initiated under section 7(d) of the EPPA \n     and section 1.12 of this part. However, the exemption in \n     section 7(f) of the EPPA and this section is limited solely \n     to losses or injury associated with controlled substances.\n       (g) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption \n     are subject to the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 \n     of the EPPA, as discussed in sections 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, \n     1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part. As provided in these \n     sections, the exemption will apply only if certain \n     requirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified \n     requirements nullifies the statutory authority for polygraph \n     test administration and may subject the employing office to \n     the remedies authorized in section 204 of the CAA. The \n     administration of such tests is also subject to collective \n     bargaining agreements, which may either prohibit lie detector \n     tests, or contain more restrictive provisions with respect to \n     polygraph testing.\n\n      Subpart C--Restrictions on Polygraph Usage Under Exemptions\n\n     SEC. 1.20 ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION UNDER ONGOING \n                   INVESTIGATION EXEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Section 8(a)(1) of the EPPA provides that the limited \n     exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA and section 1.12 of \n     this part for ongoing investigations shall not apply if an \n     employing office discharges, disciplines, denies employment \n     or promotion or otherwise discriminates in any manner against \n     a current employee based upon the analysis of a polygraph \n     test chart or the refusal to take a polygraph test, without \n     additional supporting evidence.\n       (b) ``Additional supporting evidence'', for purposes of \n     section 8(a) of the EPPA, includes, but is not limited to, \n     the following:\n       (1)(i) Evidence indicating that the employee had access to \n     the missing or damaged property that is the subject of an \n     ongoing investigation; and\n       (ii) Evidence leading to the employing office's reasonable \n     suspicion that the employee was involved in the incident or \n     activity under investigation; or\n       (2) Admissions or statements made by an employee before, \n     during or following a polygraph examination.\n       (c) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or refusal to take a \n     polygraph test may not serve as a basis for adverse \n     employment action, even with additional supporting evidence, \n     unless the employing office observes all the requirements of \n     sections 7(d) and 8(b) of the EPPA, as applied by the CAA and \n     described in sections 1.12, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24 and 1.25 of this \n     part.\n\n     SEC. 1.21 ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION UNDER CONTROLLED \n                   SUBSTANCE EXEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Section 8(a)(2) of the EPPA provides that the \n     controlled substance exemption in section 7(f) of the EPPA \n     and section 1.13 of this part shall not apply if an employing \n     office discharges, disciplines, denies employment or \n     promotion, or otherwise discriminates in any manner against a \n     current employee or prospective employee based solely on the \n     analysis of a polygraph test chart or the refusal to take a \n     polygraph test.\n       (b) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or refusal to take a \n     polygraph test may serve as one basis for adverse employment \n     actions of the type described in paragraph (a) of this \n     section: Provided, That the adverse action was also based on \n     another bona fide reason, with supporting evidence therefor. \n     For example, traditional factors such as prior employment \n     experience, education, job performance, etc. may be used as a \n     basis for employment decisions. Employment decisions based on \n     admissions or statements made by an employee or prospective \n     employee before, during or following a polygraph examination \n     may, likewise, serve as a basis for such decisions.\n       (c) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or the refusal to \n     take a polygraph test may not serve as a basis for adverse \n     employment action, even with another legitimate basis for \n     such action, unless the employing office observes all the \n     requirements of section 7(f) of the EPPA, as appropriate, and \n     section 8(b) of the EPPA, as described in sections 1.13, \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24 and 1.25 of this part.\n\n     SEC. 1.22 RIGHTS OF EXAMINEE--GENERAL.\n\n       (a) Pursuant to section 8(b) of the EPPA, the limited \n     exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for ongoing \n     investigations (described in sections 1.12 and 1.13 of this \n     part) shall not apply unless all of the requirements set \n     forth in this section and sections 1.23 through 1.25 of this \n     part are met.\n       (b) During all phases of the polygraph testing the person \n     being examined has the following rights:\n       (1) The examinee may terminate the test at any time.\n       (2) The examinee may not be asked any questions in a \n     degrading or unnecessarily intrusive manner.\n       (3) The examinee may not be asked any questions dealing \n     with:\n       (i) Religious beliefs or affiliations;\n       (ii) Beliefs or opinions regarding racial matters;\n       (iii) Political beliefs or affiliations;\n       (iv) Sexual preferences or behavior; or\n       (v) Beliefs, affiliations, opinions, or lawful activities \n     concerning unions or labor organizations.\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\n       (4) The examinee may not be subjected to a test when there \n     is sufficient written evidence by a physician that the \n     examinee is suffering from any medical or psychological \n     condition or undergoing any treatment that might cause \n     abnormal responses during the actual testing phase. \n     ``Sufficient written evidence'' shall constitute, at a \n     minimum, a statement by a physician specifically describing \n     the examinee's medical or psychological condition or \n     treatment and the basis for the physician's opinion that the \n     condition or treatment might result in such abnormal \n     responses.\n       (5) An employee or prospective employee who exercises the \n     right to terminate the test, or who for medical reasons with \n     sufficient supporting evidence is not administered the test, \n     shall be subject to adverse employment action only on the \n     same basis as one who refuses to take a polygraph test, as \n     described in sections 1.20 and 1.21 of this part.\n       (c) Any polygraph examination shall consist of one or more \n     pretest phases, actual testing phases, and post-test phases, \n     which must be conducted in accordance with the rights of \n     examinees described in sections 1.23 through 1.25 of this \n     part.\n\n     SEC. 1.23 RIGHTS OF EXAMINEE--PRETEST PHASE.\n\n       (a) The pretest phase consists of the questioning and other \n     preparation of the prospective examinee before the actual use \n     of the polygraph instrument. During the initial pretest \n     phase, the examinee must be:\n       (1) Provided with written notice, in a language understood \n     by the examinee, as to when and where the examination will \n     take place and that the examinee has the right to consult \n     with counsel or an employee representative before each phase \n     of the test. Such notice shall be received by the examinee at \n     least forty-eight hours, excluding weekend days and holidays, \n     before the time of the examination, except that a prospective \n     employee may, at the employee's option, give written consent \n     to administration of a test anytime within 48 hours but no \n     earlier than 24 hours after receipt of the written notice. \n     The written notice or proof of service must set forth the \n     time and date of receipt by the employee or prospective \n     employee and be verified by his or her signature. The purpose \n     of this requirement is to provide a sufficient opportunity \n     prior to the examination for the examinee to consult with \n     counsel or an employee representative. Provision shall also \n     be made for a convenient place on the premises where the \n     examination will take place at which the examinee may consult \n     privately with an attorney or an employee representative \n     before each phase of the test. The attorney or representative \n     may be excluded from the room where the examination is \n     administered during the actual testing phase.\n       (2) Informed orally and in writing of the nature and \n     characteristics of the polygraph instrument and examination, \n     including an explanation of the physical operation of the \n     polygraph instrument and the procedure used during the \n     examination.\n       (3) Provided with a written notice prior to the testing \n     phase, in a language understood by the examinee, which shall \n     be read to and signed by the examinee. Use of Appendix A to \n     this part, if properly completed, will constitute compliance \n     with the contents of the notice requirement of this \n     paragraph. If a format other than in Appendix A is used, it \n     must contain at least the following information:\n       (i) Whether or not the polygraph examination area contains \n     a two-way mirror, a camera, or other device through which the \n     examinee may be observed;\n       (ii) Whether or not any other device, such as those used in \n     conversation or recording will be used during the \n     examination;\n       (iii) That both the examinee and the employing office have \n     the right, with the other's knowledge, to make a recording of \n     the entire examination;\n       (iv) That the examinee has the right to terminate the test \n     at any time;\n       (v) That the examinee has the right, and will be given the \n     opportunity, to review all questions to be asked during the \n     test;\n       (vi) That the examinee may not be asked questions in a \n     manner which degrades, or needlessly intrudes;\n       (vii) That the examinee may not be asked any questions \n     concerning religious beliefs or opinions; beliefs regarding \n     racial matters; political beliefs or affiliations; matters \n     relating to sexual behavior; beliefs, affiliations, opinions, \n     or lawful activities regarding unions or labor organizations;\n       (viii) That the test may not be conducted if there is \n     sufficient written evidence by a physician that the examinee \n     is suffering from a medical or psychological condition or \n     undergoing treatment that might cause abnormal responses \n     during the examination;\n       (ix) That the test is not and cannot be required as a \n     condition of employment;\n       (x) That the employing office may not discharge, dismiss, \n     discipline, deny employment or promotion, or otherwise \n     discriminate against the examinee based on the analysis of a \n     polygraph test, or based on the examinee's refusal to take \n     such a test, without additional evidence which would support \n     such action;\n       (xi)(A) In connection with an ongoing investigation, that \n     the additional evidence required for the employing office to \n     take adverse action against the examinee, including \n     termination, may be evidence that the examinee had access to \n     the property that is the subject of the investigation, \n     together with evidence supporting the employing office's \n     reasonable suspicion that the examinee was involved in the \n     incident or activity under investigation;\n       (B) That any statement made by the examinee before or \n     during the test may serve as additional supporting evidence \n     for an adverse employment action, as described in paragraph \n     (a)(3)(x) of this section, and that any admission of criminal \n     conduct by the examinee may be transmitted to an appropriate \n     Government law enforcement agency;\n       (xii) That information acquired from a polygraph test may \n     be disclosed by the examiner or by the employing office only:\n       (A) To the examinee or any other person specifically \n     designated in writing by the examinee to receive such \n     information;\n       (B) To the employing office that requested the test;\n       (C) To a court, governmental agency, arbitrator, or \n     mediator pursuant to a court order;\n       (D) By the employing office, to an appropriate governmental \n     agency without a court order where, and only insofar as, the \n     information disclosed is an admission of criminal conduct;\n       (xiii) That if any of the examinee's rights or protections \n     under the law are violated, the examinee has the right to \n     take action against the employing office under sections 401-\n     404 of the CAA. Employing offices that violate this law are \n     liable to the affected examinee, who may recover such legal \n     or equitable relief as may be appropriate, including, but not \n     limited to, employment, reinstatement, and promotion, payment \n     of lost wages and benefits, and reasonable costs, including \n     attorney's fees;\n       (xiv) That the examinee has the right to obtain and consult \n     with legal counsel or other representative before each phase \n     of the test, although the legal counsel or representative may \n     be excluded from the room where the test is administered \n     during the actual testing phase.\n       (xv) That the employee's rights under the CAA may not be \n     waived, either voluntarily or involuntarily, by contract or \n     otherwise, except as part of a written settlement to a \n     pending action or complaint under the CAA, agreed to and \n     signed by the parties.\n       (b) During the initial or any subsequent pretest phases, \n     the examinee must be given the opportunity, prior to the \n     actual testing phase, to review all questions in writing that \n     the examiner will ask during each testing phase. Such \n     questions may be presented at any point in time prior to the \n     testing phase.\n\n     SEC. 1.24  RIGHTS OF EXAMINEE--ACTUAL TESTING PHASE.\n\n       (a) The actual testing phase refers to that time during \n     which the examiner administers the examination by using a \n     polygraph instrument with respect to the examinee and then \n     analyzes the charts derived from the test. Throughout the \n     actual testing phase, the examiner shall not ask any question \n     that was not presented in writing for review prior to the \n     testing phase. An examiner may, however, recess the testing \n     phase and return to the pre-test phase to review additional \n     relevant questions with the examinee. In the case of an \n     ongoing investigation, the examiner shall ensure that all \n     relevant questions (as distinguished from technical baseline \n     questions) pertain to the investigation.\n       (b) No testing period subject to the provisions of the Act \n     shall be less than ninety minutes in length. Such ``test \n     period'' begins at the time that the examiner begins \n     informing the examinee of the nature and characteristics of \n     the examination and the instruments involved, as prescribed \n     in section 8(b)(2)(B) of the EPPA and section 1.23(a)(2) of \n     this part, and ends when the examiner completes the review of \n     the test results with the examinee as provided in section \n     1.25 of this part. The ninety-minute minimum duration shall \n     not apply if the examinee voluntarily acts to terminate the \n     test before the completion thereof, in which event the \n     examiner may not render an opinion regarding the employee's \n     truthfulness.\n\n     SEC. 1.25  RIGHTS OF EXAMINEE--POST-TEST PHASE.\n\n       (a) The post-test phase refers to any questioning or other \n     communication with the examinee following the use of the \n     polygraph instrument, including review of the results of the \n     test with the examinee. Before any adverse employment action, \n     the employing office must:\n       (1) Further interview the examinee on the basis of the test \n     results; and\n       (2) Give to the examinee a written copy of any opinions or \n     conclusions rendered in response to the test, as well as the \n     questions asked during the test, with the corresponding \n     charted responses. The term ``corresponding charted \n     responses'' refers to copies of the entire examination charts \n     recording the employee's physiological responses, and not \n     just the examiner's written report which describes the \n     examinee's responses to the questions as ``charted'' by the \n     instrument.\n\n     SEC. 1.26  QUALIFICATIONS OF AND REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMINERS.\n\n       (a) Section 8 (b) and (c) of the EPPA provides that the \n     limited exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for ongoing \n     investigations shall not apply unless the person conducting \n     the polygraph examination meets specified qualifications and \n     requirements.\n       (b) An examiner must meet the following qualifications:\n       (1) Have a valid current license, if required by the State \n     in which the test is to be conducted; and\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\n       (2) Carry a minimum bond of $50,000 provided by a surety \n     incorporated under the laws of the United States or of any \n     State, which may under those laws guarantee the fidelity of \n     persons holding positions of trust, or carry an equivalent \n     amount of professional liability coverage.\n       (c) An examiner must also, with respect to examinees \n     identified by the employing office pursuant to section \n     1.30(c) of this part:\n       (1) Observe all rights of examinees, as set out in sections \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24, and 1.25 of this part;\n       (2) Administer no more than five polygraph examinations in \n     any one calendar day on which a test or tests subject to the \n     provisions of EPPA are administered, not counting those \n     instances where an examinee voluntarily terminates an \n     examination prior to the actual testing phase;\n       (3) Administer no polygraph examination subject to the \n     provisions of the EPPA which is less than ninety minutes in \n     duration, as described in section 1.24(b) of this part; and\n       (4) Render any opinion or conclusion regarding truthfulness \n     or deception in writing. Such opinion or conclusion must be \n     based solely on the polygraph test results. The written \n     report shall not contain any information other than \n     admissions, information, case facts, and interpretation of \n     the charts relevant to the stated purpose of the polygraph \n     test and shall not include any recommendation concerning the \n     employment of the examinee.\n       (5) Maintain all opinions, reports, charts, written \n     questions, lists, and other records relating to the test, \n     including, statements signed by examinees advising them of \n     rights under the CAA (as described in section 1.23(a)(3) of \n     this part) and any electronic recordings of examinations, for \n     at least three years from the date of the administration of \n     the test.

Such action would not constitute disclosure under \n     this part provided that the other examiner has no direct or \n     indirect interest in the matter.\n\n                         Subpart E--[Reserved]\n\n     SEC. 1.40  [RESERVED].\n\n               Appendix A to Part 801--Notice to Examinee\n\n       Section 204 of the Congressional Accountability Act, which \n     applies the rights and protections of section 8(b) of the \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act to covered employees and \n     employing offices, and the regulations of the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance (sections 1.22, 1.23, \n     1.24, and 1.25), require that you be given the following \n     information before taking a polygraph examination:\n\n     1. (a) The polygraph examination area  [does]  [does not]  \n     contain a two-way mirror, a camera, or other device through \n     which you may be observed.\n\n     (b) Another device, such as those used in conversation or \n     recording  [will]  [will not]  be used during the \n     examination.\n\n     (c) Both you and the employing office have the right, with \n     the other's knowledge, to record electronically the entire \n     examination.\n\n     2. (a) You have the right to terminate the test at any time.\n\n     (b) You have the right, and will be given the opportunity, to \n     review all questions to be asked during the test.\n\n     (c) You may not be asked questions in a manner which \n     degrades, or needlessly intrudes.\n\n     (d) You may not be asked any questions concerning: Religious \n     beliefs or opinions; beliefs regarding racial matters; \n     political beliefs or affiliations; matters relating to sexual \n     preference or behavior; beliefs, affiliations, opinions, or \n     lawful activities regarding unions or labor organizations.\n\n     (e) The test may not be conducted if there is sufficient \n     written evidence by a physician that you are suffering from a \n     medical or psychological condition or undergoing treatment \n     that might cause abnormal responses during the examination.\n\n     (f) You have the right to consult with legal counsel or other \n     representative before each phase of the test, although the \n     legal counsel or other representative may be excluded from \n     the room where the test is administered during the actual \n     testing phase.\n\n     3. (a) The test is not and cannot be required as a condition \n     of employment.\n\n     (b) The employing office may not discharge, dismiss, \n     discipline, deny employment or promotion, or otherwise \n     discriminate against you based on the analysis of a polygraph \n     test, or based on your refusal to take such a test without \n     additional evidence which would support such action.\n\n     (c)(1) In connection with an ongoing investigation, the \n     additional evidence required for an employing office to take \n     adverse action against you, including termination, may be (A) \n     evidence that you had access to the property that is the \n     subject of the investigation, together with (B) the evidence \n     supporting the employing office's reasonable suspicion that \n     you were involved in the incident or activity under \n     investigation.\n\n     (2) Any statement made by you before or during the test may \n     serve as additional supporting evidence for an adverse \n     employment action, as described in 3(b) above, and any \n     admission of criminal conduct by you may be transmitted to an \n     appropriate Government law enforcement agency.\n\n     4. (a) Information acquired from a polygraph test may be \n     disclosed by the examiner or by the employing office only:\n\n     (1) To you or any other person specifically designated in \n     writing by you to receive such information;\n\n     (2) To the employing office that requested the test;\n\n     (3) To a court, governmental agency, arbitrator, or mediator \n     that obtains a court order.\n\n     (b) Information acquired from a polygraph test may be \n     disclosed by the employing office to an appropriate \n     governmental agency without a court order where, and only \n     insofar as, the information disclosed is an admission of \n     criminal conduct.\n\n     5. If any of your rights or protections under the law are \n     violated, you have the right to take action against the \n     employing office by filing a request for counseling with the \n     Office of Compliance under section 402 of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act. Employing offices that violate this law \n     are liable to the affected examinee, who may recover such \n     legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate, including, \n     but not limited to, employment, reinstatement, and promotion, \n     payment of lost wages and benefits, and reasonable costs, \n     including attorney's fees.\n\n     6. Your rights under the CAA may not be waived, either \n     voluntarily or involuntarily, by contract or otherwise, \n     except as part of a written settlement to a pending action or \n     complaint under the CAA, and agreed to and signed by the \n     parties.\n\n     I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the above \n     notice, and that it has been read to me.\n\n     ________________________________________\n     (Date)\n     ________________________________________\n     (Signature)\n\n    APPLICATION OF RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS OF THE WORKER ADJUSTMENT \n RETRAINING AND NOTIFICATION ACT OF 1988 (IMPLEMENTING SECTION 204 OF \n                                THE CAA)\n\nSec.\n639.1  Purpose and scope.\n639.2  What does WARN require?\n639.3  Definitions.\n639.4  Who must give notice?\n639.5  When must notice be given?\n639.6  Who must receive notice?\n639.7  What must the notice contain?\n639.8  How is the notice served?\n639.9  When may notice be given less than 60 days in advance?\n639.10  When may notice be extended?\n639.11  [Reserved].\n\n[[Page S4558]]\n\n     Sec. 639.1  Purpose and scope\n\n       (a) Purpose of WARN as Applied by the CAA.--Section 205 of \n     the Congressional Accountability Act, Public Law 104-1 \n     (``CAA''), provides protection to covered employees and their \n     families by requiring employing offices to provide \n     notification 60 calendar days in advance of office closings \n     and mass layoffs within the meaning of section 3 of the \n     Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, 29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2102. Advance notice provides workers and their \n     families some transition time to adjust to the prospective \n     loss of employment, to seek and obtain alternative jobs and, \n     if necessary, to enter skill training or retraining that will \n     allow these workers to successfully compete in the job \n     market. As used in these regulations, WARN shall refer to the \n     provisions of WARN applied to covered employing offices by \n     section 205 of the CAA.\n       (b) Scope of These Regulations.--These regulations are \n     issued by the Board of Directors, Office of Compliance, \n     pursuant to sections 205(c) and 304 of the CAA, which directs \n     the Board to promulgate regulations implementing section 205 \n     that are ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by \n     the Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (a) [of section 205 of the CAA] \n     except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause \n     shown . . . that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section''. The regulations issued by \n     the Board herein are on all matters for which section 205 of \n     the CAA requires a regulation to be issued. Specifically, it \n     is the Board's considered judgment, based on the information \n     available to it at the time of promulgation of these \n     regulations, that, with the exception of regulations adopted \n     and set forth herein, there are no other ``substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) [of section 205 of the CAA]''.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these sections and those of the Secretary \n     from which they are derived. Moreover, such changes, in and \n     of themselves, are not intended to constitute an \n     interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n       These regulations establish basic definitions and rules for \n     giving notice, implementing the provisions of WARN. The \n     objective of these regulations is to establish clear \n     principles and broad guidelines which can be applied in \n     specific circumstances. However, it is recognized that \n     rulemaking cannot address the multitude of employing office-\n     specific situations in which advance notice will be given.\n       (c) Notice in Ambiguous Situations.--It is civically \n     desirable and it would appear to be good business practice \n     for an employing office to provide advance notice, where \n     reasonably possible, to its workers or unions when \n     terminating a significant number of employees. The Office \n     encourages employing offices to give notice in such \n     circumstances.\n       (d) WARN not to Supersede Other Laws and Contracts.--The \n     provisions of WARN do not supersede any otherwise applicable \n     laws or collective bargaining agreements that provide for \n     additional notice or additional rights and remedies. If such \n     law or agreement provides for a longer notice period, WARN \n     notice shall run concurrently with that additional notice \n     period. Collective bargaining agreements may be used to \n     clarify or amplify the terms and conditions of WARN, but may \n     not reduce WARN rights.\n\n     Sec. 639.2 What does WARN require?\n\n       WARN requires employing offices that are planning an office \n     closing or a mass layoff to give affected employees at least \n     60 days' notice of such an employment action. While the 60-\n     day period is the minimum for advance notice, this provision \n     is not intended to discourage employing offices from \n     voluntarily providing longer periods of advance notice. Not \n     all office closings and layoffs are subject to WARN, and \n     certain employment thresholds must be reached before WARN \n     applies. WARN sets out specific exemptions, and provides for \n     a reduction in the notification period in particular \n     circumstances. Remedies authorized under section 205 of the \n     CAA may be assessed against employing offices that violate \n     WARN requirements.\n\n     Sec. 639.3 Definitions\n\n       (a) Employing Office.--(1) The term ``employing office'' \n     means any of the entities listed in section 101(9) of the \n     CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(9) that employs--\n       (i) 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees; \n     or\n       (ii) employs 100 or more employees, including part-time \n     employees, who in the aggregate work at least 4,000 hours per \n     week, exclusive of overtime.\n     Workers on temporary layoff or on leave who have a reasonable \n     expectation of recall are counted as employees. An employee \n     has a ``reasonable expectation of recall'' when he/she \n     understands, through notification or through common practice, \n     that his/her employment with the employing office has been \n     temporarily interrupted and that he/she will be recalled to \n     the same or to a similar job.\n       (2) Workers, other than part-time workers, who are exempt \n     from notice under section 4 of WARN, are nonetheless counted \n     as employees for purposes of determining coverage as an \n     employing office.\n       (3) An employing office may have one or more sites of \n     employment under common control.\n       (b) Office Closing.--The term ``office closing'' means the \n     permanent or temporary shutdown of a ``single site of \n     employment'', or one or more ``facilities or operating \n     units'' within a single site of employment, if the shutdown \n     results in an ``employment loss'' during any 30-day period at \n     the single site of employment for 50 or more employees, \n     excluding any part-time employees. An employment action that \n     results in the effective cessation of the work performed by a \n     unit, even if a few employees remain, is a shutdown. A \n     ``temporary shutdown'' triggers the notice requirement only \n     if there are a sufficient number of terminations, layoffs \n     exceeding 6 months, or reductions in hours of work as \n     specified under the definition of ``employment loss''.\n       (c) Mass Layoff.--(1) The term ``mass layoff'' means a \n     reduction in force which first, is not the result of an \n     office closing, and second, results in an employment loss at \n     the single site of employment during any 30-day period for:\n       (i) At least 33 percent of the active employees, excluding \n     part-time employees, and\n       (ii) At least 50 employees, excluding part-time employees.\n\n     Where 500 or more employees (excluding part-time employees) \n     are affected, the 33 percent requirement does not apply, and \n     notice is required if the other criteria are met. Office \n     closings involve employment loss which results from the \n     shutdown of one or more distinct units within a single site \n     or the entire site. A mass layoff involves employment loss, \n     regardless of whether one or more units are shut down at the \n     site.\n       (2) Workers, other than part-time workers, who are exempt \n     from notice under section 4 of WARN are nonetheless counted \n     as employees for purposes of determining coverage as an \n     office closing or mass layoff. For example, if an employing \n     office closes a temporary project on which 10 permanent and \n     40 temporary workers are employed, a covered office closing \n     has occurred although only 10 workers are entitled to notice.\n       (d) Representative.--The term ``representative'' means an \n     exclusive representative of employees within the meaning of 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7101 et seq., as applied to covered \n     employees and employing offices by section 220 of the CAA, 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1351.\n       (e) Affected Employees.--The term ``affected employees'' \n     means employees who may reasonably be expected to experience \n     an employment loss as a consequence of a proposed office \n     closing or mass layoff by their employing office. This \n     includes individually identifiable employees who will likely \n     lose their jobs because of bumping rights or other factors, \n     to the extent that such individual workers reasonably can be \n     identified at the time notice is required to be given. The \n     term affected employees includes managerial and supervisory \n     employees. Consultant or contract employees who have a \n     separate employment relationship with another employing \n     office or employer and are paid by that other employing \n     office or employer, or who are self-employed, are not \n     ``affected employees'' of the operations to which they are \n     assigned. In addition, for purposes of determining whether \n     coverage thresholds are met, either incumbent workers in jobs \n     being eliminated or, if known 60 days in advance, the actual \n     employees who suffer an employment loss may be counted.\n       (f) Employment Loss.--(1) The term employment loss means \n     (i) an employment termination, other than a discharge for \n     cause, voluntary departure, or retirement, (ii) a layoff \n     exceeding 6 months, or (iii) a reduction in hours of work of \n     individual employees of more than 50 percent during each \n     month of any 6-month period.\n       (2) Where a termination or a layoff (see paragraphs (f)(1) \n     (i) and (ii) of this section) is involved, an employment loss \n     does not occur when an employee is reassigned or transferred \n     to employing office-sponsored programs, such as retraining or \n     job search activities, as long as the reassignment does not \n     constitute a constructive discharge or other involuntary \n     termination.\n       (3) An employee is not considered to have experienced an \n     employment loss if the closing or layoff is the result of the \n     relocation or consolidation of part or all of the employing \n     office's operations and, prior to the closing or layoff--\n       (i) The employing office offers to transfer the employee to \n     a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting \n     distance with no more than a 6-month break in employment, or\n       (ii) The employing office offers to transfer the employee \n     to any other site of employment regardless of distance with \n     no more than a 6-month break in employment, and the employee \n     accepts within 30 days of the offer or of the closing or \n     layoff, whichever is later.\n       (4) A ``relocation or consolidation'' of part or all of an \n     employing office's operations, for purposes of paragraph \n     Sec. 639.3(f)(3), means that some definable operations are \n     transferred to a different site of employment and that \n     transfer results in an office closing or mass layoff.\n       (g) Part-time Employee.--The term ``part-time'' employee \n     means an employee who is\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\n     employed for an average of fewer than 20 hours per week or \n     who has been employed for fewer than 6 of the 12 months \n     preceding the date on which notice is required, including \n     workers who work full-time. This term may include workers who \n     would traditionally be understood as ``seasonal'' employees. \n     The period to be used for calculating whether a worker has \n     worked ``an average of fewer than 20 hours per week'' is the \n     shorter of the actual time the worker has been employed or \n     the most recent 90 days.\n       (h) Single Site of Employment.--(1) A single site of \n     employment can refer to either a single location or a group \n     of contiguous locations. Separate facilities across the \n     street from one another may be considered a single site of \n     employment.\n       (2) There may be several single sites of employment within \n     a single building, such as an office building, if separate \n     employing offices conduct activities within such a building. \n     For example, an office building housing 50 different \n     employing offices will contain 50 single sites of employment. \n     The offices of each employing office will be its single site \n     of employment.\n       (3) Separate buildings or areas which are not directly \n     connected or in immediate proximity may be considered a \n     single site of employment if they are in reasonable \n     geographic proximity, used for the same purpose, and share \n     the same staff and equipment.\n       (4) Non-contiguous sites in the same geographic area which \n     do not share the same staff or operational purpose should not \n     be considered a single site.\n       (5) Contiguous buildings operated by the same employing \n     office which have separate management and have separate \n     workforces are considered separate single sites of \n     employment.\n       (6) For workers whose primary duties require travel from \n     point to point, who are outstationed, or whose primary duties \n     involve work outside any of the employing office's regular \n     employment sites (e.g., railroad workers, bus drivers, \n     salespersons), the single site of employment to which they \n     are assigned as their home base, from which their work is \n     assigned, or to which they report will be the single site in \n     which they are covered for WARN purposes.\n       (7) Foreign sites of employment are not covered under WARN. \n     United States workers at such sites are counted to determine \n     whether an employing office is covered as an employing office \n     under Sec. 639.3(a).\n       (8) The term ``single site of employment'' may also apply \n     to truly unusual organizational situations where the above \n     criteria do not reasonably apply. The application of this \n     definition with the intent to evade the purpose of WARN to \n     provide notice is not acceptable.\n       (i) Facility or Operating Unit.--The term ``facility'' \n     refers to a building or buildings. The term ``operating \n     unit'' refers to an organizationally or operationally \n     distinct product, operation, or specific work function within \n     or across facilities at the single site.\n\n     Sec. 639.4 Who must give notice?\n\n       Section 205(a)(1) of the CAA states that ``[n]o employing \n     office shall be closed or a mass layoff ordered within the \n     meaning of section 3 of [WARN] until the end of a 60-day \n     period after the employing office serves written notice of \n     such prospective closing or layoff . . . ''. Therefore, an \n     employing office that is anticipating carrying out an office \n     closing or mass layoff is required to give notice to affected \n     employees or their representative(s). (See definitions in \n     Sec. 639.3 of this part.)\n       (a) It is the responsibility of the employing office to \n     decide the most appropriate person within the employing \n     office's organization to prepare and deliver the notice to \n     affected employees or their representative(s). In most \n     instances, this may be the local site office manager, the \n     local personnel director or a labor relations officer.\n       (b) An employing office that has previously announced and \n     carried out a short-term layoff (6 months or less) which is \n     being extended beyond 6 months due to circumstances not \n     reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff is \n     required to give notice when it becomes reasonably \n     foreseeable that the extension is required. A layoff \n     extending beyond 6 months from the date the layoff commenced \n     for any other reason shall be treated as an employment loss \n     from the date of its commencement.\n       (c) In the case of the privatization or sale of part or all \n     of an employing office's operations, the employing office is \n     responsible for providing notice of any office closing or \n     mass layoff which takes place up to and including the \n     effective date (time) of the privatization or sale, and the \n     contractor or buyer is responsible for providing any required \n     notice of any office closing or mass layoff that takes place \n     thereafter.\n       (1) If the employing office is made aware of any definite \n     plans on the part of the buyer or contractor to carry out an \n     office closing or mass layoff within 60 days of purchase, the \n     employing office may give notice to affected employees as an \n     agent of the buyer or contractor, if so empowered. If the \n     employing office does not give notice, the buyer or \n     contractor is, nevertheless, responsible to give notice. If \n     the employing office gives notice as the agent of the buyer \n     or contractor, the responsibility for notice still remains \n     with the buyer or contractor.\n       (2) It may be prudent for the buyer or contractor and \n     employing office to determine the impacts of the \n     privatization or sale on workers, and to arrange between them \n     for advance notice to be given to affected employees or their \n     representative(s), if a mass layoff or office closing is \n     planned.\n\n     Sec. 639.5 When must notice be given?\n\n       (a) General Rule.--(1) With certain exceptions discussed in \n     paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in Sec. 639.9 of \n     this part, notice must be given at least 60 calendar days \n     prior to any planned office closing or mass layoff, as \n     defined in these regulations. When all employees are not \n     terminated on the same date, the date of the first individual \n     termination within the statutory 30-day or 90-day period \n     triggers the 60-day notice requirement. A worker's last day \n     of employment is considered the date of that worker's layoff. \n     The first and each subsequent group of terminees are entitled \n     to a full 60 days' notice. In order for an employing office \n     to decide whether issuing notice is required, the employing \n     office should--\n       (i) look ahead 30 days and behind 30 days to determine \n     whether employment actions both taken and planned will, in \n     the aggregate for any 30-day period, reach the minimum \n     numbers for an office closing or a mass layoff and thus \n     trigger the notice requirement; and\n       (ii) look ahead 90 days and behind 90 days to determine \n     whether employment actions both taken and planned each of \n     which separately is not of sufficient size to trigger WARN \n     coverage will, in the aggregate for any 90-day period, reach \n     the minimum numbers for an office closing or a mass layoff \n     and thus trigger the notice requirement. An employing office \n     is not, however, required under section 3(d) to give notice \n     if the employing office demonstrates that the separate \n     employment losses are the result of separate and distinct \n     actions and causes, and are not an attempt to evade the \n     requirements of WARN.\n       (2) The point in time at which the number of employees is \n     to be measured for the purpose of determining coverage is the \n     date the first notice is required to be given. If this \n     ``snapshot'' of the number of employees employed on that date \n     is clearly unrepresentative of the ordinary or average \n     employment level, then a more representative number can be \n     used to determine coverage. Examples of unrepresentative \n     employment levels include cases when the level is near the \n     peak or trough of an employment cycle or when large upward or \n     downward shifts in the number of employees occur around the \n     time notice is to be given. A more representative number may \n     be an average number of employees over a recent period of \n     time or the number of employees on an alternative date which \n     is more representative of normal employment levels. \n     Alternative methods cannot be used to evade the purpose of \n     WARN, and should only be used in unusual circumstances.\n       (b) Transfers.--(1) Notice is not required in certain cases \n     involving transfers, as described under the definition of \n     ``employment loss'' at Sec. 639.3(f) of this part.\n       (2) An offer of reassignment to a different site of \n     employment should not be deemed to be a ``transfer'' if the \n     new job constitutes a constructive discharge.\n       (3) The meaning of the term ``reasonable commuting \n     distance'' will vary with local conditions. In determining \n     what is a ``reasonable commuting distance'', consideration \n     should be given to the following factors: geographic \n     accessibility of the place of work, the quality of the roads, \n     customarily available transportation, and the usual travel \n     time.\n       (4) In cases where the transfer is beyond reasonable \n     commuting distance, the employing office may become liable \n     for failure to give notice if an offer to transfer is not \n     accepted within 30 days of the offer or of the closing or \n     layoff (whichever is later). Depending upon when the offer of \n     transfer was made by the employing office, the normal 60-day \n     notice period may have expired and the office closing or mass \n     layoff may have occurred. An employing office is, therefore, \n     well advised to provide 60-day advance notice as part of the \n     transfer offer.\n       (c) Temporary Employment.--(1) No notice is required if the \n     closing is of a temporary facility, or if the closing or \n     layoff is the result of the completion of a particular \n     project or undertaking, and the affected employees were hired \n     with the understanding that their employment was limited to \n     the duration of the facility or the project or undertaking.\n       (2) Employees must clearly understand at the time of hire \n     that their employment is temporary. When such understandings \n     exist will be determined by reference to employment \n     contracts, collective bargaining agreements, or employment \n     practices of other employing offices or a locality, but the \n     burden of proof will lie with the employing office to show \n     that the temporary nature of the project or facility was \n     clearly communicated should questions arise regarding the \n     temporary employment understandings.\n\n     Sec. 639.6  Who must receive notice?\n\n       Section 3(a) of WARN provides for notice to each \n     representative of the affected employees as of the time \n     notice is required to be given or, if there is no such \n     representative at that time, to each affected employee.\n       (a) Representative(s) of Affected Employees.--Written \n     notice is to be served upon the chief elected officer of the \n     exclusive representative(s) or bargaining agent(s) of \n     affected employees at the time of the notice. If this person \n     is not the same as the officer of the local union(s) \n     representing affected\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\n     employees, it is recommended that a copy also be given to the \n     local union official(s).\n       (b) Affected Employees.--Notice is required to be given to \n     employees who may reasonably be expected to experience an \n     employment loss. This includes employees who will likely lose \n     their jobs because of bumping rights or other factors, to the \n     extent that such workers can be identified at the time notice \n     is required to be given. If, at the time notice is required \n     to be given, the employing office cannot identify the \n     employee who may reasonably be expected to experience an \n     employment loss due to the elimination of a particular \n     position, the employing office must provide notice to the \n     incumbent in that position. While part-time employees are not \n     counted in determining whether office closing or mass layoff \n     thresholds are reached, such workers are due notice.\n\n     Sec. 639.7  What must the notice contain?\n\n       (a) Notice Must be Specific.--(1) All notice must be \n     specific.\n       (2) Where voluntary notice has been given more than 60 days \n     in advance, but does not contain all of the required elements \n     set out in this section, the employing office must ensure \n     that all of the information required by this section is \n     provided in writing to the parties listed in Sec. 639.6 at \n     least 60 days in advance of a covered employment action.\n       (3) Notice may be given conditional upon the occurrence or \n     nonoccurrence of an event only when the event is definite and \n     the consequences of its occurrence or nonoccurrence will \n     necessarily, in the normal course of operations, lead to a \n     covered office closing or mass layoff less than 60 days after \n     the event. The notice must contain each of the elements set \n     out in this section.\n       (4) The information provided in the notice shall be based \n     on the best information available to the employing office at \n     the time the notice is served. It is not the intent of the \n     regulations that errors in the information provided in a \n     notice that occur because events subsequently change or that \n     are minor, inadvertent errors are to be the basis for finding \n     a violation of WARN.\n       (b) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``date'' \n     refers to a specific date or to a 14-day period during which \n     a separation or separations are expected to occur. If \n     separations are planned according to a schedule, the schedule \n     should indicate the specific dates on which or the beginning \n     date of each 14-day period during which any separations are \n     expected to occur. Where a 14-day period is used, notice must \n     be given at least 60 days in advance of the first day of the \n     period.\n       (c) Notice.--Notice to each representative of affected \n     employees is to contain:\n       (1) The name and address of the employment site where the \n     office closing or mass layoff will occur, and the name and \n     telephone number of an employing office official to contact \n     for further information;\n       (2) A statement as to whether the planned action is \n     expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire \n     office is to be closed, a statement to that effect;\n       (3) The expected date of the first separation and the \n     anticipated schedule for making separations;\n       (4) The job titles of positions to be affected and the \n     names of the workers currently holding affected jobs.\n\n     The notice may include additional information useful to the \n     employees such as information on available dislocated worker \n     assistance, and, if the planned action is expected to be \n     temporary, the estimated duration, if known.\n       (d) Employees not Represented.--Notice to each affected \n     employee who does not have a representative is to be written \n     in language understandable to the employees and is to \n     contain:\n       (1) A statement as to whether the planned action is \n     expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire \n     office is to be closed, a statement to that effect;\n       (2) The expected date when the office closing or mass \n     layoff will commence and the expected date when the \n     individual employee will be separated;\n       (3) An indication whether or not bumping rights exist;\n       (4) The name and telephone number of an employing office \n     official to contact for further information.\n\n     The notice may include additional information useful to the \n     employees such as information on available dislocated worker \n     assistance, and, if the planned action is expected to be \n     temporary, the estimated duration, if known.\n\n     Sec. 639.8  How is the notice served?\n\n       Any reasonable method of delivery to the parties listed \n     under Sec. 639.6 of this part which is designed to ensure \n     receipt of notice of at least 60 days before separation is \n     acceptable (e.g., first class mail, personal delivery with \n     optional signed receipt). In the case of notification \n     directly to affected employees, insertion of notice into pay \n     envelopes is another viable option. A ticketed notice, i.e., \n     preprinted notice regularly included in each employee's pay \n     check or pay envelope, does not meet the requirements of \n     WARN.\n\n     Sec. 639.9  When may notice be given less than 60 days in \n       advance?\n\n       Section 3(b) of WARN, as applied by section 205 of the CAA, \n     sets forth two conditions under which the notification period \n     may be reduced to less than 60 days. The employing office \n     bears the burden of proof that conditions for the exceptions \n     have been met. If one of the exceptions is applicable, the \n     employing office must give as much notice as is practicable \n     to the union and non-represented employees and this may, in \n     some circumstances, be notice after the fact. The employing \n     office must, at the time notice actually is given, provide a \n     brief statement of the reason for reducing the notice period, \n     in addition to the other elements set out in Sec. 639.7.\n       (a) The ``unforeseeable business circumstances'' exception \n     under section 3(b)(2)(A) of WARN, as applied under the CAA, \n     applies to office closings and mass layoffs caused by \n     circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the \n     time that 60-day notice would have been required.\n       (1) An important indicator of a circumstance that is not \n     reasonably foreseeable is that the circumstance is caused by \n     some sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition \n     outside the employing office's control.\n       (2) The test for determining when circumstances are not \n     reasonably foreseeable focuses on an employing office's \n     business judgment. The employing office must exercise such \n     reasonable business judgment as would a similarly situated \n     employing office in predicting the demands of its operations. \n     The employing office is not required, however, to accurately \n     predict general economic conditions that also may affect its \n     operations.\n       (b) The ``natural disaster'' exception in section \n     3(b)(2)(B) of WARN applies to office closings and mass \n     layoffs due to any form of a natural disaster.\n       (1) Floods, earthquakes, droughts, storms, tidal waves or \n     tsunamis and similar effects of nature are natural disasters \n     under this provision.\n       (2) To qualify for this exception, an employing office must \n     be able to demonstrate that its office closing or mass layoff \n     is a direct result of a natural disaster.\n       (3) While a disaster may preclude full or any advance \n     notice, such notice as is practicable, containing as much of \n     the information required in Sec. 639.7 as is available in the \n     circumstances of the disaster still must be given, whether in \n     advance or after the fact of an employment loss caused by a \n     natural disaster.\n       (4) Where an office closing or mass layoff occurs as an \n     indirect result of a natural disaster, the exception does not \n     apply but the ``unforeseeable business circumstance'' \n     exception described in paragraph (a) of this section may be \n     applicable.\n\n     Sec. 639.10 When may notice be extended?\n\n       Additional notice is required when the date or schedule of \n     dates of a planned office closing or mass layoff is extended \n     beyond the date or the ending date of any 14-day period \n     announced in the original notice as follows:\n       (a) If the postponement is for less than 60 days, the \n     additional notice should be given as soon as possible to the \n     parties identified in Sec. 639.6 and should include reference \n     to the earlier notice, the date (or 14-day period) to which \n     the planned action is postponed, and the reasons for the \n     postponement. The notice should be given in a manner which \n     will provide the information to all affected employees.\n       (b) If the postponement is for 60 days or more, the \n     additional notice should be treated as new notice subject to \n     the provisions of Sec. Sec. 639.5, 639.6 and 639.7 of this \n     part.

Mr. President, today I would like to honor a \ngroup of high school students who have embarked on a project that not \nonly enhances their educations but fosters their sense of civic \nresponsibility. Between April 27 and April 29, more than 1,300 students \nfrom all over the country were in Washington, DC, to compete in the \nnational finals of competition sponsored by a program called We the \nPeople, The Citizens, and the Constitution. I'm proud to announce that \nthe class from Hutchinson High School in Hutchinson represented \nMinnesota in the competition. These young people have undergone a \nrigorous course of study and worked diligently to reach the national \nfinals by winning local competitions in their home State.\n  The accomplished young people representing Minnesota are the \nfollowing: Adam Brodd, Megan Carls, Eddy Cox, Chris Dahlman, Aaron \nDouglas, Ben Froemming, Aaron Hall, Eric Holtz, Rana Kasich, Kristen \nMann, Aaron May, Mike Peek, Patrick Perrine, Terri Rennick, Chelle \nRobinson, John Sandberg, Dave Schaefer, Sara Sharstrom, Jill Shun, \nKelly Watson, and Michelle Wulkan.\n  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Mike Carls, who \ndeserves some of the credit for the success of the team. The district \ncoordinator, Jerry Benson, and the State coordinator, Robert Wangen, \nalso contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the \nteam reach the national finals.\n  The We the People program is specifically designed to educate young \npeople about the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. An evaluation of \nthis program has shown that students in the program display more \npolitical tolerance and feel more politically effective than most \nadults in America. Students become more interested in politics and they \nlearn how to get politically involved.\n  The 3-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing in \nwhich the students' oral presentations are judged on the basis of their \nknowledge of constitutional principles and their ability to apply them \nto historical and contemporary issues. In short, these students are \ndebating some of the very issues we've been debating on the Senate \nfloor in recent months: the division of power between State and Federal \nGovernment, the balance of power among the branches of government, the \nright to privacy, the role of religion in public life.\n  Through the We the People program, students learn the constitutional \nvalues of freedom, equality and justice, the principles that bind our \nNation together. These students have taken something that is an \nhistorical document and made it a part of their lives. In an era when \nso much of our public discourse is polarized, when there is so much \ndiscussion of ``us'' and ``them,'' these young people learn to value \nthe ``we'' of ``we the people.'' I wish these students the best of luck \nin the future and look forward to their continued success in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4562-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    JEFFERSON COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, twice a year, the Jefferson \nCounty Medical Society conducts a mini-internship program to inform and \neducate those outside the medical professional about the practice of \nmedicine. For 2 days, about 12 to 18 business professionals and \ngovernment officials are matched up with several Louisville physicians \nto watch them perform their jobs. Recently, Melissa Patack, a member of \nmy staff, had this unique and worthwhile opportunity. I ask that a \nsummary of her experience be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n  Jefferson County Medical Society Mini-Internship--April 16-17, 1996\n\n       On April 16 and 17, 1996, I participated in the Jefferson \n     County Medical Society's Mini-internship program. During the \n     course of the two days, participants accompanied physicians \n     in their usual activities and had the opportunity to observe \n     first-hand the practice of medicine.\n       On Tuesday morning, I met Dr. Kathryn Cashner, an ob-gyn \n     with a speciality in high risk pregnancies, at her office to \n     watch her morning appointments with more than a dozen women. \n     Dr. Cashner is a sole practitioner, with patients from all \n     socio-economic backgrounds. About one-quarter to one-third of \n     her patients receive Medicare benefits. This was a morning of \n     unusual normalcy, Dr. Cashner remarked. Virtually all of the \n     women were experiencing normal pregnancies, although several \n     of the patients were 4 to 6 months into their pregnancies and \n     seeing Dr. Cashner for the first prenatal visit. Dr. Cashner \n     counseled one woman who had a negative test result, but who \n     was immediately sent for a follow-up sonogram which turned \n     out to be normal. When I left Dr. Cashner at Audubon \n     Hospital, she was about to perform surgery on one of her \n     high-risk patients which would enable the patient to carry \n     her baby to full term. Dr. Cashner's practice brings her into \n     close contact with the lives of her patients; on one wall of \n     her office she displays pictures of all the babies she has \n     brought into the world.\n       The afternoon brought me to Jewish Hospital to observe Dr. \n     Thomas O'Daniel, a plastic surgeon, performing a face lift. \n     Watching directly over his shoulder, I saw Dr. O'Daniel \n     perform the delicate task of reconstructing a 57 year-old \n     woman's face. The operation was a grueling, pain-staking \n     procedure of more than 6 hours. Dr. O'Daniel concentrates on \n     facial injuries and gets a great deal of satisfaction from \n     the work he does on children. The next morning, he was \n     operating to correct a child's clef palate. Last fall, he \n     traveled to Guatemala, where he and his staff operated on 75 \n     children who suffered from clef palates and other facial \n     deformities.\n       In the evening, I went to University Hospital where I \n     watched Dr. Robert Couch run the night shift of the emergency \n     room. The evening brought everything from walk-ins seeking \n     routine medical care to the airlift of two victims from a \n     head-on automobile crash, probably caused by a driver who had \n     too much to drink. The residents under Dr. Couch's \n     supervision were poised for action when the helicopter landed \n     and two women with broken bones, head injuries and internal \n     bleeding were wheeled in to Room 9. Within moments, life-\n     saving actions were taken to get one patient breathing. X-\n     rays were immediately taken and the young doctors made snap \n     decisions on the treatment for these endangered patients. \n     These emergency room doctors don't have on-going \n     relationships with their patients. They treat and move on to \n     the next crisis with enormous dedication.\n       After an exhausting and exhilarating day, I returned the \n     next morning at 7:15 a.m. to Jewish Hospital to observe Dr. \n     Laman Gray perform a quadruple coronary bypass on a 67 year-\n     old man. One stands in sheer amazement at the sight of the \n     human heart beating in an open chest cavity. When it came \n     time for Dr. Gray to stitch the new bypass vessels to the \n     aorta, the heart was stopped and then brought back to its \n     rhythmic beating when Dr. Gray completed his delicate work. \n     Dr. Gray had another operation scheduled for the afternoon \n     and in-between, he was dealing with 2 other emergencies, \n     including arranging for the airlifting of a heart attack \n     victim from another state to Jewish Hospital for care and \n     treatment.\n       Wednesday afternoon, I accompanied Dr. Cindy Zinner on her \n     appointments at the Portland Family Clinic, a federally-\n     sponsored community health center. Dr. Zinner specializes in \n     internal medicine and pediatrics, and that afternoon, was \n     working as a pediatrician. The Portland facility fills a \n     unique role by being accessible not only to those covered by \n     health insurance (including Medicaid) but also to the working \n     poor who lack employer-sponsored health insurance, and who do \n     not qualify for Medicaid. In observing Dr. Zinner treat \n     several seemingly routine ear infections and perform a number \n     of well-child examinations, the highly important role for \n     preventive medicine becomes readily apparent. Dr. Zinner \n     becomes a positive force in the lives of these struggling \n     families.\n       These doctors, the residents, nurses and other assistants \n     with whom they work are dedicated to the care and treatment \n     of individuals from every part of our society. Each of the \n     doctors has chosen a very different career in medicine, but \n     all are devoted to the good health and life of the people \n     they treat. My experience was a significant educational \n     opportunity and I was privileged to watch these men and women \n     perform their work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4562-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4562-S4563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PRISON LITERACY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr President, you may remember that a few weeks \nago, I had an amendment on the floor to restore funding to the prison \nliteracy program. I hope that will stay in the final appropriations \nthat we agree to.\n  The need to do something on the question of illiteracy was emphasized \nin an editorial in the Chicago Tribune and by an excellent letter to \nthe editor from George Ryan, the Secretary of State in Illinois who, \nI'm pleased to say, has been a leader in literacy efforts.\n  I ask that the George Ryan letter be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                           Learning in Prison\n\n       Springfield.--The March 25 editorial titled ``The crime of \n     prison illiteracy'' correctly laid out the devastating \n     problem of low literarcy levels among prisoners in Illinois \n     and across the nation. Education is an\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\n     important factor in keeping people out of jail and in \n     reducing the number of repeat offenders swelling our prisons.\n       Boosting overall adult literacy levels has long been a goal \n     of mine. To this end, the secretary of state's office has \n     made a concerted effort to assist the Illinois Department of \n     Corrections and local law-enforcement officials in offering \n     literacy programs to as many inmates as possible.\n       Over the last three years, my office has funded volunteer \n     literacy tutoring for 6,107 inmates. There are currently \n     volunteer programs in 22 state correctional facilities and 30 \n     county and municipal jails.\n       In 1995, 785 community volunteers and inmate/peer tutors \n     helped Illinois prisoners raise their reading levels. More \n     inmates can be helped to overcome their literacy \n     difficulties, however, if more volunteer tutors were \n     available. I urge the citizens of Illinois to donate a few \n     hours of their time to a local literacy program.\n       In addition to these volunteer efforts, I have awarded a \n     $64,400 literacy grant to the Illinois Department of \n     Corrections School District 428 to fund reading programs at \n     the Dwight, Kankakee, Pontiac and Sheridan facilities and to \n     supplement literacy efforts at 13 other state correctional \n     centers. More than 430 inmates were served by these programs. \n     Test scores indicated that the reading levels of these \n     prisoners improved at a faster rate than the levels of other \n     adult literacy students.\n       As the Tribune pointed out, education is not a panacea for \n     reducing recidivism. But it is a proven fact that raising the \n     reading skills of inmates helps make them productive members \n     of society after they serve their terms and reduces the \n     chances that they will commit another crime.\n                                                   George H.

On Monday, May 6, \n1996, the town of New London will celebrate its 350th anniversary, \nmarking a milestone of historic significance to both the State and our \nNation.\n  And what a history New London has. The one-room schoolhouse in which \npatriot Nathan Hale taught prior to his hanging by the British as a \nRevolutionary War spy stands in Union Plaza as a testament to the New \nEngland grit with which the city has prospered for centuries.\n  Founded in 1646 by John Winthrop Jr., New London is situated in the \narea the Pequot Indians called ``Nameaug,'' or ``good fishing place.'' \nIndeed, after Winthrop negotiated with the Pequots, the new colony's \nlocale, New London, grew rapidly into a prosperous fishing and \nseafaring city on the west side of the Thames River.\n  Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the port of New London \nbustled with trading vessels carrying merchants and their goods between \nthe other colonies, Europe, and the Caribbean. With the barter of \nlumber and horses for sugar, molasses, and rum, as well active trade of \nother goods and plentiful fishing reserves, the local economy \nflourished. The whaling industry soon took hold, and by the mid 1800's \nwhaling was the local economy's mainstay. While that industry died \nquickly after whales became scarce, New London's whaling heritage is \nstill visible throughout town. New London later grew into a \nmanufacturing center, with silk mills and machine shops, and became a \nmajor banking, industry, and transportation hub with easy railroad and \nferry access up and down the East Coast.\n  New London's coastline location has not only been economically \nimportant, but also strategically key. In 1776 during the Revolutionary \nWar, the first colonial naval expedition sailed from New London, and \nlocal privateers beat the British at sea during the war. Although the \ntown was burned in retaliation, New London was rebuilt and the area \nbecame a vital test and training ground for America's maritime forces. \nThe U.S. Coast Guard Academy has been based in New London since 1910, \nand the city contributes much to nuclear submarine and Naval technology \nresearch and development via the many defense contractors based in the \narea.\n  Today, Mr. President, New London remains a busy eastern seaport city \nthat is home to a vibrant business community, several colleges, an arts \ncenter, and vacation resorts. And the same New England grit that \nbrought New London through the darkest days of the Revolutionary War \nsurvives.\n  For 350 years, the city of New London has contributed to the \neconomic, military, and cultural progress of the United States of \nAmerica. Its history precedes the founding of our Nation. Few American \ncities can lay claim to such a rich heritage, and as the motto for the \ncelebration indicates, this is a time for New London to rejoice in \n``Pride in the Past--Progress in the Future.'' I am proud to join the \ncitizens of New London and all Connecticut's citizens in celebrating \nthis special birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4563-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL FIRE SERVICE INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nsignificant efforts of the Congressional Fire Services Institute, \nincluding those of Executive Director Bill Webb and others, in \norganizing the Eighth Annual National Fire and Emergency Services \nDinner last night. Due to the tireless commitment of CFSI, this \nterrific event provided a highly appropriate opportunity to honor and \nthank the men and women of the fire service who risk their own lives \nevery day to protect the lives and property of others.\n  In the 8 years since its inception, the annual dinner has grown \nbeyond expectations, attracting an increasingly large number of friends \nand members of the fire service from across the country. It has \nattracted scores of dignitaries over the past 8 years including \nPresident Clinton who spoke at last year's dinner. Last night's program \nfeatured Vice-President Al Gore and majority leader Dole and a number \nof Congressional Caucus members from both sides of the aisle \ndemonstrating a continued bipartisan commitment and expression of \ngratitude to the fire service.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to commend the \nCongressional Fire Institute for its efforts in promoting fire related \nissues and in honoring the men and women of the fire service in a way \nthat reflects the grace and valor with which they protect us \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4563-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4563-S4564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DONALD MINTZ\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, America lost a real civic leader, \nLouisiana and New Orleans lost a political leader who believed in \ncooperation, not confrontation, and I lost a good friend far too early \nin his life.\n  Don Mintz lived a beautiful life, raised a beautiful family and had a \nwonderful wife Susan, who together contributed so much to so many.\n  I ask that an editorial on Donald Mintz that ran in the New Orleans \nTimes Picayune on April 30, 1996, which expresses the feelings of so \nmany, be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                              Donald Mintz\n\n       Donald Mintz, who died unexpectedly Sunday of a heart \n     attack, was a New Orleanian first and foremost. Though he \n     never held public office, Mr. Mintz set a highly public \n     example of how to be a citizen in our complex, multiracial \n     community. He was as much at home in a corporate boardroom as \n     in the humblest neighborhood.\n       He tried to connect our disparate worlds. He was a builder \n     of bridges between his black and white friends, a man of \n     faith nationally recognized for his work as a Jewish lay \n     leader and, most importantly, a dreamer of dreams, which he \n     worked with ferocious energy to realize. One of his fondest, \n     of becoming mayor of New Orleans, was unfulfilled after \n     unsuccessful campaigns in 1990 and 1994.\n       But even without the portfolio of office, Mr. Mintz was a \n     doer, a relentless actor and producer on the city's stage. \n     There was nothing lukewarm about him. Whatever caught his \n     interest had him thoroughly absorbed. And then he was \n     relentless, driven, sometimes brazen, always dedicated, \n     especially to New Orleans.\n       As Marc Morial, the man who defeated him most recently for \n     mayor, said: ``Above all, he was a committed New Orleanian.''\n       By his death at age 53, Mr. Mintz had well beyond a \n     lifetime's worth of accomplishments. He had been chairman of \n     the Anti-Defamation League's advisory board and achieved \n     national stature in this country's Jewish community; he had \n     been a founder of a law firm; chairman of the Dock Board, the \n     Downtown Development District, the United Way and the \n     Criminal Justice Task Force on Violent Street Crime, and \n     president of the Metropolitan Area Committee, Kingsley House, \n     Touro Synagogue and the Jewish Federation of Greater New \n     Orleans.\n       He was the managing partner of several Warehouse District \n     renovations, a member of the Archbishop's Community Appeal \n     campaign committee and a board member of The Chamber/New \n     Orleans and the River Region and the New Orleans Symphony.\n\n[[Page S4564]]\n\n       Between mayoral elections, he was passionate in his \n     leadership of the statewide committee that set up the \n     Louisiana Health Care Authority to run the Charity hospital \n     system and became chairman of the authority's board.\n       The activities bespeak involvement and dynamism, but they \n     don't describe Donald Mintz's spirit. With his wife, Susan, \n     he exuded a love of people, a love of life, a love of \n     community, a devotion to New Orleans. Coupled with this \n     tireless drive, the result is that he made a difference in \n     his hometown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4563-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GAMBLING IN THE SUNLIGHT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the New York Times has again hit the \nmark in a recent editorial supporting a national study of the economic \nand social impacts of gambling. The Gambling Impact Study Commission \nAct has received considerable attention as it makes its way through the \ncommittee process. Although the road has at times been bumpy, we are \nwell on the way to creating a commission with the powers it needs to \nproduce a balanced and fair analysis of legalized gambling.\n  In response to constructive criticism of the original bill, we have \nbeen hard at work crafting a substitute. Developed with bipartisan \nsupport, the substitute will take into account the legitimate interests \nof those whose livelihoods are invested in the industry as well as the \nconcerns of those who would prefer to limit the expansion of gambling.\n  However, we are quickly running out of time. The American public \ndeserves to know the advantages and disadvantages of legalized \ngambling. The Commission's report will be an important national \nresource for policymakers at all levels of government. In order to make \nthis happen, we need to move quickly to make room on the Senate \ncalendar and to insure the passage of the Gambling Impact Study \nCommission Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the editorial and to work with me to \npass this act before it is too late.\n  I ask that the New York Times editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 27, 1996]\n\n                        Gambling in the Sunlight\n\n       Just a few weeks ago, Representative Frank Wolf's proposal \n     to create a commission on the social and economic impact of \n     the nation's gambling explosion seemed just the sort of \n     virtuous idea that everyone in this partisan Congress could \n     support. In early March the House approved the nine-member \n     study panel without dissent. But the Virginia Republican's \n     proposal is in trouble in the Senate and may die there unless \n     the majority leader, Bob Dole, exerts leadership to rescue \n     it.\n       A special interest group known for its generous campaign \n     contributions--the Nevada-based gaming industry--has teamed \n     up with prominent and well-compensated Republican lobbyists \n     to try to stop the bill. With help from Nevada's Democratic \n     Senator, Richard Bryan, and Alaska's Ted Stevens, the \n     Republican chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \n     the effort seems to be succeeding.\n       Mr. Bryan blocked Senate action. Mr. Stevens, meanwhile, \n     has produced a weak revision that would deny the commission \n     the powers it needs to subpoena documents, convene \n     investigative hearings and make recommendations that go \n     beyond such obvious issues as native-American casinos and \n     gambling on the Internet. Angered by criticism, Mr. Stevens \n     last week decided, for now, against reporting any bill out of \n     his committee. The delay increases the chance that the \n     commission will die in the usual close-of-session legislative \n     logjam.\n       The social and economic consequences of the rapid \n     proliferation of casinos and state-run lotteries have \n     received too little attention. There is room for a \n     comprehensive look at the true costs and benefits for local \n     economies and at the relationship between gambling and crime. \n     There is also a need to look at the industry's role in \n     creating gambling addicts and the extent to which earnings \n     derive from problem gamblers. Even staunch supporters of \n     legalized gambling cannot object to a fair effort to give \n     localities the information they need to make informed \n     decisions before turning to gambling as a source of new or \n     increased revenue.\n       Although Mr. Dole has received hefty campaign contributions \n     from the gambling industry, he has indicated his support for \n     a national gambling study. To make it happen, though, he \n     needs to move quickly to make room for the bill on the Senate \n     calendar and to insure its passage with the commission's full \n     investigative powers intact. Among other things the \n     commission would study the gambling industry's ability to \n     influence public policy. The Senate's timidity is a case in \n     point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4564-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4564-S4566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A RECIPE FOR GROWTH\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention a recent article by Felix Rohatyn titled ``Recipe \nfor Growth,'' which appeared in the April 11, 1996, Wall Street \nJournal.\n  Although he is a traditional Democrat, Flex Rohatyn has long \nadvocated economic solutions and ideas that transcend political \naffiliation. And in a time when economic change and rising job \ninsecurity are causing more and more American families to find that the \npromise of the American dream is increasingly unattainable his views \ndeserve particular recognition.\n  Throughout my State of Connecticut, and the Nation as a whole, \nthousands of families are sitting around the kitchen table wondering \nhow are they going to pay their monthly bills. How are they going to \nmake their mortgage payments?\n  But the issue runs even deeper--to people's vision of the future. \nWill they have the money to send their kids to college? What happens if \nthey lose their health care? How can they prepare for retirement when \nthey barely have enough right now? These painful choices are leaving \nworkers anxious and scared for the future.\n  Let me be clear on one point: There are millions of Americans who are \nsucceeding in this economy. Since this administration took Office, the \nAmerican economy has seen the creation of 8.5 million new jobs, many of \nwhich are both full time and at an increased wage.\n  However, while a significant number of Americans are succeeding, this \nrising tide is not lifting all boats. Many Americans are still \nsuffering, and we must do more to deal with their plight.\n  Surely, there are no easy solutions to America's problems. We need to \nhave a debate on these issues. But, most important, we need to start \nfinding ways to increase economic growth be it through balancing our \nbudget, reforming our tax laws to create new jobs, relieving business \nof the burdens of wasteful regulation or lowering interest rates.\n  I share the view of many responsible members of the business \ncommunity who believe that our current growth rate of 2.5 per cent is \nfar below the Nation's true capacity for growth. Our economy is capable \nof enhanced growth, and we must do more to realize this goal.\n  The benefits of economic growth are clear: An increase of as little \nas one-half of 1 percent in the growth rate, would wipe out the \ndeficit, provide millions of dollars for tax cuts and create enormous \nemployment opportunities for millions of American workers. \nAdditionally, increasing economic growth would allow us to balance the \nbudget without the draconian cuts in education, the environment, \nMedicare, Medicaid, and other social programs that my colleagues across \nthe aisle have advocated.\n  Expanding economic growth may be the most important issue that faces \nour country and it is a challenge we all must undertake. Americans \nunderstand that when we all work together, from the public and private \nsectors to employers and employees we can face any challenge.\n  Felix Rohatyn's ``Recipe For Growth'' serves as an excellent \nblueprint for bringing genuine and real growth to the American economy. \nIf we are serious about expanding growth and bringing the promise of \nthe American dream to all our people, then I believe every Member of \nthis body should take the time to read this article and heed the advice \nof Felix Rohatyn.\n  I ask that Mr. Rohatyn's article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 11, 1996]\n\n                           Recipe for Growth\n\n                         (By Felix G. Rohatyn)\n\n       The American economy is now constrained by a financial iron \n     triangle, in part created by the Republican majority together \n     with the Clinton administration, from which it is difficult \n     to break out and which is beginning to generate serious \n     social tensions.\n       The first leg of this triangle is the commitment to balance \n     the budget in seven years. Even though there has never been a \n     rational explanation for this time frame, it has now become \n     part of the political theology. It would be as dangerous for \n     either party to depart from it, say by suggesting that eight \n     or nine years would be equally logical, as it was for George \n     Bush to abandon his ``No new taxes'' pledge.\n       The second leg is an extension of the first and is more \n     restrictive in its effect: It is the\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\n     acceptance, by both parties and blessed by the Congressional \n     Budget Office, that our economic growth rate will be 2.2% for \n     the seven-year period. Even though projections are \n     notoriously inaccurate even over much shorter periods, this \n     particular projection is becoming both a prediction and a \n     self-limitation. It implies that this rate of growth is the \n     limit of what our economy is capable of without inflation. \n     Since this view has the support of the Federal Reserve, the \n     Treasury and the financial markets, it has become a de facto \n     limit on economic growth. The markets and the Fed react to \n     any appearance of acceleration with higher interest rates and \n     the economy then falls back to 2.2% or below.\n       The third leg of this triangle is the impact of technology \n     and global competition on incomes and employment. THe lethal \n     political combination of corporation downsizing together with \n     ever-increasing differentials in wealth and income among \n     Americans of differing levels of education and skills, and \n     the huge rewards to capital as the result of the boom in the \n     securities markets, are creating serious social tensions and \n     political pressures.\n       Unless we can somehow break out of this iron triangle, we \n     could face serious difficulties, and the best hope for a \n     breakout is to make a determined effort for a higher rate of \n     economic growth. Only higher growth, as a result of higher \n     investment and greater productivity, can make these processes \n     socially tolerable. In order to deal constructively with the \n     realities of technology and the global economy. Democrats and \n     Republicans may have to abandon cherished traditional \n     positions and turn their thinking upside down: Democrats may \n     have to redefine their concept of fairness, while Republicans \n     may have to rethink the role of Government.\n\n\n                          economic insecurity\n\n       The American economy is growing very slowly despite \n     occasional upward blips. Growth and inflation are both around \n     2%. Our main trading partners, Europe and Japan, are \n     undergoing serious economic strains of their own, with German \n     unemployment nearing 10% and French unemployment near 12%. \n     Fiscal contraction is taking place on both sides of the ocean \n     as the Maastricht criteria are maintained in Europe and \n     deficit reduction continues as a priority here, feeding a \n     general sense of economic insecurity. The winds of deflation \n     could be stronger than the winds of inflation.\n       At the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is near \n     its all-time high of 5700, mergers and restructurings are \n     still taking place at a record pace, and layoffs and \n     downsizing are continuing as the inevitable result of global \n     competition and technological change. And Pat Buchanan has \n     created a political groundswell, on the left as well as on \n     the right, by identifying real problems but proposing \n     solutions based on fear, xenophobia, isolationism and \n     protectionism. It is frightening to think of the political \n     impact of a Buchanan if unemployment were now 7.5 percent \n     instead of 5.5 percent. All that it requires is the next \n     recession.\n       The social and economic problems we face today are varied. \n     They include job insecurity, enormous income differentials \n     significant pressures on average incomes, urban quality-of-\n     life and many others. Even though all of these require \n     different approaches, the single most important requirement \n     to deal with all of them is the wealth and revenues generated \n     by a higher rate of economic growth. John Kennedy was right: \n     A rising tide lifts all boats. Although it may not lift all \n     of them at the same time and at the same rate, without more \n     growth we are simply redistributing the same pie. That is a \n     zero sum game and it is simply not good enough.\n       The fact that our 2 percent-2.5 percent present growth rate \n     is inadequate is proven by the very problems we face. The \n     question of when, and especially how, to balance the federal \n     budget deserves a great deal more intelligent discussion than \n     the political sloganeering we have heard so far. The budget \n     is a document that reflects neither economic reality nor \n     valid accounting practices. If the budget is to be balanced \n     in order to satisfy the financial markets, only real \n     justification of this goal, then it must be done with growth \n     rather than with retrenchment. That higher growth, together \n     with controlling costs of entitlement like Medicare, Medicaid \n     and Social Security, will generate the capital needed to \n     provide both private and public investment adequate to the \n     country's needs.\n       Bringing the rate of growth from its present 2 percent-2.5 \n     percent to a level of 3 percent-3.5 percent would generate as \n     much as an additional $1 trillion over the next decade. It \n     could provide both for significant tax cuts for the private \n     sector as well as for the higher level of public investment \n     in infrastructure and education required as we move into the \n     21st Century. It would obviously generate millions of new \n     jobs. The present bipartisan commitment to balance the budget \n     in seven years, based on the present anemic growth, is \n     economically unrealistic and probably socially unsustainable. \n     In all likelihood, higher growth is in fact the only way to \n     achieve budget balance. The question is how to achieve it.\n       The conventional wisdom among most academic economists as \n     well as the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and Wall \n     Street is that our economy cannot generate higher growth \n     without running the risk of triggering inflation. Now \n     everyone shares that view. In particular, the leaders of many \n     of this country leading industrial corporations believe that \n     we could sustain significantly higher growth rates based on \n     the very significant productivity improvements they are \n     generating in their own businesses, year-after-year.\n       Economics is not an exact science as we have painfully \n     learned over and over again. It is the product of the \n     psychology of millions of consumers, of business leaders \n     making long term investment decisions, of capital flows \n     instantaneously triggered by events and ideas. We must do \n     away with the false notion that we must choose between growth \n     or inflation. Our experience, even in the more recent past, \n     shows that technology and competition can produce growth \n     without serious inflationary pressures. In the face of \n     today's totally new environment of almost daily revolutions \n     in technology combined with globalization, we should be \n     willing to be bolder, both in fiscal and monetary policy.\n       As a traditional Democrat, I have always believed that \n     freedom, fairness and wealth, basic to a modern democracy, \n     required an essentially redistributionist philosophy of \n     wealth, that a fairly steeply graduated income tax was \n     required as a matter of fairness and that lower deficits \n     would guarantee adequate growth and a fair distribution of \n     wealth. The experience of the last two decades, with the \n     advent of the global economy, has very much shaken that view.\n       Fairness does not require the redistribution of wealth; it \n     requires the creation of wealth, geared to an economy that \n     can provide employment for everyone willing and able to work, \n     and the opportunity for a consistently higher standard-of-\n     living for those employed. Only strong private sector growth, \n     driven by higher levels of investment and superior public \n     services, can hope to providing the job opportunities \n     required to deal with technological change and globalization. \n     Only higher growth will allow that process to take place \n     within the farmework of a market economy and a functioning \n     democracy.\n       We should have no illusions about the likelihood of \n     reducing the level of present income and wealth \n     differentials; they are likely to increase in the near future \n     as the requirements for skills and education increase. The \n     world is not fair; we must, however, make it better for those \n     in the middle as well as at the lower end of the economic \n     scale. The key is enough growth that, even if initially the \n     lower end does not gain as rapidly as the upper, it can \n     improve its absolute standard of living, and being a process \n     of closing the gap.\n       Higher growth requires a tax system that promotes growth as \n     its main objective. It must encourage higher investment and \n     savings. That is not the case today. Today's tax system aims \n     at a concept of fairness dictated by distribution tables. \n     That may not be the best test. A tax system with growth as \n     its main objective may be a variation of the flat tax; or it \n     may be a national sales tax; or it may be another system \n     aimed at taxing consumption instead of investment such as \n     proposed by Sens. Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici.\n       The power and dominance of global capital markets in \n     today's world would seem to aim in the latter direction. \n     Lowering taxes on capital would at first blush seem to help \n     the already wealthy, current holders of capital. But whatever \n     its effect on the distribution tables, it could unleash \n     powerful capital flows, both domestic and foreign, that would \n     lower interest rates significantly and make investment in the \n     U.S. even more competitive than it is today. At the same \n     time, they would maintain the strength of the dollar and \n     maintain low rates of inflation.\n       Achieving the objective of higher growth could also include \n     the gradual privatization of Social Security in order to \n     create a massive investment pool with higher returns for the \n     beneficiaries and greater investment capabilities for the \n     private and the public sector. The key to economic success in \n     the 21st Century will be cheap and ample capital, high levels \n     of private investment to increase productivity, high levels \n     of education and advanced technology. It also includes higher \n     levels of public investment in building a national \n     infrastructure supportive of the 21st century economy.\n       If the Democrats can redefine their concept of fairness, \n     Republicans, on the other hand, may have to abandon their \n     view of passive government. If growth and opportunity are to \n     be the prime objectives of our society, the government must \n     play an active role in some areas. The first is education; \n     the second is higher levels of infrastructure investment; the \n     third is in the maintenance of a corporate safety net.\n       Public school reform, driven by higher standards, is an \n     absolute priority. Even though that is a state \n     responsibility, it is a national problem. These standards, \n     regardless of today's political conventional wisdom, will \n     ultimately be national in scope. Access to higher education \n     should be made available to any graduating high school senior \n     meeting stringent national test levels and demonstrably in \n     need of financial assistance. The equivalent of the GI Bill, \n     providing national college scholarships to needy students, \n     should be created and federally funded. It should be the \n     primary affirmative action program funded by the federal \n     government.\n       As part of a higher economic growth rate, state and local \n     governments should provide higher levels of infrastructure \n     investment. In addition to the creation of private \n     employment, this could also provide public sector jobs to \n     help meet the work requirements\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\n     of welfare reform, as well as to provide the support to a \n     high capacity modern economy. Financial assistance from the \n     federal government would encourage the states in that \n     endeavor. Higher growth would enable federal as well as state \n     and local budgets to take on this responsibility.\n       A corporate safety net should be provided in order to deal \n     with the inevitable dislocations which corporate downsizings \n     and restructurings will continue to create. Business, labor \n     and government should cooperate to create a system of \n     portable pensions and portable health care to cushion the \n     transition from one job to another. Incentives should be \n     provided for business to make use of stock grants for \n     employees laid off as a result of mergers and restructuring. \n     If losing one's job creates wealth for the shareholders, the \n     person losing his or her job should share in some of that \n     wealth creation. Corporate pension funds, to the extent they \n     are overfunded as a result of the stock market boom, could be \n     part of a process to provide larger severance and retraining \n     payments for laid-off employees.\n       Other than in areas such as pensions and health care, it is \n     counterproductive to try to legislate the social side of \n     ``corporate responsibility''; it is almost impossible to \n     define. To begin with, most large U.S. corporations are \n     majority-owned by financial institutions including the \n     pension funds of the very employees who are in danger of \n     displacements. These institutions, driven by their own \n     competitive requirements, were the source of the pressures on \n     management which resulted in the dramatic restructuring of \n     American industry over the last decade. Those restructurings \n     have made American industry highly competitive in world \n     markets; they must continue and we must continue the opening \n     of world trade.\n       Boards of directors are not blind to the risks of political \n     backlash. The issue of executive compensation, made starkly \n     visible by its tie-in with the rise in stock market values, \n     will be dealt with responsibly or boards will find themselves \n     under great shareholder pressure. The use of profit-sharing, \n     stock options and stock grants to practically all levels of \n     the corporation will be significantly expanded and should \n     create greater common interests between executives, \n     shareholders and employees. However, the main role of the \n     corporation must remain to be competitive, to grow, to \n     invest, to hire and to generate profits for its shareholders; \n     a significant portion of employee compensation should be \n     related to the growing productivity of its employees.\n       The benefits to business in such an approach are obvious, \n     but labor also has a large stake in such a re-examination. \n     Some of the proposals put forth at present would have very \n     negative results for working Americans. It is too late to \n     return to a protected American economy; the only result would \n     be to trigger a financial crisis that would harm America and \n     our trading partners. It is impossible to stop the effect of \n     global information, technology, capital and labor. What is \n     important for working people, union or non-union, is the \n     creation of more well-paying jobs as a result of high levels \n     of investment and high levels of education; to share in the \n     profits of their employers through profit-sharing and stock \n     ownership; to share in the benefit potential of pension funds \n     vastly increased by the boom in the financial markets; to \n     have access to permanent health care security and to high \n     levels of education and training to deal with the 21st \n     century requirements.\n       Business and labor, together, should hammer out such an \n     agenda. If we are serious about balancing the budget in a \n     responsible manner, the president and the congressional \n     leadership could set a national objective that the economy's \n     rate of growth reach a minimum sustainable level of 3% \n     annually by the year 2000. They could ask the best minds in \n     the country, from government, from business, from labor and \n     from academia to provide a set of options which could lead to \n     such a result. Many of these options would be politically \n     difficult, both for Democrats and for Republicans, and some \n     would probably be impossible. But the only way to abandon \n     long-held notions that may no longer apply to today's world \n     is to discuss them within the framework of a very simple and \n     definite objective: higher growth.\n\n\n                        a different perspective\n\n       Setting the U.S. on a path to higher growth will require \n     coordination with our partners in the G-7. The Europeans \n     should welcome such an initiative since they are in greater \n     need for growth than we are. Nevertheless, the process will \n     be slow and it must be put into motion.\n       The President's setting an objective of higher growth would \n     have an important psychological impact; the economy is, after \n     all, heavily influenced by psychological factors. If the \n     president were to set an ambitious growth objective, then all \n     elements affecting the economy would be subject to review \n     from a different perspective. They would include fiscal and \n     monetary policy; investments and savings; education and \n     training; and international trade. Most importantly, these \n     activities should take place within a framework in which the \n     Democratic Party redefines its concept of fairness and the \n     Republican Party redefines its concept of the role of \n     government. At present, neither is appropriate for the \n     revolution that technology, globalization and the inclusion \n     of an additional one billion people to the global work force \n     will bring about tomorrow.\n       Ultimately, a rising tide will float all ships, and both \n     political parties can help bring this about. If they fail to \n     do so, at a minimum the present malaise will turn uglier, and \n     it is even conceivable that another tide will sweep away \n     existing parties. If that were to happen, arguments about \n     growth or fairness will be totally irrelevant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4564-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         STEVEN P. AUSTIN--1996 FIRE SERVICE PERSON OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 30 years ago, President Lyndon \nJohnson stated,\n\n       The American firefighter today must meet the challenge of \n     fires caused by numerous new chemicals, explosives, and \n     combustible fibers, and other dangerous materials. He must be \n     prepared to fight fires in crowded cities and giant \n     buildings, as well as in remote rural communities.\n\n  Today, we know that these challenges to the fire services have grown \nconsiderably. The greatest example, of course, being the tragedy in \nOklahoma City.\n  That is why today, Mr. President, I am honored to pay tribute to \nSteven P. Austin, who last night at the National Fire and Emergency \nServices Dinner, was named Fire Service Person of the Year.\n  Steve Austin serves as chairman of the National Advisory Committee \nfor the Congressional Fire Services Institute, working countless hours \nto meet the challenges faced by the fire and emergency services. He \nworks diligently helping those who help us in times of crisis.\n  Steve Austin may remember President Johnson's words back in 1966, \nbecause 3 years prior, Steve Austin began his service as a volunteer \nfirefighter. Today, he continues to respond to emergency calls as a \nmember of the Aetna Hose, Hook and Ladder Company of Newark, DE.\n  Along with his work as chairman and firefighter, Steve Austin, \ncontinues to serve as a fire claims superintendent for the State Farm \nFire and Casualty Company, external affairs representative for the \nInternational Association of Arson Investigators, chairman of the NFPA \nTechnical Committee on Fire Investigator Professional Qualifications, \nand as a member of the Delaware State Fire Police. In the past, he has \nbeen president of the New Castle County Volunteer Firemen's Association \nand also president of the Delaware Chapter International Association of \nArson Investigators.\n  During his distinguished career, Steve Austin has received the George \nH. Parker Distinguished Service Award, the Life Membership Award, and \nthe Presidential Award from the International Association of Arson \nInvestigators.\n  Steve Austin is committed to meeting the new challenges faced by the \nfire services. I am confident that as long as there are dedicated \npeople like him, the fire service will continue to serve us with the \nheroism, bravery and professionalism that we have all come to expect. \nIt is an honor to pay tribute to him today as a great leader, a great \nDelawarean, and a great friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4566-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4566-S4567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PAUL D. BARNES\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we are quick to criticize those who \nwork for our Government but rarely recognize the people who have \ndedicated long careers to making Government work better and more cost \neffectively for all of us. For that reason, I want to pay tribute today \nto Paul D. Barnes.\n  Mr. Barnes is currently the Regional Commissioner for the Social \nSecurity Administration's Chicago region. His fine service in Chicago \nwill end in late May, when he assumes his new position as Assistant \nDeputy Commissioner for Operations in Baltimore, MD. I am confident \nthat Chicago's loss will be Baltimore's gain as Mr. Barnes brings his \nstrong work ethic and demonstrated leadership to his new job.\n  Paul Barnes has served as Regional Commissioner for the Social \nSecurity Administration's Chicago region, which includes all six \nMidwestern States, since November 1990. As regional commissioner, he \nhas been responsible for providing executive direction and leadership \nto the region's 7,500 Federal employees and the 2,200 State employees \nwith whom they contract for disability determinations. These employees \nprovide Social Security services as well as administer the Supplemental \nSecurity Income Program for the 45 million people who reside in the \nregion.\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\n  Mr. Barnes began his career with the Social Security Administration \nin Columbia, TN in 1968. He has held a number of management positions \nsince joining the agency, including serving as director of the \nsoutheastern Program Service Center in Birmingham, AL from July 1987 \nthrough May 1989. Before taking the top post in the Chicago region, he \nwas serving as the deputy regional commissioner for the Atlanta region \nin Georgia.\n  He was a magna cum laude graduate of Lane College in 1968, and earned \na master's degree in public administration from the University of \nSouthern California. He currently serves as a member of the Executive \nCommittee of Chicago's Federal Executive Board. He has served as the \nfederal executive board's executive vice-president and in 1993, he led \nthe metro-Chicago Combined Federal Campaign to the city's first ever $3 \nmillion charity drive.\n  In 1995, Mr. Barnes received a Presidential Distinguished Executive \nAward from President Clinton in recognition of his efforts to meet the \nnational performance review objectives of producing a Government that \nworks better and costs less. In 1992, he received a Meritorious \nExecutive Award from President Bush and the Social Security \nAdministration's National Leadership Award.\n  Mr. Barnes has touched many lives in Illinois and he will be missed. \nI wish him the best of luck in the future and thank him for his support \nand dedication to the people of Illinois and our entire region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4566-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4567-S4568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING THE POLISH PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Committee on the \nJudiciary be discharged from further consideration of Senate Joint \nResolution 51, and further that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S. J. Res. 51) saluting and \n     congratulating Polish people around the world as, on May 3, \n     1996, they commemorate the 205th anniversary of the adoption \n     of Poland's first constitution.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, May 3 is a very important day for the Polish \npeople for it is on this day that they will celebrate the 205th \nanniversary of Poland's first constitution.\n  Last week, along with a number of my Senate colleagues on both sides \nof the aisles, I introduced a resolution commemorating this historic \noccasion. I am pleased that the Senate is acting today to unanimously \npass this resolution.\n  The Polish Constitution was the first is Eastern Europe to secure \nindividual and religious freedoms for all persons living under it. \nWhile it was short lived, its principles endured and it became the \nsymbol around which a national consciousness was born. When the \ncourageous people of Poland forced out their Communist oppressors, they \nreturned to the basic freedoms and principles contained in this \nconstitution.\n  Mr. President, this resolution is a manifestation of this Congress' \nstrong support for a free independent Poland. It is also a reflection \nof the deep and abiding friendship between Poland and the United \nStates.\n  I know that all of my colleagues join with me in congratulating \nAmericans of Polish descent and Poles all around the globe on this \nimportant occasion.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise as a cosponsor of \nthis resolution to commemorate the 205th anniversary of the adoption of \nthe first Polish Constitution.\n  Democracy is not a new idea in Poland. The heart and soul of Poland \nhave always been democratic. In 1791, the Polish people enacted the \nfirst liberal constitution in Europe since antiquity. It was the second \nconstitution in the world, after the American Constitution. The Polish \nConstitution was similar to ours. It included the principles of \nindividual liberty and a separation of powers. It stated that all power \nwould be derived from the will of the people--a truly revolutionary \nidea in 18th century Europe.\n  The friendship between the United States and Poland goes back to the \nRevolutionary War, when the great Polish patriot Tadeusz Kosciuszko \nfought in our war of independence. In fact, he helped to defend \nPhiladelphia as our constitution was being drafted. When he returned to \nPoland, Kosciuszko helped to defend his country from the invading \nRussians who feared their neighbor's growing commitment to democracy.\n  The Polish Constitution was in effect for less than 2 years. But its \nprinciples endured. Even while Poland was held captive behind the iron \ncurtain, the Polish people remembered and longed for liberty. Theirs \nwas the first country in Eastern Europe to free itself from communism \nand Russian domination.\n  Today, Poland is a free and independent nation--ready to take its \nrightful place as a member of NATO and the European Union.\n  Mr. President, I am so proud to be the first Polish American woman to \nbe a Member of the U.S. Senate. I am proud of my heritage, and what it \ntaught me about patriotism, loyalty and duty. And I am proud to join my \ncolleagues in paying tribute to the Polish people for their \ncontribution to democracy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 205th \nanniversary of the adoption of Poland's first constitution, which will \nbe celebrated on May 3, 1996. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senate \nJoint Resolution 51 which salutes and congratulates the Polish people \non this historic milestone.\n  The Polish constitution of 1791 established that ``all power in civil \nsociety should be derived from the will of the people.'' It marked the \nfirst attempt of a Central-Eastern European country to break free of \nthe feudal system of government. It was also the first constitution in \nthe region to uphold individual and religious rights for all people. \nEven though the constitution was in effect less than 2 years, the \nguiding principles that it put forth lived on in the hearts of the \npeople of Poland. These principles gave them strength in the dark years \nthat followed for Poland.\n  It is heartening to see the strides Poland has made in the past few \nyears as it reemerges into the community of free nations. I salute the \npeople of Polish descent in America who have contributed so much to our \ndemocracy and those around the world for the principles their forebears \nestablished in Central-Eastern Europe 205 years ago.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent the joint resolution be considered \nread a third time and passed, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider laid upon the table, and any statements appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record. I ask my statement be included.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 51) was considered read the third \ntime, and passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 51\n\n       Whereas, on May 3, 1996, Polish people around the world, \n     including Americans of Polish descent, will celebrate the \n     205th anniversary of the adoption of the first Polish \n     constitution;\n       Whereas American Revolutionary War hero Thaddeus Kosciuszko \n     introduced the concept of constitutional democracy to his \n     native country of Poland;\n       Whereas the Polish constitution of 1791 was the first \n     liberal constitution in Europe and represented Central-\n     Eastern Europe's first attempt to end the feudal system of \n     government;\n       Whereas this Polish constitution was designed to protect \n     Poland's sovereignty and national unity and to create a \n     progressive constitutional monarchy;\n       Whereas this Polish constitution was the first constitution \n     in Central-Eastern Europe to secure individual and religious \n     freedom for all persons in Poland;\n       Whereas this Polish constitution formed a government \n     composed of distinct legislative, executive, and judicial \n     powers;\n       Whereas this Polish constitution declared that ``all power \n     in civil society should be derived from the will of the \n     people'';\n       Whereas this Polish constitution revitalized the \n     parliamentary system by placing preeminent lawmaking power in \n     the House of Deputies, by subjecting the Sejm to majority \n     rule, and by granting the Sejm the power to remove ministers, \n     appoint commissars, and choose magistrates;\n       Whereas this Polish constitution provided for significant \n     economic, social, and political reforms by removing \n     inequalities between\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\n     the nobility and the bourgeoisie, by recognizing town \n     residents as ``freemen'' who had judicial autonomy and \n     expanded rights, and by extending the protection of the law \n     to the peasantry who previously had no recourse against the \n     arbitrary actions of feudal lords;\n       Whereas, although this Polish constitution was in effect \n     for less than 2 years, its principles endured and it became \n     the symbol around which a powerful new national consciousness \n     was born, helping Poland to survive long periods of \n     misfortune over the following 2 centuries; and\n       Whereas, in only the last 5 years, Poland has realized the \n     promise held in the Polish constitution of 1791, has emerged \n     as an independent nation after its people led the movement \n     that resulted in historic changes in Central-Eastern Europe, \n     and is moving toward full integration with the Euro-Atlantic \n     community of nations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That--\n       (1) the people of the United States salute and congratulate \n     Polish people around the world, including Americans of Polish \n     descent, as on May 3, 1996, they commemorate the 205th \n     anniversary of the adoption of the first Polish constitution;\n       (2) the people of the United States recognize Poland's \n     rebirth as a free and independent nation in the spirit of the \n     legacy of the Polish constitution of 1791; and\n       (3) the Congress authorizes and urges the President of the \n     United States to call upon the Governors of the States, the \n     leaders of local governments, and the people of the United \n     States to observe this anniversary with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4567-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 2, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, our current welfare system does not work \nbecause it is not based on the proven American formula for escaping \npoverty: A job. A strong family. A good education. Saving some money to \nbuy a home.\n  Instead, it undermines almost every value that leads to self-reliance \nand success. Poverty persists and 3 out of every 10 births are out of \nwedlock. Unbelievably, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is 80 percent in \nsome communities.\n  Within the past year, the U.S. Congress has twice passed Federal \nwelfare reform. President Clinton has vetoed it both times. Face it, \nPresident Clinton has preserved the current system which is trapping \nanother generation of Americans in despair and locking them out of the \nAmerican dream.\n  Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson refuses to allow this to happen. Last \nThursday, he signed into law a program replacing in Wisconsin the \nfailed national welfare system. It is called Wisconsin Works. The new \nprogram provides work opportunities and work programs. In order to help \nbeneficiaries get a job, it makes available child care and health care \nto all low-income families who need it.\n  As Governor Thompson stated:\n\n       After almost a decade of welfare reform experiments, \n     Wisconsin Works represents the end of welfare in Wisconsin. \n     The current aid to families with dependent children [AFDC] \n     program has become, for many families, a way of life. Because \n     the program does not require work or provide incentives to \n     become self-sufficient, it has trapped many families in \n     dependency. Wisconsin Works aims to rebuild the connection \n     between work and income and help families achieve self-\n     sufficiency.\n\n  Due to his experience, Governor Thompson knows what he is talking \nabout. He has made welfare reform a top priority by introducing more \nthan 10 reform initiatives and by working hard to fix the current \nWelfare-to-Work Program called JOBS. During his administration \nWisconsin's AFDC caseload has been reduced by more than 27 percent.\n  Wisconsin Works is the good news. Now let me give you the bad. The \nGovernor and the Wisconsin Legislature cannot deliver to the people of \nWisconsin this replacement for the failed system until President \nClinton and his administration give them permission. By twice vetoing \nFederal welfare reform passed by our Congress, the President has denied \nWisconsin and many other States the opportunity to put into place \nneeded reforms.\n  The status quo, which the President has preserved, requires Wisconsin \nto come to the Clinton administration on bended knee to ask Washington \nbureaucrats for permission to make adjustments to the current one-size-\nfits-all national welfare system.\n  No doubt about it, while welfare recipients remain trapped in the \ncurrent system, President Clinton will claim he has helped reform \nwelfare by granting States permission to experiment through controlled \ndemonstration programs known as ``waivers.''\n  The reality is these waivers are not the solution. We all know \nwaivers have brought us in the right direction. However, the waiver \nprocess perpetuates a flawed system. Real change will only occur when \nStates are released from the burden of excessive Federal rules and \nregulations. The waiver process is too costly, time consuming, and \nburdensome, often requiring months and months of negotiating between a \nState and the relevant Federal Cabinet agency\n  Earlier this year, all 50 of the Nation's Governors rejected the \nwaiver process in favor of comprehensive welfare reform. Their \nunanimously adopted policy would provide greater State flexibility to \nenhance States as ``laboratories of democracy'' while ensuring the \nnecessary State accountability to promote work, family, and individual \nself-sufficiency among welfare beneficiaries.\n  The national bipartisan Governor's welfare policy reflects the \nprinciples contained in both welfare reform bills passed by the \nCongress and vetoed by the President. I remain committed to working \nwith our Nation's Governors to accomplish real Federal welfare reform.\n  President Clinton has said that he is reluctant to return power to \nthe States because it will lead to a ``race to the bottom.'' As \nGovernor Thompson and the Wisconsin Legislature have proved, however, \ncompassion and innovation can go hand in hand. I congratulate them for \ntheir achievement, and I invite President Clinton to join with this \nCongress in moving power out of Washington and returning it to where it \nbelongs--our States, our communities, and our people.\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\n\n\n        UNITED STATES LOSES FIRST WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION CASE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the World Trade Organization has just issued \nits first decision in a trade case brought under the new dispute \nsettlement system.\n  The case was brought against the United States by Venezuela and \nBrazil. The allegation was that a U.S. environmental regulation, issued \nunder the Clean Air Act, discriminated against imported gasoline.\n  On Monday, the United States lost the case. President Clinton must \nnow decide whether to comply with the WTO decision. If he decides the \nUnited States should comply, he must announce a plan for doing so.\n  I believe the American people deserve an explanation from President \nClinton about this case. They deserve an explanation about what this \ncase might mean in the future for other U.S. laws and regulations.\n  Clearly there will be future WTO cases where the United States will \nbe the losing party. We cannot expect to win every case. Perhaps \nMonday's case was properly decided.\n  But it seems to me that our laws should continue to be a matter for \nAmericans, not international judges, to determine. We should decide \nwhat our environmental laws will be. We should decide what kinds of \nregulations are necessary to protect our environment. We should decide \nthat our children deserve cleaner air and purer water, not some \nbureaucrat in Geneva.\n  We do not always agree, and that is part of our democratic process. \nBut at least we work out for ourselves what laws and regulations are \nbest for America.\n  Mr. President, I believe President Clinton has simply failed to tell \nthe American people what his strategy is for defending other American \nlaws in the future from potential wrongful attack in the WTO. As far as \nI know, President Clinton has been silent on this question, one that is \ndeeply troubling to many Americans.\n  I have a strategy for defending American laws. I proposed a plan in \nJanuary 1995 that would ensure that the United States could withdraw \nfrom the WTO if our laws, and our rights, were being trampled in \nGeneva.\n  Many, many Americans shared my concern--that the WTO might begin to \noperate out of control, might begin to issue rulings that were outside \nits mandate, in short, that the WTO might abuse its authority. I was \nconcerned that if this were to happen, the United States would not have \nany adequate mechanism to deal with it. My proposal creates such a \nmechanism. It allows us to get all the benefits of the WTO, but \nprotects us against the potential harm should the WTO fail to honor our \nrights.\n  Unfortunately, my proposal has not yet become law because of some \nopposition--not much. There is strong bipartisan support for this \nproposal, but one of my colleagues on the other side has had a hold on \nthis bill several months, and we hope to move on it early this month or \nnext month.\n  President Clinton supports my proposal. In fact, he endorsed my \nproposal when I endorsed the GATT at the White House nearly 2 years \nago. I certainly would appreciate the President's help in getting this \nmeasure passed. I think it would be helpful to the President and to the \ncountry. It would answer a lot of concerns American workers have who \nare frustrated about the loss of American jobs.\n  So I hope we can have action on my proposal in the very near future \nwith the President's support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4568-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AFSA 35TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the Air Force Sergeants Association [AFSA] \nmarks the 35th anniversary of its founding today. I commend this \nassociation for all of its efforts on behalf of the entire military \ncommunity but, in particular, the enlisted component.\n  In 1961, AFSA was founded as a non-profit association to represent \nthe interests of Air Force enlisted members, who, at that time, had no \nvoice to speak for them. Over the years, AFSA's membership has grown to \n160,000 with nearly 300 chapters around the world. Today, AFSA \nrepresents active and retire enlisted Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and \nAir National Guard members and their families.\n  In my view, AFSA's reputation on Capitol Hill is better than ever, a \nbroker of honest information--whether through testimony, visits, or \ncorrespondence--working hand-in-hand with elected officials. AFSA has \nworked hard over the years to keep Members of Congress focused on the \nquality of the lives of the active and retired enlisted men and women \nAFSA represents.\n  AFSA was directly involved in championing improved pay and allowances \nfor active duty members, dental and income insurance programs for \nreservists, the restoration of military cola equity, the end of source \ntaxation, and the increase in the Social Security earnings limit.\n\n  Last fall, AFSA generated massive grassroots support to clearly show \nwhere military personnel stood on the ``high-one'' retirement \nrecalculation proposal.\n  AFSA also provides awards, grants and scholarships through the Airmen \nMemorial Foundation, AMF, established in 1983. In addition, the AMF has \na post-military employment program that aids Air Force members who are \nabout to retire or separate.\n  AFSA also believes in preserving the heritage and accomplishments of \nAir Force enlisted personnel. In 1986, AFSA founded the Airmen Memorial \nMuseum in Suitland, MD, which is a comprehensive reference center for \nAir Force enlisted history.\n  On the occasion of their 35th anniversary, I congratulate the Air \nForce Sergeants Association. I know that AFSA will continue to be an \neffective, strong, and dedicated voice for Air Force enlisted \npersonnel, active, reserve, guard, retired members, and their families. \nI thank the association for its successful efforts and look forward to \ncontinuing to work with AFSA on matters of mutual concern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4569-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, on tomorrow, I expect the Senate to \nconclude its action on the illegal immigration bill. During the earlier \ndiscussion on the immigration bill, I tried to take advantage of the \nopportunity to offer an amendment that would have raised the minimum \nwage 90 cents--45 cents this year, 45 cents the next year--90 cents for \nworking families. We were unable to get sufficient recognition to put \nthat proposal before the U.S. Senate, and the cloture motion was put \nbefore us, which effectively restricted our opportunity to take any \naction on the minimum wage.\n  A further cloture motion was offered, which further prohibits us from \nhaving considered the minimum wage, even if we had extended the time, \nwhich under the rules would have permitted debate and discussion for \nsome 30 hours.\n  So for this phase of the minimum wage debate, we will conclude \ntomorrow, through the decision of the Senate, action on the illegal \nimmigration bill and any opportunity to have the minimum wage amendment \nbefore the Senate.\n  Then we will move on to other business and, as I have stated at other \ntimes, as the minority leader, Senator Daschle, has stated, and as \nothers have stated--my colleagues Senator Kerry and Senator Wellstone--\nwe will look for the first opportunity to offer that amendment.\n  It is a rather poignant time, Mr. President, as we are having this \ndebate on the minimum wage, because in 1960, during the campaign of \nPresident Kennedy, one of the important issues was the issue of the \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  In the 1960 campaign against Richard Nixon, John Kennedy ran an ad in \nwhich he called for an increase in the minimum wage. And in the ad, he \nsat in front of the camera and said:\n\n\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\n\n       Mr. Nixon has said that a $1.25 minimum wage is extreme. \n     That's $50 a week. What is extreme about that? I believe the \n     next Congress and the President should pass a minimum wage \n     for $1.25 an hour. Americans must be paid enough to live.\n  I am reminded of the same issue before us today. This Friday, May 3, \nis the 35th anniversary of Bob Dole's vote against President Kennedy's \nlegislation raising the minimum wage from $1 to $1.25.\n  Bob Dole and Richard Nixon were wrong to oppose President Kennedy's \nminimum wage hike 35 years ago, and I believe Bob Dole and Richard \nArmey are wrong to oppose President Clinton's minimum wage hike today.\n  Mr. President, this issue has been debated and discussed. It is as \nold as some 60 years of our history. We know what the issues are: Are \nwe going to respect work? Are we going to honor work? Are we going to \nsay to men and women who are working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the \nyear that they ought to have a livable wage to be able to provide for \ntheir family, their children, to pay a mortgage, put food on the table, \nare we going to meet our responsibilities to those working families, \nwhich at other times we have done?\n  This issue will be before us again and again and again until we are \nable to meet our responsibilities to the working families in this \ncountry. That we pledge, that we commit ourselves to. And just as we \nfound that we were successful in raising the minimum wage in the early \n1960's from $1 to $1.25, all the way up to where it is at the present \ntime, we are going to be successful in raising it to $5.15 an hour as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/01/senate-section/article/S4569-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
