Mr. President, I am a bit of a railroad buff, and \nthere have been some recent changes relative to the operation of Amtrak \nthat I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues this \nmorning.\n  I think it is fair to say that it is important that we consider our \ntraditions, and how our traditions have really brought us together as a \nnation and preserved the fabric of our culture.\n  It has been 30 years ago that we switched our telephones from \nexchange names to all-digit dialing. I think it is fair to say that \nwhile it increased the efficiency, it lost some of its personality. I \nrecall we had Black 789, White 243, Green 910. We had an operator who \n\n[[Page S544]]\nwould occasionally talk to you if you had a problem. Yet, this change \nwas necessary because of the expansion of telephone service and it \nproduced economic efficiencies.\n  However, Mr. President, I note with sadness the decision of Amtrak to \nstop using the historical and traditional names for train service in \nthe Northeast corridor. Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported \nthat Amtrak had decided that, for the Yankee Clipper, along with the \ntrain called the Mohawk, the train called the Mayflower, the train \ncalled the Connecticut Yankee, the overnight train to Boston, the Night \nOwl, and nearly all the other traditional names will no longer be used. \nIn their place, nearly all of Amtrak's Northeast corridor trains will \nbe referred to as the Northeast Direct, followed by a number such as \n142, 147, 148. I really cannot understand this decision because I \ncannot see where it necessarily affects the efficiency or service to \nthe public.\n  A spokeswoman for Amtrak was quoted as saying these names are a \ncolorful part of the past but really not helpful today. According to \nthe spokeswoman, ``If you hear `the Catskill,' it doesn't really tell \nyou where you're going,'' and that may be true, but certainly the \nNortheast Direct 147 tells travelers even less. At least the \nConnecticut Yankee suggests the train is headed to New England; the \nNortheast Direct 147 really tells you nothing. You do not know where it \nis headed.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I wrote to the president of Amtrak, Mr. Tom \nDowns, and urged Amtrak to reconsider this decision. Again, I appeal to \nAmtrak in the sense that these are names that are part of the American \nheritage. I think it is a heritage and tradition that is partially a \npublic trust, if you will. Unilaterally deciding to change these names, \nI guess, would be equivalent, perhaps, to having the Interior \nDepartment redesignate Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks as \nWestern Park 1, Western Park 2, and perhaps Acadia National Park as \nEastern Park 4.\n  Since 1971, Amtrak has received about $13 billion in Federal funding \nto help cover its operating and labor costs. Legislation which is \ncurrently on the Senate calendar, S. 1395, would establish an intercity \npassenger rail trust fund. The lion's share of whose funds would go to \nAmtrak. The proposal calls for Amtrak to receive more than $2 billion \nover the next 4 years.\n  In my opinion, Amtrak has made a mistake in changing the names of the \nhistoric trains of the Northeast corridor by replacing them with \nnumbers. I urge Amtrak to reverse this decision.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter \nwhich I sent to Amtrak's president be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 1996.\n     Mr. Thomas Downs,\n     President, Amtrak, 60 Massachusetts Avenue NE, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Downs. The Thursday, January 25 edition of the \n     Wall Street Journal reports that Amtrak has decided to stop \n     using the traditional names for train service in the \n     Northeast corridor. In conversations with Amtrak officials, \n     my staff has confirmed that Amtrak has decided that the \n     ``Yankee Clipper,'' ``The Mohawk,'' ``Mayflower,'' \n     ``Connecticut Yankee,'' the overnight to Boston, ``The Night \n     Owl,'' and nearly all the others, will no longer be used.\n       It appears that nearly all of Amtrak's Northeast corridor \n     trains will be referred to as ``Northeast Direct'' followed \n     by a number such as 142 or 147. Quite frankly, I cannot \n     understand this decision.\n       A spokeswoman for Amtrak was quoted as saying that these \n     names were colorful, but not helpful. According to this \n     spokeswoman, ``if you hear `the Catskill,' it doesn't really \n     tell you where you're going.'' That may be true. But \n     certainly, Northeast Direct 147 tells travelers even less. At \n     least, the Connecticut Yankee suggests the train is headed to \n     New England. Northeast Direct 147 tells you nothing.\n       Mr. Downs, I urge you immediately reconsider this decision. \n     These names are part of tradition. And it is a tradition that \n     is partially a public trust. It is nearly equivalent to \n     having the Interior Department redesignate Yellowstone and \n     Yosemite National Parks as Western Parks 1 and 2.\n       As you know, since 1971, Amtrak has received $13 billion in \n     federal funding to help cover its operating capital and labor \n     costs. Legislation that is currently on the Senate calendar \n     (S. 1395) would establish an Intercity Passenger Rail Trust \n     Fund, the lion's share of whose funds would go to Amtrak. The \n     proposal calls for Amtrak to receive more than $2 billion \n     over the next four years.\n       I believe Amtrak has made a mistake and I believe you ought \n     to fix it immediately.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S543-8", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S544-S545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INCREASE IN THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to talk briefly about \nanother matter that this body is going to be asked to address in the \nvery near future, and that is to increase the debt ceiling.\n  As the President and my colleagues know, the authorization to issue \ndebt is limited with a cap. And that cap is $4.9 trillion. It is a debt \nso inconceivable that no one can comprehend how large $4.9 trillion is.\n  Currently, Mr. President, we are looking in the fiscal year just \nended at a deficit of about $165 billion. That is a significant figure. \nBut we cannot stop there because there is a further application of \ninterest, and the interest cost on the $4.9 trillion is about $235 \nbillion. And it should be noted that currently interest rates are \nrelatively low. The effective rate of interest is probably somewhere in \nthe area of 5.5 to 6.5 percent on this $4.9 trillion.\n  Back in December 1980, the prime rate in the United States was 20.5 \npercent. One can only visualize what the interest cost would be. And \nthis interest has to be paid because the individuals who hold Treasury \nnotes, instruments of debt issued by the Government, have to be paid \nnot only principal but interest. But to suggest that we are currently \npaying an effective rate of somewhere between 5 or 6 or 6.5, or \nthereabout--the fact is that interest rates could rise as they have in \nthe past, which would have a disastrous effect on the economic vitality \nof this Nation.\n  So, if we look at the accumulated debt that we are carrying, the $4.9 \ntrillion, recognizing that each year we spend more than we generate in \nrevenues, and add to that, we are faced with the reality that within a \nrelatively short period of time we are going to have to increase that \nthe debt ceiling. We are going to have to increase that authorization \nsomewhere, we are told, of up to $5.3, or $5.4, or $5.5, or $5.6 \ntrillion for a term of perhaps 18 months, and then we are going to have \nto do it again.\n  So my point is we are continuing to increase the indebtedness of this \nNation. I am told that for a person being born today, his or her share \nof the debt is somewhere in the area of $150,000, to $175,000. That is \ngoing to increase unless we do something drastic and turn it around.\n  We have been talking for a long time about a balanced budget. \nEverybody, including the White House, supports a balanced budget, a \nmandatory balanced budget, a process that will get us there. And we \nhave talked about a 7-year ascension. We have had, I think, five \nproposals from the administration. The first one did not get one vote \nin the U.S. Senate. The last one really makes the lion's share of the \ncuts in the sixth and seventh years. That is pretty hard to accept \nbecause we know that Congress is not going to have the self-discipline \nin 6 or 7 years to make those draconian cuts. We know that President \nClinton, even if he were to be reelected is not going to be in office \nin 2001 and 2002 when reality will hit.\n  So we are going into this period of debate on increasing the debt \nfrom $4.9 trillion at a time when we are adding $165 billion in \ndeficits each year, and we do not have a way out. When I say ``a way \nout,'' we do not have a commitment to a real balanced budget in 7 years \nbecause the last proposal by the White House was not real. The press \nand the public do not seem to accept that it was not real in terms of \nall the cuts in the sixth or seventh year as opposed to proportional \nreductions in each of the 7 years.\n\n  It is like taking medicine, Mr. President. You have to take it \nanyway. If you take it up front and get it over with through the \nprocess, why, hopefully, you can reach a cure. If you have to take it \nwhen you get too sick, sometimes it might not cure you.\n  Furthermore, I think it is fair to say that during the extended \ndebate to try to reach a balanced budget, the Republicans were blamed \nfor shutting down \n\n[[Page S545]]\nthe Government. For reasons that I find a little hard to understand, \nthere was not a recognition that this was a shared responsibility. It \nwas as much the responsibility of the White House as it was Members of \nCongress because the President vetoed the reconciliation package which \nwould have basically kept the Government going. He vetoed about six of \nthe appropriations bills and signed the others. Those would have funded \nthe Government.\n  So the responsibility is very much that of the executive branch--the \nPresident and the White House--as we reflect on the last attempt at a \nfiscally responsible effort to try to address what the public wants, \nwhat we know is good for the country, and that is the realistic \nbalanced budget process. Unfortunately, that process, in the opinion of \nthe Senator from Alaska, has failed as a consequence of the inability \nof the administration to recognize that we simply have to reduce the \nrate of growth of Government. That does not mean we have to cut \nprograms. We simply reduce the rate of growth.\n  That was so evident in the debate over Medicare. We are not cutting \nMedicare payments. Medicare payments would increase each year. But the \nrate of growth would be reduced from nearly 10 percent to somewhere in \nthe area of 6 percent.\n  So, Mr. President, again as we reflect on where we are, and the \ncoming crisis with the debt ceiling, it is a responsibility of the \nadministration and the President to recognize that it is not in the \ninterest of the country to proceed with a debt ceiling increase without \na realistic way to address a process that will achieve a balanced \nbudget in 7 years.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reflect on just where we are going and the \nsignificance that. If we all believe in a balanced budget and we still \ndo not have the self-discipline in the process to recognize that \nsomehow we are going to have to achieve a balanced budget in a \nmeaningful way and we have at the same time the obligation to increase \nthe debt authorization of this country--there is a direct connection \nbetween the two. If we believe in a balanced budget, we should know \nthat to increase the debt authorization without a realistic way of \nbalancing the budget is basically irresponsible in the long-term for \nthe fiscal and monetary policy of this country.\n  Our debt has to be brought under control and the spiral of its \nincrease has to be reversed. And we run the risk of increased interest \nrates on that debt. So, Mr. President, we should make the necessary \ncorrections now by having as part of the debt ceiling increase a \nrealistic accord on a balanced budget process that is meaningful and \nachievable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all quorum calls during \nthe designated period for morning business be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alaska suggest the \nabsence of a quorum?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the minority \nleader and our Democratic caucus to ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of the bill to increase \nthe debt limit. I will explain in just a moment my intention and the \nreason I offer this unanimous-consent request.\n  All of us understand what we have just been through in this past \nyear. We have been through a pretty difficult time. We have struggled \nas between different philosophies on a range of issues, and we have \nseen Government shutdowns on two occasions. We have seen and heard \npeople boast about potentially not extending the debt limit and causing \na default on the debt. So we have been through a very difficult period.\n  I think most Members on both sides of the aisle would like very much \nnever to see that repeated. I do not know of anyone who has a continued \nappetite to see another Government shutdown. I frankly do not know of \nanyone who, at this point, thinks it would be a good idea if this \ncountry were to default on its debt. And yet, we are now at about \nFebruary 1 and at the end of this month, the Secretary of the Treasury \nindicates that he will not have the resources with which to meet the \nrequirements to repay the bonds that exist, and there would be a \ndefault unless the debt limit is extended.\n  Some say, ``Well, let us wait until the end of February, until we \nhave done certain things to find a way to reach an agreement between \nthis party and the other party.'' I understand that, and I understand \nthe reason why some would like to postpone this for a while.\n  On the other hand, there are others of us who are anxious that we \nmove as quickly as we can to get something into a conference so we have \nsome movement on extending the debt limit, so we can tell the people of \nthis country that we are working on it and making progress on it. To \nwait for the final 3, 4 days or the final week prior to the need for a \ndebt limit extension, prior to default, does, it seems to me, given the \ncircumstances of the last year, create a condition that could provide \nsome risk. That is why some of us feel that this would be the time to \nmove a piece of legislation that would increase the debt limit and move \nthat into a conference.\n  So with that purpose in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of a bill, now at the desk, to \nincrease the debt limit, that the bill be read a third time and passed \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader and Senator from \nMississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly understand why the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota would make this effort at this time. I point \nout, I still believe, I still hope that there is an opportunity for a \nbudget agreement. I am an incurable optimist. The President has \nindicated he is willing to continue that effort. I know there are \ninformal discussions going on at the staff level.\n  The problem with debt limits, as the Senator well knows from his days \nin the House in particular, even in the Senate, is that there are some \nSenators and some Congressmen who would prefer not to vote for a debt \nlimit going over $5 trillion for the first time in history until there \nis some guarantee that there is going to be fiscal restraint, that \nthere is some budget agreement that will control the rate of growth of \nspending, control the annual deficits and the debt.\n  If there is any hope that we might get an agreement, then certainly a \ngood place to consider putting that would be on the debt limit. Plus, \nthere also continues to be an effort across the aisle in a bipartisan \nway, in the House and Senate, to come to a bipartisan coalition \nagreement. It looks to me like good progress has been made in that \narea. \n\n[[Page S546]]\n\n  I have looked at the numbers from the coalition group and the numbers \nin the House and both of them are actually better than the results of \nthe discussions between the President and the leaders in Congress from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  That may be the way to do this: Get a budget No. 3 that we can vote \non that would have broader bipartisan support than we had earlier. Once \nagain, maybe put it on the debt limit and move it forward. Or in \naddition to that, I do know the House is meeting this week and they are \nlooking at other alternatives as to how that might be considered.\n  So, in an effort to get it through the House and get it through the \nCongress and get it to the President, we want to make sure we thought \nit through carefully, have done it right. We do not want to go through \na futile exercise of getting something to the President he will veto.\n  I assume there is a time sensitivity, although the Secretary of the \nTreasury indicated there were going to be real problems last November, \nand while he was working to avoid those problems, now we do not really \nknow where the problem does develop. Is it the middle of February, the \nfirst of March, middle of March, or can we go on indefinitely by \nactions of the Secretary of the Treasury?\n  I do not think he can go on indefinitely, but I do know that the \nintention of the majority leader is that we act on this in a timely \nfashion, and the House and the Speaker are acting on some legislation \nthat will allow us to act probably the week of February 26, maybe \nbefore that. If we can come to some sort of agreement, maybe we can do \nit before that.\n  But I think just to move it here at this point would be a futile \nexercise and maybe even would be unhelpful in trying to get an \nagreement.\n  So at this point, Mr. President, I object to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Mississippi is absolutely \ncorrect that a logical place to increase the debt limit would be in a \nbudget agreement, and if there is a budget agreement--and I hope there \nis--then obviously the debt limit should be increased in that \nagreement.\n  The dilemma is, the Moody's organization last week served notice \npublicly, because of the potential of a default, because of the \npotential that perhaps the debt limit will not be extended, because of \nthe potential that there might be some who want to use the debt limit \nas leverage, and the ultimate leverage, of course, being default if \nthere is not a budget agreement, because of that, Moody's has indicated \nthey are taking a look at whether to downgrade the creditworthiness of \nU.S. Government bonds.\n  It seems to me that ought to be a warning to all of us that we ought \nnot fool around with this question of the grading of Government bonds \nand the creditworthiness of Government bonds.\n  This is a very important issue. The Senator from New York, Senator \nMoynihan, has spoken at some length on it. I say to the Senator from \nMississippi, I know that Senator Dole is not in any way suggesting that \nhe would want to default. In fact, I do not think Senator Dole felt \nthat the Government shutdowns were the way to run the Government. So I \nam not suggesting that there are those whom we are discussing at this \npoint who believe this would be a wise course. I think there are some \nin the Congress who probably have said in the past, ``It does not \nmatter to us if we do not pay the bondholders 30 or 60 days \nafterward,'' the implication of that suggesting that default certainly \nis an option as one of the pieces of learning we will use in the \nnegotiations.\n  So many of us feel that rather than waiting until it is too late, let \nus start early here and be offering some UC requests to see if we \ncannot move this along. I know the minority leader has indicated that \nwhen the Senate is in session during this month, he feels that we \nshould be offering requests. I am offering this on his behalf today to \nextend the debt limit. And, again, I understand the reasons for the \nobjection today. My hope would be that in the days ahead we will find a \nway to advance this through the Senate and go to conference so we can \nsend a message to the country and the world that no one around here \nwill play with the creditworthiness of this country. No one will use \nthe issue of default as leverage in this context. I think most of us \nbelieve that would be terribly, terribly risky, and a very \nunsatisfactory outcome.\n  So I understand the point the Senator from Mississippi has made. I \nhope he understands why I have offered this today. He would expect to \nsee it offered again in the days ahead when the Senate is in session.\n  I would like to, if I might, Mr. President, propound a question to \nthe Senator from Mississippi. Although we are in session today----\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield first, because I think he is \nfixing to change the subject, I want to get this into the Record.\n  I think there is some question, also, just for the information of the \nSenators, about the Senate acting first on a clean debt ceiling, \nwhether this is a revenue effort under those conditions and therefore \nsubject to a point of order. I make that observation. I am not pursuing \nit at this point.\n  For the information of the Senate, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record at this point the history, going back to 1984 \nthrough 1990, of how debt ceilings were extended and the riders that \nwere added to those debt ceiling bills in order for them to be able to \ncomplete and go through the process.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Legislative Riders on Past Debt Limit Extensions\n\n\n                            1990--H.R. 5355\n\n       Passed by the House, but not by the Senate. Would have \n     increased the debt ceiling by $322 billion to $3.444 \n     trillion. Rider: Amended the rules on sequestration to exempt \n     Social Security.\n\n\n                            1989--H.R. 3024\n\n       Increased the debt ceiling by $70 billion for the period \n     from August 7, 1989, through October 31, 1989. Rider: Made \n     changes regarding the current accrual value of certain \n     obligations issued on a discount basis.\n\n\n                          1989--H.J. Res. 280\n\n       Increased the debt ceiling to $3.1227 trillion. Rider: \n     Repealed Section 89 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to \n     health benefits provided under certain discriminatory \n     employee benefit plans).\n\n\n                          1987--H.J. Res. 324\n\n       Increased the debt ceiling to $2.8 trillion. Rider: Gramm-\n     Rudman II, which contained provisions relating to \n     sequestration, overall budget caps, and budget process \n     reform.\n\n\n                          1986--H.J. Res. 668\n\n       Increased the debt ceiling by $189 billion for the period \n     from October 21, 1986, through May 15, 1987. Rider: This debt \n     limit was attached to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \n     of 1986.\n\n\n                          1985--H.J. Res. 372\n\n       Increased the debt limit to $2.0787 trillion. Rider: Gramm-\n     Rudman Deficit Control Act, which contained provisions \n     relating to sequestration and set overall budget caps.\n\n\n                            1985--H.R. 3721\n\n       Increased the debt ceiling to an amount no greater than \n     $1.9038 trillion for the period from November 14, 1985, to \n     December 6, 1985. Rider: Contained riders that delayed the \n     effective dates of the following provisions by one month: Tax \n     increase on cigarettes; section 285 of the Trade Act of 1974; \n     section 10(d) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and, \n     section 5(c) of the Emergency Extension Act of 1985.\n\n\n                            1984--H.R. 5692\n\n       Increased the debt ceiling by $30 billion to $1.520 \n     trillion. Riders: Allowed the Treasury to hire experts or \n     consultants as contract employees. Reimburse the State \n     Department for health and medical services provided to \n     overseas employees; maintain uniforms provided to Treasury \n     employees; provide athletic services for students at the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia; \n     install fencing, guard booths, lighting, and other \n     maintenance for Treasury Department facilities and enter into \n     reciprocal assistance with state and local law enforcement \n     agencies.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Now I will respond to another question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think it might be worthwhile to put in the Record the \nreports of last week by the Moody's organization about the evaluation \nof the potential downgrading of Federal bonds. That might describe in \nsome more detail the issue of the risks that some of us are concerned \nabout. I ask unanimous consent that the report I cited be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S547]]\n\n\n                      U.S. Debt Rating Threatened\n\n       Alarmed by the protracted budget brawl in Washington, a \n     venerable Wall Street credit rater is threatening to \n     downgrade America's prized triple-A rating if the deadlock \n     forces the government to default on its debts for the first \n     time.\n       The unprecedented warning Wednesday from Moody's Investors \n     Service, which has been judging borrower credit worthiness \n     for nearly a century, would mark a stunning blow to the U.S. \n     government's credit standing and sully the pristine status of \n     $397 billion in Treasury debt with interest due in coming \n     months.\n       The warning marked the bluntest negative reaction from the \n     financial world so far to the possibility that Uncle Sam \n     might renege on a pledge to repay borrowed money, which has \n     never happened and has helped make U.S. government IOUs the \n     safest and most coveted securities in the world.\n       ``This is a wake-up call,'' said Mike Casey, an \n     international economist at Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc., \n     a New York investment research firm.\n       Moody's said it was obliged to make the warning because \n     ``the positions being taken in the current debate over the \n     budget and the debt ceiling have significantly increased the \n     risk of a default on the above-mentioned security \n     obligations.''\n       It said the possible downgrade doesn't reflect ``any \n     underlying deterioration in the fiscal position of the United \n     States Government, but rather from the peculiar circumstances \n     surrounding the present political controversy over the \n     direction of federal economic and social policy.''\n       Some congressional Republicans have threatened to allow the \n     government to default if the Clinton administration doesn't \n     capitulate on spending cuts in the battle to balance the \n     federal budget. The administration has said Congress must \n     raise the $4.9 trillion debt limit by March 1 or a default \n     could result.\n       Although most economists say the possibility of default \n     remains extremely remote, many still regarded the Moody's \n     warning as a sobering reminder that it's not possible.\n       ``In a sense it's like nuclear warfare,'' said Robert \n     Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International in \n     New York. ``If it happens it's a terrible problem. But \n     nobody thinks it's going to happen.''\n       The Moody's warning coincided with conciliatory moves in \n     the budget battle, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he \n     wanted to avoid a default. But it was unclear whether \n     Gingrich also was speaking for more militant Republicans, \n     many of them freshmen in the House, who have used the threat \n     of default as a bargaining tactic.\n       After a meeting with Gingrich Wednesday evening, one \n     freshman congressman, Rep. David McIntrosh, R-Ind. said his \n     class was ``pretty much on board'' with the speaker.\n       Moody's said it was placing Treasury bonds and notes with \n     interest payments due Feb. 29 and April 1 ``on review for \n     possible downgrade.''\n       The rating agency didn't make clear what these securities \n     would be downgraded to. But the loss of triple-A status could \n     make it more expensive for the Treasury to borrow, adding \n     billions of dollars in extra interest to the government's \n     overall debt and reverberating throughout the economy with \n     pressure for higher interest rates.\n       Bond prices were sharply lower by midday today, continuing \n     a slide that began late Wednesday afternoon as word of the \n     Moody's announcement spread. But traders said prices were \n     falling for other reasons as well.\n       Standard & Poor's Corp., another leading debt-rating \n     service, made similar warnings on Nov. 10, when the issue of \n     a possible default first arose in the budget negotiations. \n     Still, the wording of the Moody's announcement was far more \n     blunt and specific, referring to particular groups of medium- \n     and long-term Treasury bonds that would be affected.\n       S said a spokesman that it is examining the spillover \n     effects of a potential default of U.S. Treasury securities \n     and expects to make an announcement about that in the next \n     several days.\n       Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin responded to the Moody's \n     announcement with a brief statement expressing his belief \n     that the debt impasse will be resolved by the end of \n     February.\n       Some Wall Street economists theorized that Moody's made the \n     warning partly because of sensitivity to the credit-rating \n     industry's past failures to forewarn of brewing financial \n     debacles.\n       Just in the past few years, for example, both Moody's and \n     Standard & Poor's have been rebuked for failing to sound the \n     alarm on impending crises in Mexico and Orange County, \n     Calif., which cost investors huge losses.\n       ``Moody's and S have caught a lot of grief in the past,'' \n     said Casey. ``They have lot of history of locking the barn \n     door after the cows have gone.''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask the Senator from Mississippi a question about \nsomething that will come up later this week that I know is important to \nmany of us, including the Senator from Mississippi. We are in session \ntoday on Tuesday and we do not have recorded votes and will not have \nrecorded votes Wednesday. We will have recorded votes on Thursday. My \nunderstanding, from the discussion I had with the majority leader last \nFriday, was that on Thursday of this week we would be turning to the \nissue of the farm bill. I am very concerned about trying to get us to \nmove a piece of farm legislation.\n  I know there are people with very different views about what kind of \nfarm bill would best serve the interests of family farmers in this \ncountry in the future. Some say, the so-called Freedom to Farm Act must \nbe passed, or else. Others say that there is the Farm Security Act's \nmarketing loans, and other things. In your part of the country, in \nMississippi, we are in the circumstance where farmers are ready to go \ninto the fields at some point soon. I confess that, as of an hour ago \nwhen I last talked to somebody in North Dakota, there is not anybody \nclose to starting up a tractor and going into a field today because it \nis awfully cold there today. But down south people are close to \nstarting to want to do spring's work. In our part of the country, \nfarmers want to talk to bankers and to their agribusinesses about the \nfarm plan. They want to know under what conditions will they plant this \nspring, and what will the farm program be? We were supposed to have \npassed a 5-year plan last year. There was one put in the reconciliation \nbill, which everybody knew would be vetoed. We have nothing at this \npoint.\n  My hope is that we can work together, Democrats and Republicans, and \nif we need to demonstrate a burst of bipartisanship here, there is no \nplace better to do that than on a farm bill. Your farmers have the same \nneeds as mine. I have strong feelings about what we ought to do, and I \nknow others do as well. Especially, we owe them an answer. I hope very \nmuch that, come Thursday--I think we will have a couple of cloture \nvotes on a couple of different plans, and perhaps we will not invoke \ncloture on either. If that is the case, I hope we can find a way \nThursday to advance some kind of basic farm plan in order to put it \ninto conference so we can work hard in the next week or so and finally \nmove a farm plan out of the Congress. Farmers deserve that. We owe that \nto them.\n  I ask the Senator from Mississippi his view on the urgency of this, \nand whether he thinks that we are going to be able to move forward \nThursday with some dispatch to deal with this issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in responding to the Senator from North \nDakota, he brought back memories of bipartisan efforts in the past on \nthe farm bill. I think it was maybe 1982. I remember that at the time I \nwas in the House and I was the minority whip. At that time, the \nmajority whip was a fellow named Tom Foley. We were working on the farm \nbill. It was very delicate and tedious. Everybody wanted a farm bill, \nbut some of the people did not necessarily want to go on record voting \nfor that particular version. I remember even exchanging vote counts \nwith the majority whip. We managed to get a pretty good farm bill \nthrough, but one that was pretty evenly divided between the two \nparties. So that is always the way it should be done. I think usually \nthat is the way agriculture policy is developed, in a bipartisan way.\n\n  I do agree that there is an urgency, too. During the years I have \nbeen a Member of Congress, I never had to go back home in February--\nthat is when we start going into the field in my State--to tell farmers \nthat we do not have a farm bill. They do not know what to expect. There \nhas never been an instance where I recall where we let existing law \nexpire, which opens the door to utilizing outdated, expensive, and \nineffective 1938 and 1949 so-called permanent laws. That is what is \nabout to happen. If we do not do something on this, we are going to \nrevert back to the so-called permanent law. That causes all kinds of \nconfusion not only for the farmers, but the lenders and the suppliers, \nwhich are an important part of the economy in my State and, I know, in \nyour State. Even the Secretary stated that reversion to the permanent \nlaw has all kinds of problems. Authorization for wheat, feedgrains, and \nrice programs under current law have already expired. So there is an \nurgency.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota knows that an effort is underway \nnow where Senators and their staffs are working on what is the best \napproach. We did have the farm bill that was in the reconciliation \npackage, as \n\n[[Page S548]]\nthe Senator said. It was vetoed by the President. Some of us would like \nto look at that as a base and maybe make some changes. I know the \nSenator has a different approach. We are working on what is the best \nprocedure to get an agreement, and we are going to try to have some \nunderstanding worked out later on today--hopefully very shortly--as to \nexactly what votes will occur Thursday on or in relation to agriculture \nlegislation. We are going to be very careful to be fair in how we \nproceed and give those who have different views a chance to make their \ncase, and have one or more cloture votes, but try to make an effort to \nget this issue moving in such a way that maybe we can get into \nconference and work out an agreement that we can get to the President \nin the shortest possible period of time. So we are working right now on \na unanimous-consent agreement that would get us into consideration on \nThursday that would allow for a vote or votes to occur and try to find \na way to move it forward.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n  One of the dilemmas here is that the farm bill, which was placed in \nthe reconciliation bill and passed last year and vetoed, would have \neliminated the permanent law, the 1949 act. Many of us had great \nconcern about that. There are new and innovative ways to deal with the \nissue of payments, and other approaches in the short term. But in the \nlong term we feel strongly that the needs of a network of family farms \nwill only be met if we retain some kind of permanent authority for farm \nlegislation. But I guess the point I was making--and I am comforted \nsome by the Senator's comments--I think at the end of Thursday we need \nto have found a way to reach agreement on something that we can move \ninto conference that builds a bridge between the various proposals that \nnow exist. I think we have not seen much bipartisanship in the last \nyear or so. In fact, it has been some while beyond that, I guess. If \never we need a burst of strong bipartisanship, it is to find a way to \nmove this farm legislation forward.\n\n  I look forward to working with the Senator. There is an effort \nunderway; we have a lot of staff people on a bipartisan basis searching \nfor some common ground. Perhaps that will result in the ability to move \nsomething on Thursday. Time is very short. It is very urgent that we \nprovide farmers an answer about what will be the conditions under which \nthey plant this spring, what kind of a farm program will exist in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we also \nstill hope there is the possibility that we would have a vote or votes \nthis week on the telecommunications issue. That has not been clarified \nyet.\n  Speaking of bipartisan efforts, that is one where last year a lot of \nwork went into that legislation. It is a very important piece of \nlegislation. I believe it passed by a vote of something like 81 to 18. \nIt is on the verge of being ready to come out of conference. We hope we \ncan get an agreement worked out on that also sometime today. If we can, \nwe would hope maybe we could have a vote on that also on Thursday.\n  We could have at least two or three votes on Thursday, both of them \non very, very important issues: agriculture and telecommunications. \nThat is almost a year's work. Time is short on both of them. We are \ngoing to work very hard to try to get an agreement worked out.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S545-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S548-S553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE LATE LT. COL. RICHARD SAKAKIDA\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want to take the floor of the U.S. Senate \nto tell my colleagues and the people of Hawaii and the country about a \nHawaii-born unsung hero of World War II. His extraordinary story has \nnever been fully told.\n  In a description of Colonel Sakakida's wartime activities, it is \nwritten that today Richard Sakakida is alive and well and living in \nCalifornia.\n  I was deeply saddened by the death last week of Lt. Col. Richard \nSakakida near his home in Fremont, CA, after a lengthy illness. Colonel \nSakakida, one of America's genuine war heroes, faced death with the \nsame stoicism and dignity as he displayed in facing the dangers of war \nand the constant pain of his war injuries.\n  Colonel Sakakida will be mourned by the many who knew him personally \nor by reputation, including the thousands of Japanese-Americans who \nfollowed his footsteps to serve in their country during the Second \nWorld War.\n  He is survived by his beloved wife of many years, Cherry, to whom I \noffer my deepest condolences.\n  Colonel Sakakida was a true hero, one whose contributions, \ntragically, have never fully been recognized by his own Government. His \nwas one of the most amazing stories to come out of World War II.\n  As a United States Army undercover agent and prisoner of war of the \nJapanese in the Philippines 50 years ago, he endured isolation, \nprivation, disease, shrapnel wounds, the constant threat of discovery, \nand unspeakable physical torture in carrying out daring intelligence \nmissions for his country. His sacrifices not only resulted in the \nadvancement of the Allied cause during the Second World War, they \nreflected a great sense of duty and personal courage rarely seen even \nin that great conflict.\n  As one of the very first Nisei recruited to the United States \nmilitary service, Colonel Sakakida also helped to pave the way for the \nthousands of other Japanese-Americans who would make their own \ncontributions to the war effort as members of the famed 100th/442d \nRegimental Combat Team and the lesser known Military Intelligence \nService. Later, though he modestly would have denied this, Colonel \nSakakida's achievements opened doors of opportunity in the military and \nsociety at large for subsequent generations of Japanese-Americans and \nother minorities.\n  In death, as they never were in life, Colonel Sakakida's \naccomplishments deserve to be remembered and honored. To this end, I \nhope that Members of Congress will actively support efforts to ensure \nthat his military valor is one day recognized by his Government.\n  For the benefit of those who do not know this remarkable solder's \nstory, I ask unanimous consent that a description of Colonel Sakakida's \nwartime activities as excerpted from ``America's Secret Army: The \nUntold Story of the Counter Intelligence Corps'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  America's Secret Army: The Untold Story of the Counter Intelligence \n                                 Corps\n\n                   (By Ian Sayer and Douglas Botting)\n\n\n                                sakakida\n\n       Of all the unsung heroes of World War Two, Richard Sakakida \n     must rank as one of the most remarkable. For courage, \n     fortitude and loyalty to his adopted homeland there were few \n     to rival him. Yet outside a small circle of veteran CIC \n     agents Sakakida's name is almost unknown, and his \n     extraordinary story has never been fully told.\n       Richard Sakakida was a native of Hawaii, the son of \n     Japanese parents who had emigrated there from Hiroshima at \n     the beginning of the century. Most Americans would have \n     described him as a Japanese-American, but the Japanese had a \n     special word for such expatriates--Nisei, meaning the \n     firstborn away from the homeland. Educated at a American high \n     school in Honolulu and brought up as an American citizen in a \n     Japanese family, Sakakida was a man of two cultures and two \n     languages. The outbreak of war between America and Japan \n     might easily have led to a hopeless confusion of loyalties in \n     a person of his dual background, but it did not. Like the \n     great majority of Nisei, many of whom were later to \n     distinguish themselves in action against the Germans in \n     Europe, Sakakida firmly considered himself to be an American \n     first and last. In March 1941, nine months before the \n     Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, this resolute, soft-voiced, \n     earnest-mannered young man was invited to put his unusual \n     linguistic and cultural qualifications to practical use by \n     joining the specialist branch of the U.S. Army best able to \n     take advantage of them--the CIC. Along with another young \n     Nisei, Arthur Komori, he was sworn in as a CIC agent in \n     Hawaii with the rank of sergeant. These were the first \n     Japanese-Americans ever to be recruited into the CIC, and \n     they were to be among the handful of their detachment to \n     survive the war against Japan.\n     \n[[Page S549]]\n\n       After an intensive training course in the use of codes and \n     ciphers and the recognition of prime targets, Sakakida and \n     Komori were told to prepare to embark on a secret mission, \n     the nature of which would be revealed to them later. They \n     were told that their destination was Manila, the capital city \n     of the Philippines, an American possession on the point of \n     independence, where the United States still maintained a \n     substantial military presence. They were warned that their \n     assignment would certainly be a source of inconvenience \n     and probably of danger. They were to say nothing except to \n     their immediate family--in Sakakida's case his widowed \n     mother.\n       Less than a month later the two agents set sail for Manila \n     on board a U.S. Army transport, traveling as deck hands in \n     order to conceal their identity as members of the armed \n     forces. In Manila, a city of tropical languor and almost \n     colonial ease, they were met by the Commanding Officer of the \n     CIC Detachment in the Philippines and briefed for the first \n     time about the nature of their mission. The magnitude of \n     their task took their breath away. It involved nothing less \n     than the counter intelligence investigation of the entire \n     Japanese community in Manila, into which they were required \n     to infiltrate themselves as undercover miles in order to \n     target those individuals who had connections with the \n     Japanese military and posed a threat to the security of the \n     United States Army. As a cover story they were to claim that \n     they were crew members of a freighter and had jumped ship \n     after tiring of life at sea--a story Komori enhanced by \n     adding that he was also a draft dodger, a state of affairs \n     which he reported later ``was favourably received by the pro-\n     Emperor sons of Japan.''\n       Sakakida was instructed to register at a small hotel called \n     the Nishikawa, while Komori checked in at the Toyo Hotel. \n     From these two bases the tyro agents were to start looking \n     around for roles in keeping with their assumed identities. \n     Their case officers, Major Raymond and Agent Grenfell D. \n     Drisko, were the only members of the CIC Detachment who knew \n     that they were Nisei agents. In order to stay in contact they \n     were given keys to a mailbox at the Central Post Office in \n     Manila under the name of Sixto Borja and told to check the \n     box twice daily for instructions about rendezvous places. \n     Major Raymond or Agent Drisko would then pick them up at a \n     prearranged spot and drive them by a roundabout route to the \n     Military Intelligence section in Forth Santiago, where they \n     could submit their report in safety and receive new \n     briefings. For Major Raymond, a long-time Agent, Sakakida and \n     Komori developed tremendous admiration and affection. ``He \n     gradually instilled in us the techniques of subtle \n     investigations and subterfuges in the best traditions of the \n     CIC,'' Komori recalled later. To him they owed everything \n     they knew about working as undercover agents amongst the \n     impendingly hostile Japanese.\n       And so, in the months preceding the outbreak of war, the \n     two young and apprehensive Nisei began the delicate task of \n     burrowing into the warren of the main Japanese community in \n     the Philippines, numbering more than 2,000 in all. \n     Sakakida posed as a sales representative of Sears, \n     Roebuck, whose sales brochures he had learnt by heart, and \n     spent most of his evenings in the Japanese Club, where he \n     assiduously ingratiated himself with the Japanese \n     businessmen who frequented this hotbed of Nippon \n     orthodoxy. Meanwhile Komori obtained a post as a teacher \n     of English at the Japanese Cultural Hall in Manila and \n     made use of this respectable position to win the \n     confidence and even the friendship of some of the leading \n     Japanese residents of the city--the Japanese Consul \n     General, the Chief of the Japanese News Agency, the Chief \n     of the Japanese Tourist Bureau, the Chief of the Japanese \n     Cultural Hall and many others. With few exceptions he \n     found the Japanese ``arrogant and expansionist-minded,'' \n     openly sympathetic to the militaristic ambitions of the \n     Japanese Army generals and increasingly dismissive of the \n     more peaceable and compromising civil government in Tokyo. \n     War fever had developed to such an extent, Komori \n     reported, that one of his students in his English class, a \n     journalist who wrote for a newspaper in Osaka, even \n     reported the likely route of advance of the Japanese \n     forces once they had launched their attack against the \n     British in Singapore.\n       Komori had to go along with all this, of course, in order \n     to keep up his cover. He even had to seem to join in the \n     jinjoistic euphoria when Japanese planes bombed the American \n     fleet at Pearl Harbor on 7 December and drink toasts to the \n     Emperor when America declared war on Japan the following day. \n     The outbreak of war now put him in grave danger, for it meant \n     that henceforth he would be spying on an enemy people, and \n     would have to face the consequences if he put a foot wrong. \n     The war was only a few hours old when the complexities of \n     Komori's new situation were brutally brought home to him. He \n     was in the Japanese News Agency in Manila, downing yet \n     another sake in yet another toast to the Emperor, when the \n     door burst open and he found himself ringed by a group of \n     Filipino Constabulary with bayonets fixed. To the Filipinos \n     he was just another Japanese. Along with officials of the \n     News Agency, Komori was herded down the stairs and into a \n     waiting bus. He was then driven to the stinking old Bilibid \n     Prison--``the hell hole'' as he recalled, ``of Manila''--and \n     here he languished, an American agent amidst a gaggle of \n     enemy subjects, completely confident that Major Raymond would \n     eventually learn his whereabouts and rescue him.\n       Meanwhile, in the wake of the rising tide of anti-Japanese \n     feeling in the Philippines that followed the outbreak of \n     hostilities, Sakakida too had been thrown into the Bilibid \n     Prison, though via a much more circuitous chain of events. In \n     the preceding months he had found employment as a clerk in \n     the Nishikawa Hotel in return for his room and board, a \n     job which had given him an ideal opportunity to inspect \n     the passports and other credentials of Japanese visitors \n     to Manila. With the coming of the war Sakakida's \n     information-gathering operation gained much greater \n     momentum. The United States now required all Japanese \n     nationals to file declarations of their bank accounts and \n     assets, and many of them came to Sakakida to seek his help \n     in filling out all the various forms. In this way he was \n     able to interview a considerable portion of the Japanese \n     community in the Philippine capital and obtain a large \n     volume of information which did not go on the forms, \n     particularly about the military background of the people \n     concerned, all of which he passed on to U.S. Military \n     Intelligence.\n       Sakakida did not, of course, reveal to anyone that he was \n     an American citizen. Since to all outward appearances he was \n     completely Japanese, he was treated as such by the hostile \n     Filipinos, and before long he found himself in such physical \n     danger that he was forced to look to his own survival. When \n     the Manila radio station announced that all aliens should \n     report to their local police station for internment, Sakakida \n     was happy to oblige. Along with three other Japanese he was \n     flung in the back of an open police truck and driven off \n     through the narrow streets of Manila, where crowds of angry, \n     anti-Japanese Filipinos aimed blows and missiles at them, so \n     that they were bruised, bloody and exhausted by the time they \n     reached the sanctuary of the Japanese Club, now an internment \n     centre for Japanese, German and Italian aliens. A few days \n     later he was sent into Manila city to obtain food for the \n     children in the centre, and while he was there he took the \n     opportunity to return to his hotel to pick up his belongings. \n     But he had barely begun to pack his bags when he was seized \n     by three Filipino Secret Service agents on suspicion of being \n     a spy and thrown into Bilibid Prison, where like his fellow \n     agent Komori he languished in hope of rescue by his CIC \n     commander, Major Raymond.\n       By now the situation on the war front had begun to \n     deteriorate catastrophically. In the first phase of their \n     plans for the military conquest of the Far East, the Japanese \n     had launched an almost simultaneous assault on Hong Kong, \n     Malaya and the Philippines. On the same day as the attack on \n     Pearl Harbor, over half the bomber of the American air force \n     in the Far Eastern Theatre and one-third of the fighters were \n     destroyed in Japanese air attacks on the American air base at \n     Clark Field in the Philippines, and the naval base in Manila \n     Bay was effectively devastated. Without naval support or \n     command in the air, the commander of the Filipino and \n     American forces in the Philippines, General Douglas \n     MacArthur (Commanding General of the U.S. Army Forces, Far \n     East), had no real prospect of holding Manila when the \n     Japanese began landing ground forces in strength on the \n     island of Luzon on 20 December, and he ordered a \n     withdrawal southward to the natural stronghold of the \n     Bataan Peninsula and the island fortress of Corregidor, \n     where he would hold out as best he could till relief \n     arrived from Hawaii, perhaps in six months' time.\n       Inevitably Sakakida and Komori were swept up in the turmoil \n     of the last few desperate days before the Japanese entry into \n     Manila. Events moved swiftly. First they were snatched from \n     prison by Agent Drisko; then on Christmas Eve, with bombs \n     falling on manila and the sky over the city a lurid red from \n     the fires of burning buildings and oil tanks, they were \n     bundled on to a tiny steamer bound for Bataan, along with the \n     entire staff of the CIC Detachment and Military Intelligence \n     section and all their documents. Sakakida and Komori were \n     seconded to Corregidor, the tiny overgrown island fortress \n     off the tip of Bataan, popularly known as The Rock, where \n     General MacArthur had established his headquarters after the \n     retreat from Manila. Here Sakakida was assigned as General \n     MacArthur's personal interpreter and translator. So desperate \n     was the general need for Japanese linguists, however, that \n     both Sakakida and Komori were sent to work near the front \n     lines in Bataan in alternating three-day shifts, so that \n     while one was on The Rock the other would be in Bataan until \n     they changed places. In Bataan they operated from makeshift \n     headquarters of bamboo sticks and banana leaves in a clearing \n     in the jungle, where amid the screeching birds and clacking \n     palms they plunged into a frenzy of activity. They went on \n     patrols and scouting expeditions through the lines, \n     interrogated prisoners-of-war, interned collaborators, \n     collected enemy documents and translated them, amassed \n     information of all kinds about Japanese movements and \n     intentions.\n       On occasion Sakakida traveled to the front to collect \n     personal papers from the bodies of the Japanese dead, for \n     Japanese soldiers kept highly detailed diaries which provided \n     not only useful tactical information but illuminating \n     insights into the morale and outlook of the Japanese \n     soldiery. Once he was \n\n[[Page S550]]\n     summoned from army headquarters to broadcast a surrender appeal in \n     Japanese to diehard Japanese troops fighting a last-ditch \n     battle in the cliff caves at Longoskawayan Point, where the \n     Japanese Army had been trying to build up a pocket to \n     outflank the American defences at the Bataan front. The \n     Japanese responded to Sakakida's appeal with a fusillade of \n     fire and had to be wiped out to a man by pointblank \n     gunnery. Sakakida was not very popular with American and \n     Filipino front-line troops, because wherever he went he \n     drew a lot of fire from the enraged Japanese. Sitting in \n     his fox hole with his microphone and loudspeaker and an \n     escort of Filipino Scouts, he would broadcast his \n     surrender message across to the Japanese front line, and \n     the Japanese would listen in silence with exquisite \n     politeness until he had finished, and then blast the area \n     to bits with mortars and grenades and anything else they \n     could lay their hands on. At one time Sakakida tried \n     firing little messages at them with a home-made catapult. \n     The messages, which were rolled up in 2-inch lengths of \n     piping, read: ``It is cherry blossom time back in your \n     homeland, and the military have sent you here to the \n     jungles of Bataan. You ought to be at home with your \n     families and loved ones enjoying the cherry blossom. So \n     why continue this futile battle? Come and surrender with \n     this leaflet and your shipment back home will be \n     guaranteed.''\n       After this bombardment of the Japanese positions with this \n     touching homily, a voice with a strong Japanese accent called \n     out in English from the jungle: ``What the hell are you \n     firing now, Americans? Are you out of ammunition?''\n       By now many agents found themselves in the thick of \n     intensive and desperate fighting. When Special Agent Lorenzo \n     Alvarado's unit lost all its officers, Alvarado assumed \n     command during a fire fight with the enemy, and for his \n     courage and initiative was subsequently decorated with a \n     gallantry award. Early in March one of Sakakida's colleagues, \n     Special Agent Harry Glass, made history by becoming the first \n     CIC agent to be wounded in World War Two. He was struck in \n     the neck by a .25 calibre rifle bullet fired by a Japanese \n     sniper hidden in a tree along a jungle trail. By a miracle, \n     the bullet entered one side of his neck and exited the other \n     side without piercing the oesophagus or severing any blood \n     vessels, and Glass was back on duty in a couple of days, with \n     only two small plasters, one on each side of his neck, to \n     mark the historic spots.\n       Back on Corregidor they found The Rock was not a nice place \n     to be. It was now raked daily from dawn to dusk by Japanese \n     air and artillery bombardment, so that the garrison was \n     forced to seek permanent shelter in the tunnel system bored \n     deep inside the hills, where they eked out an acutely \n     uncomfortable troglodytic existence on half rations. Under \n     the hail of Japanese high explosives the two Nisei on \n     Corregidor worked 16 to 20 hours a day helping to decipher \n     Japanese signal codes and monitoring Japanese air force \n     communications, which were broadcast in clear, thus enabling \n     the Americans to warn target areas on the island that a raid \n     was coming. Later they were joined by another Hawaiian-born \n     Nisei, Clarence Yamagata, a civilian who had practised law in \n     Manila and acted as part-time legal advisor to the \n     Japanese Consulate until the American withdrawal from the \n     city.\n       As time passed the American position became more and more \n     hopeless and untenable, even on fortress Corregidor. By the \n     beginning of April it was clear that the end was near for the \n     hard-pressed soldiers on Bataan. After three months of bitter \n     and intensive combat, malnutrition and disease the men were \n     exhausted. By now the average daily food intake was down to \n     800 calories per man; and 90 per cent of the Filipino Army \n     had no shoes. Hope of relief had faded and most were resigned \n     to the prospect of imminent surrender to an overwhelming \n     enemy. Few could now escape the tragic fate that was about to \n     overtake them.\n       On 9 April Bataan fell in the greatest capitulation in \n     American history and some 76,000 shattered American and \n     Filipino survivors were led north into captivity on a \n     notorious death march that killed over half their number. \n     Many of Sakakida's CIC comrades took part in this march. \n     Others were transported to the prison camps in crowded, \n     insufferably hot freight cars, without water or food. Most \n     were to die at the hands of the Japanese, succumbing to the \n     privation and brutality of the camps, or drowning in \n     torpedoed prison ships, or simply disappearing without trace. \n     One agent did manage to escape after the surrender on Bataan. \n     This was Grenfell D. Drisko, who had been one of the first \n     CIC contacts that Sakakida and Komori had made on their \n     arrival in the Philippines. Fleeing to the hills, Drisko had \n     joined up with a guerrilla group, but unconfirmed reports \n     indicate that shortly before the Americans recaptured the \n     Philippines, Drisko's location had been betrayed to the \n     Japanese in return for a bounty and he was subsequently \n     captured and killed.\n       By the time of the Bataan surrender General MacArthur had \n     already removed himself and his headquarters to the security \n     of distant Australia, leaving his deputy, General Wainwright, \n     to hold the fort--in a completely literal sense--on doomed \n     Corregidor. Both generals expressed deep concern over Komori \n     and Sakakida. Since the Japanese refused to recognize the \n     right of anyone of Japanese blood to bear loyalty to another \n     country, they would doubtless treat the two Nisei with even \n     greater harshness in captivity than they would their \n     Caucasian comrades--especially if they discovered that the \n     Nisei in question had been undercover agents of American \n     military intelligence. General MacArthur therefore ordered \n     Komori and Sakakida to leave the Philippines on the makeshift \n     evacuation flotilla known as the ``bamboo feet.'' This \n     presented Sakakida with the most difficult and momentous \n     decision in his life and marked his transition from an agent \n     of ability to a man of heroic stature--and a master spy.\n       Sakakida contended that the evacuation plans as they stood \n     entailed leaving Yamagata behind to face his fate as a \n     prisoner of the Japanese. In his view this was unthinkable. \n     Yamagata had openly occupied a position of trust among the \n     Japanese and then voluntarily come over to the American side. \n     Clearly he would be marked out for special treatment by his \n     captors--a fate too dreadful to contemplate. Sakakida was \n     also aware that Yamagata's wife and children were then living \n     in Japan, a situation which made Yamagata even more \n     vulnerable to any pressure the Japanese chose to put on him. \n     Sakakida himself was not in such a vulnerable position. He \n     had never worked openly for the Japanese, he had no wife or \n     family. It was therefore only right and just, he felt, that \n     Yamagata should take his place on the ride to freedom. He put \n     this proposal to his commanding officer, who in turn put it \n     to General Wainwright, who put it to General MacArthur, who \n     agreed. Sakakida would have to survive the Japanese \n     occupation as best he could.\n       So, early on the morning of 13 April 1942, Sakakida bade \n     Yamagata and fellow agent Komori farewell as they set off on \n     their breakout bid from the beleaguered island of Corregidor. \n     They went not by sea but by air, taking off from the island's \n     tiny airstrip on what was considered a ``50-50 attempt'' to \n     get out in an army training plane that had been patched up \n     after a previous crash landing, with an American newsman and \n     an emissary from the Chinese leader, Chiang Kai-shek, also on \n     board. The plane flew through the Japanese blockade without \n     incident and landed on the more southerly Philippine island \n     of Panay. Here they were rescued by a B-25 bomber flown, in \n     Komori's recollection, by a legendary pilot by the name of \n     Captain Paul I. (``Pappy'') Gunn, an expert in dare-devil \n     low-level flying, who flew them out, Komori later recalled, \n     ``in a flight in broad daylight through enemy territory in a \n     hedge-hopping, canyon-shooting, wave-skipping trip, during \n     which the pilot kept telling us that enemy planes could not \n     see us as we were flying only a few feet above our own \n     shadow.'' The B-25 landed on Mindanao, the most southerly of \n     the main Philippine islands, where it took on a maximum fuel \n     load and then took off again on an historic flight of 17 \n     hours to Australia, the longest flight ever made by an \n     aircraft of that type. Komori was later to state that in his \n     view this flight had been a ``test hop'' which proved that a \n     B-25 could be flown much farther than had hitherto been \n     believed, and that it set a precedent for the bombing raid on \n     Japan made a few days later by B-25's from the aircraft \n     carrier Hornet.\n       Komori's first task in Australia was to write what turned \n     out to be the definitive American guideline for the handling \n     and interrogation of Japanese POWs, based on the experience \n     that he and Sakakida had had in Bataan. The two CIC Nisei had \n     found that if a Japanese captive was given a drink of water, \n     an American cigarette and immediate medical care if needed, \n     his fear of summary execution evaporated and he was happy to \n     disclose everything he knew or was asked. This ``kindness and \n     understanding'' approach was to pay off in huge tactical and \n     strategical intelligence gains throughout the rest of the war \n     in the Pacific area.\n       Because of his language capability, Komori was next \n     assigned to the newly formed Allied Translation and \n     Interrogation Section under Colonel Sidney Mashbir. ATIS \n     performed an increasingly valuable task in translating \n     captured enemy documents and interrogating captured Japanese \n     soldiers. But Komori was a CIC agent and was in due course \n     assigned to the chief of counter intelligence in MacArthur's \n     South West Pacific command, General Elliott Thorpe. When the \n     tilt of war clearly swung against the Japanese, Komori \n     rejoined the CIC in the field as the agent, first in the \n     Philippines during the American re-conquest, then in Japan, \n     where he was one of the first CIC agents to set foot after \n     the surrender. Komori was to make a career in the CIC after \n     the war, retiring as a colonel to practise law in his native \n     Hawaii.\n       Sakakida's experience was to prove very different. There \n     was little for him to do except wait. He jointed up with the \n     other members of the CIC detachment on Corregidor preparing \n     for the inevitable surrender and helped them destroy \n     intelligence files and other records. He was then instructed \n     to revert to his former role as an undercover agent and \n     officially listed as a civilian by the American command. It \n     was understood that if the opportunity ever arose he would \n     try to enter the Japanese forces with the object of \n     channelling intelligence material to the guerrilla formations \n     that were already gathering in the hills.\n       On 6 May the ravaged defenders of Corregidor were \n     overwhelmed by the greatly superior Japanese forces that had \n     fought their way ashore. After sustaining heavy U.S. losses, \n     General Wainright and several of his aides, carrying a while \n     flag, went out of the tunnels in the direction of the enemy \n     lines in order to arrange a surrender. Some four \n\n[[Page S551]]\n     hours later Wainright had not returned--and the Japanese had not ceased \n     their onslaught. Fearing the worst for Wainright's fate, his \n     deputy, General Beebe, decided to take a small leaking \n     harbour craft and try and reach Bataan to contact some higher \n     ranking Japanese. Sakakida went with Beebe to \n     interpret; Special Agent James Rubard and several others \n     of the headquarters staff volunteered to man the boat for \n     the voyage across.\n       As the boat came in to Cabcaben Port on the south-east tip \n     of Bataan, a squad of Japanese soldiers appeared, forced the \n     Americans to stand at attention and then proceeded to remove \n     their dogtags, watches and other valuables. The Japanese NCO \n     in charge then spoke to Sakakida in Japanese, and when \n     Sakakida replied the NCO struck him a number of times, \n     breaking his glasses, cutting his face and knocking him to \n     the ground. ``Hold your temper, Kelly,'' General Beebe \n     admonished Sakakida, deliberately addressing him by a false \n     name in order to conceal his Nisei identity. Rubard feared \n     they were going to kill Sakakida on the spot, but instead \n     they refused to allow him to accompany General Beebe as an \n     interpreter and returned all but General Beebe and his aides \n     by Japanese landing craft to the area of Corregidor where \n     American forces were being held captive.\n       For CIC men like Rubard and Sakakida this was a highly \n     volatile and dangerous time, especially when the Japanese \n     began calling members of Wainright's headquarters staff to \n     Malinta Tunnel for interrogation. Along with other members of \n     G-2 staff, Agent Rubard had been engaged in despatching \n     Filipino natives in small boats to Bataan and to the mainland \n     to observe and report on Japanese military dispositions and \n     movements. Being aware of the identity of these Filipinos, he \n     feared that under intense physical abuse and torture he might \n     be compelled to reveal their names. For that reason he \n     intended concealing his identity from his captors, at least \n     until the interrogations had ceased and prisoners had been \n     transferred to other locations.\n       But Rubard's plan was foiled, and his life and that of his \n     CIC colleague Sakakida put in jeopardy, by the activities of \n     a certain John David Provoo, a former G-2 clerk from army \n     headquarters in Manila, who as a Japanese linguist had at one \n     time been considered as a potential recruit for the CIC \n     Philippines Detachment. Provoo had never been accepted into \n     CIC because his background investigation revealed that he was \n     a suspected homosexual and Japanese sympathizer who had spent \n     several years in Japan learning the Japanese language and \n     studying to be a Buddhist monk. Immediately after the \n     surrender of Corregidor, Provoo began acting as an \n     interpreter for the Japanese occupiers. He went with Japanese \n     troops to the hospital wing of Malinta Tunnel and relayed \n     their orders that all sick and wounded Americans should be \n     moved out at once so that Japanese wounded could be \n     hospitalized there. When he heard this order Captain Thompson \n     of the Medical Service Corps told Provoo: ``Tell them to go \n     to hell, the men are too sick to be moved.'' When \n     Provoo interpreted this response to the enemy, they \n     immediately dragged Thompson out of the tunnel and \n     executed him on the spot.\n       This same John David Provoo now brought a squad of Japanese \n     soldiers down to the prisoner enclosure and pointed out \n     Rubard and several other headquarters staff members. Three \n     grueling, intensive days of ceaseless interrogation then \n     befell the helpless Rubard as his captors demanded \n     information on codes, Filipino agents and much else besides. \n     At each interrogation the Japanese became increasingly angry \n     and abusive. But they were not very skilled in the art of \n     interrogation and were further hampered by their very limited \n     knowledge of English. By the third day of questioning \n     Rubard's interrogators were slapping him about and swinging \n     their swords to demonstrate how they would behead him if he \n     did not co-operate. But he was able to maintain a consistent \n     story throughout his interrogation. He claimed that his only \n     duty had been to keep the G-2 situation map up to date, that \n     codes were kept by the Signal Crops (which was true), and \n     that Filipino agents had been handled by two G-2 officers who \n     had been evacuated to Australia by submarine shortly before \n     the fall of the island. At the end of the third day Rubard \n     was returned to the prisoner compound with his head still \n     intact. The next day he joined the main body of American \n     prisoners leaving Corregidor for a prison camp in Central \n     Luzon. He was never interrogated again. (After his \n     liberation, Rubard learned that Provoo had worked for \n     Japanese propaganda radio in Tokyo during the war. He was \n     never charged as a traitor, however, and his trial in a U.S. \n     court on charges of complicity in the murder of Captain \n     Thompson was dismissed on the grounds that he had been denied \n     a right to a fair and speedy trial. So Provoo went unpunished \n     for his actions against his fellow countrymen, though some \n     years later he was reportedly imprisoned for different \n     criminal offenses.)\n       Like the surrendered troops on Bataan, the American \n     defenders of Corregidor were herded into captivity on a death \n     march which left many dead or dying, and some of those who \n     survived this grim ordeal then had to endure an even grimmer \n     one in the hands of the Japanese military police--the dreaded \n     Kempei Tai.\n       Sakakida was one of those in whom the Kempei Tai took a \n     special interest. He did not take part in the death march but \n     was kept on Corregidor for six months--the only American left \n     on this tragic rock. He had originally come to the attention \n     of the Japanese military on the very first day of the \n     surrender, when he had accompanied General Wainwright to \n     Bataan to act as interpreter at the surrender conference. \n     From that day his life had followed a steep decline into \n     hell. He told the Japanese that he had been taken by the \n     Americans from internment camp and made to work for them \n     under duress, but the Japanese did not believe this cover \n     story and produced several liberated Japanese prisoners-\n     of-war who testified that Sakakida had worked for the \n     United States Army as an interrogator on a completely \n     voluntary basis. He was kept in one of the side tunnels in \n     Corregidor's honeycomb of tunnel installations and \n     interrogated over a period of several months. As Sakakida \n     was not very cooperative the method of interrogation grew \n     daily more severe. Sakakida was tortured, often severely. \n     Sometimes he was burned all over his body with lighted \n     cigarettes, sometimes he was beaten. He was slung with his \n     back over a wooden beam, his feet dangling free of the \n     floor, and he had water pumped into his stomach and was \n     then jumped on by his Japanese guards.\n       It was never entirely clear whether the torture was meted \n     out as a punishment for being a Nisei, as a means of \n     extracting information, or both. The Kempi Tai not \n     unreasonably believed that any Japanese who had suddenly \n     appeared in their midst at the side of the American C-in-C in \n     the Philippines, as Sakakida had done, ought to have \n     something interesting to divulge to them, though they were \n     not sure what. So every so often they beat him and burned him \n     some more, but he still would not talk. He was taken to the \n     former School of Artillery at Fort Stotsenberg and tortured, \n     and sometimes he was hauled off to the Judge Advocate \n     General's section at Fourteenth Army Headquarters in Manila, \n     where the view and the faces were different but the general \n     ambience much the same as before. Throughout all this \n     unpleasantness Sakakida held out and stuck to his original \n     story. He claimed that he was a victim of circumstances and \n     that the Americans had taken him to Corregidor and Bataan as \n     an interpreter and nothing more. He maintained that he was an \n     American citizen (which was true) and a civilian (which was \n     not). Never once, burnt and bloody though he was, did he so \n     much as breathe a hint that he was an agent of enemy \n     intelligence.\n       In December 1942 Sakakida was removed to Bilibid Prison. \n     Here he shared the same cell block as Japanese soldiers \n     serving life sentences for surrendering to the Americans \n     during the battle for Bataan. Some of these soldiers had been \n     interrogated by Sakakida after their surrender and they now \n     relished the opportunity of getting their own back. Sakakida \n     was not informed that he was to stand trial for treason, \n     since anyone of Japanese ancestry was of necessity a Japanese \n     citizen, and it was therefore as a Japanese citizen that he \n     had given his services to his country's enemies, the \n     Americans. If this charge was continued with, Sakakida faced \n     the death sentence. But towards the end of the year \n     Fourteenth Army Headquarters received word from the Japanese \n     Foreign Ministry in Tokyo that, although Sakakida had \n     indeed been registered with the Japanese Consul in Hawaii \n     at birth, his Japanese citizenship had been officially \n     made void in August 1941 by his mother. She had the \n     foresight to take this action after her son had left for \n     the Philippines--an action which even the Japanese \n     recognized made the charge of treason illegal. The charge \n     against Sakakida was therefore reduced to one of \n     disturbing the peace and order of the Japanese Imperial \n     Forces in Japan, and the interrogation continued, and the \n     torture too, though on an appropriately reduced scale. \n     Then this luckless Nisei was put in solitary confinement \n     and left to rot.\n       Altogether Sakakida spent nearly a year in the hands of the \n     Kempei Tai. Finally, in February 1943, he was taken from \n     Bilibid Prison to the office of Colonel Nishiharu, Chief \n     Judge Advocate of Fourteenth Army Headquarters, who had \n     evidently reviewed the case and come to the conclusion the \n     story which Sakakida had continued to tell without a single \n     variation was in all probability genuine. The Colonel told \n     Sakakida that he would now be released from custody and taken \n     into his, the Colonel's, employ. He was to work in the office \n     as an English translator, run a mimeograph machine, make tea \n     and help out generally, and in his off-duty time he would \n     serve as a houseboy at the Colonel's home. Sakakida was soon \n     to discover that security was not the Japanese military's \n     strongest virtue. Ofter he found himself alone in the office \n     with countless sensitive documents lying untended in unlocked \n     filing cases. Some of these documents he proceeded to \n     memorize or purloin, though as yet he had no means of \n     communicating their contents to the Allied cause.\n       Sakadida's rehabilitation was only probationary, however. \n     At various times and in devious ways the Japanese tried to \n     trap him into an admission that he was a serving member of \n     the United States Army. One day someone threw him a .45 \n     pistol to clean, just to see how he handled it. Sakakida \n     realized that to disassemble the weapon properly would \n     demonstrate an embarrassing military expertise on his part, \n     so he merely wiped it with an oily rag and handed it back. On \n     another occasion a Japanese officer, a graduate of Harvard \n     with a disarmingly sympathetic manner, quietly asked him how \n     much the \n\n[[Page S552]]\n     U.S. Army paid him as an interpreter. Sakakida saw through this ruse at \n     once, of course--it was a common method of finding out a \n     prisoner's rank--and replied that he had received no pay at \n     all, only food and accomodation. Once he was alarmed to hear \n     the counterespionage chief at Fourteenth Army suddenly accuse \n     him out of the blue of being a sergeant in the American Army, \n     a charge he denied with sufficient vehemence for the officer \n     to turn to other things. All these ruses he survived, only to \n     be caught dipping into Colonel Nishiharu's precious stock \n     of American cigarettes, an outrage which earned him the \n     sack as houseboy at the Colonel's house (though he was \n     kept on in his job at the Colonel's office).\n       As it turned out, this was the best thing that could have \n     happened to him. He was now sent to live in the civilian \n     barracks in the former English Club in Manila city. Even \n     under its new managers, the English Club could hardly be \n     described as a penitentiary. Though the Japanese warrant \n     officer in charge kept strict discipline--roll call at six in \n     the morning and 11:30 at night, bed check at midnight--he \n     overlooked the hours between midnight and the morning roll \n     call. Sakakida thus found that he had several hours of the \n     night at his disposal to resume his role as a CIC agent deep \n     behind enemy lines. During those hours of darkness he had the \n     opportunity to pass on valuable intelligence information \n     gained at Fourteenth Army Headquarters during the day. He \n     knew that by this time the Filipino resistance had built up a \n     well-organized guerrilla movement in the mountains and \n     possibly had established radio contact with General \n     MacArthur's headquarters in Australia. If Sakakida could find \n     a suitable go-between he might be in a position to make an \n     important contribution to the intelligence war against Japan. \n     The risks he ran were appalling, but at no time did he see \n     himself as heroic--it was simply something he felt he had to \n     do, and was glad to do.\n       Sakakida's lucky break came not long afterwards, when the \n     wife of an imprisoned guerrilla leader, Ernest Tupas, who was \n     serving a 15-year sentence for anti-Japanese activities, \n     walked into the Judge Advocate General's office to apply for \n     a pass to visit her husband in Muntinglupa prison. Sakakida \n     was required to translate her request into Japanese and \n     during this initial contact he not only revealed his identity \n     as a U.S. Army Nisei to her, but was able to fill out a \n     number of bogus passes for her and other guerrillas' wives, \n     and also hand over several intelligence documents concerning \n     Japanese military plans. In return, Mrs. Tupas was able to \n     arrange meetings between Sakakida and many of her husband's \n     guerrilla comrades who were still at large in the Filipino \n     resistance. In his free hours Sakakida was able to pass on \n     tactical information to them and to hatch a daring plan to \n     spring Tupas and as many as 500 of his fellow guerrillas from \n     prison.\n       Sakakida's plan was simple in concept. All that was \n     required was for Sakakida himself and a small group of \n     guerrillas disguised as Japanese officers to overcome the \n     prison guards and release the inmates. In practice, of \n     course, it was a rather more complex business. There were \n     three essential components to Sakakida's plan. The first was \n     that Tupas himself should somehow wangle himself a job in \n     the prison's electrical department, so that at an \n     appropriate moment he would be in a position to short-\n     circuit the prison electrical facilities. The second was \n     that the guerrillas should keep a meticulous watch on the \n     prison in order to determine the precise movements and \n     time-keeping of the prison guards. The third was that \n     somehow they should get hold of five or six Japanese \n     officers' uniforms, preferably without knife-holes in the \n     back of the tunics.\n       All this was done and by October 1943 everything was \n     arranged. Immediately after the midnight bed check in the \n     barracks at the English Club, Sakakida stole out into the \n     darkened, deserted streets of Manila and made his way to his \n     rendezvous with the guerrilla raiding party. Along with four \n     of the guerrillas he changed into Japanese officer's uniform, \n     complete with medal ribbons and a clanking sword at his side, \n     and spent a few moments rehearsing army salutes and formal \n     Japanese bows. Then, with military precision and a haughty \n     imperial swagger to their stride, the group strutted off down \n     the road to the Muntinglupa prison, backs straight, chests \n     puffed out, faces grim and set, polished boots echoing click \n     clack on the paving stones. Sakakida, as the only ethnic \n     Japanese and linguist in the group, marched at their head as \n     they approached the main gate of the prison. It was he who \n     addressed the soldiers of the guard at the prison entrance, \n     barking at them in harsh, guttural commands which compelled \n     their confidence and respect. Thinking that the guerrillas \n     were officers from the Japanese garrison making their nightly \n     security inspection of the prison--which the guerrillas had \n     already established took place regularly between midnight and \n     2 a.m.--the guards bowed low in respect for their superiors, \n     in accordance with Japanese custom. And as they bowed, eyes \n     firmly fixed on the ground at their feet, Sakakida and his \n     partisan comrades tapped each one on the back of the head \n     with the weighted butt of a .45 revolver.\n       With precision timing the lights in the prison were \n     suddenly extinguished--Tupas had done his job well. Sakakida \n     was now joined by a second, much larger guerrilla group of \n     some 25 men, and under cover of the darkness and confusion \n     the reinforced guerrilla force broke into the prison, rapidly \n     overpowered the guards inside and began opening the cell \n     doors. Altogether nearly 500 Filipino prisoners escaped from \n     Japanese captivity that night in one of the biggest gaol-\n     breaks of the war. Most of them got clean away, scampering as \n     fast as their legs would carry them out to the city outskirts \n     and the friendlier countryside before dawn could reveal their \n     whereabouts to the enemy. By then Sakakida was safely back in \n     the English Club in time for morning roll call, and later in \n     the morning he had the gratification of witnessing the \n     hysterical Prison Superintendent report to the barely less \n     hysterical Judge Advocate General the inexplicable loss of \n     his entire contingent of prisoners--only to be dismissed \n     on the spot for his pains.\n       Among those who get away was the biggest prize of them all, \n     the guerrilla leader Tupas. With the other escapees, Tupas \n     made for the mountains of Rizal, where he set up new partisan \n     headquarters and--most crucially--established radio \n     communications with the Australian headquarters of General \n     MacArthur, who was now C-in-C of United States land and air \n     forces in the Pacific Theatre. At last Sakakida had a means \n     of relaying to the Americans the vast amount of information \n     he had acquired while he was working in Colonel Nishiharu's \n     office at Fourteenth Army Headquarters. In effect, Sakakida \n     had become one of that exotic band of makeshift intelligence \n     agents known as the ``coast watchers of the islands'', a \n     fifth column of traders, telegraphists, anthropologists, \n     civil servants and others who were left behind when the \n     islands were overrrun by the Japanese but managed to evade \n     captivity and to communicate information about Japanese \n     movements and forces by radio to MacArthur's headquarters \n     throughout the course of the war.\n       Sakakida's position was almost unique, however, for it was \n     a rare event in the history of World War Two for the Army \n     headquarters of one belligerent nation to have one of their \n     serving soldiers and intelligence agents reporting back from \n     the very heart of the Army headquarters of an enemy \n     belligerent nation. But this was the case with CIC Agent \n     Richard Sakakida. Moreover, much of the information he now \n     transmitted was priceless. Much of it concerned Japanese \n     troop movements and shipping activities, all of which was of \n     vital significance in the day-to-day conduct of the campaigns \n     in the Pacific Theatre. But probably his single most \n     devastating contribution to the American military cause was a \n     portion of the invasion plans of a Japanese Expeditionary \n     Force of the Thirty-Fifth Army which was to be sent to \n     Australia. Just how important these plans were Sakakida was \n     able to glean a few months later from a Japanese officer in \n     the Judge Advocate General's office who had taken part in the \n     ill-fated mission. The officer in question had been on board \n     one of the navy ships that had left the Philippines, \n     ostensibly with plans to land invasion forces at Port Darwin \n     in Northern Australia. The officer returned to the \n     Philippines on the only ship that got back. American \n     submarines had taken care of the rest.\\1\\\n     \\1\\ Since there is no record of any Japanese invasion of \n     Australia, it must be assumed that what Sakakida had in mind \n     here was the engagement known as the Battle of the Bismarck \n     Sea.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       With the tide of war now beginning to run against the \n     Japanese, and the dream of imperial conquest cracking and \n     crumbling away, Sakakida's position at Fourteenth Army \n     Headquarters grew steadily more precarious. It was not \n     that he was under any direct suspicion, only that as a \n     Nisei he was viewed with increasing opprobrium by any \n     member of the Japanese military who came into contact with \n     him. Once Japanese headquarters came under direct American \n     attack the mutterings against him deteriorated into \n     outright hostility. In December 1944, because of heavy air \n     raids on Manila, the Japanese commander in the \n     Philippines, General Yamashita, the legendary conqueror of \n     Singapore, was forced to move his headquarters to Baguio \n     in the mountainous north of Luzon, and then even farther \n     into the mountains, to Bontoc, a few months later. The \n     time had come, Sakakida reckoned, to make a break for it \n     and hide out through the final phase of the war in the \n     security of the hills.\n       It was not the first time he had considered escape. More \n     than a year previously General MacArthur's headquarters had \n     ordered Anderson's Guerrillas--a guerrilla unit led by an \n     American officer who had escaped from Battaan--to try and \n     extricate Sakakida from the Philippines, but Sakakida had \n     feared a trap, Anderson's messages to headquarters had got \n     garbled, and the whole operation had broken up in confusion. \n     This time he would make no mistake. Early in June 1945 he \n     escaped into the mountains and a week later joined up with a \n     small band of guerrillas in the vicinity of Farmschol. Ten \n     days later they came under heavy Japanese shelling during \n     which Sakakida was so badly wounded that he had to be left \n     behind when the guerrillas made good their escape. He was now \n     on his own and would remain so to the finish, wandering \n     between the lines for weeks and months on end.\n       In the remotest reaches of the jungle Sakakida lived more \n     like an animal than a man. Though the jungle was luxuriant it \n     offered little enough to eat beyond grass and wild fruits. \n     With a razor blade he removed shrapnel fragments embedded in \n     his abdomen, but his wounds festered and he was \n\n[[Page S553]]\n     drenched by tropical cloudbursts, for it was into the rainy season, and \n     bitten to within an inch of his life by the hordes of \n     tropical insects. For months he endured semistarvation and \n     the ravages of malaria, dysentery and beriberi. His hair and \n     beard grew long and wild, his skin was covered in sores and \n     scratches, his voice grew cracked and feeble, his eyes burned \n     fever-bright his clothes hung in tatters. He had no means of \n     knowing what was happening in the outside world, no knowledge \n     of the course of the war, of the liberation of the \n     Philippines, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the \n     American landings in Japan, the Japanese surrender to General \n     MacArthur on board the battleship Missouri. But he did notice \n     that no more American P-38 fighter-bomber planes were \n     coming over dropping napalm, and that there seemed to be a \n     lot of trigger-happy Filipinos about, whom he was careful \n     to avoid.\n       World War Two had been over for weeks when Sakakida decided \n     his condition was so desperate that he ought to attempt to \n     reach help. Finding himself close to the Asing River, he \n     resolved to follow it downstream, hoping to reach the sea, \n     but he was so ill he could only make painfully slow progress, \n     and sometimes he blacked out. Then one day he spotted some \n     movement among the trees ahead, a group of soldiers coming up \n     the hill, and he drew as close to them as he dared. The \n     soldiers carried equipment and wore helmets and uniforms \n     which were strange to him. They were clearly not Japanese, \n     nor obviously American, and his first thought was: ``God! Now \n     they've got Germans out here!'' Not until he was within \n     earshot of the men and could hear snatches of their \n     conversation did he suddenly, ecstatically, realize that they \n     were Americans after all. At first he was afraid to come out \n     of hiding for fear they would take one look at his wild \n     Japanese appearance and shoot first and ask questions later. \n     But eventually euphoria overcame his caution, and madly \n     waving his arms and yelling as loudly as he could, he stepped \n     out of the jungle for the first time in months.\n       ``Don't shoot!'' he yelled. ``I'm an American! Can't you \n     see? An American!''\n       The soldiers were extremely skeptical. Sakakida hardly \n     looked human, and certainly not American. They took him to \n     their battalion headquarters, an outfit which turned out to \n     be a medical evacuation unit posted in the forward areas to \n     collect stragglers. To the CO of this unit Sakakida \n     identified himself as an intelligence agent captured by the \n     Japanese at the outbreak of the war, and he gave his serial \n     number (10100022) and other pertinent data to back up his \n     claim. The officer was also extremely doubtful about all this \n     but agreed to put through a telephone call to the CIC Field \n     Office, and two hours later two CIC lieutenants drove up in a \n     jeep, leapt out and identified the weary agent as one of the \n     men they had been ordered by General McArthur's headquarters \n     to look for. Then they bundled Richard Sakakida into the jeep \n     and drove him to the Bagadec Field Office of the First CIC \n     Region of the 441st CIC Detachment. He had come home at last. \n     An uproarious welcome engulfed this lone survivor and a \n     festive banquet was laid out in his honour, with fried \n     chicken and beer and white bread and fresh butter and other \n     good things. Having lived for months on nothing but herbs and \n     grasses, such sumptuous fare proved too rich for him and it \n     took him a week to recover from the effects of the most \n     memorable binge in his life.\n       Sakakida was hospitalized for a week, then sent to Manila \n     for de-briefing. His story was so extraordinary that he found \n     people needed a lot of convincing he had not been a \n     collaborator with the Japanese. At Christmas 1945 he was at \n     last sent home to Hawaii for two weeks' leave, one of which \n     he spent in hospital with malaria and a high white corpuscle \n     blood count. Then it was back to Manila, where he was \n     assigned to the War Crime Investigation team, locating and \n     identifying guilty parties, aided by the Japanese \n     predilection for keeping records and diaries. He testified in \n     the trial of General Yamashita and later in the trial of the \n     American traitor of Corregidor, Sergeant John David Provoo. \n     Commissioned in 1947, he sought a transfer to the air force \n     and was subsequently posted to Japan, finally retiring in \n     1975 as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force. Today \n     Richard Sakakida is alive and well and living in California--\n     and happy to avoid the ballyhoo that attends most national \n     heroes.\n       Richard Sakakida and Arthur Komori were among the only \n     members of the CIC Detachment in the Philippines--the ``Lost \n     Detachment''.--to survive the war. Others known to have \n     survived included Special Agents Lorenzo Alvardo, John Lynch, \n     Ralph Montgomery, James Rubard and Clyde Teske. Most of the \n     rest died in Japanese hands. Both these brave Nisei were \n     awarded Bronze Stars for their work which, in the words of \n     their commendation, ``they performed with complete disregard \n     to the danger in which they found themselves.'' These two \n     Nisei, the citation continued, ``are a credit to their people \n     and to the United States Army.'' Of Sakakida's exploits over \n     and above the call of duty, his friend Komori had this to \n     say: ``His successful duping of the Japs is the finest story \n     of counter intelligence within enemy lines. His recovery was \n     considered even more important than the capture of General \n     Yamashita, the conqueror of Singapore.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S548-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

He has developed rapidly an \nunusual acuity for the chemistry and movement of issues in the often \nconfusing milieu of the Senate legislative process, and the floor \nconsideration of national defense legislation.\n  In the context of our Committee work he has drafted authorization and \nappropriations language and recommendations in a wide variety of areas, \nincluding: the budget of the Department of Defense and the State \nDepartment, U.S. policy toward Bosnia, and the annual budget for world-\nwide military construction projects. In all, his work has been \noutstanding, timely, with a sure foundation of good judgment, a fine \nknowledge of the English language, a pleasing writing style and an \nability to make a good argument. His work, in fact, has been \noutstanding even in the comparison to the general group of Fellows that \nserve in the Senate on an annual basis, and I have been very pleased to \nrequest that the Army National Guard leave him with us for another \nlegislative session.\n  In the same time, B.G. Wright has attended to his other duties in the \nArmy National Guard, and also to his very unusual duty of serving as a \nWhite House social aide. In the process of this latter position, he was \nrequested by name to assist President Clinton in hosting 150 Heads of \nState for the United Nation's Fiftieth Anniversary in New York.\n  The Army National Guard has had the good sense to permit B.G. to \nremain on my staff for an additional year, and I have no doubt that he \nwill continue to grow and contribute to the life of the Senate in the \ncoming year. I look forward to his work, his exceptionally pleasing \npersonality, and his good character. I again congratulate him on a well \ndeserved promotion to Lieutenant Colonel and wish him all the best in \nhis Army career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S553-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S553-S554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the effort to defund the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. Playing games with the budget \nappropriations in this manner is contrary to the Nation's welfare. The \nintent to incapacitate and slowly dismantle the agency by obstructing \nthe planning and grantmaking processes appears to be a deliberate \nattempt to terminate Federal support for the arts and to deny Americans \naccess to their cultural heritage.\n  Some may believe that the arts will be able to generate the local \nsupport necessary to sustain themselves, but I am fearful the opposite \nwill be true. Local dollars are already stretched to capacity. Major \narts funders such as the Rockefeller Foundation, the Pew Charitable \nTrusts in Philadelphia, and the James Irvine Foundation in California \nhave stated publicly that foundations will not and cannot replace \nFederal funding. Corporate giving has declined in recent years despite \neconomic growth and there is little, if any, reason to believe that \nwill change. The commercial entertainment industry continues to resist \ninvesting in the source of much of its talent. Further, \n\n[[Page S554]]\nremoval of both the national recognition and the stimulation of \npartnerships offered through Federal grants will produce a dramatic \nreduction in State and local support.\n  The Rockefeller Foundation surveyed 40 foundations and found every \ndonor but one unable to increase their cultural portfolios. Dr. Alberta \nArthurs concluded her report of the study by stating, ``The cultural \nsituation we have created in the last 30 years is a dense and delicate \nbalance of private and public interests and funds. If this is to be \ndisturbed, what will replace it?''\n  Opponents of the Arts Endowment know that a replacement is unlikely. \nThe cry to privatize is but a code word for eliminate. These are the \nsame people who advocate for new tax laws that would end deductions for \nindividual and corporate contributions to the arts.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts has been remarkably successful in \nfurthering the ideals for which it was created. The arts are no longer \nviewed as the privileged domain of a relatively few practitioners and \nconnoisseurs; they are no longer considered as incidental or peripheral \nto our way of life. Every single community in our country now has \naccess to its indigenous and creative national culture. Without Arts \nEndowment funding, many popular programs simply would not exist, let \nalone be made available to millions of Americans in all parts of our \nNation. The major arts institutions serving well-to-do patrons in urban \nareas will survive, but how many children, elderly, disabled, inner-\ncity and rural dwellers will be able to participate? How will new \naudiences gain access to our common culture?\n  Targeting the Arts Endowment is not about balancing the budget. It is \nabout throwing out the solid arts networks built over 30 years because \nof unease caused by a few controversial grants. The Arts Endowment has \nalready cracked down on such grants, and it has certainly borne its \nfair share of cuts. Recently, the agency eliminated 47 percent of its \nstaff positions and reorganized its administration and grantmaking to \nadjust to a 40-percent reduction in its budget. Anything more would \nseverely damage the availability and accessibility of countless arts \nprograms in communities nationwide. It must not happen.\n  I would urge my colleagues to stop playing politics with the \nEndowment, honor the appropriations that both Houses have passed, and \nenact a bridge that will enable this agency, already hampered by severe \nfunding reductions, to get on with its valuable work in an orderly \nfashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S553-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SINTE GLESKA UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I would like to take a few minutes \nto recognize the achievements of Sinte Gleska University in Rosebud, \nSD. This week, the university celebrates its 25th anniversary.\n  Sinte Gleska has a dual mission--to prepare South Dakota students for \nthe 21st century and extend the Lakota traditions. Each of these \nmissions is important to the future of our State. The university \ncontinually must push ahead to incorporate the latest technology into \nits curriculum, adapting to the changing needs of a diverse and global \neconomy. At the same time, the university must preserve the Lakota \nheritage--the language and culture which are unique to our region of \nthe country.\n  It is not an easy task for any institution to simultaneously look \nforward and back, but Sinte Gleska has done an outstanding job in \nfulfilling its missions. Each year the university produces graduates \nwho become educators, community workers, and tribal leaders. In fact, \nthe success of native American students at tribal colleges is higher \nthan at other universities.\n  The university's success certainly can be attributed to its emphasis \non values. Sinte Gleska's logo names four values which the university \nstrives to instill in students--wisdom, bravery, fortitude, and \ngenerosity. The embracement of these values strengthens individual \nstudents and binds the community together.\n  Last year, Congress passed legislation giving the Nation's 29 tribal \ncolleges land grant status. This important change put tribal colleges \non equal footing with other State universities. Additional efforts in \nWashington to advance tribal colleges are continuing. I am working with \nother Senators to secure an Executive Order equalizing the treatment of \ntribal colleges with other minority colleges and universities. Despite \nrepeated efforts by Congress, the President has not yet signed such an \norder. I again call upon him to do so immediately.\n  Sinte Gleska students face many new, exciting challenges in the years \nto come. I have no doubt that the university will help them meet those \nchallenges successfully within the framework of the four values that \nserve as the foundation for a Sinte Gleska education.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S554-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT CONCERNING EMIGRATION LAWS AND POLICIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF \n              BULGARIA--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 113\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport, which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On June 3, 1993, I determined and reported to the Congress that \nBulgaria is in full compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria \nof sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974.

Mr. President, last week, President Clinton opened a \nnew front in America's war on drugs with his appointment of Gen. Barry \nMcCaffrey as the Nation's new drug czar. In doing so, President Clinton \nhas once again demonstrated his commitment to put the full weight of \nhis office and the American Government behind efforts to stem the tide \nof drugs flooding America's streets, and I commend him for that.\n\n  The measures my colleagues and I are introducing today are meant as a \nshot across the bow to the Government of Mexico. This legislation by \nthe chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and myself, a Republican \nand a Democrat, will hopefully send a strong message that this Congress \nis prepared to back up the President's efforts in the strongest \npossible terms if Mexico's actions do not match their words in this war \non drugs.\n  One year ago, the United States provided $20 billion in loan \nguarantees to Mexico in an unprecedented economic assistance package. \nThat loan guarantee agreement expires next month with the option to \nextend it for another 6 months.\n  Today, based on the seriousness of the drug problem, the volume of \ndrugs flowing into the United States, and the ineffectiveness of \nMexico's efforts, I am joining with Senator D'Amato in introducing \nthree pieces of legislation, two bills and one sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, which, among other things, would link extension of the loan \nguarantee to Mexico to specific actions that Mexico must take to \ndemonstrate greater cooperation with the United States and \ninternational anti-narcotics efforts.\n  Let me explain for a moment the depth of this problem. The Drug \nEnforcement Administration estimates that 60 to 70 percent of all the \nillegal drugs that enter the United States are smuggled through Mexico; \n75 percent of the cocaine and 60 to 80 percent of all foreign-grown \nmarijuana in the United States originates in Mexico.\n  DEA testified that it has become commonplace to have 727 cargo-style \njets each carrying 10 to 20 tons of cocaine at a time fly into Mexico \nand return to Colombia with $20 to $30 million of United States \ncurrency aboard. Colombian drug cartels are using Mexico as a safe \nhaven to store as much as 70 to 100 tons of cocaine to be smuggled into \nthe United States.\n  The United States Customs officials estimate that almost 70 percent \nof those arrested for drug smuggling at border stations in the United \nStates are Mexican nationals.\n  Mexican drug cartels have taken over the methamphetamine drug trade. \nThis is a very dangerous drug, also known as crank or speed. The DEA \nestimates that 90 percent of the precursor chemical, ephedrine, used to \nmake methamphetamine is smuggled into the United States from Mexico, \nmuch of it originating from China.\n  Methamphetamine is an exploding problem in the United States, and \nparticularly in California. The California Bureau of Narcotics \nEnforcement figures show that from 1991 to 1994 seizures jumped 518 \npercent in just these 3 years.\n  In 10 years, from 1983 to 1993, methamphetamine abuse has skyrocketed \nin some California counties by more than 1,000 percent. Hospital \nemergency rooms admissions from amphetamine abuse have jumped by 366 \npercent.\n  California is infested with literally hundreds of clandestine and \nhighly mobile methamphetamine labs. State drug officials indicate that \nthese labs are most often run by Mexican nationals who are here \nillegally.\n  Mexico's efforts to date are simply not good enough. The recent \narrest of Juan Garcia Abrego is a step in the right direction, but \noverall Mexico's efforts have simply not been enough.\n  The United States currently has 165 extradition requests pending with \nMexico, 56 of those involving Mexican nationals. The United States has \nhad an extradition treaty with Mexico since 1978, yet Mexico has not \nallowed the extradition of a single Mexican national to the United \nStates for prosecution as any close ally would.\n  Juan Garcia Abrego was not extradited. He was deported as a U.S. \ncitizen. He held dual citizenship.\n  The drug cartels still operate in Mexico with impunity. Leaders of \ntwo of \n\n[[Page S556]]\nthe most powerful Mexican drug cartels, Amado Carillo-Fuentes and the \nArellano-Felix brothers, have outstanding United States warrants for \ndrug trafficking. They have been seen in public repeatedly with no fear \nof arrest, and there apparently has been no serious effort to apprehend \nthem.\n  Money laundering. Mexico has become a haven for money laundering. \nUnder Mexican law, money laundering is not a crime. No reporting \nrequirements for large cash transactions exist. Jose Antonio Ramirez, \ndirector of Mexico's Association of Exchange Houses, has said it is \ncommon for cartel operatives to show up at unregulated money centers \nwith literally suitcases stuffed with cash. The centers then write \nmoney orders or wire the funds to Colombia.\n  I understand that the Mexican Congress has asked the National Banking \nCommission to examine ways of preventing money laundering, but whether \nany concrete changes will result remains to be seen.\n  Let me give you some examples of government corruption:\n  Colombian jets unloading tons of cocaine in remote desert areas with \nthe possible cooperation of Mexican Federal Police.\n  Reports that in a single weekend last November, 20 tons of cocaine \ndestined for the United States were flown into Mexico in two large \ncargo plane shipments.\n  And the investigation involving connections between the drug cartels, \nSwiss bank accounts, and the brother of former President Carlos Salinas \nde Gortari only serves to reinforce the belief that drug-influenced \ncorruption may reach the highest levels of Government.\n  Based on Mexico's efforts to date, Senator D'Amato and I believe that \nextraordinary measures are required. The legislation coauthored by \nSenator D'Amato and myself would do the following:\n  One, link extension of the loan guarantee to Mexico with cooperation \nin antidrug efforts. The United States-Mexico loan guarantee agreement \nexpires next month. But the parties share an option to extend the \nagreement for an additional 6 months. And most likely they will be \nrenewed after that.\n  This bill would prohibit the extension of the repayment terms for any \nof the currently outstanding loans to Mexico. It would prohibit the use \nof any of the remaining loan guarantees not obligated unless certain \nconditions with respect to antidrug efforts are met.\n  Second, we are introducing a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \nMexico should not be certified under the Foreign Assistance Act as \nfully cooperating with the United States and international \nantinarcotics efforts. Failure to certify as cooperating with these \nefforts would jeopardize Mexico's eligibility to receive foreign aid.\n  Sanctions for failure to be certified are mandatory, requiring that \nthe United States withhold 50 percent of all foreign aid, with the \nexception of humanitarian and drug enforcement funds.\n  The third bill prohibits the approval of applications from Mexican \ntrucking companies applying for cross-border permits under NAFTA until \nthe Secretary of Transportation can certify that the trucks meet United \nStates safety standards, the President certifies Mexico is taking \nsufficient steps to combat international narcotics trafficking, and the \nCongress approves the applications via a joint resolution.\n  These are strong steps, but I truly believe that this problem is so \nserious that strong steps are required.\n  Evidence that would show Mexico's commitment to address these issues \nwould include action such as the following:\n  One, compliance with all outstanding requests for extradition by the \nUnited States.\n  Two, enactment and implementation of effective money laundering laws.\n  Three, action to prevent Mexico's drug profiteers from taking \nadvantage of plans to privatize formerly public assets such as banks.\n  Four, enactment of effective laws to inspect and license trucks, \ncars, and aircraft as well as their owners and operators to assist drug \ncrime enforcement.\n  Five, enactment of effective laws to curtail the importation and \nexport of major precursor chemicals for methamphetamine production and \nother narcotic production.\n  Six, specific action to effect the arrests of Mexican drug cartel \nleaders and other individuals involved in organized crime.\n  Seven, adoption of a comprehensive program for drug enforcement and \nassistance to United States law enforcement to take effective action.\n  Eight, specific action dedicated to detecting and halting the large-\nscale air transportation of narcotics.\n  Nine, specific action to prosecute graft and corruption among \ncivilian, government, and military officials that assist drug \nproduction and smuggling.\n  And, finally, passage of asset forfeiture laws which enable the \nconfiscation of property derived through narcotics trafficking or \nfraudulent use of the loan guarantee funds.\n  Without tangible evidence that Mexico is willing to work toward these \ngoals, I am prepared to support the strong steps I have outlined.\n  Mr. President, earlier Senator D'Amato and I, at a press conference, \nindicated our joint action to press forward with these bills. Mr. \nD'Amato indicated that his Banking Committee would be holding hearings \non these bills in March. We earnestly and sincerely invite other \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have seen firsthand a major tunnel under the Mexican \nborder that goes from a warehouse in Mexico, to a warehouse on the \nCalifornia side, that was air-conditioned and electrified to facilitate \nthe smuggling of drugs from one country to another.\n  Mr. President, not too long ago in Rialto, CA, San Bernardino county, \nan arrest was made with the seizure of 4.5 tons--4.5 tons of \ncocaine. That amount of cocaine did not come across the border in \nbackpacks.\n\n  Mr. President, I have been to the border. I have seen trucks going \nback and forth with very little or no inspection in the line-release \nprogram. For the past year, I have advocated a tightening of that \nprogram.\n  Now, under NAFTA, an even greater number of trucks would be able to \ncross the border with no inspection. What is the guarantee, when we \nknow there is up to 100 tons of cocaine stored on the other side of the \nborder awaiting transfer across this border, that it will not come in \nthese trucks?\n  In every city, whether it is New York City, whether it is Los \nAngeles, or whether it is San Francisco, we have all seen people dying \nin the streets from drugs and drug deals gone awry. We have all seen \nthe evolution of gangs around the trafficking of narcotics. We have all \nseen the street prices of cocaine drop and the problem get worse. We \nhave seen the major spread of methamphetamine labs throughout the \nlargest State in the Union, California.\n  The time has come to say, Enough is enough. To the Government of \nMexico, close ally of the United States, we say ``This is $20 billion \nin loan guarantees plus other guarantees from the Monetary Fund--you \nmust work hand in hand with us.'' We must stop the 727 cargo jets from \nlanding on Mexican soil, from offloading drugs which then disappear \nbefore onloading United States currency for transport back to Colombia.\n  We must see that cartel leaders are extradited, that American \nextradition requests are honored, and that there are effective laws on \nthe books to preclude money laundering in Mexico. In general, we must \nsee that there is vigorous enforcement in Mexico to abate and stop the \nlarge flow of chemicals, cocaine and other contraband substances into \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following letters be \nprinted in the Record: One letter signed by Senator D'Amato and myself, \ndated January 26, to the Secretary of State urging denial of \ncertification; a letter sent by myself on December 6 to Ambassador \nKantor pointing out problems in cargo trucks coming from Mexico; \nanother letter to Ambassador Kantor, Secretary of State Christopher, \nSecretary of Treasury Rubin, and Attorney General Reno addressing \ncontinuing problems with drug enforcement that are presented by Mexico.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S557]]\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Warren M. Christopher,\n     Secretary, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing to urge you to advise \n     the President to deny certification that Mexico has taken \n     sufficient actions to combat international narcotics \n     trafficking when he reports to Congress on the anti-narcotics \n     efforts of major drug producing and drug-transit countries on \n     March 1, 1996.\n       As you know, Mexico is one of the most significant drug \n     producing and drug transit countries in the world, and the \n     bulk of the drugs moving through Mexico end up in the United \n     States, particularly in the state of California. The Drug \n     Enforcement Agency estimates that at least 75 percent of all \n     cocaine available in the United States originates in Mexico. \n     Further estimates are that 70 to 80 percent of all foreign-\n     grown marijuana in the United States originates in Mexico. It \n     is well known that Colombian drug cartels are using Mexico as \n     a base from which to transport narcotics into the United \n     States. We have been told that Colombian cartels may store as \n     much as 70 to 100 tons of cocaine in Mexico at any one time \n     to await smuggling into the United States.\n       These problems are bad enough, but they are made worse by \n     the Mexican government's failure to take serious actions to \n     address them. There has not been enough of a serious effort \n     to break up the drug cartels that operate with virtual \n     impunity in Mexico, or to arrest and extradite the drug lords \n     who run them. The recent arrest and deportation of Juan \n     Garcia Abrego is a positive development, but it contrasts \n     sharply with the actions of the Mexican authorities in many \n     other cases. To cite just two examples, the leaders of two of \n     the most powerful cartels in Mexico--Amado Carillo-Fuentes of \n     the Chihuahua Cartel, and the Arellano-Felix brothers of the \n     Tijuana Cartel--are reported to be regularly seen in public \n     with no fear of arrest.\n       In addition, Mexico has become a haven for laundering drug \n     money, which is one of the most important aspects of the \n     cartels' operations. Mexican laws regarding money laundering \n     are inadequate, and banks and money exchange houses in Mexico \n     do not have the same reporting requirements for large \n     transactions as they do in the United States. Thousands of \n     exchange houses are openly flouting what little oversight the \n     Mexican government conducts, and millions of dollars are \n     flowing to Colombia via money orders and wire transfers.\n       Finally, drug-influenced corruption continues unabated \n     within Mexican law enforcement agencies and the government \n     itself. One former cartel leader told U.S. prosecutors that \n     up to $50 million a month is used to bribe corrupt Mexican \n     officials to ignore, or even facilitate, drug-trafficking \n     activities. Drug money has clearly corrupted officials at \n     every level of Mexico's government and law enforcement \n     community, and--the investigations of the brother of former \n     President Carlos Salinas de Gortari notwithstanding--\n     President Zedillo's government is not taking sufficient \n     action to root out this corruption.\n       In light of these facts, we are sure you will agree that \n     Mexico is not deserving of certification as cooperating with \n     U.S. and international narcotics efforts when the President \n     issues his report pursuant to section 409A of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act. Furthermore, we do not believe that any vital \n     national interest warrants granting Mexico a waiver from \n     decertification. The illegal drugs that flow into the United \n     States from Mexico are tearing at our very culture, and as \n     such they themselves represent a fundamental threat to our \n     vital national interests. In contrast, the vital national \n     interests of the United States do not require us to provide \n     assistance to Mexico or to vote for multilateral development \n     bank assistance to Mexico, the two areas that would be \n     affected by Mexico's failure to be certified.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this extremely \n     important matter. We look forward to your early reply.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dianne Feinstein,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Alfonse D'Amato,\n       U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Michael Kantor,\n     Ambassador, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor: I am writing to express my strong \n     opposition to the planned December 17 implementation of the \n     proposal to dramatically increase the number cargo trucks \n     from Mexico with direct access to delivery points in the \n     United States, under the North American Free Trade Agreement. \n     This opposition is based on two very serious concerns: first, \n     that inadequate provision has been made to ensure that this \n     will not result in increased drug smuggling across the \n     southwest border; and, second, that this will adverse impact \n     the safety of California's highways.\n       It is my understanding that, beginning on December 17, \n     under NAFTA, cargo trucks crossing the border from Mexico \n     will no longer be restricted to delivery points within a \n     limited commercial zone along the U.S.-Mexico border, but \n     will be permitted to ship freight from origination points in \n     Mexico directly to delivery points throughout California, \n     Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Estimates are that broader \n     access will increase land shipments across the U.S.-Mexico \n     border to approximately 6 million truckloads annually by the \n     year 2001.\n\n\n                             Drug Smuggling\n\n       My concerns with respect to drug smuggling are two fold. \n     First, that our infrastructure to interdict drugs may not be \n     able to keep pace with our efforts to facilitate increased \n     trade and commerce across our land borders. And second, as \n     trade and commerce barriers are reduced between Mexico and \n     the United States, our drug abatement efforts will become \n     increasingly dependent upon the enforcement efforts of our \n     Mexican counterparts.\n       In a memorandum sent to me by Treasury Secretary Rubin last \n     March, his office noted that the number of arriving trucks \n     from Mexico increased last year at a faster rate than the \n     rate of truck inspections, resulting in a decrease in the \n     percentage of trucks being examined for drugs. Although he \n     declined to assume that the increasing cargo volume \n     automatically means an increase in contraband, he recognized \n     that the increase in cargo volume provides a window of \n     opportunity for smugglers.\n       In fact, in spite of (or perhaps because of) the reported \n     success of a number of drug interdiction programs responding \n     to changes in drug trafficking patterns, including the \n     Customs Air Program and Border Patrol's Operation Hold the \n     Line, Secretary Rubin noted that the next logical step for \n     smugglers is to try to exploit the huge cargo volume crossing \n     the border each day.\n       I concur with the assessment that drug smugglers will take \n     advantge of any relaxation of travel barriers between the \n     U.S. and Mexico, and fear that this greater access for \n     Mexican carriers under NAFTA will exacerbate what is already \n     a serious problem with drug interdiction.\n       Specifically, my questions regarding implementation are: \n     How will Customs procedures change to accommodate the \n     increase in truck volume? How will this change impact the \n     Line Release Program? Will companies go through any form of \n     application process or background check, or will any truck \n     from any company in Mexico be given unlimited access to U.S. \n     delivery points in these border states? What is the process \n     for licensing individual drivers from the companies shipping \n     cargo? Will the individual drivers undergo background checks?\n       According to officials from the Department of Justice, \n     cocaine smuggled across the California border with Mexico \n     accounts for at least 70 percent of the drug sent over the \n     entire Southwest border, so California has an enormous \n     interest in ensuring that drug interdiction efforts remain a \n     paramount concern as NAFTA is implemented.\n       Another emerging drug threat in the United States, \n     particularly in California, is the explosive increase in \n     methamphetamine production and trafficking. California has \n     become the production capitol of the nation for this \n     dangerous drug, and the major source of methamphetamine and \n     the precursor chemicals to produce this drug are the Mexican \n     drug cartels.\n       Mexican traffickers have established international \n     connections for supplies of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine key \n     precurson chemicals for methamphetamine which are controlled \n     in the United States but not in Mexico. Shipments of these \n     and other precursor chemicals are sent to Mexico from around \n     the world and then smuggled into the United States to \n     literally hundreds of clandestine laboratories in California \n     for production.\n       Methamphetamine is fast becoming the crack epidemic of the \n     1990s, and law enforcement is already unable to keep up with \n     the problem. A greater volume of uninspected trucks and \n     relaxed trade barriers can only make this problem worse.\n       Secondly, I am also worried about increasing our reliance \n     on Mexico to stop the probable increased flow of drugs across \n     our border. As I have spelled out in a separate letter to \n     you, I am gravely concerned about the adequacy of Mexican \n     efforts to restrict drug trafficking and the alarming level \n     of drug-influenced corruption within Mexican law enforcement \n     agencies and the government itself. This most certainly \n     impacts our efforts at drug abatement in the United States. \n     The news report this last week of a passenger plane loaded \n     with cocaine landing in Baja California Sur with the possible \n     cooperation of Mexican Federal Police is a shocking reminder \n     that our efforts to stop the flood of drugs on American \n     streets are only as strong as our weakest link.\n       I respect the efforts the Clinton Administration has made \n     to reduce the flow of drugs into the United States and I know \n     you share my concerns about maintaining the integrity of our \n     drug interdiction efforts. I support increased trade and \n     commerce with Mexico, but only to the extent that efforts to \n     curtail the epidemic of drug use in our own country are not \n     diminished, and to the extent that Mexico is cooperating \n     fully with our efforts.\n\n\n                             highway safety\n\n       I also want to express my strong concern about the safety \n     implications of allowing large trucks from Mexico access to \n     California's roads.\n\n\n                          hazardous materials\n\n       The Attorney General of Texas, Dan Morales--who supports \n     NAFTA--reports that more than a fourth of the approximately \n     5,000 Mexican trucks which cross into Texas every day carry: \n     corrosives; chemicals; explosives; jet fuel; and pesticides.\n     \n[[Page S558]]\n\n       This week's issue of Time magazine reports that in the past \n     few months, several Mexican trucks in the U.S. have exploded \n     or leaked toxins.\n       With such dangerous materials, and evidence of a poor \n     record of truck safety in the United States, I fear that this \n     problem will escalate dramatically with the expansion of \n     Mexican truck traffic.\n\n\n                                 brakes\n\n       Another major area of concern is Mexico's request that the \n     Administration ease its requirements on front brakes. \n     According to the California Highway Patrol, in 1994 there \n     were 45 accidents involving large trucks for which faulty \n     brakes were found to be the cause. In these accidents, 77 \n     people were injured and there was one fatality. There has \n     been a steady decline over the past ten years of accidents \n     involving large trucks, and I have grave concerns that the \n     increase in Mexican trucks on California's freeways and roads \n     will increase this number.\n\n\n                             drivers hours\n\n       As you know, truckers in the United States are limited to \n     ten hours of driving time. In Mexico, however, there is no \n     limit to the number of hours a driver may be behind the \n     wheel. Again, according to the California Highway Patrol, \n     there were 108 accidents in California involving a large \n     truck where the driver simply fell asleep. These accidents \n     were responsible for killing six and injuring 148.\n       I am very concerned about the adequacy of truck safety \n     inspection at the border. I fear that U.S. Customs Service \n     agents, who already have their hands full inspecting vehicles \n     for drugs and trade treaty compliance features, are simply \n     not going to have the time or technical expertise to conduct \n     thorough safety inspections on trucks coming from Mexico.\n       On behalf of the people of California, I urge your personal \n     attention to these issues.\n       Thank you for your anticipated assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Michael Kantor,\n     Ambassador,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor: I am writing to request that you, \n     along with Secretary of State Christopher, Secretary of the \n     Treasury Rubin, and Attorney General Reno, address a \n     continuing problem which is vexing our country, and my state \n     in particular--the grossly inadequate drug enforcement \n     ``effort'' by Mexico.\n       Just last week, separate published reports demonstrated the \n     alarming, dramatic scale of this problem.\n       The Los Angeles Times reported on the continuing \n     investigation of Raul Salinas de Gortari, older brother of \n     Mexico's former President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari--an \n     investigation which continues to yield appalling information \n     about the extent of drug-influenced corruption in Mexico. The \n     investigation is demonstrating that: The Mexican drug lords \n     have become partners with the Colombian cartels; these \n     cartels supply up to three-fourths of the cocaine in the \n     United States, according to U.S. officials; Raul Salinas de \n     Gortari was closely associated with the most powerful drug \n     lord, Juan Garcia Abrego; Raul Salinas de Gortari served as \n     an intermediary between the drug cartels and Mexico's \n     political and economic elite; Garcia Abrego and Raul Salinas \n     de Gortari used their respective fields of influence to \n     protect each other from law enforcement; Raul Salinas de \n     Gortari profited handsomely from this relationship, with \n     Mexican officials estimating that he may have stockpiled up \n     to $250 million in foreign bank accounts and other \n     investments; and perhaps worst of all, this web of corruption \n     and protection may have extended even to Raul's brother, \n     President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.\n       This investigation was made public in Mexico last week, \n     prompting the unprecedented step of a unanimous vote by \n     members of all parties in Mexico's House of Deputies to \n     establish a congressional commission to investigate Raul \n     Salinas de Gortari and the sources of his wealth.\n       Coupled with other evidence of drug corruption in Mexico, \n     much of which was laid out at a Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee hearing this August, I am afraid that Mexico is in \n     serious jeopardy of becoming a drug-dominated narco-\n     democracy.\n       The New York Times, meanwhile, also reported last week that \n     an entire passenger jet loaded with tons of cocaine landed in \n     a dry lake bed in Baja California Sur on Saturday. Local \n     fishermen saw the cocaine unloaded by 20 men wearing black \n     Mexican Federal Police uniforms. These men arrived in a \n     convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles. After unloading the \n     plane, they set about trying to destroy it, by dismantling \n     it, attempting to blow it up with explosive powder, and \n     finally bulldozing over it with desert sand.\n       Despite widespread reports of Mexican police involvement \n     with allowing or even conducting drug smuggling, state police \n     who arrived on the scene allowed themselves to be talked out \n     of taking action by the uniformed men--demonstrating that the \n     state police were either duped, incredibly inattentive and \n     lacking in vigilance, or corrupt themselves.\n       It comes as no surprise that investigators have traced the \n     airplane's serial numbers back to Colombia's Cali cartel. As \n     for the tons of drugs that were unloaded from the plane, the \n     newspaper reported that they have not been recovered. I would \n     appreciate your investigating and reporting to me what \n     happened to these drugs, and to the plane.\n       For your convenience, I have attached copies of these \n     articles. What is especially dismaying is that there is \n     nothing new about airplanes loaded with multi-million dollar \n     shipments of cocaine flying from Colombia to Mexico. At a \n     Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in February, 1995, Drug \n     Enforcement Administration Director Constantine told me about \n     727s flying 10 to 20 tons of cocaine at a time into Mexico, \n     and returning to Colombia with 20 to 30 million dollars of \n     U.S. currency.\n       At the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in \n     August, we discussed this again. At that point, Ambassador \n     Gelbard interjected, ``based on an order from President \n     Zedillo, he has mobilized the Mexican Air Force to intercept \n     any such flights that do occur.'' And yet, we see now that \n     the flights do continue.\n       Frankly, I am astounded and disgusted that the Mexican \n     government is unable or unwilling to stop massive cargo \n     flights, or incidents such as this latest one, involving an \n     airplane, heavy vehicles, explosives, bulldozers, and police \n     officers who turn the other way.\n       It is no secret where these drugs are going: straight into \n     my State of California. At the February hearing, Director \n     Constantine confirmed that California has replaced Florida as \n     the major point of importation of cocaine into America. He \n     further stated that 75% of the cocaine in the United States \n     enters through the Southwest border from Mexico.\n       Mr. Ambassador, I ask that you, together with Secretary of \n     State Christopher, Secretary of the Treasury Rubin, and \n     Attorney General Reno, really take a good, hard look at what \n     specifically can be done to compel Mexico to achieve a higher \n     level of cooperation and enforcement against drugs.\n       The United States provides Mexico with a great deal of \n     assistance--such as the $20 billion loan guarantee earlier \n     this year. Yet this assistance seems to go to a country that \n     is utterly ineffective at stopping the infliction of the \n     scourge of drug trafficking on my state and our country--or, \n     worse, corruptly facilitates it. If Mexico will not summon \n     the will to help us in this effort, perhaps it is time for us \n     to reconsider our assistance to them.\n       On behalf of the people of California, I urge your personal \n     attention to this issue.\n       Thank you for your anticipated assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Inhofe be added \nas a cosponsor to the bills and the resolution I have just sent to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the Mexican economic meltdown is \nover a year old and no one--not the Mexican people and certainly not \nthe American taxpayers--have seen any signs of improvement or relief. \nLast year, the Clinton administration rushed in to bail out the Mexican \nGovernment with an ill-conceived, and legally tenuous, financial \nassistance package that spent billions of taxpayer dollars. The time \nhas come to stop this financial hemorrhage.\n  Since February 21, 1995, when the administration signed its Financial \nAssistance Agreement with Mexico, I have been saying that the Clinton \nbailout was an ill-conceived disaster. It is not just my opinion, it is \nthe cold hard facts. You only need to look at the Mexican economic \nindicators, including 50-percent interest rates and staggering \ninflation, and the suffering of the Mexican people to realize that the \nplan is not working. Mexico's real economy is still in shambles: record \nnumbers of Mexicans are out of work, interest rates are soaring, the \npeople are starving, and the country is reeling under increasing social \nand political unrest. Christopher Whalen, writing in the January 21, \n1996, edition of the Washington Post, stated ``As in the 1970's, the \nMexicans are again addicted to the debt that we have been spoon-feeding \nthem, and they still can't pay it back.''\n  Mr. President, the only people who have benefited from the Clinton \nbailout are the global investors, the currency speculators, Mexican \nbusiness leaders, and high paid advisers retained by the Mexican \nGovernment. The Mexican bailout was doomed to disaster from the very \nbeginning.\n  Congress rejected Clinton's bailout scheme last year, despite the \nadministration's doomsday predictions of an international financial \ncrisis and waves of illegal immigration. The global financial crisis \nnever materialized but hordes of illegal immigrants are still crossing \nour borders in an attempt to \n\n[[Page S559]]\nescape their desperate living conditions. Their hardships are a direct \nresult of inept Mexican economic policies and the harsh austerity \nmeasures the Clinton administration imposed upon the Mexican people as \npart of the bailout.\n  Mr. President, Mexico has received over $25 billion and it has not \nsolved anything. The Clinton administration bypassed Congress and sent \nbillions of hard-earned American taxpayer dollars to a country reeling \nunder narco-corruption and failed economic policies. Mexico's downward \nspiral is accelerating and the fallout is only beginning.\n  According to the terms of the Financial Assistance Agreement between \nthe administration and Mexico--Article 3, section 7--the agreement \nexpires after 1 year, on February 21, 1996, and it may be extended by \nthe Secretary of Treasury for another 6 months. Secretary Rubin has \nindicated that the Treasury Department intends to extend the bailout \nfor another 6 months so now is the time for Congress to act.\n  Mr. President, my colleague and friend, Senator Feinstein and I, are \ncosponsoring this bill which would place strong conditions on the \nadministration to stop them from wasting more taxpayer dollars on the \nMexican bailout, by preventing an extension of the Assistance \nAgreement, and stopping any additional rollovers of the money already \nowed to the United States, as of the first of this year.\n  At the very least, if the President decides to continue squandering \nany more of the remaining $10.5 billion of U.S. taxpayer money already \ncommitted to Mexico, he should be required to certify that Mexico is \ndoing all that it can to stop the massive flow of narcotics into our \ncountry. This should not be a simple certification--it should be tough \nand thorough. This bill will require Mexico to take strong action to \nfight the drug lords and narcotics kings who are becoming \nmultimillionaires by importing drugs into our country.\n  Our bill sets several pertinent conditions regarding the enormous \namounts of drugs Mexico is sending to this country every day. In our \nbill, the President must certify that Mexico has satisfied each of \nthese conditions before sending any more taxpayer money to Mexico. \nThe Congress already passed a certification requirement related to the \nMexican bailout last year in the Mexican Debt Disclosure Act, which \nrequired the President to certify normal business standards were being \nimposed on the loans and money sent to Mexico.\n\n  A few key facts on the severity of the drug problem with Mexico \nvividly illustrate the need for immediate action:\n  The Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA] estimates that over 70 \npercent of the cocaine in the United States crosses the United States-\nMexico border. Using Mexico as storage for the cocaine, the Colombian \ndrug organizations may be holding cocaine with a street value of up to \n$1 billion.\n  According to the DEA, virtually all of the heroin produced in Mexico \nis trafficked in the United States.\n  The DEA also reports that more than 50 percent of the marijuana found \nin the United States came from Mexico, either cultivated there or \ntransshipped through Mexico from other localities.\n  It appears that trafficking gangs in Mexico are also involved in all \naspects of the methamphetamine trade: producing, trafficking, and \ndistributing it as well as the chemicals used to manufacture the \nmethamphetamines. Law enforcement officials have noticed an increase in \nits availability in the United States.\n  The recent arrest of Juan Garcia Abrego, described as an \ninternational drug kingpin and said to have headed a billion-dollar \ndrug empire, may hold the key to understanding just how big the Mexican \ndrug organizations are and the volume of drugs they traffick into the \nUnited States. The information that he provides to U.S. law enforcement \nis a glimpse into the underground world of international drug \ntrafficking. His arrest is merely the tip of the iceberg.\n  Currently, the Colombian cartel and the drug trafficking gangs in \nMexico are working in partnership to deliver and distribute multitons \nof narcotics into the United States. However, Assistant Secretary of \nState Robert Gelbard told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that, \nwith the arrest of leaders of the Columbian Cali cartel, Mexican drug \ntrafficking gangs may be able to actively traffick these drugs \nthemselves.\n  No doubt, there will be an increase in the availability of narcotics \nas a direct result of the Mexican drug gangs' interest in narcotics \ndistribution, and the ease with which they can transport it into the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an important first step in addressing two \nvery serious problems affecting the American people. This bill will \nforce the Clinton administration and the Mexican Government to make \nreal and substantial efforts to halt the flow of illegal drugs into our \ncountry. The bill also sends notice to the administration that the \nCongress, and the American people, are tired of having hard-earned \ntaxpayer dollars squandered. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbipartisan effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S555-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S559-S560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 10\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, his name was added as a cosponsor \nof S. 10, a bill to make certain laws applicable to the legislative \nbranch of the Federal Government, to reform lobbying registration and \ndisclosure requirements, to amend the gift rules of the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives, and to reform the Federal election laws \napplicable to the Congress.\n\n\n                                 S. 837\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from New Mexico \n[Mr. Domenici] was added as a cosponsor of S. 837, a bill to require \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the \n250th anniversary of the birth of James Madison.\n\n\n                                 S. 990\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nHatfield] was added as a cosponsor of S. 990, a bill to expand the \navailability of qualified organizations for frail elderly community \nprojects (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE)), to \nallow such organizations, following a trial period, to become eligible \nto be providers under applicable titles of the Social Security Act, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nIndiana [Mr. Lugar] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1028, a bill to \nprovide increased access to health care benefits, to provide increased \nportability of health care benefits, to provide increased security of \nhealth care benefits, to increase the purchasing power of individuals \nand small employers, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1334\n\n  At the request of Mr. Frist, the names of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms] and the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 1334, a bill to amend chapter 28 of title 35, \nUnited States Code, to provide for noninfringing uses of patents on \nmedical and surgical procedures.\n\n\n                                S. 1379\n\n  At the request of Mr. Craig, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1379, a bill to make technical amendments to the Fair Debt Collection \nPractices Act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1392\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, the names of the Senator from Alabama \n[Mr. Shelby] and the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 1392, a bill to impose temporarily a 25 percent \nduty on imports of certain Canadian wood and lumber products, to \nrequire the administering authority to initiate an investigation under \ntitle VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 with respect to such products, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1541\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the names of the Senator from Washington \n[Mr. Gorton], the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], the Senator from \nVirginia [Mr. Warner], the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum], the \nSenator from Florida [Mr. Mack], the Senator from Texas [Mrs. \nHutchison], and the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1541, a bill to extend, reform, and improve \nagricultural commodity, trade, conservation, and other programs, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 85\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from \nConnecticut \n\n[[Page S560]]\n[Mr. Lieberman] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 85, a \nresolution to express the sense of the Senate that obstetrician-\ngynecologists should be included in Federal laws relating to the \nprovision of health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S559-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 40--TO COMMEMORATE THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF \n                            TEXAS STATEHOOD\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHINSON (for herself and Mr. Gramm) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Res. 217\n\n       Whereas the American Foreign Service was established in \n     1924 and some 11,600 men and women now serve with the foreign \n     affairs agencies of the United States at home and abroad;\n       Whereas the diplomatic, consular, communications, trade, \n     development, and numerous other functions these men and women \n     perform constitute the first and most cost-effective line of \n     defense of our Nation by protecting and promoting United \n     States interests abroad;\n       Whereas the men and women of the American Foreign Service \n     are increasingly exposed to risks and danger to themselves \n     and their families, even in times of peace, and many have \n     died in the service of their country;\n       Whereas in this uncertain post-Cold War era, an ever-\n     vigilant American Foreign Service remains essential to the \n     strategic, political, and economic well-being of this Nation \n     by strengthening the United States' relations with other \n     countries and promoting a safer, more peaceful world;\n       Whereas the United States Government's foreign affairs \n     agencies and the American Foreign Service Association have \n     observed Foreign Service Day on the first Friday in May for \n     many years; and\n       Whereas it is both appropriate and just for the country as \n     a whole to recognize the dedication of the men and women of \n     the American Foreign Service and to honor those who have \n     given their lives in the loyal pursuit of their duties and \n     responsibilities representing the interests of the United \n     States of America and of its citizens: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commend the men and women who have served or are \n     presently serving in the American Foreign Service for their \n     dedicated and important service to country;\n       (2) honor those in the American Foreign Service who have \n     given their lives in the line of duty; and\n       (3) designate the first Friday in May 1996 as ``American \n     Foreign Service Day''.\n\n     The President is authorized and requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States and \n     the Federal, State, and local administrators to observe the \n     day with the appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, today I am submitting legislation to \nacknowledge the important work and great sacrifice of the men and women \nof the American Foreign Service. By passing this resolution, the Senate \nwill commend these dedicated public servants for their important \nservice to our country, honor those killed in the line of duty, and \nseek broader recognition this year of American Foreign Service Day.\n  For many years, the U.S. Government's foreign affairs agencies and \nthe American Foreign Service Association have jointly sponsored a \nForeign Service Day observance during which new names are added to the \nmemorial plaque in the Department of State honoring those ``who have \ndied under heroic or inspirational circumstances'' while serving our \ncountry abroad. This ceremony has been held within the walls of the \nState Department. This year, I believe that we as a Nation should join \nin this observance, just as we join together to honor our military \npersonnel on Armed Forces Day and Veterans Day.\n  The memorial plaque contains the names of 171 brave Americans who \nhave died in service to our country at posts abroad. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a list of these names be printed in the Record. Later this \nyear, the names of the three American negotiators who were killed last \nfall in search of peace in Bosnia will be added to that plaque. All of \nus were deeply moved by the tragic sacrifice of Ambassador Robert \nFrasure, Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph J. Kruzel, and Col. S. \nNelson Drew.\n  We have many debates in this body that involve the American Foreign \nService. In the past year, we have debated its structure, we have \nreduced its funding, we have seen Foreign Service officers unpaid or \nkept from work because of partial Government shutdowns, and we have \nbeen slow to act on many Foreign Service nominees. Each of these \nactions has its own purpose, but I worry that the cumulative effect may \nwell be to send a signal to our Foreign Service officers that the U.S. \nSenate doubts the importance of their work. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. With this legislation, I hope the Senate will send a \nclear message that, whatever our views on the difficult policy matters \nthat affect America's overseas presence, we all stand firmly behind the \nimportant work of America's dedicated Foreign Service officers, and we \nrecognize the undeniable importance of their work.\n  In the coming year, I hope to explore steps we may take to strengthen \nour Foreign Service. I believe we need to act to ensure that we are \nrecruiting and retaining the very best people that our country has to \noffer, and I hope to work with the Foreign Service community and my \ncolleagues to identify ways in which the Senate can help. For many \npeople around the world, the men and women of the American Foreign \nService are the faces of America.\n  I, for one, believe America owes these men and women a debt of \ngratitude.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAmericans Who Have Lost Their Lives Under Heroic or Other Inspirational \nCircumstances While Serving the U.S. Government and the American People \n                       Abroad in Foreign Affairs\n\n(Names are listed not chronologically but as placed on State Department \n                           memorial plaques)\n\n       William Palfrey: Lost at sea, 1780.\n       Joel Barlow: Exposure, Zarnowice, 1812.\n       Richard C.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Congresswoman \nBarbara F. Vucanovich for her many years of public service, \nparticularly in the House of Representatives. She has represented the \nState of Nevada's Second District for 14 years and is the first woman \nfrom Nevada elected to Federal office.\n  Representative Vucanovich has served in many leadership capacities \nduring her time on Capitol Hill, including her current position as \nsecretary of the House Republican Conference for the 104th Congress. \nShe is a member of the House Appropriations Committee, and chairwoman \nof the Military Subcommittee. Congresswoman Vucanovich is also a member \nof the Subcommittee on the Interior, the Subcommittee on Veterans' \nAffairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies.\n  As members of the Nevada delegation, Congresswoman Vucanovich and I \nhave worked together to prevent the practice of source taxation, which \nunfairly burdened the residents of our State. Representative Vucanovich \nhas also been an ally in our fight to protect Nevada from becoming a \nhigh-level nuclear waste repository. She has been active in promoting \ntravel and tourism to benefit Nevada's economy.\n  Representative Vucanovich demonstrated remarkable personal courage in \nher battle with cancer. She never permitted the disease to slow her \ndown, never missing a congressional vote in the midst of her treatment. \nShe has worked to help increase public awareness of this disease and \nhow it may be detected and treated.\n  I am pleased to recognize Congresswoman Barbara F. Vucanovich for her \nmany years of public service and dedication to the State of Nevada and \nthe people she represents, and I wish her and George the very best in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S562-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A VOTE AGAINST THE NINTH CR\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my vote \nagainst the continuing resolution on Friday, January 26.\n  The CR under which the Government is now operating is the ninth \ncontinuing resolution for fiscal 1996. That is four more CR's for 1 \nfiscal year than we have ever passed before. And we can be sure, come \nMarch 15, that we will be traveling down this road again.\n  This CR continues a dangerous and chaotic policy of haphazardly \nappropriating funds, while leaving State and local governments, Federal \nemployees, and millions of Americans who depend on the Federal \nGovernment uncertain of the future.\n  This uncertainty can be traced in large part to the fact that months \ninto fiscal 1996, the Republican controlled Congress has yet to \ncomplete work on all 13 appropriations bills.\n  This congressional foot dragging has brought us to the point we're at \ntoday: With a CR that is nothing more than a cynical attempt, by those \nwho held the Government hostage and then didn't get their way, to \ndismantle critically important Federal programs in a piecemeal and \nindiscriminate fashion.\n  Let me be clear on one point: I am absolutely committed to balancing \nthe budget. In 1981, I was one of six Senators to vote against \nPresident Reagan's budget, which I may add got us into this mess in the \nfirst place. I cosponsored the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Reduction Act and \njust last October, I was 1 of 19 Senators to vote for the Simon-Conrad \nbill that would balance the budget in 7 years with CBO numbers.\n  More important, after the havoc wreaked by the Republicans during the \nlast Government shutdown, I am committed to seeing the Government stay \nopen and Federal employees at their desks.\n  Continuing resolutions, Government shutdowns, and legislative \nblackmail are simply no way to run the Federal Government.\n  The majority party says we must balance the budget to protect our \nchildren from inheriting a crushing debt. Yet at the same time we hear \nthis rhetoric, the majority is passing a CR that directly harms our \nchildren's future by eliminating $3.1 billion from education programs--\nthe largest cut in education funding in American history.\n  Education is not alone. This CR would cut back funding by 25 percent \nfor the Cops on the Beat Program, summer jobs programs for \ndisadvantaged youth, and environmental cleanup. How can this Congress \nclaim it is protecting children at the same time it is cutting money to \nkeep communities safe and our water and air clean?\n  The majority party came into Washington with the slogan ``Promises \nMade, Promises Kept.'' Well if their promises were to shut down the \nGovernment, eliminate money for education and the environment, cut \nMedicare and Medicaid, raise taxes on working families, and now \nhamstring the Federal Government's efforts to maintain its \nresponsibilities and obligations, then I suppose they have kept their \npromises.\n  I am hopeful that at some point in the future we will take our cue \nfrom President Clinton's State of the Union call for reconciliation by \nreaching a bipartisan agreement on how to balance the budget. Until \nthen, this Government will stumble from CR to CR while millions of \nAmericans suffer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S562-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S562-S563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMEMORATING THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF TEXAS STATEHOOD\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to immediate consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 40, \nsubmitted earlier by Senators Hutchison and Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 40) to commemorate \n     the sesquicentennial of Texas statehood.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a very \nspecial event in the history of my State. This recognition is almost \nidentical to one passed by the Texas State Legislature on March 7, \n1995.\n  Just last month, on December 29, 1995, Texas celebrated the \nsesquicentennial of their statehood. Unlike all other States ever \nadmitted, we gave up the sovereignty of an independent republic to join \nthe Union.\n  On March 1, 1845, Congress passed a resolution inviting the Republic \nof Texas to join the Union, and a special convention of Texans met to \nconsider it, under the leadership of Thomas Jefferson Rusk. The \nconvention accepted the offer on July 4, and its decision was ratified \nby the people in October. We submitted a constitution, which Congress \naccepted on December 29.\n  Rusk went on to become the first U.S. Senator from Texas, and I, the \ngreat-granddaughter of his law partner, now hold his seat. Taylor and \nRusk had signed the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico in \n1836.\n  Texans mark the 29th, quietly, as the commencement of our statehood, \nalthough we didn't lower the Lone Star and post the Stars and Stripes \nuntil February 19, 1846. We must have been happy with statehood in \n1955, because we expressly renounced the right to fly \n\n[[Page S563]]\nthe flag of our old Republic at the same level as that of our Union. \nOur legislature mandated that it fly in a subordinate position, in a \nmanner followed by all other States.\n  Although independence remains the signal day in Texas history, Texans \nlook upon their statehood with pride, as a means of conferring \nblessings upon the people of all the States. When Old Glory was raised \nfor the first time in Austin, TX, Anson Jones, the last President of \nthe Republic of Texas, stated with eloquence:\n\n       The lone star of Texas, which ten years since arose amid \n     cloud, over fields of carnage, and obscurely shone for a \n     while, and following an inscrutable destiny, has passed on \n     and become fixed forever in that glorious constellation which \n     all . . . lovers of freedom in the world must . . . adore--\n     the American Union. Blending its rays with its sister stars, \n     long may it continue to shine, and may a gracious heaven \n     smile upon this consummation with the wishes of the two \n     republics, now joined together in one.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be considered and agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statement \nrelating to the resolution appear at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 40) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 40\n\n       Whereas 1995 marks 150 years since the United States of \n     America admitted Texas as the 28th State in the Union;\n       Whereas the sesquicentennial of Texas statehood is a truly \n     momentous occasion that allows all Texans to reflect on their \n     State's proud heritage and bright future;\n       Whereas acting on the advice of President John Tyler, the \n     United States Congress adopted a joint resolution on February \n     28, 1845, inviting the Republic of Texas to enter the Union \n     as a State with full retention of its public lands; today, a \n     century and a half later, Texas enjoys the distinction of \n     being the only State admitted with such extensive rights;\n       Whereas the citizens of the Republic of Texas were deeply \n     committed to the goals and ideals embodied in the United \n     States Constitution, and, on June 16, 1845, the Congress of \n     the Republic of Texas was convened by President Anson Jones \n     to consider the proposal of statehood;\n       Whereas Texas took advantage of the offer, choosing to \n     unite with a large and prosperous Nation that could more \n     effectively defend the borders of Texas and expand its \n     flourishing trade with European countries; by October 1845, \n     the Congress of the Republic of Texas had approved a State \n     constitution, charting a bold new destiny for the Lone Star \n     State;\n       Whereas the proposed State constitution was sent to \n     Washington, D.C., and on December 29, 1845, the United States \n     of America formally welcomed Texas as a new State; the \n     transfer of governmental authority, however, was not complete \n     until February 19, 1846, when Anson Jones lowered the flag \n     that had flown above the Capitol for nearly 10 years and \n     stepped down from his position as president of the Republic \n     of Texas; and\n       Whereas with the poignant retirement of the flag of the \n     Republic, Texas emerged as a blazing Lone Star in America's \n     firmament, taking its place as the 28th State admitted into \n     the Union: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) commemorate the sesquicentennial of Texas statehood; \n     and\n       (2) encourage all Texans to observe such day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities on this historic \n     occasion. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Texas Congressional Delegation, to \n     the Governor of Texas, to the National Archives, and to the \n     Texas Archives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/30/senate-section/article/S562-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S563-S566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VA HEALTH CARE DELIVERY ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to comment briefly \ntoday, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, on an important \nand, I think, noncontroversial piece of legislation to extend the \neffective dates of certain legal authorities under which the Department \nof Veterans Affairs [VA] operates.\n  The extension of each, and all, of legal authorities which are before \nthe Senate today has previously been approved by the Senate. \nSpecifically, this body approved the extension of each of these \nprovisions on January 5, 1996, when it approved S.991, as amended. The \nSenate then substituted the text of S. 991, as so approved, into H.R. \n2353, and sent that legislation back to the other body. We anticipated \nat that time that the House would approve these noncontroversial \nprovisions--and, indeed, the House has approved them. The House, \nhowever, has made certain additional amendments to the Senate-passed \nbill which necessitate further consideration of the bill by this body.\n  To summarize, this is what the House has done to change the Senate-\napproved bill: first, it made permanent certain authorities pertaining \nto VA's home loan program that the Senate would have extended, on an \ninterim basis, for 2 years only; second, it extended the maximum \nallowable timeframe for which VA may enter into a particular lease \ntransaction in order to facilitate the construction of a power plant on \nthe grounds of the VA Medical Center in San Antonio, TX; and, third, \nwith respect to certain programs being extended by the Senate-approved \nbill, the House amendments would either modify existing reporting \nrequirements or, in three instances, impose new reporting requirements \non VA, in order that the Congress might be in a better position in the \nfuture to decide whether to extend these provisions again.\n  Mr. President, these amendments are not objectionable. I will only \ncomment at more length on one of them: the House amendment to make \npermanent VA's authority to guarantee home mortgage loans with interest \nrates set by the marketplace--instead of by VA officials. I heartily \nsupport this amendment.\n  Three years ago, the Congress enacted legislation to authorize VA, \nfor the first time, to guarantee home mortgage loans having interest \nrates set by the marketplace. Before 1992, the maximum allowable \ninterest rate that a veteran could be charged on a VA-guaranteed home \nloan was set by the VA. As I explained in my floor statement on January \n5, 1996, this attempt to ``protect'' veterans caused market disruptions \nand did not result in any real benefit to veteran home purchasers. In \ncases where the VA-set ``ceiling'' rate was set too low, home sellers \ntypically upped the price of the house to be sold or, worse, they \nrefused to deal with veteran-purchasers.\n  When the Senate approved an extension in VA's authority to guarantee \nloans with market-set interest rates on January 5, I said that the \nCommittee would be holding hearings on this issue with an eye toward \nmaking this legal authority permanent. The committee's membership, and \nour colleagues in the other body, however, are willing to make this \nauthority permanent now. I certainly have no objection to proceeding \nnow to ``let'' the marketplace--rather than VA bureaucrats--set \nmortgage interest rates; I never thought it made sense in the first \nplace to put a ``sunset'' date in the provision which allows reliance \non the marketplace. Therefore, I support the House amendment, and I am \npleased to be able to make permanent the home loan authorities enacted \nin 1992.\n  The other House modifications require less explanation. One would \nextend the maximum term for which a VA Medical Center, in San Antonio, \nTX, could lease its land in order to facilitate the construction by the \nlocal utility of a power plant on VA grounds from which VA could buy \ninexpensive power. This transaction--at least at this particular \nmedical center--clearly appears to make sense. The other amendments \nwould ease VA reporting burdens--a concept that I certainly support--\nand, in three instances, add new reporting requirements. While I am \nless than enthusiastic about layering yet more statutory reporting \nrequirements on VA, perhaps these reports will be useful. In any case, \nI do not intend to delay this overdue legislation further by objecting \nto these reporting requirements.\n  Otherwise, Mr. President, the bill contains no significant \nmodification relative to the bill already approved by the Senate. As \nexplained in greater length in my floor statement of January 5, 1996, \nthe bill will extend VA authority to grant to so-called ``environmental \nveterans''--those who were exposed to ionizing radiation during \nservice; those who served in the Republic of Vietnam and who are, \ntherefore, ``presumed'' to have been exposed to dioxin; and those who \nserved in the Persian Gulf War and who may have possibly been exposed \nto some presently unknown toxic substances or other environmental \nhazards--to priority access to VA hospital care services. That \nauthority will be extended through this year, during which the \ncommittee intends to examine closely an entire range of issues \nassociated with VA's standards for eligibility for health care \nservices. \n\n[[Page S565]]\n\n  It would also extend VA's legal authority to contract for drug and \nalcohol abuse treatment services. It would extend a number of legal \nauthorities under which VA either itself provides, or contracts for \nothers to provide, health care and other services to homeless veterans. \nIt would extend VA's current pilot program on noninstitutional \nalternatives to nursing home care. It would also extend: VA's Health \nProfessional Scholarship Program; VA's authority to use local pay \nsurveys to determine the appropriate level of locality pay for VA nurse \nanesthetists; and VA's authority to enter into certain property leasing \ntransactions. It would extend--and make permanent--previously enacted \nhome loan authorities including: VA's authority to guarantee home loans \nhaving market-set interest rates; VA's authority to guarantee ``energy \nefficient'' mortgages; and VA's authority to allow lenders access to \nappraisals on the properties they finance. Finally, it would extend \nVA's ``enhanced loan asset sale authority,'' an authority which \nfacilitates the marketing of instruments by which sales of foreclosed \nVA-owned properties are financed.\n  As I have noted, Mr. President, these provisions have previously been \napproved by the Senate, and there was no previous controversy with \nrespect to any of them. The changes made by the other body are not \nobjectionable to me. Nor have any other members of the Veterans' \nAffairs, Committee raised objection. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues \nto approve these measures, as amended by the other body, in order that \nwe might put into place now-expired VA legal conditions without further \ndelay.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time that has been afforded me and I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking minority member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge the Senate to give its unanimous \nsupport to the pending measure, H.R. 2353. This legislation is the \nfinal compromise on legislation reported by the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs on September 20, 1995, and originally passed by the Senate on \nJanuary 5, 1996. The debate on the original Senate passage begins on \npage S102 of the Record for January 5. The House passed this compromise \non January 25, 1996.\n  This legislation would extend a variety of veterans programs and \nauthorities that have expired. The proposed extensions are relatively \nshort-term ones--1 or 2 years--to ensure that the program or authority \nremains in place while the committee takes the opportunity to review \nthe various issues in more detail.\n  Mr. President, I regret the delay in the final action on this \nlegislation--first in the Senate, and now at final passage, when the \nHouse, rather than passing the bill as passed by the Senate, returned \nit to us after a delay so that certain very minor provisions--which I \nwill describe in a moment--could be added to this measure. This is a \nsimple extender bill, and it should have been passed months ago. We \nshould not be in the situation of allowing Government benefits and \nprograms to expire. We must do better.\n  Mr. President, there is no objection as far as I know to any of the \nprovisions in the bill as it comes before the Senate today. I urge its \nswift enactment so that it can reach the President as soon as possible \nfor his signature.\n\n\n                         SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. President, the bill as amended by the House and now pending in \nthe Senate contains 20 substantive provisions--15 of which provide for \nthe extension of programs and authorities--the vast majority of which \nare the same as the Senate-passed provisions--and five provisions added \nby the House, four of which require reports from VA and one relating to \nthe furnishing of utilities at a VA medical center.\n  I will first describe briefly the provisions which extend programs \nand authorities, noting any changes from the provisions as passed by \nthe Senate on January 5. I will then briefly describe the provisions \nadded by the House.\n  The provisions which would provide for extensions of programs and \nauthorities would:\n  First, extend until December 31, 1996, the special eligibility for VA \ninpatient care which is accorded to certain veterans--those exposed to \nionizing radiation from nuclear weapons tests or the occupation of \nJapan following World War II; Vietnam veterans exposed to herbicides \nduring their service; and Persian Gulf war veterans exposed to \nenvironmental hazards during their service. Any care furnished to \nveterans exposed to radiation or herbicides pursuant to this authority \nbetween its expiration on June 30, 1995, and the date of enactment of \nthis measure, would be ratified.\n  Second, extend until December 31, 1996, the special eligibility for \nVA outpatient care accorded to Persian Gulf war veterans.\n  Third, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to contract for \ncommunity-based drug and alcohol care.\n  Fourth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's pilot program of \nnoninstitutional alternatives to nursing home care.\n  Fifth, make permanent VA's authority to guarantee loans which bear an \ninterest rate negotiated between the veteran and the lender. The \nSenate-passed bill would have extended this authority for 2 years.\n  Sixth, make permanent VA's authority to guarantee loans that include \ncosts related to making energy efficiency improvements to the dwelling \nthat is the object of the loan. The Senate-passed bill would have \nextended this authority for 2 years.\n  Seventh, extend until December 31, 1996, VA's enhanced loan asset \nsale authority pursuant to which VA guarantees the timely payment of \nprincipal and interest to purchasers of real estate mortgage investment \nconduits.\n  Eighth, make permanent VA's authority to permit a lender who is \nauthorized to make loans which are automatically guaranteed to review \nappraisals. The Senate-passed bill would have extended this authority \nfor 2 years.\n  Ninth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to enter into \nagreements with nonprofit organizations and State and local governments \nwhereby such entities acquire real property, or the use of such \nproperty, from VA in order to furnish services to homeless veterans.\n  Tenth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to use data on \ncompensation paid to nurse anesthetists who work on a contract basis \nfor non-VA entities in determining appropriate locality pay for nurse \nanesthetists who work for VA.\n  Eleventh, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's Health Professional \nScholarship Program.\n  Twelfth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to enter into \nenhanced-use leases with non-VA entities.\n  Thirteenth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's program of \ncommunity-based residential care for homeless chronically mentally ill \nveterans.\n  Fourteenth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to carry \nout a demonstration program of compensated work therapy and therapeutic \ntransitional housing.\n  Fifteenth, extend until September 30, 1997, VA's authority to make \ngrants to entities for the purpose of furnishing services and \nassistance to homeless veterans.\n  Sixteenth, extend until September 30, 1997, the Department of Labor's \nhomeless veterans' reintegration projects and authorize appropriation \nof $10 million for this program.\n  Mr. President, as I noted, the House added five provisions to the \nbill as passed by the Senate. Four of these provision would relate to \nreports from VA--on housing programs; on the desirability of \nconsolidating certain community-based programs; on the efficacy of VA's \nHealth Professional Scholarship Program; and on the operation of VA's \nenhanced-use lease programs. The fifth provision authorizes VA to enter \ninto contracts of up to 35 years' duration for the provision of \nutilities at the San Antonio VA medical center.\n  Without getting into the merits of any of these provisions--beyond \nwondering, in this time of budgetary constraints, about the costs \nassociated with generating the various reports--I must express my \ninability to understand why they were seen as so important at this time \nas to necessitate delaying the extender provisions.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Mr. President, the principal point of this legislation is to extend a \nnumber \n\n[[Page S566]]\nof important VA authorities and programs, and I urge all of my Senate \ncolleagues to support it. As I noted at the outset, our consideration \nof this bill was delayed, first in the Senate because of unrelated \nconcerns, and more recently, by the House, over the inclusion of the \nreport provisions. It is vital that we act as quickly as possible to \nreauthorize the various programs and authorities.\n  Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the majority staff of the \ncommittee, particularly Bill Tuerk, for their work on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to give its unanimous approval to \nthis measure.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur with the amendments of the House to the Senate amendments, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill appear at the appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
