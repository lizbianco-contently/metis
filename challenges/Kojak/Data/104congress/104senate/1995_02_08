Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is certainly \nan appealing idea. I can understand why many believe that it is a \nnecessary procedural reform to ensure fiscal responsibility. I voted \nfor the concept in 1986 when there seemed to be a lack of shared \npolitical will, between Congress and the Executive, to impose \ndiscipline.\n  Last year, it seemed to me that the atmosphere had improved \ndramatically, and I opposed the balanced budget amendment because of \nthe substantial and significant strides which the Clinton \nadministration was then making, and continued to make, to curb \nexpenditures and reduce the deficit.\n  Now, things appear even more promising for the imposition of fiscal \nrestraint. The new congressional majority has made it a primary \nobjective, and the President remains committed to the idea of smaller \nand leaner government, although I might add parenthetically that I wish \nhis 1996 budget would have gone a bit further than it does in this \ndirection.\n  But I am not yet convinced that this apparent convergence of \npolitical will power should result in a constitutional amendment that \ndictates procedure for all time to come.\n  For one thing, I, like many of my colleagues want to see where it \nwill lead in the immediate future. I want to know the full consequences \nof a 7-year plan to bring revenues and expenditures into balance.\n  In particular, I want to know the impact on programs in which I have \na deep and abiding interest as a legislator--education programs, \nforeign aid, support for the United Nations, and support for the arts \nand humanities.\n  And I especially need to know if the cumulative loss of Federal aid \nto the State of Rhode Island over the 7-year period ending in 2002 \ncould indeed be nearly $1.8 billion as has been predicated, and, if so, \nhow will my small State adjust to such a massive change.\n  For all of these reasons I joined in cosponsoring the right-to-know \namendment offered by our distinguished minority leader, Senator \nDaschle. We not only have a right to know, we have a responsibility to \nask.\n  But even if we succeed in getting all the right answers I still am \nnot sure \n[[Page S2278]]  the case will be made for amending the Constitution.\n  I am troubled by the reservations which have been expressed--\neconomic, fiscal, and constitutional--as we look more closely beneath \nthe attractive surface of the proposed amendment.\n  I wonder about the economic impact of rapid withdrawal of some $1.6 \ntrillion in Federal spending in the arbitrary timeframe of the next 7 \nyears. Some have warned that the resulting fiscal drag could virtually \nwreck the economy, especially if it should coincide with high interest \nrates or a recession.\n  I wonder too about the rigid annual requirement for balance in each \nfiscal year. Some have called it ritualistic in its disregard for the \nmore random vagaries of economic cycles, precluding the timely \noperation of automatic stabilizers such as unemployment insurance \nduring downswings when tax receipts may be on the decline.\n  And on the other side of the ledger, I wonder if the ritual \nrequirement to balance might deter the accumulation of budget surpluses \nin good years, since the pending amendment might tend to promote \nunreasoning tax slashes when such opportunities arise.\n  I wonder if this constitutional amendment will be any more immune to \nevasion and accounting chicanery than other attempts to put the \npolitical process in a straightjacket. I think of the experience of my \nown State of Rhode Island where, in order to comply with a \nconstitutional mandate and to take advantage of independent financing \nauthority, various categories of expenditures simply have been moved \noff budget to a number of commissions and authorities.\n  And finally, Mr. President, I wonder about the wisdom of using our \nConstitution for the purpose of imposing accounting rules. Will this \namendment still be relevant a century from now in the light of now-\nunforeseen developments in technology, medical science, space \nexploration, demographic changes, and all intervening natural disasters \nand climatic variations?\n  From the perspective of 2095, it may appear rather anomalous that the \nU.S. Senate spent much of the month of February 1995 trying to mandate \nfor all time that our books should be balanced, down to the last dollar \nand cent, at the end of each 12-month period.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I would only add that if this \namendment is not approved, there will be a great burden on us all to \nget to work with a minimum of recrimination to produce the general \nresult which would have been mandated; namely, a progressive reduction \nin Government spending and a corresponding alleviation of debt, \nhopefully at a more measured pace and without resort to troublesome \narbitrary time constraints. I pledge my support to the effort.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Rhode Island withhold \nhis request?\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I withhold my request.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is conducting morning business \nuntil 9:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/08/senate-section/article/S2277-5", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                URGE ADOPTION OF RIGHT-TO-KNOW AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to use just a couple of minutes in morning business to \ncomment on a very important vote that the Senate will engage in, \nsometime around noon today. That is on the motion which I guess will be \nmade to table the right-to-know amendment or to send it back to \ncommittee, and why I think it is very important that this body adopt a \nright-to-know amendment so that the people back in the respective \nStates, when their legislators have to vote on this very important \nbalanced budget amendment, will know what they are voting on.\n  I support a balanced budget amendment. I have supported it in the \npast. I have voted for it in the past. I hope to be able to vote for it \nagain.\n  The thing that really concerns me is that we would expect that \nsomeone who proposes a balanced budget amendment, like our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, one would expect if they propose this, \nthey would have an idea about how they will do it; that they have a \nplan that allows them to get, in the year 2002, to a balanced budget. \nSurely, they are not just proposing a balanced budget amendment without \nany plan, or without any idea as to how they are going to get there.\n  I have not seen the plan. That is what I think the American people \nare entitled to. Is there a secret plan on how to balance the budget \nthat they do not want to share with the American people, that they do \nnot want to share with the Governors of the respective States who will \nhave to live by it, as well as us? Is there a secret plan they do not \nwant to tell the members of the legislatures about, because if they see \nit, it may be so devastating they will not vote for it? Is there a \nsecret plan to reach the year 2002 that cuts Social Security, slashes \nspending on Medicare, health programs for the elderly? Is there a \nsecret plan, for instance, which wipes out State highway programs?\n  I do not know. I do not think anybody knows. Surely those who propose \na balanced budget must have in their heads an idea of how to get there. \nThe only thing that we are suggesting is that before we send the \nbalanced budget amendment to the States and say, ``Vote on it,'' that \nwe share with them the secret plan. If there is a plan that proposes \nhow we get there, let Members see it.\n  What is wrong with it? If the balanced budget amendment is a good \nthing, and I think it is, certainly how we get to that balanced budget \nis something that is equally important. It may be that there is a \ngolden secret plan that does not cut defense, that does not have any \ntax increases, that does not cut Social Security, that does not cut \nMedicare, that does not cut highway programs, and yet gets to a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. If there is such a plan, let me see \nit. Let me show it to the States so that when they vote on it they will \nknow exactly what they are voting on.\n  I think the bottom line, Mr. President and my colleagues, is that the \nAmerican people not only have a right to know, but in the real world, \nthey have a need to know. I want my legislators in Louisiana, when they \nvote on this balanced budget, to say, ``Now we know how it will be \nachieved. Here is what we have to do as a State in order to make it \nwork.''\n  This is a partnership, I say to my colleagues. We are not doing this \nby ourselves. This is a partnership arrangement between the Congress, \nthe Federal Government, and the States. We all will have to share in \nit. Maybe States will have to increase taxes. It might be they will \nhave to slash State programs that the Federal Government cannot assist, \nas in the past, with many of these programs. But the bottom line is \nthat the only protection the American people have is the right to know \nwhat we are talking about.\n  I will say, once again, that surely the people who have proposed a \nbalanced budget have a plan. It should not be a secret plan, it should \nbe a public plan. The only thing that we are asking is that it should \nbe made part of this effort so that when the States are called upon to \nact on this, they will be able to do it intelligently, and not have to \ndo it in the dark.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/08/senate-section/article/S2278-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Averaged out, every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica owes a share of this massive debt, and that per capita share is \n$18,247.10.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/08/senate-section/article/S2278-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n                  SUSSEX COUNTY, DE: NO. 1 IN COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am very proud to come to the Senate floor \ntoday to announce that the 1992 Census of Agriculture has named Sussex \nCounty, the southern most county in the beautiful State of Delaware, as \nthe No. 1 poultry producing county in the United States. As my hometown \nnewspaper, the Wilmington News Journal, so eloquently stated it: \n``Sussex County still rules the roost as the chicken-growin'est county \nin the nation.''\n  Of course, being the No. 1 producer is nothing new for Sussex \nCounty--the county has officially remained the No. 1 producer since \n1982. In fact, Sussex County has been the unofficial leading poultry \nproducer since the industry got its start in Ocean View, DE, in 1923.\n  It all started with Mrs. Wilmer Steele when she placed an order for \n50 chicks, intended for egg production, and ended up with 500. She \ndecided to raise rather than return the extra chicks, and when they \nwere big enough she sold approximately 400 of them to a local buyer. \nThree years later, she and her husband were raising 25,000 young \nchickens and selling them to the local population who were discovering \nthe versatility of chicken meat. America is eating about 10 times as \nmuch chicken today as we were in 1925, numbers attributable to the fact \nthat chicken is high in protein, low in fat, tasty, and very \naffordable.\n  Mr. President, we are doing everything we can in Delaware to maintain \nthe productivity of the poultry industry nationwide. Today there is a \ndisease, harmless to humans but deadly for chickens, affecting the \nproductivity of Delaware poultry industry flocks. Avian diseases such \nas this affect flocks across the country on a regular basis. In an \neffort to prevent the economic damage done by these outbreaks, the \nUniversity of Delaware, in cooperation with the Federal Government and \nprivate industry, is building a poultry research facility that will \nhelp the poultry industry solve this type of disease problem.\n  I have worked very closely with the poultry industry people in my \nState to get this facility up and running. The Delmarva poultry \nindustry has an outstanding record of commitment to research and \ndevelopment in avian diseases and I am hopeful that the remainder of \nthe funds needed to finish this project can be secured this year. The \ngrowers who are responsible for keeping Sussex County and the Delmarva \nPeninsula in the ranks of the top producers know the importance of this \nfacility to the national production of poultry.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Sussex County for, once \nagain, achieving No. 1 producer status and for providing the American \npublic with healthy and affordable nutrition.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/08/senate-section/article/S2279-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J.

The time between 9:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. \nshall be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. \nThe Chair recognizes the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will manage the time on this side until \nthe minority leader appears. I yield to myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, this is not an insignificant or an unimportant issue. \nThe Senate is debating the issue of whether to change the U.S. \nConstitution and, if so, how to change it.\n  The reason we are at this point today is because the country has had \nfiscal policy problems of a very significant nature. We have had very \nsignificant yearly budget deficits, and we are now bearing a very large \nFederal debt.\n  And the question is: What can or should be done about that? I guess \nmost people here would not mind very much if we had a very large \nFederal deficit if it resulted from our having to fight a war to \nprotect our liberty and freedom. I do not think anyone would complain \nmuch about floating bonds and going into debt to protect this country \nand to protect freedom and liberty. We would understand that.\n  I do not suppose anybody would complain very much about a Federal \ndeficit if we spent several hundred billion dollars that we did not \nhave and we cured cancer just like that. It would be well worth the \nprice. I do not imagine anyone would complain very much of having \nborrowed to do that.\n  But that is not what we are doing today. We have operating budget \ndeficits year after year after year that represent a very significant \nimbalance between the amount of money we take in and the amount of \nmoney needed to routinely run the Government and do the things that \nthis Government does, including all of the transfer payments and all of \nthe programs. And that is the problem. It is not a new problem.\n  I understand that in this Chamber when you look at the division of \nthe Chamber, some will stand up and decide to boast, ``Gee, we're the \nconservatives, we're the ones who want to help the taxpayer and save \nthe money and save the country, and you all, you're the liberals, \nyou're the ones who want to tax and spend.''\n  Total baloney, total nonsense. There is not a plugged nickel's worth \nof difference between the appetite for spending the taxpayers' money on \nthat side of the aisle as opposed to this side of the aisle. That side \nof the aisle wants to spend it on military; we want to spend it on milk \nfor hungry kids. The fact is, you look at the record in 15 years and I \nguarantee you will discover not any significant difference at all in \nterms of the appetite about how much money the two sides want to spend. \nOh, they have different priorities, no question about that. They want \nto spend it on different things. But they all have the appetite for \nspending.\n  But we do not have an appetite to raise the money for that which we \nspend. So the question is, what do we do about that? The answer is, we \ncannot spend that which we do not have. We have to cut back. We have to \ndeal with that honestly. We have to make tough choices, and that is why \nwe come to this juncture.\n  Tough choices are choices that often persuade Members of this body \nand the other body in our legislative branch to gnash their teeth and \nsweat profusely and wring their hands and worry and not sleep because \nthey are tough votes, they are awful choices. People think that \nsomebody is going to be angry, maybe I will lose my job. If that is the \nattitude, one ought not serve here. These are not tough choices. These \nare issues you look at and decide what is right for this country, what \nmakes sense, what must we do to fix what is wrong.\n  Every day that I serve in this Senate, I am proud of that service, \nand some days I rue the fact that there are many who decide that public \nservice is unworthy and Government somehow is corrupt and evil and bad \nand cast those kinds of aspersions. I am proud of my service here. I \nthink public service is a wonderful undertaking.\n  Mine comes, I suppose, from a family history and background. I was \nreading last evening something my brother, who is a journalist, had \nwritten about my ancestors. One of them was a great-grandmother named \nCarolyn and a great-grandfather named Otto. They got married in Oslo, \nNorway, and moved to Minnesota. They had eight children. Then Otto \ndied, and Carolyn, \n[[Page S2280]]  living in Minnesota with eight children and a husband \nwho just died, apparently contemplated what to do in life.\n  What Carolyn did was respond to something that the Federal Government \ndid. The Federal Government said to the people, ``If you are willing to \nmove into a homestead out on the Great Plains, we will give you a \nquarter section of land. If you want to go out and claim it, go farm \nit, go live on it, we will give you a quarter section of land.''\n  So Carolyn with all these children, a husband just died, moved to \nNorth Dakota, Cherry Butte Township, ND, and pitched a tent on the \nprairie with her kids. This strong Norwegian woman homesteaded a \nquarter section of land and built herself a house and built herself a \nfarm, raised a family and had a son who had a son who had me. And here \nI am.\n  I think of the strength of someone like Carolyn, and all of us have \nthese folks in our background. Tough choices? I suppose that is a tough \nchoice, losing your husband and deciding to move to pitch a tent on the \nwinter prairies of North Dakota with your children to try to start and \nbuild a farm and make a go of it. That is a tough choice. These are not \ntough choices.\n  When we decide that we do not have the strength and we do not have \nthe will to do the fundamental things that are necessary to protect and \npreserve and nurture this country's future, then something is wrong \nwith all of us.\n  So I come to the floor today to say on this question there ought not \nbe a serious question about whether we do something about this \ncrippling budget deficit. That question ought not be asked anymore. \nAnybody who is still asking that question deserves to go out the other \nside of that door.\n  The question is what and how, and that is what the amendment is about \ntoday. The amendment we are going to vote on in a couple of hours does \nnot say we do not want to balance the budget. It does not say we should \nnot have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I have voted \nfor a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in the past. I did \nnot come here thinking we ought to do that, but I was persuaded over \nthe years by Republicans and Democrats, yes, conservatives and \nliberals, who ratcheted up year after year deficit after deficit. I \nhave been persuaded that any additional discipline, any additional \nincentive that requires balance is something I would support.\n  But we come today to vote on a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget, and the question many of us ask is, is this just one more \nempty promise? Because, if it is, the pail is full of those, and the \nAmerican people can hardly lift it anymore. Or does this have some \nstrength and some meat? Is this honest? Is this going to lead to a plan \nthat actually balances the budget?\n  Why do we ask? We ask because those who propose this, those who say \nlet us change the Constitution, let us improve on the work of \nWashington and Madison and Franklin and Jefferson and others who \ncontributed to the Constitution, they say: ``We want to do a couple \nthings. We recognize there is a big deficit in this country, but we \nwant to do a couple things. One, we want to cut the income by cutting \ntaxes and, two, we want to increase defense spending.''\n  It is logical for those who took simple arithmetic that if you are \ngoing to increase the biggest area of public spending and decrease your \nrevenue, one might be willing, and probably required, to ask then how \nare you going to get to a balanced budget? What is your plan? Or is \nthis another empty vessel, one more broken promise? Is this just \npolitics?\n  We have offered an amendment that is called the right-to-know \namendment, and we are just saying that in this country, if this is not \nan empty promise, if this is not an empty vessel, then somebody must \nhave a plan that says we can cut taxes and increase defense spending \nand by the year 2002 find a balanced budget out there.\n  I hope we can find a balanced budget by the year 2002, and I plan to \nbe part of the solution to do that. I may vote for this constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, but I do not understand why anyone in \nthis Chamber would vote against this amendment called the right-to-know \namendment.\n  One prominent Member of Congress says, ``Well, if the American people \nunderstood what this means, it would make their knees buckle.'' Does he \nknow something that I do not know? Does he know what the plan is? Is \nthere a mystery plan there someplace that he is aware of that is going \nto make people's knees buckle? If so, I wonder if he shared it with the \nPresiding Officer. He has not shared it with me. I suspect he has not \nshared it with you.\n  The question is, I guess, is there a plan out there someplace? Is \nthere a mystery plan floating around that is going to make people's \nknees buckle? If so, let us hear it, let us have it, let us debate it, \nlet us discuss it.\n  I remember a television commercial--one of my favorites--about \nchicken. The television commercial was a customer that came up to the \ncounter and wanted to know what was in these chicken nuggets. The \nperson at the counter said, ``Well, its chicken.''\n  ``Well, what kind of chicken?''\n  ``Chicken parts,'' they said.\n  ``Well, what kinds of chicken parts?''\n  And the person behind the counter said, ``Different parts.''\n  I wonder what is in a plan in the minds of those who propose to \nbalance the budget, mystery meat of some type?\n  Could they share it with us, maybe? How do you get from here to \nthere? Does anybody who took arithmetic understand you cannot increase \nyour biggest area of spending, cut your revenue, and get from here to \nthere?\n  I do not understand what they are telling us. So we are saying if \nthis is more than an empty promise, let us fill it up a bit. Let us say \nto the American people here is what we are going to do, and here is how \nwe are going to do it.\n  If we are not willing to do that, what we are saying is this is \nbusiness as usual. This is not about policy. This is not about \nsubstance. This is about politics. And if this is about politics, then \nthis is not about balancing the budget. This is not about doing what we \nought to do for this country's future.\n  So when we discuss the document that begins with ``We the People,'' \nand we decide we want to change a few words here and there, we are \ngoing to try and sort of monkey around a little bit because we have had \na lot of people over a long period of years who have not had the \ncourage to say you can only spend what you take in, when we discuss \nthat and decide that, I wonder if we cannot begin to discuss what that \nwould mean in practical terms for the American people.\n  We are going to have a task here that is pretty ominous, actually. \nBut I for one think it is a task we must undertake.\n  Last evening, I was looking through this sheet, which does not mean \nmuch to anybody. It is a sheet by the Congressional Budget Office that \nplots out for 10 years what our spending and taxing and deficits will \nbe. What this sheet says, to the extent that you can forecast out 10 \nyears--it is kind of like forecasting the weather in North Dakota, a \nlittle uncertain. But what this says is at the current rate, with the \ncurrent plan, we are talking about the potential of adding $4.3 \ntrillion to the Federal debt--$4.3 trillion. If anybody thinks that we \ndo not have a problem, just look at all the projections and understand \nwe do not have any alternative. We have to deal with this. However, we \ncannot deal with it just as a political issue. We have to deal with it \nin a real way.\n  Now, we are going to have an amendment following this one on Social \nSecurity. I do not want five reasons that someone would vote against \neither the right-to-know amendment or the Social Security amendment. I \nwould just like one decent reason, just one. There is only one reason \nsomeone would vote against a right-to-know amendment, I suppose, and \nthat is because they have no plan and you cannot get there from here. \nYou cannot be saying I wish to increase spending, and I want to cut \nrevenue, and I wish to balance the budget.\n  So we have a right to know. The American people have a right to know. \nHow can you know something that cannot be accomplished? I guess that is \nwhy we do not have a plan. But if this is honest, if it is real, if it \nis not just an empty promise, then why would someone vote against this \nright-to-know amendment? Why? And the next \n[[Page S2281]]  amendment, the Social Security amendment, saying we \ntake Social Security out of paychecks in a dedicated tax and put it in \na trust fund. We say we promise, in a promise between the people who \nwork and the people who retire in a binding contract, we promise to \nmaintain a trust fund as a solemn obligation. We promise that it will \nbe used for Social Security.\n  Why--just one reason, not five--would anyone vote against an \namendment that says you cannot use Social Security trust funds, you \ncannot raid Social Security trust funds to balance the budget? It has \nnot added 1 cent to the budget deficit. In fact, it is running a \nsurplus. To the extent that we now have national savings extracted from \nthat system, we need them when the baby boomers retire. So I am not \nasking for five reasons, just one decent reason someone would vote \nagainst either of these amendments.\n  Now, we will in the coming hours this morning continue to discuss \nwhat all of this means in terms of balancing the budget and plans and \nthe ultimate vote on the constitutional amendment. And I would like, if \nI can--I know that we are in a situation where we do not have very \nthoughtful or very interesting debates, unfortunately. I think it would \nbe more fun if we all talked to each other on the floor and figured out \nwhat we are doing. Is it political for you and me? Is it policy?\n  The Senator from Utah is here, and I have listened to him at great \nlength, and I would like to engage in a dialog with him if we could for \na couple of minutes.\n  We propose that if we say as a body, maybe with my vote, that we \nshould change the Constitution, it is a big step. If we say that and we \nshould therefore balance the budget by the year 2002, we say we have an \nobligation to the American people, to the State legislatures, to \neveryone out there to decide to give them some skeleton of a plan. Here \nis the way it is going to happen in 7 years.\n  Now, some say, well, it cannot be done in 7 years. We have a 5-year \nbudget. Well, why not give us five-sevenths of the plan? Just give us a \npart of it. We will take a fraction.\n  I would ask the Senator, if I could, without losing my right to the \nfloor, what prevents some in this Chamber from believing the American \npeople have a right to know?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is a good question. I do not think anybody knows \nexcept for one thing. We have had over 10 plans offered by colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, some together as bipartisan plans that \nwould lead us to a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  The problem is not 1 of those 10 plans has 51 votes. And we have \nworked on trying to come up with some way of satisfying everybody from \na balanced budget standpoint for the whole 19 years I have been here, \nand we have not been able to do that.\n  Our contention is that we will never do that unless we pass the \nbalanced budget amendment and put a fiscal mechanism in place so that \nliterally we can balance the budget.\n  I just cite to the distinguished Senator a very interesting article \nthat appeared in the Washington Times just this morning. It is entitled \n``Social Security and the balanced budget.''\n  Now, the thrust of it is to criticize those who believe that you \nshould exclude Social Security out of the balanced budget amendment; in \nother words, write a statute into the balanced budget amendment. But it \ndoes make a very interesting point here. This is by David Keating.\n\n       During the Vietnam war, an American officer was quoted \n     saying we had to destroy the village in order to save it. Now \n     the U.S. Senate may apply similar logic when it votes on a \n     proposal to add a huge loophole to the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment, supposedly to save Social Security.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. All right, I get the drift.\n  Mr. HATCH. But the point I wanted to make--let me just take a second \nhere. There was a point on this----\n  Mr. DORGAN. But I understand the point the Senator has made, and I do \nnot want to----\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me conclude with just one more sentence to answer the \nSenator's question.\n  The fact is we have never been able to do it up to now, and there is \nno way that we should hold the amendment hostage, assuming we pass it \nby a two-thirds vote and send it to the States, there is no reason why \nwe should hold it hostage until we take another 18 years to try to get \ntogether on a balanced budget without the balanced budget amendment \nbeing in place.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the point the Senator from \nUtah makes. It is an interesting point. The reason I ask the question \nis this. The Senator's party controls the Senate. We understand that. I \nmean I was up election night and saw the results. I did not smile as \nbroadly as the Senator did perhaps, but the fact is that is the way the \nsystem works.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is all relative.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Republicans control the Senate. Now, when we controlled \nthe Senate, we passed a deficit reduction bill in 1993. It was a hard \nbill, in many respects, to get votes for. But we rounded up votes for \nit and, with 51 votes, passed a bill that, the statistics now \ndemonstrate, cut the budget deficit by somewhere around $600 billion.\n  We did not even get one accidental vote on the other side of the \naisle. You think somebody would just make a mistake over there. But I \ntell you, it took every single vote that we could muster on this side \nof the aisle to do what was necessary. This is heavy lifting. The \npolitical vote, the easy vote is to vote ``no'' and walk away. But we \ndid not. We did it. We voted to cut the deficit in a significant way, \nand I went home and took a lot of heat, and I was proud to stand up and \nsay I am not part of the problem, I am part of the solution. Even if it \nis controversial, even if some of you do not like it, I am going to \ncast my vote to try to fix what is wrong in this country.\n  The reason I make that point is this. You say that, well, you know, \nthe reason we are not able to give you a plan is we do not think there \nis a plan out there that can get 51 votes.\n  Look, part of the responsibility of leadership when you run this \nChamber is to come up with those votes--and I may join you on those \nvotes. But at the very least, especially because of recent experience \nwe have had where we could not even get one vote on that side of the \naisle to do the heavy lifting, I think in this circumstance when you \nsay let us change the Constitution, then you have a special obligation \nto provide the leadership to get the votes for a plan to say to the \nAmerican people, here is what we stand for. It is not just words to \nchange what Ben Franklin and Madison and others did. It is not just \nwords. Here is what we stand for. Here is our plan. And here is what we \nare willing to vote for.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I respect the Senator and his Democratic colleagues for \nstanding up and doing what they thought was right. We did not think it \nwas right because we did not want to increase the taxes the way they \ndid--or you did, the highest tax increase in history.\n  Mr. FORD. No, no.\n  Mr. HATCH. I know there are those who want to say the dollar is worth \nless and, therefore, Reagan's was the highest--therefore, they are both \nhigh. Both occurred because of people who felt the same way as people \nwho voted last time.\n  But under the Daschle amendment, what it would do is it would hold \nthings up. This is the one time in history where we have a chance of \npassing a balanced budget amendment, sending it to the States, letting \nthe States make the determination whether they are going to ratify it, \nthree-quarters of them, or 38 States, and make it part of the \nConstitution.\n  The Daschle amendment would basically hold that up until we come up \nwith a balanced budget approach that passes 535 Members of Congress.\n  Mr. FORD. No.\n  Mr. HATCH. We think that is not the way to go. We believe we have to \npass the balanced budget amendment, get it out to the States, and I \nassure my colleague, Republicans and Democrats will get together and we \nwill have to come up with that glidepath in the year 2002. I think we \nwill have to get a majority of both Houses to do it. That is the only \nway we are going to get there.\n  And my point about the last 19 years is that we have never been able \nto do it \n[[Page S2282]] in that time. I want to have the mechanism, the \nprocedural route by which we can get there.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand that and I appreciate the point the Senator \nis making. I understand that is why they are likely to defeat this \nright-to-know amendment--which is a terrible mistake, incidentally, \nbecause the question of whether this is a real promise or a broken \npromise is really a judgment by the American people about: Is this \nsimply more words and more posturing, more politics, or is there \nsomething here that is real?\n  The interesting point of all this is the American people, I think, \nare pretty resilient and pretty strong. You go through 200 years of \nhistory in this country, and they move right to left but they always \ncome back to the strong center. And they have a good sense of what is \nright or wrong and a good sense of what ought to be done.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The fact is the American people are a lot more able to \ntolerate the kinds of medicine that need to be administered these days \nthan most people here give them credit for. But I think they do want to \nknow. They want to know if someone says: ``Look, we have the votes. We \nwant to go off and build star wars. We know that is out of fashion, but \nit is not out of fashion with us. We want a star wars program. It is \n$30 billion, $40 billion. We want to build it because we have the \nmuscle.''\n  Somebody back home will want to know, if you are going to build star \nwars, does that mean you are going to cut school hot lunch programs? \nThey want to know what all this means, and those are simple issues. \nWhat are the priorities?\n  You can look back 100 years from now in this country and look at this \ncountry's budget and you can tell something about what our people were, \nwhat we felt was important, what we invested in, what we considered \nimportant for the future. You could tell that by what we decided to \nspend money on.\n  The American people, I think, given 18 or 20 years of promises--most \nof them empty--by both parties, given complicity in arranging this \ndeficit by creating a situation where we spend more each year than we \ntake in because we ratchet up all the entitlement programs to inflation \nand we ratchet down taxes on the other side so you create an \nimbalance--I think the people would want to say if this is not business \nas usual, if it is not really business as usual, why, then, are there \nnot, this time, honest answers? Why are there not honest answers to the \nquestions of what will this mean to us?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. What is this medicine about? I would say to the Senator \nfrom Utah, we have limited time. I probably consumed a few more minutes \nthan I should have on my side. I would love to continue this. I hope we \ncan have it when we do not have a time agreement, at some other time, \nbecause I would like to talk through some of these things. With that, I \nwould like to----\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield on my time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield on the Senator's time, sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator is making a terrific case for the \nbalanced budget amendment. I know he is a supporter of it. So I commend \nhim for that as well.\n  He makes the case that we are going to spend billions on star wars, \nwill that take away from school lunches? Right now we just fund both of \nthem because we do not have to live within any procedural or any \ndisciplined constraints.\n  The balanced budget, if we pass it, then becomes the discipline \nthrough which we are going to have to look at defense as well as \neverything else and we are going to have to somehow or other come to a \nconclusion among competing programs and make priorities. I think it \nwould force us to do that. Of course, that is the whole argument for a \nbalanced budget amendment, and I think the Senator is making a good \ncase for it.\n  I guarantee I will work with the distinguished Senator and others to \ntry to get to that consensus, but until we get the discipline in place, \nwe will never get there and we know it and everyone knows it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My intention was to make a strong case for the right-to-\nknow amendment, and I hope we will get some votes on the other side of \nthe aisle to pass that. That will make this constitutional amendment an \nhonest amendment, give people some hope that instead of talking about \nit, we will finally get something done.\n  Mr. President, I have consumed some time on our side of the aisle. We \nhave a number of other people who want to speak. I know we have been \ngoing back and forth.\n  I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The minority has 36 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, have up to 10 \nminutes and the distinguished Senator from the State of Washington, \nSenator Murray, have up to 5 minutes of our 36 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I also rise to support this amendment. I \noffered a similar version of the right-to-know amendment, the glidepath \namendment, in the proceedings in the Senate Judiciary Committee. I \nthought it was the best discussion we had in the committee after a \ncouple of days of discussion. I thought the discussion on the right-to-\nknow amendment was really the most thoughtful and the one that really \ncrystallized the issue.\n  In at least two important ways, this is the truth amendment. First, \nin one sense the amendment is a truth test. If the supporters of this \nconstitutional amendment are serious about balancing the budget, this \namendment is the one that really provides that opportunity. The central \nconcern I have had with the proposed balanced budget amendment is that \nit will actually undercut our efforts to reduce the deficit and balance \nthe budget by just providing political cover for those who are \nunwilling to make these really tough decisions. Having voted for the \nbalanced budget amendment, I fear Members will feel free to duck the \nreal work of actually identifying and voting for real spending cuts and \nthey will be able to continue to do this ducking of the issue as the \nStates go through the rather laborious process of trying to see if they \nare going to ratify this thing in the next year or 2 or 7 years.\n  Of course, supporters of the constitutional amendment deny this \nassertion. They proclaim loudly they will seek specific cuts and we \njust have to wait and see what they might be. This amendment to the \nbalanced budget amendment, this right-to-know amendment, provides those \nwho are genuinely interested in ensuring the Congress does its job with \nthe opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to real deficit \nreduction. It does what the proponents of a balanced budget amendment \ncontend they want to do. This amendment forces Congress to get the job \ndone. It forces Congress to lay out over the next 5 or 6 or 7 years, \nexactly how we are going to accomplish this.\n  Except, Mr. President, the good thing about this amendment that \ncannot be said about the balanced budget amendment is that the right-\nto-know amendment does not allow delay and evasion. It does not let the \n104th Congress off the hook by simply passing an amendment, a balanced \nbudget amendment, that does not lay out a single spending cut. The last \nCongress made substantial progress in reducing the budget deficits that \nhave been generated by the budget policies of the 1980's. That progress \nwas made because the 103d Congress was willing to lay out and have a \nvery difficult process of discussing specific items to reduce the \ndeficit. It was not easy. It was not always popular. But it was \nspecific and it worked and the economy is sound and ultimately the \nefforts of the President and the majority at that time have been \naccepted by the American people.\n  Now there is a new majority, a new leadership in Congress. As is so \noften the case when there is a change in the ruling party, that new \nmajority promises great change. On the first bill we considered in this \nCongress we were told very bluntly there would be no \n[[Page S2283]] amendments no matter how reasonable, no matter how \nnecessary, because, in the words of the new majority and in the words \nof one Senator, it was because this is about who runs this place.\n  But when is the majority going to show us how they plan to reduce the \ndeficit? In other words, when are they going to show us how they are \ngoing to run the place when it comes to balancing the budget? That is \npart of running the place.\n  Why is it the new Congress, from which all things are supposedly \npossible, is apparently incapable of providing us with a plan to reduce \nthe deficit? Mr. President, a majority of those supporters of this \nproposed amendment who were here in 1993--and I am referring to the \nbalanced budget amendment--refused to support the deficit reduction \npackage that was passed and that has resulted in progress.\n  I remember the discussion in the Judiciary Committee of the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Simpson, who referred to past votes when the \nRepublicans were in the majority, which he called times when the rubber \nhit the road. He said the Democrats were not there to help.\n  In 1993, the rubber hit the road here; $500 billion in deficit \nreduction was proposed and passed, and not one single Republican in \neither House chose to vote for those specific spending cuts.\n  That is, unfortunately, the only way this can be accomplished, \nidentifying what has to be cut and actually doing it.\n  So I understand that nobody necessarily has to assign any particular \nplan. But if you are going to propose a balanced budget amendment I \nthink you have a special burden to at least show us some plan with \nregard to how it is going to be accomplished.\n  Mr. President, I said there were two ways this was a truth amendment. \nThe other is that this is the truth-in-packaging measure. The voters, \nlocal government, and the State legislatures that are asked to ratify \nthis amendment are all entitled to know what supporters of the \nconstitutional amendment mean to do before they modify the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  Looking at the Presiding Officer, one of leaders in this body of \nconcern with State and local governments, this is exactly the kind of \nthing that this Senator has talked about--the fact that these folks \nhave a right to know what we are up to out here, and that we do not lay \nan unreasonable burden on them in the form of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Unfortunately, though, the supporters of the balanced budget \namendment have been very reluctant to provide that kind of information. \nThey maintain that to reveal the whole horrible truth to the Congress \nand the public would make it impossible to pass the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I find that kind of reasoning to be a gross \nunderestimate of the American people. And it is amazing. It even \nreveals a little bit of an antidemocratic philosophy, and is a little \nbit insulting to the American people. This is a critical point. I \nthink, in contrast, supporters of this proposal, instead of giving the \ninformation, want to alter one of the greatest testaments to democracy \nin history, our Constitution, and they want to do it in a way, they \nfreely admit, they say would be opposed by the people if they knew what \nwas proposed. The obvious irony of this is also a form of hypocrisy.\n  Mr. President, though I oppose the proposed constitutional amendment, \nI am convinced that the failure of the supporters to provide a specific \nproposal and glidepath will actually undermine the efforts to have the \namendment ratified. Even worse, it may jeopardize the real world, the \nreal effort that is required to reduce the deficit. Without a broad-\nbased consensus, no significant deficit reduction plan would stand. Any \nplan which would generate the opposition that the proponents so \nobviously fear would be overturned, and rightly so, in a democracy.\n  So, Mr. President, we will not achieve the broad-based consensus that \nwe need by dealing dishonestly with the American people. We have made \nprogress on the deficit. I for one believe the American people are \nready to sacrifice and do more, if they are treated with respect, with \nhonesty, and with open Government. I have seen this consistently over \nthe last 2 years and when I was running for the Senate. I see it in \neach of the 72 counties of our State, where I hold a listening session \nin each county every year. Most recently, I have seen it in the \nwillingness of so many of my constituents. The vast majority of my \nconstituents say to me, ``Don't take a tax cut and give it to the \nAmerican people.'' They say, ``Just reduce spending to reduce the \ndeficit.'' This is the way the people are talking. They are ready to \nhandle this problem, if we are open about it.\n  Mr. President, the people of this country are willing to make \nsacrifices to help clean up the mess that was not of their making. The \nvery least we can do is to deal honestly with them. That is what this \namendment does. It provides an honest approach.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States is \nstill our great national contract. Before we ask people to accept a \nchange in that contract, they are entitled to read the fine print.\n  So I urge my colleagues on this important vote later today to support \nthe Senator from South Dakota and provide the American people the \ninformation they need so they can go forward with some confidence on \nthis issue.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, there is no more important aspect to this debate than \nthe amendment put forward by my good friend from South Dakota, the \nminority leader.\n  Yesterday, the Budget Committee heard very important testimony from \nDr. Laura Tyson, the Chair of the President's Council of Economic \nAdvisers. Dr. Tyson explained how risky passing this resolution can be \nif we do not know exactly what is going to be cut, how much, and when.\n  She outlined for us how dangerous these drastic, irrational cuts can \nbe to the current economic expansion. She described how our fiscal \npolicy will be ``handcuffed,'' that is her word, not mine, if this \nresolution becomes part of the Constitution.\n  I refer our colleagues, Mr. President, to her testimony before the \nBudget Committee yesterday. And, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof an article by Dr. Tyson in yesterday's Washington Post be made a \npart of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                    It's a Recipe for Economic Chaos\n\n                          (By Laura D. Tyson)\n\n       Continued progress on reducing the deficit is sound \n     economic policy, but a constitutional amendment requiring \n     annual balance of the federal budget is not. The fallacy in \n     the logic behind the balanced budget amendment begins with \n     the premise that the size of the federal deficit is the \n     result of conscious policy decisions. This is only partly the \n     case. The pace of economic activity also plays an important \n     role in determining the deficit. An economic slowdown \n     automatically depresses tax revenues and increases government \n     spending on such programs as unemployment compensation, food \n     stamps and welfare.\n       Such temporary increases in the deficit act as ``automatic \n     stabilizers,'' offsetting some of the reduction in the \n     purchasing power of the private sector and cushioning the \n     economy's slide, not be able to moderate the ups and downs of \n     the business cycle on its own as well as it can with the help \n     of the automatic fiscal stabilizers.\n       First, monetary policy affects the economy indirectly and \n     with notoriously long lags, making it difficult to time the \n     desired effects with precision. By contrast, the automatic \n     stabilizers of fiscal policy swings into action as soon as \n     the economy begins to slow, often well before the Federal \n     Reserve even recognizes the need for compensating action.\n       Second, the Fed could become handcuffed in the event of a \n     major recession--its scope for action limited by the fact \n     that it can push short-term interest rates no lower than \n     zero, and probably not even that low. By historical \n     standards, the spread between today's short rates of 6 \n     percent and zero leaves uncomfortably little room for \n     maneuver. Between the middle of 1990 and the end of 1992, the \n     Fed reduced the short-term interest rate it controls by a \n     cumulative total of 5\\1/4\\ percentage points. Even so, the \n     economy sank into a recession from which it has only recently \n     fully recovered--a recession whose severity was moderated by \n     the very automatic stabilizers of fiscal policy the balanced \n     budget amendment would destroy.\n       [[Page S2284]] Third, the more aggressive actions required \n     of the Fed to limit the increase in the variability of output \n     and employment could actually increase the volatility of \n     financial markets--an ironic possibility, given that many of \n     the amendment's proponents may well believe they are \n     promoting financial stability.\n       Moreover, they do so quickly and automatically, without the \n     need for lengthy debates about the state of the economy and \n     the appropriate policy response.\n       By the same token, when the economy strengthens again, the \n     automatic stabilizers work in the other direction: tax \n     revenues rise, spending for unemployment benefits and other \n     social safety net programs fall, and the deficit narrows.\n       A balanced budget amendment would throw the automatic \n     stabilizers into reverse. Congress would be required to raise \n     tax rates or cut spending programs in the face of a recession \n     to counteract temporary increases in the deficit. Rather than \n     moderating the normal ups and downs of the business cycle, \n     fiscal policy would be required to aggravate them.\n       A simple example from recent economic history should serve \n     as cautionary tale. In fiscal year 1991, the economy's \n     unanticipated slowdown caused actual government spending for \n     unemployment insurance and related items to exceed the \n     budgeted amount by $6 billion, and actual revenues to fall \n     short of the budgeted amount by some $67 billion. In a \n     balanced-budget world, Congress would have been required to \n     offset the resulting shift of more than $70 billion in the \n     deficit by a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts that \n     by themselves would have sharply worsened the economic \n     downturn--resulting in an additional loss of 1\\1/4\\ percent \n     of GDP and 750,000 jobs.\n       The version of the amendment passed by the House has no \n     special ``escape clause'' for recessions--only the general \n     provision that the budget could be in deficit if three-fifths \n     of both the House and Senate agree. This is a far cry from an \n     automatic stabilizer. It is easy to imagine a well-organized \n     minority in either House of Congress holding this provision \n     hostage to its particular political agenda.\n       In a balanced budget world--with fiscal policy enjoined to \n     destabilize rather than stabilize the economy--all \n     responsibility for counteracting the economic effects of the \n     business cycle would be placed at the doorstep of the Federal \n     Reserve. The Fed could attempt to meet this increased \n     responsibility by pushing interest rates down more \n     aggressively when the economy softens and raising them more \n     vigorously when it strengthens.\n       Finally, a balanced budget amendment would create an \n     automatic and undesirable link between interest rates and \n     fiscal policy. An unanticipated increase in interest rates \n     would boost federal interest expense and thus the deficit. \n     The balanced budget amendments under consideration would \n     require that such an unanticipated increase in the deficit be \n     offset within the fiscal year!\n       In other words, independent monetary policy decisions by \n     the Federal Reserve would require immediate and painful \n     budgetary adjustments. Where would they come from? Not from \n     interest payments and not, with such short notice, from \n     entitlement programs. Rather they would have to come from \n     either a tax increase or from cuts or possible shutdowns in \n     discretionary programs whose funds had not yet been \n     obligated. This is not a sensible way to establish budgetary \n     priorities or maintain the health interaction and \n     independence of monetary and fiscal policy.\n       One of the great discoveries of modern economics is the \n     role that fiscal policy can play in moderating the business \n     cycle. Few if any members of the Senate about to vote on a \n     balanced budget amendment experienced the tragic human costs \n     of the Great Depression, costs made more severe by President \n     Herbert Hoover's well-intentioned but misguided efforts to \n     balance the budget. Unfortunately, the huge deficits \n     inherited from the last decade of fiscal profligacy have \n     rendered discretionary changes in fiscal policy in response \n     to the business cycle all but impossible. Now, many of those \n     responsible for the massive run-up in debt during the 1980s \n     are leading the charge to eliminate the automatic stabilizers \n     as well by voting for a balanced budget amendment.\n       Instead of undermining the government's ability to moderate \n     the economy's cyclical fluctuations by passing such an \n     amendment, why not simply make the hard choices and cast the \n     courageous votes required to reduce the deficit--the kind of \n     hard choices and courageous votes delivered by members of the \n     103rd Congress when they passed the administration's $505 \n     billion deficit reduction package?\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Dr. Tyson, probably more clearly than \nanyone I have heard in the past few days, explains how dangerous this \nresolution is and why the American people have a right to know what our \nbudget will look like before we act on this measure.\n  Mr. President, the staff of the Budget Committee prepared an analysis \nof the balanced budget amendment which puts the abstract words of this \nresolution into perspective.\n  Now, as you know, Mr. President, the proponents of this resolution \ntell us we must have a balanced budget in the year 2002. But, they \nrefuse to tell us how they will achieve that balance. They will not \nlevel with the American people about what they will cut and what they \nwill eliminate. And, Mr. President, the American people have a right to \nknow.\n  They have a right to know before we pass this amendment how this will \naffect them.\n  If we pass this resolution with an exemption for Social Security, \ndefense, and some other sensitive programs and if we still enact all \nthe tax cuts in the Contract With America, and all of that is possible, \nwe will see a 50-percent across-the-board cut in all other programs.\n  Is this responsible budgeting, Mr. President? Is this rational? Is \nthis common sense? If we put this resolution into action, Mr. \nPresident, agricultural programs could take a 50-percent cut. So could \nhighway funds. We could lose half of our education and job training \nmoney, and we could lose half of our student loans.\n  If the Constitution is amended in this way, and Congress actually \nacts on it, the cleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation is in \njeopardy. This is not the way we return security to our Nation, Mr. \nPresident. And, it is not how we restore the glimmer of hope to our \nchildren's eyes.\n  The radical cuts this amendment will demand will likely fall squarely \non the backs of the most vulnerable in our society--our children, our \nelderly, our disabled most in need of help.\n  And, Mr. President, at a time of uncertainty for all of our working \nfamilies we find this resolution will hurt our workers. The economists \nat Wharton predict Washington State could lose 209,000 jobs the year \nafter this amendment takes effect. They predict my State will \nexperience a 15-percent drop in total personal income. And, they tell \nme hardest hit will be the manufacturing sector--especially the \naerospace industry--which is already experiencing massive job losses.\n  Mr. President, it is time to level with the American people. If we \nare gong to engage in a discussion of balancing the budget, let's get \nbeyond the 10-second sound bites. Let us tell the American people how \nthis budget will affect our lives, and their children's lives. Because, \nMr. President, if we are going to change the Constitution of the United \nStates the American people have a right to know exactly how this will \naffect their lives, their security, and their future.\n  I retain the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from Utah for yielding the time.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated in previous remarks on the floor in \nthis debate on another day, this really is the defining moment. This is \nthe opportunity for us to move on balancing the Federal budget. If we \ndo not do it during this time when we have the opportunity to pass this \namendment, it will be the last time. The House has passed it 300 to \n132. It is very close here in the Senate. Some would say that we do not \nhave the 67 votes that are required as of now.\n  Here we are, out here talking about a right to know, so-called. \nEveryone knows that is a smokescreen. It is dilatory. It is a delay \ntactic to try to stop us from voting on this amendment or to try to \nobfuscate the issue so much that no one will understand what the real \nproblems are.\n  Here is the real problem, Mr. President. This is the President's \nbudget.\n  It is interesting that the color is green, and it should be because \nin this budget the President spends one heck of a lot of money. In this \nbudget, the President adds, over 5 years, well over $1 trillion more to \nthe national debt. The annual deficits run over $200 billion a year, on \nan average, for the next 5 years, adding over $1 trillion to the \nnational debt. That is what it says.\n  The other side says we need a right to know. Well, what about the \nPresident of the United States? Why does he not submit to us at least \nsomething that leads toward a balanced budget? \n[[Page S2285]] He basically has taken a walk and has presented this \nbudget. It is green. You know, Mr. President, here is the color it \nshould be--red--because it is red ink, more red ink, more red ink, more \nred ink, business as usual, politics as usual. We stand down here on \nthe floor and we talk and talk and talk, and the debt goes up and up \nand up, and our children's future is at stake.\n  That is what this is all about, Mr. President. Let us face it, that \nis what it is all about. How can the President of the United States, \nwith his party on the floor trying to delay this amendment by using \nthis phony argument of the right to know, keep a straight face in \npresenting this budget? He ought to replace Jay Leno, for crying out \nloud. It is hysterical. It is so funny that no one could possibly take \nthe man seriously. How can you say that?\n  If you want further evidence of what this thing is all about on this \namendment--and I say to my colleague, the floor leader from Utah--I \nremind him because he was very much a participant in this debate a year \nago, in February 1994, when we had the amendment up here and we lost it \nby three or four votes, as the Senator well remembers. The sponsor of \nthis right-to-know amendment by the minority leader of the U.S. Senate \nwas on the floor, and it is interesting to hear what he said because he \nsupported the amendment in that debate and voted for the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. Here is what he said:\n\n       To remedy our fiscal situation, we must stop spending \n     beyond our means. This will not require the emasculation of \n     important domestic priorities, as some suggest.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       We are building a legacy of debt for our children and our \n     grandchildren and hamstringing our ability to address \n     pressing national priorities.\n\n  And then he said:\n\n       In this debate on a balanced budget amendment, we are being \n     forced to face the consequences of our inaction. Quite \n     simply, we are building a legacy of debt for our children and \n     our grandchildren and hamstringing our ability to address \n     pressing national priorities.\n\n  Here, Mr. President, ironically is what Senator Daschle, the minority \nleader, said on February 28 on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the \nright to know:\n\n       Congress and the President will have 7 years to address the \n     current deficit and reach a consensus on our Nation's budget \n     priorities. We will have time to find ways to live within our \n     means and still meet existing obligations to our citizens, \n     particularly the elderly.\n\n  So you have the sponsor of this amendment on the floor of the Senate \n1 year ago in support of the balanced budget amendment and saying pass \nthe amendment and we will lay out the plan and we will work together to \nlay out a plan to balance the budget. That is 180 degrees in reverse of \nwhere we are today with the Senator from South Dakota with his so-\ncalled right-to-know amendment.\n  When are we going to do this? The reason why we need the amendment \ncould never be more obvious than it was when the President submitted \nthat budget, because we will not do it without the amendment. I want to \ncomment for a few moments on this issue of the right to know, because \nit is kind of fascinating. I hear about the public's right to know as \nif we have to know every single item, everything we are going to do \nbefore we pass the amendment. If Congress wanted to get a balanced \nbudget, they would have done it, Mr. President, and we would not need \nthe amendment. The reason we need the amendment is because they will \nnot do it. That is the reason--because they will not do it.\n  Do you know what I think? I think the public has a right to know why \nevery child born in America today, even as I speak, is born \napproximately $18,000 in debt. I think that child has a right to know \nwhy that is happening in this country and what we are going to do about \nit. That is a right to know that I think we ought to have.\n  Also, I hear on the floor that we are going to make the tough \ndecisions. Give me a break. That is why we need the amendment. We are \nnot making the tough decisions, and the President did not make the \ntough decisions in this budget. He did not make the tough decisions. He \ntook a walk. That is going to continue to happen until the national \ndebt goes right through the roof. It is already fast approaching, or \nwill be by the turn of the century, over $6 trillion. Where does it \nstop, at $12, $13, $15, $16, $20, $100 trillion? That is where it is \ngoing to go if we do not stop. We just have to do it.\n  Why would anybody think the American people are going to trust us to \nmake those decisions? Why should they? We have never done it. That is \nwhy 80 percent of them have said over and over again that they support \nan amendment. That is why they said it. That is why they want this \namendment. And that is why those who do not want it are using these \ndelay tactics and phony arguments, because they do not want to make the \ntough decisions.\n  In order to force us to do what we have been unwilling to do for the \npast 15 years or longer, we need this amendment.\n  Do you know what has been really lost in this debate, beyond the \nright to know? We are forgetting about the American people. They are \nthe losers in this debate. Many of my colleagues say, oh, the Governors \nare against it, State legislators will not support it; there will be a \nlot of polls cited next week saying that. The only poll that the \nFramers of the Constitution ever thought about or knew about, as far as \nI am concerned, is whether or not 38 States deem this amendment \nessential and a majority of the House and Senate deem it essential. If \nthey do, we will be bound by the Constitution that all of us swore to \nuphold to put our fiscal house in order and, by doing so, we will bring \nsome dignity to this body and restore fiscal sanity to this country. \nThat is what it is all about, fiscal sanity and dignity.\n  How in the world can we call it dignified to roll up trillions of \ndollars more of debt on our children, basically saying I am not going \nto worry about it today, I am going to live the good life and do what I \nhave to do, and I am going to pass my debts on to my kids. That is what \nwe are doing with trillions of dollars.\n  My friends who oppose the amendment speak only of their ability to \nmake the tough choices. ``We will make the tough choices,'' they say. I \nheard one of my colleagues say how they made the tough choices. In \nfact, it was said this morning that they made the tough choices in 1993 \nin the President's budget. He said, ``No Republican voted for this \nagreement.''\n  I remind my colleagues that Republicans were not a party to the \nagreement. We did not have anything to do with negotiating the \nagreement. We were not invited to participate in it. I do not know what \nthe discussion was like behind closed doors, nor do any of my \nRepublican colleagues know. Do you know what they talked about in those \nmeetings and discussions? They did not talk about cutting spending or \nbalancing the budget. They talked about, should we raise the top tax \nrate 5, 8, 9 percent? What are we going to raise it to? They talked \nabout raising taxes. They talked about, should we make tax increases \nretroactive for 6 months, 1 year, year and a half? How long can we go \nwith a millionaires' surtax? Should it be $500,000 or $250,000. That is \nwhat was going on. There were no talks in those meetings about spending \ncuts or about tough decisions.\n  So that is one of the reasons why I believe my friends fear the \nconstitutional amendment, those who are opposing it, because they know \nexactly what is going to happen. You will have to cut spending and cut \nthe bloated bureaucracy and eliminate outdated programs, and you will \nhave to make the tough decisions. That is the truth. They are not ready \nto do it. That is the bottom line.\n  I will close on this point. I was very much interested in the story \nin the Washington Post this week regarding Washington, DC. They \nannounced they are $722 million in debt. And Mayor Barry is telling us \nin the papers that home rule does not work. He is one of the most noted \nfigures in the history of home rule in the District. He is now saying: \nI have to have the Federal Government take over some of the services, \nthe prison system, and other programs that he says he cannot maintain. \nHe is in debt.\n  Now, why has the Mayor changed his mind? Why has he changed his tune \nfrom the big government mayor that he was for all those years?\n  It is quite simple. He does not have the tax base any longer to \nmaintain \n[[Page S2286]] the bureaucracy that had been created by him and his \npredecessors. The well is dry. They cannot raise any more taxes.\n  Indeed, we have the representative from Washington, DC, in the House \nsaying we may want to eliminate income taxes altogether for people who \nlive in the District. They cannot pay any more taxes. They are up to \nhere. That is the problem.\n  That is not the answer. The answer is not raising more taxes. The \nanswer is cutting spending. That is the issue. So he has given up. So \nthe Mayor says, ``Come in. Take these things from me. I can't deal with \nit any more. I do not have the tax base.''\n  That, my friends, is exactly the predicament that we are going to be \nin in the very, very near future. We are going to go to the well once \ntoo often. There is not going to be any more money there. You cannot \nsqueeze any more blood out of this turnip, out of the American people. \nThey do not have it any more. They are fed up. They have had enough. \nYou cannot get any more. And, therefore, the end is in sight. That is \nwhat is going to happen. That is where we are going to get to.\n  And when that point comes, what do we do? Are we are going to turn \nand say, ``Take these programs''? The answer is no. We all know, when \nthat comes, it is going to be too late and we will have bankruptcy, the \nequivalent of chapter 1, where we spend a whole bunch more dollars.\n  That is not what the American people want. The American people want \nus to be fiscally responsible, to make the tough decisions and pass \nthis amendment so that the Congress and the President, both political \nparties, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, sit down in a \nroom and make the decision to balance the budget. Yes, we will differ \non where the priorities are, but we have to do it. Now we do not have \nto do it. That is why we need the amendment.\n  So I urge my colleagues to move off this phony debate of right to \nknow and exempting programs and get on to the business of passing this \namendment sooner rather than later and stop the dilatory tactics.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for yielding to me.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire for his excellent statement. It was terrific.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to our courageous colleague from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President and my colleagues in the Senate, I am for \nthe basic aim of this amendment, but I am going to vote against the \namendment for two reasons.\n  One is, while I think we do need to spell out in broad outlines where \nwe are going and how we are going to achieve a balanced budget before \nit goes to the States, I do not believe this should be in the \nConstitution. We are talking about a procedural thing that should not \nbe in the Constitution.\n  Second, to spell out down to $100 million where we are going I think \nis just totally unrealistic in terms of where we are going to be 7 \nyears from now. So I think it is an unwise amendment.\n  I would add, if we pass the balanced budget amendment--and my hope is \nthat we will have the wisdom and the courage to do so--I will request--\nand I hope to be joined by Senator Hatch and others on this--I will \nrequest the leaders of both parties to either ask the Budget Committee \nor a special task force to put together in broad outlines how we can \nget to a balanced budget in the year 2002.\n  Now, CBO has outlined some things; the Concord Coalition has outlined \nsome things. There have been other suggestions. But I think a task \nforce that can be appointed immediately after passage and report back \nto the Senate is the way we should go. I do not believe we should put \nthis kind of an amendment in the Constitution. I think it is just not \nconstitutional in nature.\n  Second, I think to say where we are going to be 7 years from now in \nterms of $100 million--and at that point it will be about a $1.8 \ntrillion budget--is just unrealistic. So I will be voting for the \nmotion to table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I have been listening to the speeches and debate on \nthis amendment and especially on this issue. I just want to go to the \nbottom line real quick.\n  We have to get away from these scare tactics that everything is going \nto be cut. I have had people come into my office and say, ``We are \ngoing to lose our programs. Everything is going to be out because you \nwill not tell us how you are going to do it.''\n  Let me tell you, this is going to make us all set up a criteria to \nselect those things to be funded that should be funded. How many \nprograms have we got right now that are being funded that have not been \nauthorized by this body or the other body or ever signed into law by \nthe President of the United States? If that is one of those criteria, \nthen we are going to see those folks who want to fund programs that \nhave not been authorized or cannot pass the scrutiny of the Senate or \nthe House and we get them out. We just go ahead and fund them.\n  A case in point is the National Biological Survey. We appropriate all \nkinds of money for a program that has never passed this Congress. And \nif we do not have the criteria on which we fund and what we do not \nfund, we will never do it, we will never get it under control.\n  So the scare tactics are all baloney.\n  I thank my friend from Utah for yielding me the minute. You usually \nhear a lot of flowery speeches, but that is the bottom line when you go \nto taking up this issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague from Montana for his cogent remarks.\n  I now yield 15 minutes to our distinguished chairman of the Policy \nCommittee, the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleague from Montana for his \nremarks. They were brief, but they were right on target.\n  I also wish to compliment Senator Hatch, Senator Craig, and Senator \nSimon. I very much appreciate the bipartisanship which we have \nexhibited in trying to pass this constitutional amendment.\n  We have all been working for a long, long time to pass a \nconstitutional amendment saying, ``Congress, you cannot spend any more \nthan you take in.'' It is long overdue.\n  Consider the remarks Thomas Jefferson made in 1798. He said, ``I wish \nit were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution.'' He \nfurther says, ``I mean an additional article, taking from the Federal \nGovernment the power of borrowing.'' These are Thomas Jefferson's words \nand he was correct.\n  Mr. President, we have a heck of a problem. We are spending a lot \nmore money than we take in and we have been doing it for a long time. \nWe did it for many years under Republican administrations, under \nDemocratic administrations, and under primarily Democrat Congresses. We \nhad a Republican Senate in the interlude. But we have seen Federal \nspending escalate year after year.\n  Mr. President, I am going to put a lot of tables into the Record \nwhich represent the facts, the fact that Federal spending has been \nexploding.\n  In 1960, Mr. President, the Federal Government spent less than $100 \nbillion. In 1970, we spent less than $200 billion. In 1980, we spent \n$591 billion. So, we went from less than $100 billion in 1960, less \nthan $200 billion in 1970, and less than $600 billion in 1980. By 1990, \nMr. President, we spent $1.25 trillion.\n  I am bothered, Mr. President, when the President of the United States \nclaims in his State of the Union Message that he cut spending by $250 \nbillion. The fact is that Federal spending has not been reduced; it has \nclimbed every year. The only way that the President can say we have cut \nspending is by using the inflated baselines that only the Federal \nGovernment would \n[[Page S2287]]  use. He is not accurate. Federal spending has gone up \nevery single year.\n  In 1992, Federal spending was $1.382 trillion; in 1994 it was $1.461 \ntrillion; in 1995 it will be $1.531 trillion. The President's budget \nfor next year is over $1.6 trillion--And the spending continues to \nescalate. By the year 2000, spending exceeds $1.9 trillion. Federal \nspending continues to climb every year, and it has under every \nPresident and every administration.\n  Revenues have been climbing as well, but not quite as fast. I really \nthink we need some kind of restraint. I happen to think a \nconstitutional amendment is the restraint we need. I wish we did not. \nSome of my constituents asked me recently, was it really necessary? I \nsaid it would not be necessary if we had a strong majority in both the \nHouse and the Senate that was willing to make the tough fiscal \ndecisions that would have to be made to balance the budget.\n  We have not seen that kind of majority. Maybe with the new Congress \nwe will have that kind of opportunity, but history has shown that we \nhave not had it in decades. Most States have a balanced budget \nrequirement. Some may allow exceptions, but most States have something \nin their constitution that limits the amounts of money that they can \nspend and/or the amount of money they can borrow.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is vitally important we pass a balanced \nbudget amendment. It has to be a bipartisan effort, and I hope we will \nhave bipartisan support to make it happen.\n  Mr. President, some people have said, ``How do you do it?'' This is \nthe intent of Senator Daschle's amendment on the right to know. \nUnfortunately, Senator Daschle's amendment amends the Constitution. \nThis is not the proper way to do what he wants to do. I happen to agree \nthat we should put out as much information on how we will get there as \npossible. I would also say that 7 year estimates are just guessing. No \none knows what will happen in the economy between now and then, and \ncertainly the economy makes a lot of difference on what the outlays \nwill be and what the revenues will be. But to put something like his \namendment in the Constitution is wrong. I just hope my colleagues \nbefore they vote on this amendment will read the amendment that is \npending and read section 9. It includes about 11 or 12 paragraphs.\n  The rest of the balanced budget amendment is quite simple. The rest \nof the amendment, which is similar to an amendment we passed in the \nSenate in 1982, one which Senator Daschle himself has supported in the \npast, makes sense. It is logical. It would fit in the Constitution. \nSection 9 does not belong in the Constitution.\n  I hope that my colleagues will not support the right to know \namendment. Does that mean that Congress should abdicate its \nresponsibility and wait until the seventh year to do anything to \nbalance the budget? No, we should take concrete steps each year to \nreduce our deficit down to zero.\n  I regret to say that President Clinton, in his latest budget \nsubmission, has not done that. I think he has raised the white flag on \ndeficit reduction. His deficit stays at about $200 billion in the \nforeseeable future, and beyond the year 2000 increases rather \ndramatically. The President's budget touches a little bit on \ndiscretionary spending, it increases it dramatically in some areas, \ncuts it in defense and some other areas, and does not touch \nentitlements.\n  Entitlements have been exploding. I think that is irresponsible. I \nthink, basically, the President punted and said, ``Congress, you take \nover. We will wait and see how you do and we will throw rocks at it.'' \nI think that is irresponsible.\n  Regardless of what the President does, we need to move toward a \nbalanced budget. Regardless of whether or not we pass this amendment, \nwe need to move to balance the budget. I hope we will. I hope we take \nconcrete steps this year and each and every year to reduce the deficit, \nreduce the enormous debt load we have on the American people.\n  Mr. President, we do have enormous debt load. Federal debt in 1994 is \n$4.6 trillion. Mr. President, per capita that is $17,848 for every man, \nwoman, and child in the United States. That is the amount of public \ndebt we have today. Next year, 1995, that figure is $18,800. So that \nfigure has risen by over $1,700 for every man, woman, and child in the \nUnited States, the amount of debt load increase they have all \ninherited.\n  I do not think that is acceptable. I think we have to manage \nsomething. Maybe this is not the perfect solution, but it happens to be \none of the few that I think will work. We are sworn to uphold the \nConstitution, and we all take an oath that we will uphold the \nConstitution, I think we will show the courage to do so.\n  Unless and until we have that constraint, I am afraid we will fall \nback to business as usual, and business as usual is passing the Daschle \namendment or passing another amendment that says we will exclude Social \nSecurity or gut this amendment some way or another and not pass it, and \nwe will continue spending more money than we take in.\n  Why do we do that? Senators are a lot more popular if we spend money \nthan if we take it. People do not like taxes. They like spending. \nTherefore, we spend more, tax less, and have big deficits. I do not \nthink that is responsible, Mr. President. I do not think we can \ncontinue doing that.\n  How can we balance the budget? Can we do it? CBO says we will have to \ncut spending by $1.2 trillion. The President's budget would cut \nspending by $144 billion in the next 5 years. Mr. President, we will \nspend over $10 trillion in the next 6 years. The President is talking \nabout a marginal reduction of about 1 percent. Again, Federal spending \nunder the President's program goes from $1.5 to $1.9 trillion. That is \nnot a spending reduction. If spending goes up by a dollar, we should \nsay spending went up, not that we reduced the rate of both and \ntherefore it is a spending cut.\n  Mr. President, we can balance the budget if we allow spending to \nincrease, but spending cannot increase as fast. According to the \nbaseline that CBO uses, spending is increasing right now about 5.26 \npercent. We can balance the budget keeping spending growth to 3.21 \npercent for the next 7 years. Then we can balance the budget. Let me \nrepeat that: Spending can increase each and every year, by 3.26 \npercent.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will not yield. I have a few more \npoints to make, and I will be happy to yield in a moment.\n  So, Mr. President, how do we do that? We have some programs growing \nastronomically. I will mention a few: Defense has actually gone down, \nbut there are a lot of other programs that are growing very \ndramatically. Medicaid, for example, in the last 4 years has grown at \n28, 29, 12, and 8 percent. We cannot continue that rate of growth.\n  Earned income tax credit, a program that this President is very proud \nof, the last 4 years has grown at 11, 55, 18 percent, 1994 at 22 \npercent, 1995 at 55 percent. That is an exploding entitlement program \nthat this President expanded. I could go on. Food stamps in the last 4 \nyears has grown 17, 25, 21, and 11 percent. Last year, zero percent. We \ncan see it has exploded in growth. In 1990 we spent $15 billion in food \nstamps; in 1994, $25 billion in food stamps.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these tables be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       FEDERAL SPENDING CATEGORIES                      \n              [In billions of nominal dollars--Source:

Mr. President, I could go on. Medicare, in the last 4 \nyears is compounded at 13, 11, 12 percent. This year it is expected to \ncompound at 10 percent. Those are rates greater than 3.2 percent.\n  I admit, we will have to slow the rate of growth in a lot of programs \nif we will balance the budgets. Will it be easy? Not necessarily. The \npoint is that Federal spending will continue to grow and we can still \nbalance the budget. It will not be able to grow as much or as fast.\n  Again, I have heard people say, wait a minute, to balance the budget \nwe will have to reduce spending $1.2 trillion. Over the next 7 years we \nwill spend about $15 trillion. Can we afford $1.2 trillion? I think we \ncan reduce the rate of growth and not spend $15 trillion.\n  I think we have to do it, Mr. President. I think passing a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget will make us do it. If \nwe do not pass it, I am afraid we will be back to business as usual. I \nhope that is not the case. I really do hope we will be serious. I hope \nthat we will be serious and make a concerted effort to balance the \nbudget, make the tough decisions, cut spending, cut entitlement \nprograms, reduce those programs that are growing to astronomical \nlevels, and try to live within our means. We have to do it.\n  I just have a couple of comments concerning the pending Daschle \namendment. It says:\n\n       In order to carry out the purpose of this article, Congress \n     shall adopt a concurrent resolution setting forth a budget \n     plan to achieve a balanced budget (that complies with this \n     article) * * *.\n\n  And so on. And it says in section C:\n\n       New budget authority and outlays, on an account-by-account \n     basis, for each account with actual outlays or offsetting \n     receipts of at least $100,000,000 in fiscal year 1994.\n\n  [[Page S2290]] This does not belong, Mr. President, in the \nConstitution. This does not fit. It does not work. And it will not \nwork.\n  I will read from Senator Daschle's comments that he made last year on \nFebruary 28. He said:\n\n       To remedy our fiscal situation, we must stop spending \n     beyond our means. This will not require emasculation of \n     important domestic priorities, as some suggest.\n\n  And then he says:\n\n       Congress and the President will have 7 years to address the \n     current deficit and reach a consensus on our Nation's budget \n     priorities. We will have time to find ways to live within our \n     means and still meet existing obligations to our citizens, \n     particularly the elderly.\n\n  I happen to concur with that. However, his amendment does not concur \nwith the statements last year. His amendment does not belong in the \nU.S. Constitution, with all respect to its supporters. I may concur \nwith their desire for Congress to set out a glidepath. The glidepath is \nthis: Let us limit Federal spending to 3.2 percent, and if we want \nspending in some areas, like Social Security, to grow at 5 percent, \nthat is fine; we have to find some other spending areas to be reduced \nto offset that amount. We can do that, if we will just show the courage \nto do it. Unfortunately, Congress has not shown the courage in the \npast.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude with, again, complimenting the \nsponsors of the balanced budget amendment, Senators Simon, Hatch, and \nCraig, and many others who worked tirelessly to make it happen. We \npassed a similar amendment in 1982--I wish it would have been adopted \nby the House--in 1982, we were spending about $746 billion. We are \nspending more than twice as much today, in 1995, as we did in 1982.\n  So I think we need this balanced budget amendment. It is regretful we \ndid not pass it a decade ago, or maybe in Jefferson's time. We would \nnot be in the plight we are in, with our children inheriting a debt of \nover $18,000 per person. So I hope that the Daschle amendment will be \neither defeated or tabled, and I hope that we will pass a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget identical to that of the \nHouse and then allow the States to go forward with the ratification \nprocess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to yield time to the Senator from \nIllinois. Let me for 30 seconds on my time indicate that which sounds \ndeceptively simple is just plain wrong. As someone said, as happens \noften, you can simply limit to 3 percent growth and you solve the \nproblem. If you limit Social Security to 3 percent growth, you \neffectively--Social Security recipients would not have the cost-of-\nliving adjustments--but you tell the 6 million new people who become \neligible, ``There is no money for you; you don't get your Social \nSecurity benefits.'' It sounds simple.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not have the time, as the Senator did not, either. \nLet me yield 10 minutes, if I might, to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Illinois yield for 30 seconds?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I cannot yield because there is \nprecious little time left in the debate. I would like to take this \nopportunity to state my support for the right-to-know amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, and I am an equally strong supporter of the \nAmerican people's right to know what balancing the budget will mean for \nthem, for their future, and for their children's future.\n  Frankly, I do not understand why the right-to-know amendment should \nbe the least bit controversial. I cannot believe that any Member of \nthis Senate would argue that the American people should not know how \nthe Government spends their money. I cannot believe that any Member of \nthis Senate would argue that the American people should not know--in \nadvance--what programs will need to be cut, or consolidated, or \nterminated, in order to balance the budget. I cannot believe that any \nMember of this Senate would argue that the American people should not \nhave the right to make their views known on the options for balancing \nthe budget before we are committed to any particular set of options, \nand that includes options for changes in tax laws, as well as spending \ncuts. Most of all, I cannot believe that any Member of this Senate \nwould seriously argue that the American people should be asked to make \na decision on an issue as important as the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment without knowing in detail--before they \ndecide--what balancing the budget will mean, both for the United States \nin general, and for themselves.\n  It seems to me that we have an obligation to give the American people \nthe absolute truth about the Federal budget, and about the choices we \nhave to make to bring it back to balance--and to keep it there. If we \nthink balancing the budget is important--and I, for one, believe that \nit is critically important to meeting our responsibility to future \ngenerations--then we have an obligation to present the facts to our \nconstituents, to let them know what the options are, and the \nconsequences they entail. In a democracy, the only way to build broad, \nsustainable support for the hard decisions that adopting a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment will force is to talk sense to the \nAmerican people and to tell them the truth.\n  The people know the truth when they hear it--and they want to hear \nit. They know that, all too often in the past, budgetary issues have \nbeen presented to them as if they were the marks in a three-card monte \ncon game.\n  Americans don't want to put up with that any more. They want the \ntruth--now. They know they haven't been getting that truth, but they \nalso know that in our democratic system, they deserve that truth, and \nthey are entitled to it.\n  What the right-to-know amendment is all about is seeing that they get \nthe truth. It calls for nothing more than treating the American public \nwith the respect they deserve. It does nothing more than ask the \nCongress to do what common sense requires--to simply tell the truth \nabout what it means to balance the budget, and about the changes that \nbalancing the budget will bring. Most importantly, it means putting an \nend to the kind of budgetary gamesmanship that has contributed so \ngreatly to the rise in public cynicism about Government, and its \nability to tell the truth.\n  Just yesterday I was talking to an auto worker from Decatur, IL. He \nrecounted a joke that goes something like this: ``How can you tell the \ngovernment official is lying?'' The answer is: ``Because his lips are \nmoving.'' That response is a telling indictment of the Government's \nstewardship of the budget and the kind of cynicism that is out there \nabout what we do. In 1981, the American people were asked to believe in \nsupply side economics, a plan that told the American people that \ncutting taxes would lead to faster economic growth, generating \nadditional Federal revenues that would painlessly balance the budget. \nOf course, the only thing that it actually generated was staggering \ndeficits that led to a quadrupling of the national debt from $1 \ntrillion to over $4 trillion in just 12 years.\n  And the American people were told that Gramm-Rudman budget discipline \nwould lead to a balanced budget. That effort also failed, because, like \nsupply-side economics, it was more a cosmetic fix. It made the Congress \nlook good and look like it had the discipline to make hard choices \nconcerning the budget. But it was not based on telling the American \npeople the truth about the Federal budget, or about what it would \nreally take to balance it.\n  That is why the right-to-know amendment is so important now. If the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment is not to be seen as another \nbudgetary gimmick, as another way to avoid the decision, or as another \nattempt to concentrate on process in order to again postpone the real \ndecisions that must be made, the American people need to know that \nCongress is prepared to act, realistically and forcefully, based on \nbudgetary realities rather than political illusions. And the only way \nthey will be convinced of that \n[[Page S2291]]  is if they are made a full partner in the \ndecisionmaking process.\n  There are those who fear that telling the American people the truth \nwill undermine support for the balanced budget amendment, and there are \nothers who hope it will. But there is no reason to fear the truth. The \nonly thing we should fear is the consequences for our country and our \ndemocracy if we do not tell the truth.\n  Yet, there are those who continue to twist and turn in order to avoid \nmeeting their obligation to the American people--to avoid telling the \ntruth about the budget--and thereby put the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment unnecessarily at risk. These continued \nattempts at evasion make the right-to-know amendment, and the facts it \nwill provide, even more necessary.\n  After all, according to the Congressional Budget Office, it will take \nover 1.2 trillion dollars' worth of budget changes to reach a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002. And that is just the beginning, because \nbalancing the budget that year will not ensure that it is balanced from \nthen on, and that is what the balanced budget amendment requires.\n  The fact is that, as difficult as it will be to balance the budget by \n2002, that task looks almost insignificant when compared to the \nchallenge of keeping it balanced. I served on the Bipartisan Commission \non Entitlement and Tax Reform. That Commission's interim report, \nadopted by an overwhelming 30 to 1 vote, found that, without major \nreform in entitlements, the Federal Government will almost double in \nsize by 2030 as a percentage of the economy, and the Federal deficit \nthat year would exceed 18 percent of the economy.\n  Think of that. Not only would the Federal deficit in 2030 equal \nvirtually one-fifth of our GDP that year, but interest expense alone \nwould consume over $1 of every $10 our economy generates.\n  The Commission report also made it very clear that growth in spending \non discretionary programs subject to annual appropriations is not what \nis driving the growth of Federal spending. As a percentage of overall \nFederal spending, discretionary spending has dropped from over 70 \npercent of the budget in 1963 to only 28 percent of the budget now.\n  What is growing is entitlement spending, spending for activities like \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and the like. Entitlements \nconsumed only 22 percent of the Federal budget in 1963, but by 2003, \ntogether with interest on the national debt, they will account for 72 \npercent of overall Government spending.\n  The report of the Congressional Budget Office entitled ``The Economic \nand Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1996-2000,'' confirms the findings of \nthe Entitlement Commission. It found that nondefense discretionary \nspending has basically not grown at all, as a percentage of GDP, since \n1960. Over that same period, however, the CBO report found that \nentitlement spending has more than doubled.\n  Some might say, however, that looking only at percentages of the \neconomy masks very large spending increases. The actual numbers tell \nmuch the same story. For example, based on CBO's latest estimates, \nFederal spending increased by a total of $70 billion between fiscal \n1994 and fiscal 1995. Ninety-five percent of that increase was\n due to growth in entitlement programs and interest expense. In fact, \nthose two budget areas actually increased by a total of $88 billion, \nwell over the $70 billion net overall increase in Federal spending this \nyear.\n\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that every American has a right to \nknow these budget facts, and that every American has a right to know \nwhat Congress plans to do about them. Yet, it is also very clear that \nthe American people have not been told these facts, either by the media \nor by the Congress or the administration. Instead, the American people \nhave been led to believe, as a recent poll by the Wirthlin Group found, \nthat ``cutting welfare, foreign aid, and `congressional perks''' would \n``do a lot towards balancing the budget.''\n  Most Americans, however, harbor substantial doubts about what they \nknow about the budget. According to a recent memo done for the \nRepublican Conference by the Luntz Research Cos., entitled \n``Communications Strategy for the Upcoming Budget Battle'':\n\n       Again and again, focus group participants complain that \n     they don't have anywhere close to the information on the \n     budget that [Members of Congress] do. Survey respondents \n     always overestimate their knowledge on nearly any subject, \n     and only 22% believe they know either ``a lot'' or ``a good \n     amount'' about the budget process.\n\n  What that means is most Americans know that they are missing a lot of \nimportant information about the budget. Most Americans do not know, for \nexample, that AFDC spending--and I have heard a lot of talk about \nprograms for the poor--in real dollars per beneficiary, is down by \nroughly 40 percent since 1970. Most Americans do not know that foreign \naid is only about 1 percent of the Federal budget, and that the value \nof congressional perks much, much smaller than that. But every American \nhas a right to know these and the myriad other important facts about \nthe budget, and every American has a right to know how Congress plans \nto change the budget if the balanced budget constitutional amendment \nbecomes the law of the land. Americans have a right to know in advance \nso that they can determine whether those plans make sense, whether they \nwill work, who will be affected, and why.\n  There are those who argue against providing details at this point, on \nthe ground that it is somehow premature. Timing, however, did not \nprevent the new House majority from laying out its tax proposals in \ngreat specificity, proposals that the Treasury Department estimates \nwill cost $375 billion over the next 7 years, and increase the size of \nthe budget gap over that period by almost 40 percent.\n  Why is it, Mr. President, that now is the time to be specific about \ntax cuts, but now is not the time to be specific about the changes on \nthe spending side of the equation that will be required to pay for \nthose tax cuts and still balance the budget by the year 2002?\n  Americans have the right to know the specifics. It is time to put \naside talking about waste, fraud, and abuse, and pork barrel spending \nas if the budget could be balanced by eliminating those sins. It is, \ninstead, time to come clean with the American people and tell them what \nbalancing the budget will really mean. I do not say that to suggest \nthat we abandon our efforts to deal with waste, an inefficiency. Far \nfrom it. Tackling those issues must continue to be a priority. But it \nis time to acknowledge reality, and the reality is that dealing with \nwaste, fraud, and abuse is not, and cannot be, in and of itself, a \ncomplete strategy for\n dealing with the budget deficit. It is only a component of a strategy, \nand not even the biggest one.\n\n  It is time to stop diverting the American people's attention from the \nmajor policy options that absolutely must be examined if the budget is \nto be balanced. If we are serious about balancing the budget, if we \nwant to meet our obligation to future generations--and if we want the \nAmerican people to support the tough decisions that will be required--\nthen we have to stop the budget gamesmanship now, and enter a real \npartnership with the American people.\n  The American people need to know the dimensions of the budget \nproblems we face, and what the realistic options are to address those \nproblems. They need to know that it would take a 13-percent across-the-\nboard cut in every Federal program, including Social Security and \nMedicare, to balance the budget by 2002--and that more cuts would be \nneeded thereafter to keep it balanced unless the rate of growth of \nentitlement spending can be cut.\n  They need to know that it would take an 18-percent cut in every other \nprogram but Social Security to balance the budget by 2002, if that \nprogram is taken off the table, and that further cuts would be needed \nin those other programs to keep the budget balanced after 2002. And \nthey need to know that even taking Social Security off the table will \nnot keep Social Security viable in the long run, because that does \nnothing to restore the actuarial balance in that program that the \nSocial Security trustees say is now out of balance. They need to know \nthat we must act to keep Social Security available for future \ngenerations--and that the sooner we act, the easier it is to \naccomplish. And they need to know that maintaining Social Security's \nviability \n[[Page S2292]] can be accomplished without cutting the benefits of any \ncurrent beneficiary by even a nickel.\n  They need to know that it would take a 32-percent cut in all other \nFederal programs, including defense, to balance the budget by the year \n2002, if both Social Security and Medicare are taken off the table--and \nmore cuts in those programs thereafter to keep it balanced, because \nboth Social Security, and particularly Medicare, are growing faster \nthan our economy or Federal revenues. And they need to know that it \nwill take a cut of 36 percent in all other Federal programs if defense \nis also taken off the table.\n  They need to know that it is not the programs benefiting the poorest \nAmericans that are driving the growth of the Federal budget. They need \nto know that the real engines of growth are rapidly rising health care \ncosts, and the fact that the baby boom generation is moving toward \nretirement.\n  Perhaps most of all, they need to know what some of the options for \nbalancing the budget might mean for them. Would the proposed path \ntoward the balanced budget mean rougher roads, or higher subway fares? \nWhat would it mean to their children, to their opportunity to get a \ngood grammar school and high school education, and to their chances to \ngo to college. What will it mean to their ability to buy a home and to \nobtain a mortgage? And what would\n it mean to older Americans who need access to affordable health care? \nWould they face additional gaps in coverage, higher premiums, higher \ndeductibles, or some combination of all of these? Would older Americans \nbe able to choose to pay somewhat more in taxes to keep Medicare \nsolvent, or would the only choice they are offered be private \ninsurance--even if that option were to be more costly. Will COLA's--\ncost of living adjustments--be set based on the facts and the best \nmeasurement of inflation we can make, or will COLA's be determined on a \nmore political basis?\n\n  Americans also want to know whether the result of Federal actions to \nbalance the budget means higher State and local taxes for them. After \nall, the Federal Government currently provides more than 21 percent of \nthe State of Illinois' budget, and provides major support for the \nbudget of towns and cities across my State. An analysis done by the \nTreasury Department at the request of the chairman of the National \nGovernors Association found that across-the-board cuts in Federal \nspending to balance the budget could lead to tax increases in my State \nof over 10 percent--and in some States, the tax hikes necessary to make \ngood the loss of Federal funds could be as much as 25 percent.\n  In the 1970's and the 1980's, both the Presidents and the Congress \nfailed in their obligation to face our long-term budget problems. They \nflinched from making the necessary decisions because those decisions \nwere politically difficult and because it was easier to talk about \nfiscal responsibility, than to act to achieve it. However, if we had \nbalanced the budget in 1980, there would be no need for even a single \ndollar of program cuts this year. The budget would actually be in \nsurplus. Dealing with the rapid cost increases in Medicare and Medicaid \nwould be much easier than it will be now. The Government would have a \nfar greater ability to act to address problems that need our attention, \nbecause it would not be spending over $200 billion a year just on debt \nservice.\n  The failures of the 1980's brought us to where we are now, and those \nfailures make the job of restoring fiscal discipline more difficult \nnow. The lesson of that failure is that we cannot afford further delay. \nThat is why I was critical of the President's budget that was released \nyesterday It avoids facing our budget problems. It avoids telling the \nAmerican people the truth about those budget problems, and what it will \ntake to solve them. It does not meet the responsibilities that \nleadership entails.\n  But the fact that the President did not act aggressively does not \nlessen the responsibility of the Congress to act, particularly when \nCongress is attempting to add a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. We must begin to act--now--whether there is a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment or not.\n  And that is the real importance of the right-to-know amendment. It \nproperly focuses attention where it absolutely must be focused--on the \ndecisions involved in implementing a constitutional amendment--on what \nis\n involved in turning the promise of a balanced budget into a reality. \nThe work is not done if and when the balanced budget amendment becomes \na part of the Constitution, and the truth is that the real work cannot \nwait until a constitutional amendment is ratified.\n\n  The ongoing Mexican financial situation gives us a glimpse of the \nfuture if we do not tell the truth to the American people about or \nbudget problems and get their help in beginning to solve them now. \nMexico was financing economic growth with foreign capital, and was \ntherefore vulnerable to a loss of confidence. The result of that loss \nof confidence is creating economic recession in Mexico, and real \nhardship for millions of Mexicans.\n  The United States economy is much larger and stronger, and much more \nresilient than Mexico's. We do not face the same kind of sudden \ncollapse. But the U.S. national savings rate has been declining for \nmany years now. We are financing an increasing portion of our \nGovernment debt, and private economic investment with foreign capital. \nAnd the result will likely be every-higher interest rates in the United \nStates, and increasing pressure on the incomes of most Americans, if we \ndo not begin to act now. On the other hand, if we do begin to move \ntoward a balanced budget, OMB Director Alice Rivlin, in her ``Big \nChoices'' memo, tells us that we can turn the anemic 3.7-percent \nnational savings rate into a 6.1-percent savings rate by the year 2000. \nAnd that higher national savings rate would mean more opportunity and a \nbrighter future for our children--and their children.\n  As important as it is to our futures, and our country's future, to \nrestore discipline to the Federal budget--to balance the budget--how we \nget to that balance makes a difference. Some options work better for \nthe American people than others. How we choose to get to a balanced \nbudget makes a big difference.\n  The right-to-know amendment ensures that every American has the \nopportunity to get a good, hard look at the plans for balancing the \nbudget, and, indeed, at all of the available options. It takes the \nabstractions involved in the balanced budget amendment, and makes them \nconcrete and real.\n  The right-to-know amendment calls on Congress to meet its obligation \nto American democracy. It is nothing less than a recognition of our \nfundamental moral responsibility to our country, because it seeks to \nensure that the American people have the information they need to be \nable to meet their own responsibilities as Americans.\n  No one can make good decisions without good information. In a \ndemocracy, that means not only must Congress and the President have \ngood information, but so must the American people. For that reason \nalone, it should have universal support in this Senate. It is the only \nway to demonstrate that Congress is serious about wanting to balance \nthe budget, that Congress wants the American people to be real partners \nin the decisions required to make that happen, and that Congress is \ncommitted to doing what is right--telling the whole budget truth to the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I ask if the Senator will yield for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have 12 minutes and two additional statements.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I conclude by saying, Mr. President, the balanced \nbudget amendment is going to require some real hard decisions by all of \nus, decisions that will affect our States, decisions that will affect \nour constituencies, and it seems to me that we have an obligation to \ntell the truth beforehand so people get a sense of exactly how this \nwill work.\n  Taking Social Security off the table, taking Medicaid off the table, \ntaking defense off the table, doing the kinds of changes that will come \nup in amendments after we get past this one, will, I think, require \nsome hard decisions. It seems to me that with the right-to-know-\namendment the people will have \n[[Page S2293]] the truth. They can evaluate our actions more accurately \nand more effectively. They can hold us accountable for what we do.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Mr. President, at the outset of this debate, I observed that Members \nof the Senate divided into three distinct groups in connection with the \nproposal now before us.\n  The first was those who believe that the present budget and financial \nsystem of the Government of the United States is broken, broken \nseriously and requires major surgery in order to fix it. The evidence \nwhich we, a majority, in this body have cited is the fact that in 30 \nyears we have had but one balanced budget. In the last 20 years, the \ntotal debt has multiplied by more than 10 times to almost $5 trillion, \na tremendous burden on the people of the United States of America; that \neven at the present time, at a time of relative prosperity, we are \nrunning deficits of $200 billion a year, adding that amount to our \ntotal debt. The cure, it is the belief of the substantial majority of \nthe Members of this body, is the balanced budget amendment in the form \nin which it passed the House of Representatives.\n  The second group in this debate are those who claim allegiance to the \nconcept of a balanced budget but not in this fashion, not through the \nprovision for such a budget in the Constitution of the United States.\n  Now, I believe that the overwhelming challenge to that second group \nis if not this way, what way? What indicates to them in the history of \nthe last 30 or 40 years that either a President of the United States or \na Congress of the United States without any external discipline \nwhatsoever will change the course of action of several decades and work \ntoward a balanced budget without external discipline?\n  So far, this second group has been quite silent about what there is \nthat has so profoundly changed in America that we will now get what we \nhave lacked over the course of the last 30 years. In fact, it seems to \nme that it is more the duty of that group to show us how they would \nreach the goal than it is of those who believe that a constitutional \namendment is necessary and who are the subject of the demands in this \nmotion by the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Third, of course, is the group that does not believe in a balanced \nbudget at all, who feel that the present, the status quo is perfectly \nappropriate. There are relatively few in number in this body who \ncandidly advocate that position but one certainly can credit their \ncandidness. Probably a number of those in the second group really fall \ninto the third group with the balanced budget as a low priority or no \npriority at all.\n  That third group, however, got a wonderful new recruit on Monday. On \nMonday, the President of the United States, William Clinton, joined \nthem by presenting to us a budget with a $200 billion deficit and \nprojections that are very optimistic from the perspective of inflation \nand economic growth, projections that never bring the budget deficit to \nsignificantly less than $200 billion a year, with a deficit that \nincreases after the turn of the century, so that another $1.5 trillion \nwill be added to the debt. That budget, that Presidential budget is the \nbest single advertisement for the passage of this constitutional \namendment in its original form.\n  The Daschle motion, the motion of the distinguished Democratic \nleader, is designed to justify doing nothing, to retain the status quo. \nI cannot imagine that any of its proponents really believe we ought to \ninclude in the Constitution of the United States two pages of detailed \ninstructions which will become irrelevant if the constitutional \namendment is actually passed. They cannot believe it.\n  But beyond the inappropriateness of putting such language in the \nConstitution of the United States is the unconstitutionality of the \nmotion itself because our Constitution tells us that this Congress \npasses proposed constitutional amendments which are then submitted to \nthe States for their ratification. Under the Daschle motion, no such \nthing will happen. The submission to the States is conditioned upon \nCongress passing a series of laws before that submission takes place.\n  The Daschle motion is, therefore, not only bad policy, not only bad \naesthetics by putting terrible language in the Constitution of the \nUnited States, it is itself blatantly unconstitutional.\n  Both for reasons of policy and for reasons of constitutionality, the \nDaschle motion should be decisively and swiftly tabled so we can move \non to a debate over the merits of the constitutional proposal itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending resolution \nto amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget.\n  I have not always supported the balanced budget amendment. When this \nmeasure was considered by the Senate in 1982 and again in 1986, I felt \nthat Congress could and would address deficits without the aid of a \nconstitutional amendment. Several years ago, however, I realized that I \nhad overestimated Congress' ability to deal responsibly with the \nbudget. We have not balanced the budget in 25 years.\n  When it came time for the tough spending cuts ordered by the Gramm-\nRudman deficit reduction law, Congress did not have the will to follow \nthrough. So in 1992, for the first time I supported a balanced budget \namendment in the Senate.\n  Public debt is not inherently bad. It was both necessary and wise for \nthe Federal Government to borrow heavily during World War II. In the \nthree decades following the war, the United States gradually paid down \nthis debt. Beginning in the 1970's and worsening in the 1980's, \nhowever, the Federal Government reversed this trend by borrowing more \nand more to pay for current expenses. The huge deficits we have been \nrunning for the past 15 years have not been to finance public \ninvestments that will yield benefits in the future. We have been \nborrowing primarily to pay for current consumption. We're not borrowing \nto build roads; we're borrowing to put gas in the car.\n  Contrary to popular belief, Congress is never faced with the option \nof raising taxes or borrowing money to finance Government. Spending can \nonly be paid for through taxes--it is simply a question of whether we \nraise taxes today or tomorrow. Borrowing invariably means that future \ngenerations will face a heavier tax burden. In fact, the Office of \nManagement and Budget last year published an analysis of the growing \ntax burden. The report forecast that, without changes in Federal law, \nthe average net tax rate for future generations would eventually reach \n82 percent of their lifetime earnings. Clearly, such a tax burden would \nbe unacceptable.\n  The real harm caused by Government borrowing is that it draws down \nthe pool of savings available for investment. Rising standards of \nliving are possible only through investments in infrastructure, in \nplants and equipment, and in education. Savings by American families \nand businesses provide the capital for these investments. But deficits \ndraw down, or crowd out, the national pool of savings. This year, for \ninstance, the first $200 billion in savings will not go to investments \nin new plants and equipment but to feed the deficit.\n  As more and more of our savings are devoured by the deficit, \ninvestments for the future decline--and with them, the rate of economic \ngrowth in the country.\n  So the deficit is a double hit on future generations. We are not only \nasking them to finance our current spending; we are handicapping their \nability to meet this obligation--by crowding out investments for the \nfuture. We are not only eating their seed corn, we are asking them to \npick up the dinner check.\n  This travesty simply must end. As nearly every economist in the \ncountry \n[[Page S2294]] agrees, the surest way to increase investment in the \nfuture is to cut the deficit. And, the surest way to cut the deficit is \nto pass the balanced budget amendment. All other remedies have failed.\n  Repeated deficits have done serious damage not only to the economy \nbut to Congress' standing with the public. The low esteem in which \nCongress is held is directly related to our fiscal irresponsibility. \nFor the sake of the integrity of this institution, we cannot continue \nto promise the American people long-term deficit reduction and do \nlittle about it. Actions do speak louder than words.\n  We have tried every conceivable legislative option to force a more \nresponsible budget policy. With few exceptions, these efforts have \nfailed. A constitutional amendment appears to be the only solution \nleft. As others have said, it may be a bad idea but one whose time has \ncome.\n  Amending the Constitution should not be proposed lightly. It is a \nvery serious matter. However, the balanced budget amendment is \nconsistent with the historic role of the Federal constitution in \nsafeguarding the rights of those who may be under-represented in the \npolitical process. In this case the under-represented individuals are \nfuture generations who are being asked to pay for our profligacy.\n  Numerous arguments have been made in opposition to the balanced \nbudget amendment. Some have argued that the balanced budget amendment \nis a gimmick that will not work, while at the same time arguing that it \nwill wreak havoc by imposing draconian cuts. The balanced budget \namendment is neither a gimmick nor a merciless ax hanging over all \nFederal programs--and it is certainly not both.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not an easy political vote. The easy \nvotes have been the routine ones to spend beyond our means. The \nproposed amendment will not--with certainty--end deficit spending, but \nit will undoubtedly make it more difficult.\n  When the 1990 budget agreement required a supermajority to exceed \nannual caps in discretionary spending, no one argued that the \nsupermajority requirement was a gimmick. It was recognized as an \nessential step toward fiscal responsibility. When all the smoke is \ncleared on the balanced budget debate, it is undeniable that deficits \nwill be harder to continue under a constitutional amendment. If you \nwant to make it more difficult for Congress and the President to pass \nthe tax bill on to future generations, you should support the balance \nbudget amendment.\n  The amendment does not tie Congress' hand to the point that it could \nnot respond to a national crisis. With the approval of three-fifths of \nthe Congress, deficits would be permitted. In times of war or dire \neconomic circumstances, three-fifths of the Members of the Congress can \nbe expected to recognize the need for deficit spending.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has too often viewed deficits not as a \nnecessary tool in dire circumstances but as a\n convenient way to spend beyond our means. We have turned the exception \ninto the rule and have become hooked on deficit spending. It has been \neasier to reach for the deficit brew than to abstrain and act \nresponsibility. The practical effect of the balanced budget amendment \nwill be to put this elixir a little higher on the shelf and further out \nof Congress' reach.\n\n  In closing, I would like to make three points that I think put this \ndebate into context.\n  First, 37 States have balanced budget amendments. Complying with \nthese requirements is not always convenient. But over the long term, \nforcing governments to balance their budgets promotes good and \ndisciplined government.\n  Second, the fact that taxpayers are willing to finance only $1.4 \ntrillion of the $1.6 trillion worth of current Government services, \nbegs the question of whether the public really wants as much Government \nas currently exists.\n  Last, we should not lose sight of the fact that there is no free \nlunch here. Every dollar the Government borrows is a dollar unavailable \nfor job-creating investment in the private sector. Also, every dollar \nthe Government borrows today is a dollar tomorrow's taxpayers will have \nto repay. At its most basic level the balanced budget amendment stands \nfor the simple principle that we should pay today for the Government we \nuse today. If we are unwilling to put the money on the barrel \nourselves, by what right can we ask future generations to put their \nmoney on the barrel?\n  The balanced budget amendment offers the best hope of ending the \nfiscal child abuse in which we have been engaged. The bruises may not \nshow right now, but the pain is going to last a lifetime. We owe it to \nour children and their children to balance the budget. I have no \nillusions that this will be an easy task, but if we do not in earnest \nset this as our goal and accept it as our responsibility, it will never \nhappen. The debate today is not about how do we get there, it is about \nwhere are we going.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said that whenever one generation spends money \nand taxes another to pay for it, it is squandering futurity on a \nmassive scale. Let us end this squandering and pass the balanced budget \namendment now before our task becomes even more difficult.\n  Mr. President, now let me speak briefly about the pending amendment, \nthe so-called right-to-know amendment.\n  The word ``gimmick'' has been thrown around here quite a bit in this \ndebate, with the opponents of the balanced budget amendment arguing it \nis simply a gimmick rather than a serious effort to balance the budget. \nI respectfully suggest if there is a gimmick stalking the Chambers \nthese days, it is the so-called right-to-know amendment. It is designed \nto kill the balanced budget amendment and nothing else. Some of its \nprincipal sponsors supported the balanced budget amendment last year, \nand there was no mention on their part of a right to know at that time. \nCuriously, suddenly it has emerged.\n  Any one of us can produce a balanced budget plan by the year 2002. \nIndeed, some of us have. I joined last year with Senators Danforth, \nBoren and Johnston, to offer the only bipartisan alternative to the \nPresident's budget. Our plan called for cutting spending on the basis \nof $2 for every $1 in taxes. It was a serious and detailed plan. \nUnfortunately, it gathered more critical acclaim from the Concord \nCoalition and others than it did from Members of the Chamber.\n  But the issue pending before the Senate is not how we are going to \nget somewhere. It is about where we are going. Are we truly committed \nto balancing the budget? If so, let us take the first step by passing \nthis amendment. The process of figuring out how we achieve the goal is \ngoing to be difficult. Everyone in the Chamber understands just how it \nis that no serious debate can take place in an atmosphere of partisan \nsniping, where one side is trying to score points through fear \nmongering, by saying the other side is trying to attack Social Security \nor veterans or some other group.\n  Three years ago, Senators Nunn and Domenici offered a plan to cap \nentitlement spending the way we already cap discretionary spending. I \nsupported it. Unfortunately, there were only 28 votes in favor of that \napproach.\n  A second-degree amendment was offered by the Democratic leader to \nexempt veterans' programs. It was effective. Very few Senators wanted \nto vote against that amendment. It was effective in terms of short-term \npolitics, but it served to underscore what is wrong with Congress and \nwhy the American people are basically fed up with Washington. Every \nthinking person who has looked at the Federal Government knows \nentitlement reform is the key to any serious deficit reduction, yet the \npolitical fires are stoked to the point where no one dares to discuss \nopenly what we know privately to be essential--entitlement reform.\n  During the debate on the Nunn-Domenici plan, we were told, do not \nundertake broad entitlement reform, that is really not where the \nproblem is. The problem is with health care spending. We need health \ncare reform.\n  After a year of debate in this Chamber, after the President submitted \nhis 1,435-page proposal for health care reform, the best that could be \nsaid was that it was deficit neutral. Yet before we were told, ``Wait \nuntil we get to health care reform, that is where the savings are, \nforget about entitlement reform,'' and when the plan finally came up it \nwas at best deficit neutral. It certainly did not reduce the deficit.\n  [[Page S2295]] It is a mistake both in terms of politics and policy. \nThe atmosphere around here has become so poisoned that honest debate \nhas become nearly prohibited, and that is neither in the country's nor \nthe Senate's best interest.\n  The President's budget calls for $200 billion in deficits as far as \nthe eye can see. We all understand why it does not call for a long list \nof specific cuts, because he would be attacked, just as Republicans are \nwhen we produce lists of spending cuts. We need an environment like the \none Chief Justice Earl Warren sought when the Supreme Court took up the \ncase of Brown v. Board of Education, dealing with racial segregation in \npublic schools. The Chief Justice, knowing this would be a landmark and \ncontroversial case in the country's race relations, first sought an \nagreement among the Justices for unanimity in their decision. He did \nnot want such an important decision to be decided by a split Court.\n  I have no illusion that the Members of Congress could unanimously \nagree on a difficult deficit reduction package, but I do think we ought \nto learn from Chief Justice Warren's approach in terms of securing an \natmosphere where debate can be undertaken without fear of being \npunished for candor. The budget deficit is rivaled only by the candor \ndeficit. Until we can openly discuss these issues without fear of \ncharges of heresy, is any serious progress ever going to be made? The \nbalanced budget amendment is necessary to create that atmosphere, and I \nurge my colleagues to reject the attempt to subvert and derail this \neffort by the so-called right-to-know amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the remaining 11 minutes to the \nSenator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do I understand the Senator from Connecticut desires \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts. I will ask for just 2 minutes, if that is \nappropriate, if the Chair will notify me so I do not eat into the time \nof the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the right-to-know amendment offered \nby the distinguished Senate minority leader, Senator Daschle.\n  The first headline to greet me yesterday morning was ``Republicans \nVow Leadership They Say Clinton's Budget Lacks.''\n  Mr. President, I look forward to their leadership on this vitally \nimportant matter. We have not seen any yet, but I am sure it is right \naround the corner.\n  I look forward to providing as much scrutiny of Republican deficit \nreduction efforts as has been accorded to the President's efforts. To \nmy Republican friends, I say it is time to see your cuts. The 104th \nCongress has now been in session for 36 days, and we have yet to see \nany specific cuts.\n\n\n                           the Clinton record\n\n  Twenty-seven days after President Clinton assumed office he submitted \na detailed budget plan that contained more than $500 billion in deficit \nreduction. He did not say ``I want to see the Republicans plan first.'' \nInstead he did what he was elected to do--he led.\n  He made difficult and painful choices. The choices were so hard, in \nfact, that not a single Republican Member supported his deficit \nreduction initiative. The House Budget Committee chairman, \nRepresentative John Kasich, proposed an alternative plan that cut the \ndeficit by $15 billion less than the President's plan.\n  Despite the doom and gloom predictions of our Republican colleagues, \nthe President's plan has substantially reduced the deficit and helped \nthe economy. President Clinton has reversed the trend of the Reagan/\nBush era. Then the national debt was growing faster than the economy. \nNow the economy is growing faster than the debt. And the combined rates \nof unemployment and inflation have reached a 25-year low.\n\n\n                              Health care\n\n  Last year, the President exercised considerable leadership again by \ntackling the principle cause of rising deficits, skyrocketing health \ncare costs. The President offered a comprehensive plan to reform our \nhealth care system and contain rising health care costs that are \nfueling deficit growth. Forty percent of the increase in spending is \ndue to increasing medical costs.\n  Last February, CBO reported that:\n\n       Once the administration's proposal was fully implemented, \n     it would significantly reduce the projected growth of \n     national health expenditures *  *  * from 2000 on national \n     health expenditures would fall below the baseline by \n     increasing amounts. By 2004, CBO projects that total spending \n     for health would be $150 billion--or 7 percent--below where \n     it would be if current policies and trends continued.\n\n  Unfortunately, the President's efforts were thwarted.\n  The President remains committed to reining in rising health care \ncosts and reforming our system in a comprehensive manner. Health care, \nhowever, is not even mentioned in the Contract With America.\n\n\n                        fiscal year 1996 budget\n\n  On Monday, the President submitted his 1996 budget and recommended an \nadditional $81 billion in deficit reduction. That savings, and the \nPresident's tax cuts, are fully funded with specific spending cuts.\n\n\n                         republican leadership\n\n  Mr. President, we have heard much from our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle about their desire to achieve significant \naccomplishments in the first 100 days of this session. We are now 36 \ndays into that benchmark and we have yet to see the Republicans \nspending cut plans.\n  We have heard much talk, and seen very little action. The GOP has \nreversed the advice of a great Republican leader, Theodore Roosevelt. \nInstead of speaking softly, and carrying a big stick, they are shouting \nloudly and carrying a fig leaf. A constitutional amendment provides \ntheir cover.\n  Congressman Kasich said recently, ``You can't have people who are \nafraid to break china when you've got to go at this with a \nsledgehammer.''\n  Let us see what the sledgehammer will produce.\n\n\n                        right-to-know amendment\n\n  Mr. President, that is the purpose of this amendment. It is no more \nand no less than a truth in budget advertising amendment. It says \nsimply that we must be honest with the American people.\n  Before we pass a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, \nwe should tell the American people how we intend to accomplish this \ntask. I cannot imagine this effort being at all controversial anywhere \nbut Washington, DC. It simply says if you are going to talk the talk of \nbalanced budgets, you have to walk the walk of how you get there. So \nfar, that is exactly what is not happening.\n\n\n                          Reneging on promises\n\n  Several weeks ago, in response to President Clinton's demand that any \ntax cuts be deficit neutral, our Republican colleagues promised that \nspending cuts would precede tax cuts. The message was clear: Before we \npass broad new benefits, we must assure the American public that they \nwill be paid for. This promise has since been abandoned to concerns of \nkneebuckling constituents.\n\n\n                       More promises--no details\n\n  The Contract With America promises to balance the budget by 2002. CBO \nestimates that this will cost $1.2 trillion over 7 years.\n  The contract also promises $200 billion in tax cuts over 5 years, and \n$700 billion in cuts over 10 years. Fifty percent of the tax cuts, I \nmight add, would benefit Americans with incomes in excess of $100,000 a \nyear.\n  Before attempting to pay for these promises, the GOP proposes to take \nmore than half the budget off the table. Republicans want to increase \ndefense spending and remove Social Security, while at the same time \ncontinuing to pay interest on the debt. Less than half the budget would \nthen remain on the chopping block.\n  Removing these items would require a 30-percent across-the-board \nreduction in everything else.\n  That means a 30-percent across-the-board cut in: Violent crime \nprograms, veterans pensions, Medicare benefits, child nutrition, \nheadstart, health programs, low-income energy assistance, \n     [[Page S2296]]  student loans, research and development, and \n     so forth.\n  Let us analyze further for a moment what these cuts may well mean in \nhuman terms:\n  A 30-percent across-the-board could mean:\n  A $5,175 increase in Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket costs for \nseniors.\n  An elimination of nursing home coverage or optional services like \nhome care and prescription drugs.\n   Some 6.6 million less children with health care coverage through the \nMedicaid Program.\n  A drop of a third in NIH biomedical research grants severely impeding \nresearch on cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and other illnesses.\n  Veterans disabled in their service to our country could expect their \naverage monthly benefit check to decline from $819 to $574.\n  A middle-class family relying on Government loans to send a child to \ncollege could owe over $3,000 in additional interest.\n  As many as 3,000 teachers could lose their jobs, dramatically \nincreasing class sizes.\n  Over 200,000 American families could lose the child care subsidies \nthat enable parents to work or attend school.\n  Approximately 1.8 million households could lose the Federal \nassistance that enables them to pay their heating bills during the \nwinter.\n  Over 150,000 jobs could be lost through cuts in highway funds.\n  Almost 2 million pregnant women and young children could lose infant \nformula and other nutrition supplements.\n  Over 30 million meals on wheels for homebound seniors might not be \ndelivered.\n  Over 38 million means might not be served at seniors centers.\n  The average interval between inspections of food manufacturing \nfacilities could increase from 6 to 11 years.\n  Over 200,000 dislocated workers could be denied retraining and job \nreplacement services; 40,000 violations of workplace safety regulations \nuncovered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration could \nremain uncorrected.\n  Mr. President, it is clearly impossible to achieve significant \ndeficit reduction without pain.\n  That is the whole point of this amendment. Before we promise to \nbalance the budget, and enact new tax cuts, the American public \ndeserves to know exactly what kind of pain to expect.\n  The President has revealed his cuts. Democratic members have made \npainful choices and tough votes. It is time for the Republicans to \nreveal how they intend to fulfill their own promises.\n\n\n                               No details\n\n  On spending cuts, the Republicans are essentially saying to each \nother, like Connie Chung, ``Whisper it, just between you and me.'' They \ndo not want a serious debate by an informed public of all the \nimplications of this constitutional amendment.\n  It is true that 80 percent of the American public supports a balanced \nbudget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as long as it remains a \nslogan or a simple statement of principle. But what happens to that 80 \npercent figure when people are presented with various spending cut \noptions?\n  A Washington Post-ABC news poll is telling:\n  Only 59 percent still support the balanced budget amendment if it \nwould mean cuts in welfare or public assistance to the poor.\n  Only 56 percent still support it if it would mean cuts in defense.\n  Only 37 percent still support it if it would means cuts in education.\n  Only 34 percent still support it if it would mean cuts in Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. President, before we amend the fundamental charter of our Nation, \nthe U.S. Constitution, we must be open and frank with the American \npeople about our plans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to inform the \nelectorate of the important budgetary choices this body intends to make \nin the years ahead.\n  Let me briefly say it is no secret to my colleagues here that I am \nopposed to this amendment to the Constitution. My intention would be to \nvote against all amendments that are offered to it. This amendment, \nhowever, I think, deserves support. It simply asks us to know what I \nthink most persons would like to know: Before their Congressmen or \nSenators vote on something as significant and profound as to change the \norganic law of the country into which we will incorporate economic \ntheory--and it is always open to speculation and guesswork in such an \norganic law--to have some idea as to how this is all going to be \nachieved.\n  It is, as one would enter into contract negotiations--since that is a \nsubject of some heated debate now in this city, between baseball owners \nand players--as if someone would suggest: Look, sign the contract. We \nwill talk about the details afterwards.\n  You would be ridiculed if you made such a proposal.\n  Here, what we are merely suggesting is that as we go down this road, \nwhich will incorporate for the first time a real straitjacket into the \nConstitution of the United States, what are the implications of this? \nWhat does it mean to people out there who pay the taxes and fund all \nthese programs? They, it seems to me, are really the ones who have a \nright to know how their tax dollars will be used or not used in the \nfuture.\n  The suggestion, somehow, their knees would buckle if they knew \nbecause it is painful is no reason to reject the desire to find out \nexactly how this is going to work. And for that reason I strongly \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the proposed balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, because it is unnecessary and unwise to write \na balanced budget requirement into the Constitution.\n  It is obvious why the Republican majority has scheduled consideration \nof the balanced budget amendment now, so early in this new Congress.\n  The Republican majority wants to pass the constitutional amendment \nbefore more pressure builds for them to explain how they would achieve \nthe balance. The more the American people understand this leap-before-\nyou-look strategy, the less the people like it.\n  The House Republican majority leader has already admitted to this \nstrategy. Congressman Armey, a strong supporter of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, said that if Members of Congress know what it \ntakes to comply with the requirement, ``their knees will buckle.'' He \nalso is reported to have said that ``putting together a detailed list \nbeforehand would make passing the balanced budget amendment virtually \nimpossible.''\n  Instead of devoting the time and effort to craft a responsible \nbudget, the Republican majority asks us to amend the Constitution now, \nask questions later. But the Constitution has served this Nation \nthrough wars, economic depressions, and other crises far worse than the \ncurrent budget deficit. Amending the Constitution should be the \nconsidered option of last resort, not the expedient course of first \nresort.\n  For that reason, I commend Senator Daschle's amendment to insure that \nthe constitutional amendment will not take effect unless Congress first \npasses a resolution specifying in detail how the budget would be \nbalanced by 2002. The American people and their elected representatives \nin the State legislatures have a fundamental right to know how this \nconstitutional amendment would affect their lives.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a total of $1.2 \ntrillion in deficit reduction will be required to balance the budget by \nthe year 2002. And that total does not include the tax cuts called for \nby the Republican Contact With America, which would raise the total of \ncuts required to $1.5 trillion.\n  If Social Security, defense, and interest on the national debt are \nexcluded from the deficit-cutting calculations, all other Federal \nprograms will have to be cut by 22 percent to achieve a balanced budget \nin 2002. And if the tax cuts in the Contract With America are included, \nall other Federal programs will have to be cut by 30 percent. That's a \n30-percent cut in spending on Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, \nstudent loans, farm benefits, and all other Federal programs.\n  The American people have a right to know if that is how the \nRepublican majority will balance the budget.\n   [[Page S2297]] Across-the-board 30-percent cuts would have a \ndisastrous impact on children, the elderly, and hard-working familes \nthroughout the United States. Here are just a few examples:\n  Over 220,000 children would be unable to enroll in Head Start early \nchildhood programs.\n  Over 200,000 families would lose the child care subsidies that enable \nparents to work or attend school.\n  And 1.9 million students would lose the opportunity for remedial \neducation through title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n  Also, 3,000 teachers would lose their jobs, dramatically incresing \nclass sizes in many school districts.\n  To achieve the necessary cuts, the House Budget Committee has already \nproposed that the Federal Government should stop paying the interest on \nstudent loans while students are in college or professional school. \nMiddle-class students on the full available amount of such loans would \nowe over $3,000 in additional interest at the end of 4 years of \ncollege. Instead of $17,000 in loans to pay back, they would have to \npay back over $20,000.\n  The challenge that we are facing in higher education is not how we \nare going to raise the burden on middle-income families to send their \nchildren to school, but how we are going to dampen that burden, lessen \nthat burden, so that their young members of their family are going to \nbe able to go to school. The fact, even as we are here this morning, is \nthat efforts are being made within the Republican Budget Committee and \nby the Republican chair of the Appropriations Committee to raise the \ncost of those loans significantly for future years.\n  If those same needy students were to attend medical school and \ncontinue to borrow the full amount available, they would owe over \n$16,000 in additional interest at the end of medical school. A debt \nthat would be $51,000 under current law would climb to a debt of \n$67,000.\n  If Pell grants are slashed by 30 percent, eligible students would \nreceive a maximum of $1,560, a fraction of the $8,000 it now costs to \nattend many State universities. Many students could not even afford \ncommunity college at this reduced level of support.\n  What we have seen in the 1980's to 1992 is a dramatic shift from the \ngrant programs for the children of working families to go to schools \nand colleges which they were qualified to go to and to which they \nwanted to go--three-quarters for the grants and one-quarter for the \nloan. Now it is three-quarters for the loan and one-quarter for the \ngrant.\n  Now the Republicans are talking about increasing the costs of those \nparticular loans and indenturing young sons and daughters of working \nfamilies for years to come. That will only be increased dramatically \nwith a balanced budget amendment.\n  If the cut is achieved by reducing the number of students receiving \nPell grants rather than the amount of the grant, 1.1 million students \nwould fail to receive the Federal aid they need to attend college.\n  Senior citizens would face drastically higher medical bills. Medicare \nbeneficiaries would pay an additional $1,320 more in premiums and out \nof pocket costs.\n  Monthly benefits for disabled veterans would drop from $819 to $574 a \nmonth.\n  A 30-percent cut in Federal support for biomedical research would \nreduce the number of annual research project grants awarded by the \nNational Institutes of Health from 6,000 to 4,200. This cut would \nseverely damage research on cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and other \nillnesses affecting millions of Americans. The promising current effort \nto identify a genetic basis for diabetes would be set back.\n  The greatest opportunity for breakthroughs that we have had in the \nhistory of this country is out at the NIH. There is a difficulty, even \nwith the administration getting an additional $500 million for \nadditional grants. More than 90 Nobel laureates won because of NIH \nsupport over the history of the NIH with extraordinary opportunities \nfor breakthroughs in cancer and many other diseases that affect \nfamilies all across this country.\n  The effect of a balanced budget amendment, in cutting back what is \ncalled discretionary funds--we are not talking about exempting NIH. No; \nno. We are talking about cutting discretionary funds, whatever that \nmeans. Make no mistake about it. You are talking about cutting NIH; you \nare cutting cancer research; you are cutting heart disease research; \nand you are cutting AIDS research. That is going to be a direct result \nwith a balanced budget amendment.\n  Why not give us the opportunity to find out from those that support a \nbalanced budget amendment whether they are going to include the NIH? \nLet us have a debate on it. What is wrong with that? Why not say: Are \nyou going to include NIH, or are you going to be willing to cut back on \nother kinds of spending? Or, do you want to enhance some fees in terms \nof other parts of the country, mining fees or grazing fees? But we are \ndenied that opportunity, and the Daschle amendment would require that \nkind of a factor.\n  Approximately 1.8 million households would lose the Federal \nassistance that enables them to pay their heating bills during the \nwinter. Alternatively, the assistance available to all eligible \nhouseholds would be cut to only $120 each year, barely enough to pay a \nsingle month's bill.\n  Nearly a quarter million senior citizens who rely on the Meals on \nWheels Program for their nutrition would be denied that assistance. \nThere are some 32,000 seniors every single day who get Meals on Wheels \nin my State of Massachusetts. You are talking about cutting thousands \noff of that particular list. Over 700,000 senior citizens who benefit \nfrom the congregate meals program would lose that assistance. Large \nnumbers of these senior citizens, unable to feed themselves, would no \nlonger be able to live at home and would be placed into institutions.\n  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would be able to \ncarry out 12,000 fewer inspections each year. Some 40,000 violations of \nworkplace safety regulations that OSHA uncovered last year might remain \nuncorrected. A similar number of violations uncovered by the Mine \nSafety and Health Administration might remain uncorrected.\n  Over 200,000 dislocated workers would be denied retraining and job \nplacement services. An additional 200,000 teenagers seeking summer jobs \nwould be refused that opportunity.\n  The average number of food inspections by the Food and Drug \nAdministration would fall from 10,000 to 7,000.\n  The average interval between inspections of food manufacturing \nfacilities would go from 6 years to 11 years. The average frequency of \nblood bank inspections would decrease from once every 2 years to once \nevery 3 years.\n  The process for reviewing new pharmaceutical products would lengthen \nfrom approximately 20 months to 30 months initially, and get longer as \nthe backlog carries over from year to year.\n  Those are but a few of the examples of the impact of the 30-percent \nacross-the-board cut in Federal spending that would be required under \nthe Republican proposal for a balanced Federal budget by 2002.\n  If that is what the Republican majority have in mind to comply with \nthe proposed constitutional amendment, the American people have a right \nto know it.\n  The Treasury Department has also estimated the impact of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment on the States.\n  An across-the-board deficit reduction package that excluded Social \nSecurity and defense would require cuts in Federal grants to States of \n$97.8 billion and cuts of an additional $242.1 billion in other Federal \nspending that directly benefits State residents.\n We can ask whether the States have a full understanding and awareness \nof this as they begin this debate.\n\n  According to the Treasury Department, State taxes would have to \nincrease an average of 17.3 percent, just to offset the loss of Federal \ngrants.\n  If that will be the impact of the proposed constitutional amendment, \nthen the States have a right to know it.\n  Asking the States and the American people to support this proposed \nconstitutional amendment without telling them what it means is bumper \nsticker politics at its worst. The American people deserve facts, not \nslogans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the right-to-know amendment. Sunshine \nis \n[[Page S2298]] the best disinfectant. It is understandable that the \nRepublican majority prefers to keep Congress and the country in the \ndark about this proposal. But if it cannot stand the light of day, it \ndoes not deserve to pass.\n  We have the election of Republicans, and they have leadership \npositions in the House and Senate of the United States. I hope that at \nleast they would feel honor bound to be able to describe to the \ninstitutions and the American people what their vision is in terms of a \nbalanced budget.\n  That is all this amendment does. If we are going to have a balanced \nbudget, why not let the American people understand exactly what is \ngoing to be involved, both at the Federal level and at the State level? \nThis particular amendment would give that kind of information to the \nAmerican people. I think the amendment is flawed without this \namendment.\n  I hope that the amendment will be agreed to.\n  I yield back whatever time remains.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to my dear colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, and almost everyone, I think, knows of my affection \nfor him. But we know what is going to happen if we do not do this \nbalanced budget amendment. He and his friends are going to continue to \nspend us blind, which is what they have been doing for most of the last \n60 years.\n  The fact of the matter is everyone knows that this country is in real \ntrouble and they know who has basically put the Great Society programs \ninto effect, many of which, if not all of which, were well-\nintentioned--they know who has caused the entitlements to grow to now. \nIf you put interest in the entitlements, which it should be, 72 percent \nof the total Federal budget, it is running out of control. And if you \nadd in the factor that most of them do not support any type of fiscal \ndiscipline to bring the Federal Government into some sort of a balance, \nand now they come to us and say: Well, now that you have the balanced \nbudget amendment on the floor, you ought to tell us how you are going \nto do it, knowing that we have all kinds of plans already on the \nboards, some of which I agree with and some of which I do not, but \nnevertheless budgets that would get us to balance without the draconian \n30-percent cut that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is \ntalking about, this 30-percent cut across the board that my friend from \nMassachusetts has been presenting is highly exaggerated.\n  Congress could adopt many types of these plans or parts of these \nplans into a consolidated whole, if they want to, and we can reach a \nbalanced budget without cutting 30 percent across the board. In fact, I \ndo not think anybody would argue against that provision.\n  But while we have been talking here in the Congress--we are now in \nour 10th day since we started this--our balanced budget debt track we \nreach each day, $4.8 trillion is the baseline; that is our debt which \nwe started with before we started this debate. We are now in our 10th \nday, and we are now up to $8,294,400,000 in additional debt just in the \n9 days since we started here.\n  All I hear from my friends is you should not be able to enact a \nbalanced budget amendment until you tell us how you are going to reach \na balanced budget, and you cannot submit it to the States until you do. \nThey know once we put this fiscal discipline into place, the game is \nover. And they know that they are going to have to start to live within \ntheir means. No longer can they spend themselves into the Senate or \nkeep themselves in the Senate by spending and telling the people how \nmuch we are doing for them while we are spending them into bankruptcy.\n  I cannot sit here and simply ignore the fact that the liberals, who \nhave spent us into bankruptcy, are the ones who are fighting against \nthis amendment. We have irresponsible debt in this country. We have \nrunaway spending. We have a destructive welfare system that not only is \ntoo expensive but it is destroying families. We have an antisavings Tax \nCode that is eating us alive. We have a huge Washington bureaucracy. We \nare killing the American dream, and we are killing our children's \nfuture.\n  We have to cut the waste. We have to cut the fat. We have to do it \nthrough a discipline that only the balanced budget amendment will bring \nto us.\n And if we do not do that, I just worry about the country, and so does \neverybody else. This is not a game around here. For those who are \nagainst the amendment to come and say, now, after they have been in \ncontrol for most of the last 60 years, and never having reached a \nbalanced budget for the last 26 years, to come to us and say, you have \nto explain how you can do it and satisfy 535 Members of Congress before \nyou can put the discipline into place that will get us there, it seems \nto me is pure sophistry.\n\n  We need the discipline. That is what is missing. Remember Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings? We all thought that statute was going to do the job. \nIt did do a little bit until we amended it and set the goals farther \nout there, and amended it again, and now we have done away with it \naltogether because it was a simple statute. It was well-intentioned, \nand a lot of people thought it might work, and it did to some to \ndegree, but it was tossed out when they decided to spend more around \nhere.\n  The Democrats against this balanced budget amendment were in charge \nlast year, and they have been in charge since 1986. They have never \npresented a balanced budget, nor have they presented a plan. Certainly \nthe President's program is not a plan either to get us to a balanced \nbudget. His budget, very clearly, is not a plan to get us there.\n  Now we come down to the Daschle amendment, this right-to-know \namendment. I have seldom seen a more frivolous trivialization of the \nConstitution than what this amendment would do, because it would write \na section 9 into the balanced budget amendment that would put new \nlanguage into the constitutional amendment--new language for the first \ntime, all kinds of budgetary terms, all kinds of language that really \nwould allow loopholes galore, which would institutionalize even \ncommittees in the Senate and the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Look at this language and you have to say, constitutional language? \nThat is with a big question mark. I do not see how anybody can argue \nthis is what we ought to do for the Constitution, even though they talk \nabout the right to know. Aggregate levels of new budget authority. In \nthe Constitution? Major functional category, account-by-account basis, \nallocation of Federal revenues, reconciliation directives, section \n310(a) of the Congressional Budget Act. That can be changed by a simple \nmajority vote? Talk about trivialization. Omnibus reconciliation bill. \nWhat in the world does that mean? That is going to be written into the \nConstitution so they can continue doing business as usual? \nCongressional Budget Office. They are going to go write that into the \nConstitution, the Congressional Budget Office? For all of its good \nintentions, it has been wrong more than it has been right on budgetary \nmatters. Economic and technical assumptions. And then they are going to \nwrite the Committee on the Budget into this Constitution?\n  Let me just end. This is a trivialization of the Constitution. It \ndoes not make constitutional sense. It would destroy the balanced \nbudget amendment. It would destroy the one time in history since the \nHouse, for the first time, has passed the balanced budget amendment, \nthe one time in history when we really have a chance to restore \ndiscipline to this process. It would put language into the Constitution \nthat is totally unworkable, unless you want to keep spending.\n  I thought it was appropriate for some of those who did come out here \nand speak right before this important vote. The opponents are \napologists for the status quo. They are the people that have been here \n30, 40 years. They are the people that have been around here and have \nseen it go the same way every time, and they say we ought to have the \nguts to do it. Yet, when they had control, they could not do it because \nthere was not a fiscal discipline in the Constitution that required \nthem to do it, or at least gave incentives, which is what this \namendment does, to get to a balanced budget.\n  Are we going to stick with the old order around here, the old way of \ndoing things, the status quo, that now has us $4.8 trillion in debt, \nplus another $8.294 \n[[Page S2299]] billion in the 10 days we have been debating this? Are \nwe going to stick with the people who brought us to this and let them \ncome in here with this phony trivialization of the constitutional \namendment and say all of a sudden, in just a short period of time, you \nRepublicans, before you pass a balanced budget amendment and submit it \nto the States, you have to show us how you are going to cut the budget? \nThe fact of the matter is that we will show them once the discipline is \nin place, because we will all have to show them. The Democrats who \nsupport this amendment will be right there with us helping us to show \nhow this can be done. But you cannot do that in less than a year or so, \nand we have to get the balanced budget amendment in place before we do.\n  The Daschle proposal raises a lot more questions than it will answer. \nFor example, it would require a statement of new budget authority and \noutlays only on accounts which were over $100 million in 1994. What \nabout accounts which were under $100 million in 1994 but have grown \nover that? What about new accounts? This proposal would also require an \nallocation of Federal revenues among major resources of such revenues. \nBut what qualifies as major? This proposal would further require a \ndetailed list and description of changes in Federal law required to \ncarry out the plan. Such information is currently in a document \nseparate from the budget resolution. That document for President \nClinton's 1993 budget plan was over 1,000 pages long. His budget plan \nwill keep deficits at around $200 billion well into the future, for 12 \nyears into the future, and then we do not know what will happen. That \nis assuming if the rosy economic circumstances continue that they are \nclaiming will be the case.\n  Do we really want to increase the already mammoth budget resolution? \nIn addition, the provision is vague and incoherent. The Daschle \nproposal literally requires that we predict over the next 7 years not \njust the changes in law Congress may ultimately pass, but the date that \nCongress will pass them.\n  The Daschle proposal creates additional problems by making \nconstitutional reference to statutory law, as I have just shown on this \nchart. It is ridiculous. Incorporate 310(a) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974 by reference. What happens if Congress amends that section? \nDoes that qualify as a constitutional amendment by a simple majority \nvote? Similarly, as we have said, the CBO is explicitly referred to in \nthis proposal. That means that the Constitution will now have to refer \nto four branches of Government: judiciary, executive, legislative and, \nof course, the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Here we are in the new Congress trying to reduce the Federal \nbureaucracy, and the Daschle proposal attempts to enshrine a part of it \nin the Constitution. Those of us on both sides of the aisle who have \nworked for years to pass this constitutional amendment have \nconsistently heard from our opponents that we are trivializing the \nConstitution with this budget matter. Talk about trivializing the \nConstitution.\n  The Daschle proposal would have us add a new section to the \nConstitution that is longer and extraordinarily more detailed and \ntechnical than the proposal that has been the subject of hearings, \ncommittee debate, vote, and a committee report. It adds new terms to \nthe Constitution like ``concurrent resolution.'' I have gone through \nthose terms. They will no longer have just lawyers pouring over the \ndocument; we are going to need a slew of accountants to tell us what \nthe Constitution means as well.\n  I think we ought to vote this amendment down. It does not deserve to \nbe in the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I have stated many times during this debate that the \nbalanced budget amendment represents the kind of change the American \npeople voted for in November. The American people know that the mammoth \nFederal Government must be put on a fiscal diet. In contrast, the \nproposal offered by the distinguished minority leader, with all due \nrespect, is offered in the defense of the status quo and business as \nusual.\n\n\n                      the right to stall amendment\n\n  The Daschle motion to recommit has been termed by the opponents of \nthe balanced budget amendment the right-to-know motion. But it has \nrightly also been called the right-to-stall proposal. It purports to \nput off the requirement of a balanced budget until Congress actually \nagrees to a balanced budget, by adopting such a budget plan.\n  Mr. President, this proposal actually will give to Congress a \nconstitutional right to stall the requirement of a balanced budget by \nmere failure to balance the budget. Mr. President, the very reason we \nneed a balanced budget amendment is because Congress has failed to \nbalance the budget for decades. The Daschle right-to-stall amendment \nwould make that abject failure of responsibility the explicit condition \nof avoiding the acceptance of that responsibility. If there is a better \nmanner to lock in business as usual, a better way to constitutionalize \nour borrow and spend status quo--our ever-steeper slide into the debt \nabyss--I admit I cannot think of it.\n  Consider, Mr. President, that the proponents of the right-to-stall \namendment want to use Congress' historical inability to balance the \nbudget as a reason--a constitutional reason--to deny the American \npeople, to deny future generations, the requirement they want to force \nCongress to act responsibly, get its fiscal house in order, and live \nwithin its means. Talk about a recipe for inaction. The right-to-stall \nproponents say ``if Congress cannot balance the budget, they should not \nhave to.'' They say, ``if Congress has been and is unable to balance \nthe budget in the absence of a balanced budget requirement, we should \nnot impose a balanced budget requirement on it.'' Is this what the \nAmerican people want? Do they want Congress' failure to fulfill its \nresponsibility to be a reason to drop the requirement? Does this even \nmake any sense?\n  If my colleagues supporting the Daschle proposal had been in the \nFirst Congress, we would never have adopted the first amendment in the \nBill of Rights. Just imagine James Madison defending the free speech \nclause of the first amendment from some of my colleagues: Does this \nmean you cannot yell fire in a crowded theatre? they would ask. Does it \nprotect obscenity? If not, what is the line between obscenity and \nprotected free speech? We cannot accept the free speech clause without \nthese details spelled out, they would say. Does the free speech clause \nprotect the American flag from desecration? If so, we cannot accept the \nfirst amendment. Some of my colleagues made that clear when they turned \ndown the flag-burning amendment twice a few years ago.\n  What about the religion clauses, the free exercise clause and the \nestablishment clause, of the first amendment? Would supporters of the \nDaschle proposal, had they been in the First Congress, demanded an \naccounting of just when and how the Government can aid religious \nschools? Would they have insisted on knowing all of the circumstances \nunder which citizens or local governments can put a Menorah or a creche \non public property? Would they have turned down the first amendment \nbecause the First Congress could not fulfill the ludicrous task of \nanswering these questions? Or would they have accepted the principles \ncontained in the first amendment and allowed those principles to \ndevelop, as they have over the years?\n  Just imagine when the following clause in article I, section 9 came \nbefore the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia: ``No \nmoney shall be drawn from the treasury, but in Consequence of \nappropriations made by law * * *'' Oh no, my colleagues would have \nsaid, tell us how much the appropriations will be over the next 7 years \nor we cannot adopt this provision and this Constitution.\n  What about the clause in article I, section 8, giving Congress the \npower to regulate foreign and interstate commerce? Oh no, some of our \ncolleagues would have said in Philadelphia in 1787. We cannot give \nCongress the power to regulate commerce until we know the tariffs and \ninterstate regulations Congress will enact over the next 7 years.\n  Here and now, let us adopt the principle of a balanced budget with \nthe careful exceptions of war time or when a supermajority consensus is \nreached for a pressing national purpose, on a rollcall vote. Then, \nafter we adopt the principle, we can implement it over the next 7 \nyears, adjusting the budget to \n[[Page S2300]]  take into account changing circumstances during that \ntime.\n  After all, this is a constitution we are amending, not budget \nlegislation. In fact, as I read the Daschle proposal, it requires that \nwe pass a resolution laying out the details of a plan starting in \nfiscal year 1996 even though that requirement is contained in an \namendment that does not become effective until 2002.\n  To require that a constitutional provision be fully implemented \nbefore it is adopted puts the cart a long way before the horse. After \nall, the whole problem is that Congress has not been able to balance \nthe budget in the absence of a constitutional requirement to do so.\n  It seems to me that the people who really have the burden of showing \nus how they will balance the budget are the ones who claim we do not \nneed the balanced budget amendment. We say the budget cannot be \nbalanced without a constitutional requirement. To those who think we \ncan balance the budget without the balanced budget amendment, I say \nshow us how. If you cannot show us the way to a balanced budget without \nthe amendment, this suggests one of two things. Either you agree with \nus that it cannot be done without the constitutional requirement, or \nyou are simple arguing against balancing the budget at all.\n\n\n               confusing process with substantive choices\n\n  Mr. President, the right-to-stall amendment confuses the difference \nbetween choosing rules and making choices within the rules. Yesterday, \nI mentioned a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal by Prof. \nJames M. Buchanan, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, who explained that \nimportant distinction. I would like to quote it again because I believe \nit points up a basic fallacy in the reasoning of the objection of the \nright-to-stall proponents. Professor Buchanan states:\n\n       The essential argument [of the Daschle amendment \n     proponents] against the balanced budget amendment reflects a \n     basic misunderstanding of the difference between\n      a choice of rules and choices made with rules. The Clinton-\n     Democratic argument suggests that proponents of the \n     amendment should specify what combination of spending cuts \n     and revenue increases are to be implemented over the 7-\n     year transition period. This argument reflects a failure \n     to understand what a choice of constitutional constraint \n     is all about and conflates within-rules choices and \n     choices of rules themselves.\n       Consider an analogy with an ordinary game, say poker. We \n     choose the basic rules before we commence to play within \n     whatever rules are chosen. Clearly, if we could foresee all \n     of the contingencies beforehand (for example, how the cards \n     are to fall), those of us who know in advance that we shall \n     get bad hands would not agree to the rules in the first \n     place. Choices of rules must be made in a setting in which we \n     do not yet know the particulars of the within-rule choices.\n       Applied to the politics of taxing and spending, the \n     constitutional amendment imposes a new rule of the game, \n     under which the ordinary interplay of interest groups--\n     majoritarian politics will generate certain patterns of \n     taxing-spending results. By the very nature of what rules-\n     choices are, outcome patterns cannot be specified in advance.\n       The opponents of the proposed balanced budget amendment \n     should not be allowed to generate intellectual confusion \n     about the difference between choices among verus within \n     rules. There are, of course, legitimate arguments that may be \n     made against the amendment, but these involve concerns about \n     the efficacy of alternative rules, including those that now \n     exist, rather than a specific prediction of choices to be \n     made under any rule or choices made during the transition \n     between rules. [Wall St. Journal, 2/6/95, p. A13.]\n\n  Mr. President, Professor Buchanan is obviously correct. Proponents of \nthe balanced budget amendment recommend a rule change. Opponents argue \nagainst the amendment on the basis of either possible choices under the \nnew rule which could hurt well-organized special interest groups or the \nfailure to specify which well-organized special interest groups will be \nhurt under the new rule. Either objection is, as Professor Buchanan \npoints out, intellectually confused as an objection to the new rule. \nThe proponents do not advocate any particular outcomes, just a new way \nof making those choices. The right-to-stall motion offered by the \nDemocrat leader does not move the debate forward.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the Daschle right-to-stall amendment is \nnothing more than a way to stop Congress from adopting the resolve to \nforce itself to act responsibly and balance the budget and live within \nits means in the future.\n\n\n              president clinton's deficit reduction record\n\n  This brings me to the President. If President Clinton gets his way \nand defeats the balanced budget amendment this year as he did last \nyear, what is his purpose? Does he not want a balanced budget? Does he \nstand for the status quo of ever higher taxes and even higher deficits? \nLet us look at his record.\n  The President's 1993 deficit reduction tax plan has failed to control \neven the growth of annual budget deficits, which continue to rise \nduring the later years of the plan, surpassing $200 billion as early as \n1996, reaching the record level of $297 in 2001, and topping $421 in \n2005.\n  The President's so-called deficit reduction plan, which included \nmassive tax increases on working people, retirees, and other Americans, \nneither stopped the growth of the national debt nor balances the \nbudget.\n  Now, the opponents point to President Clinton's tax plan of 1993 as \nthe great epitome of budgetary courage we should follow. But, Mr. \nPresident, that was no plan to balance the budget. I would ask my \ncolleagues, did the 1993 tax bill balance the budget? Does the \nPresident propose a path to a balanced budget?\n  Now look at the President's budget released this week. It projects \n$200 billion yearly budgets as far as the eye can see--and that is the \nbest case scenario with the most optimistic assumptions. There is no \nbudget balancing leadership here.\n  Mr. President, those who say we can balance the budget without the \nbalanced budget amendment are the ones who should show us how they \npropose to do it. They are the ones who say, regardless of history, we \ncan balance the budget now, without a rules change. But I continue to \nask in vain, how do they propose to do it, Mr. President? Why should we \ntrust they will do better under the status quo than they have for the \nlast 26 years? Mr. President, I ask again, where is their plan?\n  Mr. President, this will not do. We should adopt the binding resolve \nto accept our responsibility, and then fulfill it. We should not avoid \nresponsibility on the ground that we have so far failed to act \nresponsibly. We should not be able to deny the American people and \nfuture generations the responsible rule of fiscal discipline on the \ngrounds of our historical lack of discipline.\n  Mr. President, let us take the first step first, and let us get our \nhouse in order by adopting the balanced budget amendment.\n  The fact is that if House Joint Resolution 1 passes in its current \nform, we can and will balance the budget. It is not the lack of plans \nthat has prevented us from balancing the budget; it is the lack of \nwill.\n  We don't claim to have the perfect, painless way to balance the \nbudget, but there are quite a number of options for us to examine and \ndraw from, at least in part. In fact, as I stated previously in this \ndebate, over the last few years we have seen a number of plans released \nfrom both sides of the aisle, from both bodies, and from outside \norganizations. [I will just hold up a few of them]: The Concord \nCoalition zero deficit plan; the Republican alternative to the fiscal \nyear 1994 budget, and the Congressioinal Budget Office's illustration \nof one path to balance the budget in their Economic and Budget Outlook \n1996-2000, just to name a few.\n  Even the current White House Chief of Staff submitted a balanced \nbudget proposal during his tenure in the House.\n  Other ideas include limiting the growth of spending to 2 percent \nwithout touching Social Security, or cutting 4 cents a year off of \nevery dollar of planned spending except Social Security.\n  Furthermore, there are many proposals out there to reduce spending \nsignificantly and reduce the deficit: The Dole 50-point plan; the \nPenny-Kasich deficit reduction plan; the Brown-Kerrey bipartisan \ncutting plan; the prime cuts list prepared by Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste; the Kasich budget alternatives for fiscal year 1994 \nand fiscal year 1995; and the Brown deficit reduction plan.\n  I do not think that any one of these proposals is necessarily the \nultimate solution. Yet, they all have some ideas worth considering. I \ncertainly believe that we could evaluate and analyze \n[[Page S2301]]  proposals in these plans as well as other ideas that I \nguarantee will be forthcoming from both sides of the aisle if we pass \nthis amendment.\n  Let me say it one more time: The problem is not the lack of ideas, it \nis the lack of will. House Joint Resolution 1, in its current form, \nwill provide that will.\n\n\nthe unworkability of the daschle proposal and the trivialization of the \n                              constitution\n\n  Furthermore, the Daschle proposal raises more questions than it would \nanswer. For example, it would require a statement of new budget \nauthority and outlays only on accounts which were over $100 million in \n1994. What about accounts which were under $100 million in 1994 but \nhave grown? What about new accounts? This proposal would also require \nan allocation of Federal revenues among major resources of such \nrevenues. But what qualifies as major?\n  This proposal would further require a detailed list and description \nof changes in Federal law required to carry out the plan. Such \ninformation is currently in a document separate from the budget \nresolution. That document, for President Clinton's 1993 budget plan, \nwas over 1,000 pages long. Do we really want to increase the already \nmammoth budget resolution?\n  In addition, this provision is vague and incoherent. The Daschle \nproposal literally requires that we predict, over the next 7 years, not \njust the changes in law Congress may ultimately pass, but the date that \nCongress will pass them.\n  The Daschle proposal creates additional problems by making \nconstitutional reference to statutory law. It incorporates section \n310(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by reference. What \nhappens if Congress amends that section? Does that qualify as a \nconstitutional amendment?\n  Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office is explicitly referred to \nin this proposal. That means that the Constitution would now refer to \nthe four branches of Government: Congress, the Supreme Court, the \nPresident, and the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Here we are in the new Congress, trying to reduce the Federal the \nbureaucracy, and the Daschle proposal attempts to enshrine a part of it \nin the Constitution.\n  Those of us on both sides of the aisle who have worked for years to \npass this constitutional amendment have consistently heard from our \nopponents that we are trivializing the Constitution with budget matter. \nTalk about trivializing the Constitution. The Daschle proposal would \nhave us add a new section to the Constitution longer and \nextraordinarily more detailed and technical than the proposal that has \nbeen the subject of hearings, a committee debate and vote, and a \ncommittee report. It adds new terms to the Constitution like concurrent \nresolution, aggregate levels of new budget authority, account-by-\naccount basis, allocation of Federal revenue, reconciliation \ndirectives, section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act, omnibus \nreconciliation bill, Congressional Budget Office, and economic and \ntechnical assumptions. We will no longer have just lawyers pouring over \nthis document, we'll need a slew of accountants.\n\n\n                the daschle proposal is unconstitutional\n\n  Perhaps the most significant reason for opposing this proposal is \nthat it is unconstitutional. Article V of the Constitution provides for \ntwo--and just two--ways to amend the Constitution: By a proposal passed \nby two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, or by a proposal of a \nconstitutional convention called by two-thirds of the States. In either \ncase, three-fourths of the State legislatures must ratify the proposal \nbefore it becomes part of the Constitution.\n  The Daschle proposal is infirm because it places a condition \nsubsequent to the explicit methodology for amending the Constitution \ncontained in article V. Article V mandates that whenever two-thirds of \nboth Houses concur, a proposed amendment must be promulgated to the \nStates for ratification. The Daschle proposal, on the other hand, \ndelays sending the proposed amendment to the States after passage by \nCongress until Congress acts again, this time by a simple majority on a \nbudget resolution. It is black letter law that Congress may not alter, \nexpand, or restrict, procedures established and explicitly mandated by \nthe Constitution. See Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, \n462 U.S. 919 (1983) (the Supreme Court held unconstitutional the one-\nHouse congressional veto as violative of the bicameralism and \npresentment to the President requirements of the Constitution).\n  Now Senator Daschle defended his proposal by referring to the 7-year \ntime requirement in House Joint Resolution 1 itself as an example of a \ncondition that Congress has historically set to the amendment process. \nIndeed, the Supreme Court in Dillon v. Gloss, 307 U.S. 433 (1939), did \nhold that the 7-year limit that appears in the text of an amendment is \na constitutional condition placed on the ratification process.\n  Senator Daschle, however, misstates my argument. Article V sets forth \nthe exclusive conditions for promulgation of a constitutional \namendment. The 7-year time limit is a condition on ratification. \nPromulgation and ratification are, of course, distinct acts, and the \ntwo should not be confused.\n  Under article V, once Congress has passed an amendment by the \nnecessary two-thirds margin in both Houses, the amendment must be \npromulgated to the States for ratification. There is nothing in either \nthe text of article V nor in our constitutional history that suggests \nthat Congress can play slick games with the States by passing an \namendment but keeping it from going to the States. The act of \npromulgation is a ministerial act that must be performed once the two-\nthirds vote has been obtained.\n  By contrast, there is ample reason why Congress should be permitted \nto include additional conditions on ratification, such as the 7-year \ntime limit. Article V itself makes clear that it is up to Congress to \nspecify the mode of ratification. There is also substantial precedent \nin our constitutional history for Congress to specify time limits on \nratification.\n  In conclusion, the promulgation of a constitutional amendment is \ndistinct from its ratification. The Daschle substitute is \nunconstitutional in that it would place an additional condition on, and \nthereby delay, Congress' promulgation of the balanced budget amendment. \nUnder article V, once Congress passes an amendment, it shall be \npromulgated to the States. The Daschle substitute violates this \nprovision.\n  Mr. President, for the forgoing reasons, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Dole amendment and vote to table the Daschle proposal.\n  I would like to point out that, look, we would like to resolve these \nproblems. We hope there are enough Senators here who are willing to \nstand up for this one time in history, Democrat-Republican, bipartisan \namendment that would put us on the fiscal path we should be on. We \nwould not have to worry about all those moneys being laundered through \nthe Federal Government and getting back to the people Senator Kennedy \nsaid they are meant for. I think it is time to get real about budgeting \nand spending and real about balancing this budget and real about what \nis best for this country. The only way we are going to do that is by \npassing the balanced budget amendment intact, without statutory \nlanguage added to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 11:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the minority leader for yielding.\n  I would just say this, as we come down to the critical point of the \nvote: You would think that when someone proposes a balanced budget \namendment, they must have a plan to get to it after the balanced budget \namendment passes. The only thing I am suggesting is that they should \nshare that information with the American public. They should share it \nwith the States.\n  If there is a secret plan that they have to balance the budget, does \nit include massive cuts in Social Security? Or does it include massive \nreductions in veterans' pension plans? Or does it include the \ndismantling of the highway assistance programs for the States? I am not \nsure what it includes.\n  But if there is a secret plan to reach this balanced budget, I would \nsuggest that it should be secret no longer. If it \n[[Page S2302]]  is good enough to balance the budget in the year 2002, \nlet the States see it. Let them have an opportunity to vote knowing how \nwe are going to balance that budget.\n  How can we send this amendment to the States and not let them know \nwhat the plan is as to how we are going to achieve it?\n  Oh, perhaps, maybe there is a golden secret plan they have that does \nnothing with regard to cutting Social Security and does not increase \ntaxes and increases defense spending and yet still balances the budget. \nMaybe they have that type of a plan. But let us see it.\n  I mean, somebody over there who is proposing this must have a plan on \nhow to get to the end result. How are you we doing to ask the States to \nbe able to pass this amendment unless they know what that plan is?\n  And that is what the right-to-know amendment is all about. I think \nthe people of America have a right to know how they are going to do \nthis. How are we all going to do it, because it is a collective effort. \nIt is going to be a partnership between the Federal Government and the \nStates. And the States are not going to be able to vote unless they see \nwhat plan they are going to be voting on. I think we need a right-to-\nknow amendment. I think America needs it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Louisiana \nfor his comments this morning.\n  Like this Senator, the Senator from Louisiana was in the House of \nRepresentatives in 1981. I am sure he, like I, remembers the ease with \nwhich we passed the tax package of 1981. The President and the \nRepublican leadership at that time convinced the Congress and the \nAmerican people to cut taxes, to increase defense spending, to protect \nSocial Security, and to balance the budget by 1984. There were no \ndetails, very few specifics, just a promise and the words ``trust us.'' \nThe vote was overwhelming.\n  I will never forget that morning on the floor and the overwhelming \nvote. Everyone applauded. We all went home.\n  But 10 years later, the American people saw an increase in the \nnational debt to $4 trillion, four times what it was when we had cast \nthat vote in 1981.\n  I also remember the difficulty we encountered in 1993, as we passed \nthe President's economic package. That did not pass overwhelmingly. \nThat passed by a margin of 50 to 49, amid doom and gloom predictions of \nrecession and mass unemployment and negative market reaction. We heard \nit all. It was a very, very tough vote. I vividly remember that \nmorning, as well.\n  But the difference between 1981 and 1993 was more than the difficulty \nin passage. Rather than vague predictions with rosy scenarios of 1981, \nthe 1993 proposal put details into black and white--details involving \ncuts, details involving revenue, details requiring major changes in the \nway we do business; hundreds and hundreds of pages of black and white \ndetails. It was controversial. And we fought over many of the details \nin this document for days. No one can forget that.\n  But, do you know what? It was effective. And in the end, the 103d \nCongress passed a 5-year deficit-reduction plan that reduced the \ndeficit by $500 billion. Instead of asking the American people to trust \nus, we showed them, up front, line-by-line, what our intentions were. \nAnd the results--well, the results speak for themselves.\n  Mr. President, those are the two models from which we can choose \ntoday. The only difference is that today the issue is far more \nserious--more serious because the debt has now risen to $4.5 trillion; \nmore serious because this is the first time in history that we may be \nadding an amendment to the Constitution affecting the fiscal policy of \nthis Nation.\n  The question for the American people is really very simple: After \nthose two experiences, will the Senate roll the dice, will it roll the \ndice and say, ``trust us again,'' or will we do what we know we must \ndo? Will we show in 1995, as we showed the American people in 1993, \nexactly what must be done? That is the issue.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire, my good friend, this morning \nmentioned my willingness to support a balanced budget amendment last \nyear and took issue with us for not arguing the right-to-know amendment \nthen.\n  Well, the reasons are easy for anyone to understand. First, we had \njust passed our own version of the right to know. It was right here. \nThe print was hardly dry. Second, we were not faced then, as we are \ntoday, with the exact situation with which we were faced in 1981--\npromises of tax cuts, promises of increases in defense, promises to \nprotect Social Security, and promises to balance the budget in a \ndesignated period of time, but no promise to explain how it is going to \nbe done.\n  If the Senate is unwilling to promise the American people a \nblueprint, I guess I would have to ask: What is it they are trying to \nconceal? What is it we are trying to conceal from Social Security \nrecipients whose pensions are affected by the decision we are going to \nmake in the next couple of weeks? What is it we are trying to conceal \nfrom the Pentagon and our allies about the true commitment to the \nmilitary strength of this Nation in the coming years? What is it we are \ntrying to conceal from veterans and military retirees about our true \nintentions with respect to their future?\n  What about States? What are we trying to conceal about the real \nimpact this decision will have on them, on the Governors, and on their \nfiscal health?\n  And, very honestly, what about us? What about us? What are we trying \nto conceal from ourselves, and how is it possible that we can commit \nourselves to repeating the clear mistake of the past? How can we set a \ngoal and have no idea--none--how we are going to get there?\n  Tax cuts, defense spending increases, protection for Social \nSecurity--all these are doable in the abstract. It is only in the \ncontext of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in 7 years \nthat the job becomes nearly impossible.\n  Assuming we pass the Contract With America, assuming that we protect \nSocial Security, our job is to cut $2.2 trillion in 7 years. That is \nour goal--$2.2 trillion. That means we have got to cut $300 billion for \neach of the next 7 years.\n  Pass the Contract With America, protect Social Security, balance the \nbudget by the year 2002. And we are going to ask our colleagues in the \nnext 7 years, each and every year, to cut $300 billion. And every year \nwe delay, the task becomes even more overwhelming the next year.\n  But that is only part of the story, because if we actually take \nSocial Security off the table, if we take defense off the table, and \nbecause we must exclude interest payments, we are left with a mere 48 \npercent of the budget with which to work. That is really what we have \nleft--48 percent. If you take those three items off the table, that is \nall we have left, 48 percent of the entire Federal budget from which we \nnow must cut $2.2 trillion in 7 years.\n  Well, do you know what the American people are saying? The American \npeople are saying: ``Right. Show me. Show us how you are going to cut \nall that and how you are going to cut funding for the States. Show us \nhow you are going to cut my farm programs and other programs directly \naffecting rural America. Show us how you are going to deal with \neducation, nutrition, health and housing, and as you do, do not even \nthink about saying any of this is going to be easy or painless.''\n  Mr. President, I bet there is one thing for which there is universal \nagreement within this Chamber. That is, there is a lot of skepticism \nout there, and, frankly, I think there is skepticism for a good reason.\n  Too many times, Washington has said one thing and done another. We \ncannot afford, on something this important--this important--to let that \nhappen again. We cannot afford to add to the deep-seated skepticism \nabout this institution or its actions. Not now. Not on an issue this \nimportant.\n  My Republican colleagues have lodged three basic objections to the \nright-to-know-amendment. The House majority leader said recently, \n``Once Members of Congress know exactly, chapter and verse, the pain \nthat the Government must live with in order to get a balanced budget, \ntheir knees will buckle.'' The majority's apparent solution is to hide \nthe truth and sidestep the pain. But the right-to-know-amendment says \nwe have tried all that. We did it back in 1981, and $4 trillion \n[[Page S2303]] later, we now must come to the realization that we have \nto end business as usual. That will not work again.\n  The second objection is that they cannot be precise about a 7-year \nbudget process. Yet, the current law requires already that we offer 5-\nyear estimates. What is so much more mysterious or unknowable about \nyears 6 or 7 than years 4 and 5? All the health reform proposals last \nyear were evaluated over a 10-year budget projection. The Congressional \nBudget Office already has the ability to give us 7-year budget \nestimates. We should use them. I have not heard one credible economist \ntell Members that this cannot be done, that we cannot lay out a \nbudgetary glidepath for 7 years.\n  The third objection is especially ironic. It asserts that the right-\nto-know-amendment is somehow unconstitutional because the Constitution \ndoes not specifically sanction Congress to set conditions on an \namendment before it goes to the States for ratification. But neither \ndoes the Constitution specifically sanction the 7-year limit for \nratification that is found in the underlying amendment.\n  I have not heard any of my colleagues argue that their amendment is \nunconstitutional because it includes the customary but not \nconstitutionally sanctioned time limit. As everyone here knows, the \nConstitution has just two requirements: First, that we pass the \namendment by a two-thirds vote in both Houses; and second, that it be \nratified by three-fourths of the States. That is all it says. Period.\n  Mr. President, the issue is pretty simple. If we are going to build a \nsturdy house of real deficit reduction, do we have a blueprint? Are we \ngoing to ask this body to lay out the blueprint by which that will be \ndone? Or do we just start pounding away, hoping we have the materials \nto build that house, hoping we know where the budget-cutting rooms \nreally are, hoping we can do it all in 7 years, hoping that somehow we \ncan build a house of real deficit reduction without the details.\n  The American people would never build their house without a \nblueprint. They know we cannot, either. By a margin of 86 to 14 \npercent, they are saying, ``Show us. We have a right to know if you are \ngoing to affect Social Security. We have a right to know if you are \ngoing to cut defense. We have a right to know if you are going to cut \nveterans programs. We have a right to know how you plan to cut $2.2 \ntrillion from 48 percent of your budget in 7 years. We have a right to \nknow if you have learned from the mistakes of the past. We have a right \nto know if you are really serious.''\n  So today, Mr. President, the Senate has an opportunity. It is an \nopportunity to end business as usual, an opportunity to be honest, an \nopportunity to affirm that when it comes to an amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution, the American people have a right to know.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the majority leader is in a meeting and is \nhaving a difficult time getting here, and has asked that I take a few \nminutes before he gets here. He may have to use some of the leader's \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas was to be recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Utah will be recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I particularly enjoyed the comments of the \ndistinguished minority leader of the Senate. He is a very fine man. I \nam sure he is very sincere in what he is talking about. And he is a \ngood friend. I do not have any desire to make this a partisan thing. \nThis is a bipartisan constitutional amendment. We are fighting to try \nto get this country's fiscal house in order.\n  To have people come here now and say, ``Just show us a blueprint,'' \nand to use that tax vote a year ago, when they increased taxes on the \nAmerican people--and they did get the deficit down to a little below \n$200 billion, but this was nothing, and they all know that that very \nbill that they passed and they are taking such credit for, touting it \nas their fiscal responsibility, that bill had the deficit jamming \nupward in 1996 and thereafter to the point where we get to a $400 \nbillion deficit after the turn of the century.\n  That is hardly something I would brag about, increasing taxes against \nthe American people, the largest in history, and then a jump in \nspending, starting in 1996. Now, the President has come in and he has \ntried to reduce that jump in spending, but even his budget admits, \nuntil the year 2007, we will have at least a $190 billion deficit a \nyear.\n  Now, we have had 38 years since the balanced budget amendment has \nbeen introduced. Since we passed it when I was Constitution chairman \nback in 1982 in the Senate, we have had 13 years. And every time we \nturn around, somebody is saying, ``Well, show us how you will get to a \nbalanced budget before we pass a balanced budget amendment,'' or, as in \nthis amendment's case, ``Show us how you will get there before you can \nsubmit the balanced budget amendment, once passed, to the States,'' \nputting another requirement into the Constitution that really does not \ndeserve it to be there.\n  Now, look, this is a game. It is a game by those who personally do \nnot want a balanced budget amendment, although some who will vote for \nthis will do so out of loyalty to the leader on the other side. It is \nnot a game to us. The distinguished Senator from Illinois and I are not \nplaying games. We have worked to bring the whole Congress together on a \nbipartisan consensus--Democrat and Republican--constitutional \namendment, and we intend to get it there. This type of an amendment to \nthe basic constitutional amendment would gut the whole amendment, and \neverybody on this floor knows it.\n  I yield a couple of minutes to the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Utah for \nyielding. Let me express my thanks for the leadership that he and the \nSenator from Illinois have taken on this issue, along with myself and \nothers, to bring to the floor and to build the consensus that is \nclearly here in a strong majority to pass a balanced budget amendment.\n  Now, within a few moments, we will have a vote on the Daschle motion. \nWe have been debating this amendment and the Daschle motion in part for \na week and a half, without a vote. I think the American people expect \nMembers to move in an expeditious fashion through this issue, to a time \nwhen we can vote up or down on it, and send it to them to make the \ndecision.\n  Article V of the Constitution is very clear. We have the right to \npropose amendments, and when we do, they must go straight to the \nStates. In all fairness, the Daschle amendment has to be called not the \nright to know, but the right to stall, and stall and stall, and deny \nthe American people the opportunity to express their will through their \nState legislators as to whether they want a balanced budget amendment, \nas to whether they want a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nto be the 28th amendment to our Federal Constitution.\n  So while Senator Exon or Senator Hollings may have offered similar \namendments to the unfunded mandates issue, they were entirely \ndifferent. That was a statute. That was an issue that can be changed \nyear to year, day to day, as the Congress meets. This is an amendment \nto our Constitution. Nowhere has there ever been within the \nConstitution such a prescriptive process as so designed by the Senator \nfrom South Dakota. It is not the right to know, it is simply the right \nto stall, in an effort to defeat this amendment or to deny the American \npeople the right to express their will.\n  The Senator from Utah has made that evident time and time again. I \nhave and our colleagues have joined Members on the floor to debate this \nissue.\n  Certainly we are now at a point, within a few moments, of voting, the \nvery first vote in over a week and a half, while the other body has \nalready moved several other pieces of legislation.\n  I am not at all convinced that just stalling and stalling and \nstalling, as has been proven here, is the way to solve this problem. \nThorough debate is, and I am all for adequate and thorough debate on \nthis issue. Now it is time to vote and move on to other portions of it \nin a timely fashion, and then allow \n[[Page S2304]] the American people to make the decision on how we \ngovern, not the elite few.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to give my strong support to the \nright-to-know amendment.\n  The American people have a right to know what a balanced budget \nmeans.\n  If a balanced budget amendment is added to the U.S. Constitution \nwithout a plan for how to balance the budget, we will leave the \nAmerican people in the dark.\n  Mr. President, I will not defend every line item in the Federal \nbudget. I believe we must look at the mission of programs. If a program \nachieves its mission and helps people, it should continue. If not, it \nshould be scrapped.\n  However, before we adopt a balanced budget amendment, we should know \nexactly what it is that we are doing. We need to know just how these \nprograms are going to be affected. What cuts are going to be taken. How \ndeep. What programs. And most importantly what the consequences will be \nto the health, safety, and security of the American people.\n  My first question is how a balanced budget amendment will affect \nMedicare.\n  Achieving a balanced budget in 2002 will require cuts of between 20 \nand 30 percent in Medicare--between $75 and $100 billion in 2002. What \nwill this mean for seniors?\n  Medicare already pays less than half of older Americans' health \ncosts. In the year 2002, older Americans are expected to spend more \nthan $4,600 on health care premiums and other out of pocket health \ncosts. But a balanced budget amendment could make seniors pay $1,300 \nmore. What will that $1,300 mean? It could mean forcing older Americans \nto choose between health care and eating, or between health care and \nheat.\n  Could a balanced budget amendment restrict access to health care \nproviders? We do not know. If the cuts are taken out of payments to \nproviders, those providers may decide not to see Medicare patients. \nThis could leave millions with no access to health care, especially in \nrural areas. We have a right to know.\n  Could a balanced budget amendment mean raising the eligibility age \nfor Medicare up to age 70? We do not know. Unemployed individuals in \ntheir fifties and sixties already find it difficult to obtain health \ninsurance. Many struggle with no insurance, hoping they will not get \nsick before they reach age 65, when they will at least have access to \nMedicare. If we raise the Medicare eligibility age, many more seniors \ncould be forced into poverty, unable to pay their medical bills. We \nhave a right to know.\n  Will the balanced budget amendment force elderly Americans into \nmanaged care plans so they are no longer able to choose their \nphysicians? We do not know. We--and they--have a right to know.\n  There are many other agencies and many other programs that the \nAmerican people depend upon to protect their health, their safety, \ntheir economic security. Law enforcement, traffic safety, education--\nnow will they be affected? What is the plan? Do we not owe it to the \npeople we represent to explain to them how they will be affected by the \nbalanced budget amendment?\n  I applaud this effort by my colleague Senator Daschle, the Democratic \nleader. His amendment would satisfy the American people's right to \nknow. I am proud to cosponsor and vote for this amendment, and I urge \neach of my colleagues to join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Senator Daschle has put before us a common \nsense addition to the balanced budget amendment, that requires us to \ntell the people of the States--the people who will decide on \nratification of the balanced budget amendment--what the effects of \ntheir decision will be.\n  Should we and the people who will be asked to ratify this permanent \nchange to our Constitution not be given the facts we need to understand \nits effects?\n  It seems to me that to oppose full disclosure is to say that we want \nthis decision--that is a fundamental change in our Nation's charter--to \nbe made in the dark, in ignorance.\n  Two years ago, we voted for a budget plan that laid out a course of \naction that identified the specific changes that would be needed to cut \nhalf a billion dollars from our deficits over 5 years.\n  That plan was clear and detailed; it was of course subject to both \nhonest disagreement, and, unfortunately, some partisan distortion. But \nit has cut the deficit for 3 years running, for the first time since \nthe Truman administration.\n  We told the American people what we were going to do, and we did it. \nWe cut over $500 billion from our deficits over 5 years.\n  And a strong economy that followed passage of that plan has brought \nour deficits even lower.\n  Like all of us here, I hope that the most recent action of the \nFederal Reserve Board will not be the one-two punch that wipes out the \nbenefits of that plan--a blow that both flattens the economy and \nincreases our deficits with higher interest rates.\n  Our plans here in Congress, like the plans of private citizens and \nbusinesses across the country, now hang on the hope that the Federal \nReserve has not gone too far.\n  But that is a topic for another day.\n  Some of my friends here who voted against cutting the deficit back \nthen, and some of my newer friends, who do not like the way we did it, \nnow act surprised to see that deficits will rise again in the future, \neven though no one--certainly not the administration--ever claimed they \nwould not.\n  We all knew that fundamental health care reform and other actions \nwould be necessary to turn the deficit trend down permanently, and not \njust over the life of the 1993 budget plan.\n  But the fact is that we passed that budget plan with the narrowest \npossible margin in each House of Congress.\n  As for those who now complain, their own plan was less specific than \nours and still could not promise as much deficit reduction as we have \nactually accomplished.\n  So let us not be distracted from our duty of being honest about the \nfuture by arguments about the past.\n  With the release of President Clinton's budget plan, we hear again \nfrom those who voted against deficit reduction in 1993 that they could \ndo better.\n  Well, Mr. President, I believe them. That is why I challenge them to \ntell us how they would do better, as specifically as the plan they are \nattacking.\n  If an amendment to the Constitution is needed to keep building on the \naccomplishments of the last few years, to force us to confront the \ncontinuing deficits that are predicted through the end of this decade, \nthen it only makes sense for us to prepare a document that sets forth \nthe choices that will be necessary to bring the budget into balance.\n  Right now, we are confronted with an interesting situation. A new \nmajority in Congress, that promised a new legislative agenda, now tells \nus that they cannot commit themselves to bring the budget into balance \nuntil after the Constitution is changed to force them to do it.\n  It is certainly within the competence of our budget committee and \nCongressional Budget Office to provide us with the specifics of a \nbudget path that will bring us to balance by the year 2002.\n  Of course projections are only our best scientific estimates of \nfuture economic activity. But virtually all of my friends who support \nthe balanced budget amendment have made good use of projections of \nfuture deficits under current law.\n  Those estimates are the best view we have of the future, even if we \ncannot be certain that all of our assumptions will hold true.\n  So let us drop that argument right now--we all accept that it is \npossible to make useful estimates about our economic and budget future.\n  It is because we accept such projections that we are here today, \ncontemplating an amendment to our Constitution.\n  [[Page S2305]] The particular problem this year is that this \namendment is part of an economic plan--as announced in the so-called \ncontract--that, taken all together, raises serious problems.\n  If we cut taxes, increase defense spending, and promise not to push \nany new costs off onto the Governors and mayors, the road to the \nbalanced budget looks rocky indeed.\n  It may be, Mr. President, that you cannot get to a balanced budget \nfrom here, if the contract is your road map.\n  There is powerful evidence--the one-vote margins in both Houses for \nthe 1993 budget package--that votes for deficit reduction are difficult \nto find.\n  How much more difficult will it be if we reduce our revenues, and \nkeep major segments of the budget safe from the requirements of the \nbalanced budget amendment?\n  Well, we know that it will be difficult, but we cannot know just how \ndifficult until we see some numbers about where the axe is going to \nfall.\n  Mr. President, I would like to echo the astute observation of a new \nmember of the judiciary, the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. \nFeingold].\n  During the debate in the Judiciary Committee on a similar proposal, \nSenator Feingfold responded to the suggestion that this was a \ntransparent ploy to kill the balanced budget amendment.\n  I want us all to reflect on that charge for a moment--that an attempt \nto find out just how a permanent addition to our Constitution will work \nis nothing but a ploy by those who oppose it.\n  Mr. President, when I took on the task as floor manager for this \nimportant proposal, I did so because I am genuinely torn between my \nconcern for our fiscal future and my concerns about the effects of this \nbalanced budget amendment on our Constitution and on our economy.\n  I did not anticipate that honest questions about the effects of a \npermanent change in our fundamental charter would be dismissed as \ninsincere or disingenuous.\n  But I ask my colleagues to consider Senator Feingold's response to \nthat charge. He said that the American people would be more likely to \nratify this amendment if they knew for sure what was in it, than if \nthey had to buy it sight unseen.\n  Those of us who have faith in the people who will make the final \ndecision on this amendment believe--whether we support or oppose it \nourselves--that it is our constitutional duty to establish a record of \ndebate and evidence before we send this amendment to the people.\n  Not often enough, I am afraid, does this chamber live up to its claim \nto be the world's greatest deliberative body. Certainly, we should \naspire to fulfill that role as we debate a change in our Constitution.\n  And certainly, the American people deserve to know what the new \nmajority party has in mind when they say that they can comply with the \nterms of the balanced budget amendment.\n  If we truly believe that amending the Constitution is the right thing \nto do, then let us give the American people the facts they need to make \nthat choice themselves.\n  Certainly, that is not too much to ask.\n  In addition to the very real benefits of being honest with the \nAmerican people, and restoring some of their faith in our ability to \nsolve problems, there is another substantial benefit of accepting \nSenator Daschle's amendment.\n  If we accept this amendment, we will have the assurance that we have \nin place a plan to get us from where we are today to a balanced budget \nby the year 2002.\n  By itself, that is no small accomplishment.\n  I cannot believe where we now find ourselves in this debate--where \nthe call for a specific set of goals that provide a path to a balanced \nbudget is denounced as a delaying tactic, a distraction.\n  And where those who call for an amendment to the Constitution that \nwill go into effect in the next century say that a promise to take \naction in the future is more serious than a call for action now.\n  That does not make sense to me.\n  If we accept this amendment, we will still have to send the amendment \nto the States. Let us assume for a moment that the American people lose \ntheir enthusiasm for the balanced budget amendment. What happens if we \nput all our eggs in that one basket?\n  Will we wait for the year or more that ratification is likely to take \nbefore we decide what to do next?\n  Or would we be more prudent, more serious, more committed to real \ndeficit reduction if we were to also pass a binding budget resolution \nthat sets a course for a balanced budget regardless of the outcome of \nthe ratification process?\n  I believe that the answer to that question is clear. The more serious \napproach is to pass the actual law that compliance with the balanced \nbudget amendment would require, not simply to pass an amendment with \nthe promise that at some future date we will get down to the real work \nof balancing the budget.\n  And there is a further substantial advantage to what Senator \nDaschle's amendment offers--a commitment to start now on the very \ndifficult journey ahead of us.\n  Without a plan that starts now to build on the real progress of the \npast 3 years--without such a plan in place from the beginning, we will \nhave established a collision course between our Constitution and our \neconomy.\n  In a game of chicken, we will approach the year the balanced budget \namendment comes into effect, without the capacity to comply with its \nmandate.\n  If we wait until the last minute, when huge budget cuts will be \nrequired--over $300 billion for the deficit in 2002--we will swerve, \nand avoid the economic crash that deficit reduction on that scale would \ncause.\n  At that point, the balanced budget amendment will not keep us from \nextending the year of reckoning yet further into the future. As we all \nknow, it will not make deficit spending--at any level--\nunconstitutional.\n  Lest we forget, Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment makes \ndeficits difficult, not illegal.\n  And if we make use of the established procedure in the amendment to \npermit continued deficits--probably rightly, if the cost would be a \ndisastrous recession--we will only add to the frustration and anger of \nthe American people.\n  The balanced budget amendment will be not just another empty promise \nfrom Washington, but the most cynical one of all--one that we were \nwilling to put into the Constitution, but not into action.\n  And so Mr. President, to avoid making a mockery of our constitutional \nduties, to avoid a collision between the Constitution and the economy, \nto provide the American people the facts they need to make an informed \ndecision, we should adopt this right-to-know amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment to \nrequire us to pass a detailed plan on how we will balance the budget \nbefore we act to send this proposed balanced budget amendment to the \nStates for ratification. This amendment makes good sense because it \nrequires us to consider in the here and now--not at some undefined time \nin the future--just what steps we will take to get our books in order. \nI support getting us to a balanced budget. And I support tough cuts in \nprograms to get us there. But taken alone, I am not convinced that a \nbalanced budget amendment will get us to make those tough cuts. Taken \nalone, I am not convinced that a balanced budget amendment will get us \nin balance by the year 2002. In fact, taken alone, I am concerned that \nthe balanced budget amendment may have the unintended consequence of \ntaking us further, not closer to, the goal of a balanced budget.\n  That is why I support this right to know amendment. What I do not \nsupport is an amendment which might make us all feel better but will \nnot make us behave better with taxpayer dollars. Taken alone, the \nbalanced budget amendment is long on the atmospherics and short on the \ndetails--the amendment does not take Social Security off the table, it \ndoes not provide for a continued strong national defense, it does not \nrequire us to choose difficult cuts over increased taxes. And although \nI know it is not intended to be I am fearful that this amendment is \npotentially dangerous to our economic \n[[Page S2306]]  health. I say potentially dangerous because I am \nfearful that this amendment may lull us into a false sense of \nsecurity--that we have balanced the budget just by saying we will do \nso.\n  Mr. President, this Chamber has just spent long hours debating the \nunfunded mandates bill. The idea behind that bill is that we should not \npass on costs to other levels of government, particularly if we have no \nclear idea what those costs will be. In a certain sense if ever there \nwas an unfunded mandate it is asking the States to ratify the balanced \nbudget amendment without fessing up to what that amendment will cost. \nBy refusing to give the details on how we will achieve the goal of a \nbalanced budget, we are hiding the costs, and pushing the tough \ndecisions we must make into the future. We may also be pushing the \ncosts of getting our financial house in order onto our States and our \nlocalities. At least one Treasury study shows that a balanced budget \namendment would reduce Federal grants to Connecticut by $1 billion a \nyear. Treasury estimates that if Social Security and defense are off \nthe table, Connecticut would be faced with truly draconian cuts in \neducation, job training and the environment.\n  If those are the decisions we intend to make, then let us debate \nthem. If they are decisions that we would prefer to avoid, let us \nfigure out what we can support in a rational and thoughtful way. What \nwe really need to do, is figure out how we intend to get to a balanced \nbudget and map out that strategy. If we are serious about balancing the \nbudget, the least we can do is provide those details and start working \ntoward our goal. Because I believe that it is both desirable and \npossible to come up with a workable roadmap to a balanced budget, I \nstrongly support the right-to-know amendment which calls for a 7-year \napproach to get us to a balanced budget by the year 2002. This approach \nmakes good sense and prods us toward action sooner rather than later.\n  The consequences of waiting are daunting and quite frankly, the \nbalanced budget amendment gives us the excuse to wait. If we wait until \nthe year 2002, when this amendment would go into effect, the \nCongressional Budget Office [CBO] has estimated that we would need to \ncut $322 billion--that is billion with a ``b''--out of the Federal \nbudget in a single year. That would create national, local and personal \nchaos. What we need to do is start acting now by making the kind of \ntough spending cuts that will bring us closer to our goal of a balanced \nbudget and by implementing policies that will help our economy to grow \nin a healthy way.\n  Standing in front of the mirror and announcing that you are going to \nlose 10 pounds does not take the weight off, dieting and exercise does. \nThat is what this Chamber must pledge to do. As Hobart Rowen noted a \nfew weeks ago, ``By itself, such an amendment would cut neither a \ndollar nor a program from the Federal budget.''\n  As anyone who has read the resolution mandating a balanced Federal \nbudget can tell you, it is sketched with a very broad brush. It \nexcludes nothing from the requirements of a balanced budget--not Social \nSecurity, not defense, not veterans' benefits. Nor does it leave higher \ntaxes off the table. And it allows 40 rather than 50 percent of the \nHouse and Senate to hold up the entire Federal budget in the event that \nthere is a Federal deficit. I have spent a tremendous amount of time \nexploring ways to bring that deficit down. At the same time, I do not \nsupport increasing the power of large States with lots of Members of \nthe House. By decreasing the number of House Members needed to hold up \nthe budget we would be doing just that. When you come from a small \nState like mine, changing the rules in this way just does not sit well.\n  I want us to balance the budget in a responsible and thoughtful way. \nFor this reason, I support drawing up a 7-year plan toward that goal. \nRegardless of what happens in this particular debate, I hope that all \nof us in this Chamber will pledge to work together to make that happen.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of this commonsense \namendment to the balanced budget proposal. No matter what our beliefs \nare on the wisdom of this amendment, we should at least ensure \nAmerica's right to know who will be hurt and what will be cut if we \npass a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  It would seem to me, Mr. President, that notwithstanding any \nSenator's position on this legislation, this amendment--which simply \nrequires that we be honest about the impact of our actions--is little \nto ask in the face of such a monumental constitutional change.\n  Frankly, I cannot imagine that we would consider passing any piece of \nlegislation, regardless of the subject, without doing our best to \nunderstand as much as possible about its potential impact on the \ngeneral public. Is that not, in fact, our fundamental responsibility as \nlegislators? Is that not what we were sent here to do?\n  Is that not what we just asked in the legislation this body passed \nnot more than a week ago that required the CBO to advise us of the \nimpact on State and local governments of the unfunded mandates bill?\n  I have to say, Mr. President, I am somewhat confused. The same \nSenators who insisted on knowing the nature and the exact impact of \nthat legislation are now arguing that we do not need to know the \nfinancial impact of our actions. Are we not supposed to know what we \nare doing here?\n  I ask you, are we not obligated--as a body--``to protect the \npeople,'' as Madison said in his Journal of the Federal Convention \n``against the transient impressions into which they themselves might be \nled.''\n  And here we are, legislating by impressions. That is exactly what we \nare doing if we do not show the people what this means.\n  We do not need to know the contents. We do not need to know how it \nworks or what it does, we just need to buy it, we are told.\n  Mr. President, is this the modern day equivalent of the ``traveling \nsalvation show'' complete with snake oil and magic elixirs that cure \nall of our ills? We do not need to know what is in it. Trust us. It \nworks.\n  Have we lost our perspective here? Have we lost all touch with \nreality? I wonder if anyone in this Chamber can go home to his or her \nconstituents and say, ``Ladies and gentlemen who elected me, I have \nabsolutely no idea what this legislation will do. However, I've been \nassured that everything will be fine. Trust me, and thank you for your \ncontinued support.''\n  And yet here we are suggesting that we pass this constitutional \namendment and worry about the details later. By God, let us be honest \nwith our constituents.\n  If achieving a balanced budget by 2002--with half of the budget \nprotected from cuts--will cost my State, annually, $1.9 billion in \nFederal grants, then let us be honest about it.\n  If a balanced budget will cost Massachusetts $248 million in highway \ntrust fund grants, $459 million in lost funding for education, job \ntraining, the environment, and housing, then let us be honest about it.\n  If--over 7 years--it will cost over $1 billion in Medicaid, and \nalmost $2\\1/2\\ billion in Medicare, then let us be honest.\n  Mr. President, what are we afraid of? If we support it, let us talk \nabout it. If we believe in it, let us defend it. But I implore you, let \nus be honest about the impact of what we do here. It is our job. It is \nour obligation. It is our only mandate from the people who sent us \nhere.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been informed that the majority \nleader is in meetings which he cannot interrupt.\n  (At the request of Mr. Hatch, the following statement of Mr. Dole was \nordered to be printed in the Record):\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let us be clear about one thing. Whether or \nnot the Senate votes to approve the balanced budget amendment, \nRepublicans intend to offer a detailed 5-year budget plan that will put \nus on a path toward a balanced budget by 2002--a test that President \nClinton's latest budget makes no attempt to meet.\n  The Daschle amendment is a poorly crafted, last-ditch effort to \nthwart the will of the American people who overwhelmingly support a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. The distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and the distinguished chairman \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, and others have already made \nthat point.\n  [[Page S2307]] The Daschle amendment is an effort to change the \nsubject. Rather than debate the value of making a balanced Federal \nbudget a national priority, most opponents of the balanced budget \namendment would prefer talk about potential cuts that might affect \ntheir pet programs.\n  This bait-and-switch effort will not work.\n  This Congress will put forward a plan to control Federal spending and \nmove us toward a balanced budget without touching Social Security and \nwithout raising taxes. Everything else, every Federal program from \nAmtrak to zebra mussel research will be on the table. For those who \nwant an idea of how we would try to achieve this goal, look at the \nRepublican alternative budgets that have been introduced in each of the \npast 2 years.\n  Mr. President, it is ironic that on April 1, 1993, the vast majority \nof those who now support the Daschle right-to-know amendment voted to \nadopt a budget blueprint paving the way for President Clinton's massive \ntax increase before President Clinton submitted the legally required \ndetails of his plan to Congress. They voted to adopt a budget blueprint \nthat called for a massive tax increase without knowing the specifics.\n  This debate is different. It is a lot simpler. The central issue is \nwhether or not we should vote to make balancing the budget a national \npriority. We are debating whether or not future generations of \nAmericans--our children and our grandchildren--deserve constitutional \nprotection. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  This year, we have a real chance to approve a balanced budget \namendment and send it to the States for ratification. It is the best \nchance we have had in years. Every single vote matters.\n  Several Senators who voted for a balanced budget amendment in the \npast are now under tremendous pressure from the special interests and \nothers who are addicted to Federal spending. The special interests are \ntrying to convince past supporters of the balanced budget amendment to \nswitch their votes. I hope that every Senator who supports the balanced \nbudget amendment will continue to stand firm, do what is right for our \nchildren and our grandchildren, and vote for the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Let us get on with the real debate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to just read a few of the \ndistinguished majority leader's remarks because I think they are very \nappropriate.\n  I will read these for and on behalf of the majority leader:\n\n       * * * Mr. President, it is ironic that on April 1, 1993 the \n     vast majority of those who now support the Daschle right-to-\n     know amendment voted to adopt a budget blueprint paving the \n     way for President Clinton's massive tax increase before \n     President Clinton submitted the legally required details of \n     his plan to Congress.

Mr. President, my statement today is the second in a \nseries on Butte, MT, and the attractions it offers the Micron \nsemiconductor company. I would like to focus today on Butte's top-notch \nhigher education facilities, particularly in technical fields.\n  Foremost among these is Montana Tech. Under the dynamic leadership of \nMontana Tech president, Lindsay Norman, Montana Tech has grown and \ndeveloped into one of the best small engineering and science schools in \nthe country.\n  A former vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, Mr. \nNorman really understands business, and has made it his mission to \nensure that Montana Tech's programs reflect the needs of the private \nsector.\n  As I pointed out yesterday, a recent survey of college presidents \nvoted Montana Tech the best small college science program in the United \nStates--the best, No. 1. Other surveys show that this is no fluke. \nMoney Guide magazine rated Montana Tech one of the top 15 best buys in \ncollege education in the southwest and mountain States. And last year, \nU.S. News & World Report ranked Montana Tech the No. 1 educational \nvalue among western regional universities.\n  Let me repeat. The U.S. News & World Report ranked Montana Tech the \nNo. 1 educational value among western regional universities.\n  Established in 1895 as the Montana School of Mines, Montana Tech \nhistorically focused on mineral and energy-related engineering \nprograms. It now offers undergraduate and graduate programs in a \nmultitude of science and engineering disciplines, including computer \nscience, environmental engineering, hydrogeological engineering, and \nmathematics.\n  Montana Tech also offers a broad range of courses in the humanities \nand social sciences. In addition, the college has an active continuing \neducation program which offers night courses for adults.\n  [[Page S2308]] The university has said that it would work closely \nwith Micron to make sure class offerings not only meet the educational \nneeds of Micron's employees but convene at appropriate times for \nMicron's work force.\n  Altogether, Montana Tech offers Micron a top-quality source of new \nrecruits, and the perfect place to ensure that existing employees are \nable to upgrade their technical and computer skills.\n  Also located in Butte is the Butte Division of Technology, whose 41-\nacre site offers occupational training. Its strength is its ability to \nmeet immediate and short-term training needs of regional industry and \nbusinesses, as well as to constantly update and revise its courses of \ninstruction in order to meet changing market demands.\n  Finally, of course, Butte's educational resources are not limited to \nButte-Silver Bow County. The city is strategically located at the \ncenter of the southwestern Montana technology corridor at the \nintersection of Interstates 90 and 15.\n  Thus, in addition to Montana Tech and the Division of Technology, \nMicron employees would have easy access to Montana State University at \nBozeman [MSU], Carroll College in Helena, and the University of Montana \nat Missoula. These institutions together have combined research and \nengineering programs that exceed $49 million a year.\n  Education has always been a top priority for Montanans. As Michael \nMalone, the president of Montana State University and the dean of \nMontana historical scholars, writes, as early as 1900 our State boasted \none of the Nation's highest literacy rates.\n  Our earliest State education laws paid special attention to technical \nand scientific fields. That commitment continues today in top-quality \ninstitutions like Montana Tech. And it is a perfect fit for a company \nlike Micron.\n  If I might, Mr. President, it is interesting to make another \nobservation. Last year, the senior Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] \npresented in the Democratic Caucus two charts. One chart listed the per \ncapita State expenditure for elementary and secondary education, ranked \nwith the most expensive on down to the least expensive. That is, the \ntop States spend more dollars per pupil in elementary and secondary \neducation on down to the States that spend the fewest number of dollars \nper pupil.\n  Next to that was another chart. It ranked, in descending order, \nStates whose elementary and secondary students do best in mathematics, \nthe best States being at the top, the worst States down at the bottom. \nSenator Moynihan put the charts side by side and asked a very pertinent \nquestion: What on Earth could one deduce by looking at these two \ncharts? One is that there is no correlation, zero correlation, between \nthe number of dollars spent per pupil on the one hand, and how \nelementary and secondary students ranked in mathematics performance on \nthe other.\n  Finally, the Senator pointed out, in a way only he can, combinations, \nand in seeing linkages that others do not see, he said that one can \ndraw only one conclusion by comparing the two charts and, that is, if \nyou want your kids to have the best math education, either live in \nMontana or live in the State adjoining Montana, because the States that \nhave the highest rankings of mathematics are the States of Montana, the \nDakotas, and Wyoming.\n  I mention this to point out the commitment the State of Montana gives \nto education in general, and particularly the commitment Butte gives to \nits people, Montana Tech and related universities, so that Micron will \ndo very well if it comes to Butte. Butte wants Micron and will make any \nnecessary adjustments to tailor its operations to Micron.\n  This is the second in a series of statements I will make. I will make \nanother speech regarding the ties between Micron and Butte on Monday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/08/senate-section/article/S2307-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECESS UNTIL 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to address the \nSenate about the amendment we hope to offer in the immediate future. \nThat is the amendment regarding the exclusion of Social Security from \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we lost the amendment that has been \ndebated on this floor for a week dealing with the right to know; that \nis, whether the American public should be able to understand the \nglidepath that will allow this Government to arrive at a balanced \nbudget by 2002. That was denied. The American public does not have the \nright to know how we are going to arrive at that balanced budget by the \nyear 2002.\n  I hope, though, Mr. President, that the next matter we are going to \ndiscuss, namely, Social Security, would be something the American \npublic should have the right to know. How are we going to handle Social \nSecurity in the overall mix of this balanced budget amendment?\n  It would seem to me that senior citizens, but just as importantly all \nthe people of this country, men and women who are working for a living \nand those people who yet will work, should be entitled to know how we \nare going to handle Social Security.\n  I, frankly, am disappointed the way it was handled in the other body. \nIn my opinion, the other body in handling this, in passing House Joint \nResolution 17, recognized how weak their references were to protect \nSocial Security. They did not even go to the trouble of introducing a \nstatute, trying to pass a statute. They had a concurrent resolution \nthat passed by a vote of 412-18 that has, Mr. President, the authority \nof this blank piece of paper.\n  I suggest that we would all be well advised to get to the debate on \nSocial Security, to have a determination made by this body whether we \nwill exclude Social Security from the stringencies of the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that we are in a \nperiod of morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And I may be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, following on the comments by the Senator \nfrom Nevada, let me ask the Senator from Nevada a question. The right-\nto-know amendment was an amendment \n     [[Page S2309]] offered by the Senator from Nevada, myself, \n     and many others who felt that it was important to try to \n     understand: Is this a promise to balance the budget, or is it \n     a promise with a plan this time to balance the budget? Lord \n     knows the American people have had a barrel full of promises.\n  Was there something behind it? If there is, as one of the leaders in \nthe other body said, the plan is so significant it will make America's \nknees buckle. It will make the knees buckle of the American people if \nwe ever told them what is required. The question many ask is, should \nnot the American people understand what it is they are talking about? \nWhat will buckle people's knees? Is there a plan? Is this a mystery \nplan that we are not allowed to understand or see? Well, we had a vote \non that and the vote was no. This is a program, but we do not want you \nto see the plan, if there is one. We are not sure there is one.\n  Second question: Will, in the process of balancing the budget, the \nCongress decide to take Social Security trust funds and use them to \nbalance the Federal budget? After all, the Social Security trust funds \ncome from dedicated taxes to be used for only one purpose. They go into \nthe Social Security trust fund to be used for Social Security. It is a \ncontract between those who work and those who are retired.\n  The question is, yes or no, does someone intend to use receipts from \nthe Social Security trust fund to balance the budget? The Social \nSecurity system has not caused one penny of the Federal deficit. This \nyear it is running a surplus of $70 billion. This is not a difficult \nquestion. It is easy to understand, and it is even easier to answer--\nyes, or no.\n  I think the Senator from Nevada understands, because of the way the \nconstitutional amendment that is on the floor is proposed, the wording \nsays receipts mean all receipts including Social Security receipts. \nBecause it is worded that way, one cannot correct this problem in any \nother way except to amend the constitutional amendment that is on the \nfloor.\n  I hope the Senator from Nevada will move as quickly as possible and \nthat when we debate that amendment--I hope that is the next amendment \nthe Senate will consider--we will get an up or down vote. I do not \nthink we should have a ricochet vote on this, I do not think we should \nbounce around on various procedural motions.\n  I think the question can be answered simply yes or no, are we going \nto use the Social Security trust funds to balance the budget? Is it the \nSenator's intention to offer this as the next amendment if that is in \norder, and do we hope to get a recorded vote on the question, yes or \nno?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from North Dakota asked two \nquestions. Is there a plan? I have to answer that, yes, I think there \nis a plan, and it is not one that people who are now depending on \nSocial Security would like. I think the plan is to raid the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  The second question, do I want to vote on my amendment? The answer is \nyes, I think we have to have a vote on the amendment. It is the only \nthing that would be fair to the American public. Is the Social Security \ntrust fund a separate trust fund? The answer to that is yes.\n  I would also say to my friend from North Dakota that it is \ninteresting that those Members who are pushing so hard for the Social \nSecurity exclusion are people who support the balanced budget \namendment. The Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Nevada \nare not people here trying to deep six the balanced budget amendment. I \nbelieve in a balanced budget amendment. And I have heard speeches on \nthis Senate floor by our colleague, who I do see on the floor in front \nof me, from North Dakota, the senior Senator from North Dakota. He has \ntalked many, many times about the need to balance this budget. Those \npeople that are pushing for the Social Security trust fund to be \nexcluded are people--the most vocal--are people who support the \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, can the Senator think of any reason that \nsomeone would want to vote no on an amendment like this, unless one had \ndesigns on using the Social Security revenues to balance the budget? I \ncannot think of any other reason.\n  I came here this morning and said I do not ask anybody for five \nreasons or even three if it is hard for somebody. I just ask for one \nsimple, easy-to-understand reason from somebody that would say, ``Here \nis why we do not want to include this,'' because, I guess, the only \nreason that is plausible is that we would like to use the Social \nSecurity revenues at some point to balance the budget. Is there any \nother possible reason for someone not wanting to vote for this?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from North Dakota, as I \nhave said on this floor on another occasion, the answer is, that is \nwhere the money is. As Willie Sutton, the famous bank robber said when \nhe was let out of prison, they asked, ``Why do you rob banks?'' And he \nsaid, ``That is where the money is.''\n  The Social Security trust fund is where the money is. That is why \nthere are some who do not want to exclude it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's comments. The problem with \nthose of us here is we get confused by labels--what is conservative and \nwhat is liberal. You get totally confused, because the conservative \napproach, it seems to me, is to balance the budget the way it is \nsupposed to be balanced. And the way it is supposed to be balanced is \nyou set the Social Security trust fund aside and balance the budget \ndeficit. That it seems to me is a conservative approach.\n  Yet, it seems to me that most who call themselves conservatives say, \n``Gee, we don't want to do that.'' That position, apparently, is a \nliberal position. Maybe we ought to all change seats here for a while, \nbecause I just do not understand why we are in this quandary.\n  This ought to be the simplest of questions to answer: Do we want to \nbalance the budget by raiding the Social Security trust fund? The \nanswer is, of course not. Do we want to balance the budget? The answer \nis, of course.\n  I take a back seat to nobody on this subject. I have been in charge \nof waste task forces, identified $80 billion of Federal spending we \nought to eliminate, much of which we have not. The fact is that still \ndoes not deal with the deficit. We have an abiding deep deficit problem \nthat we have to deal with. That is why I voted for balanced budget \namendments in the past. It is why I likely will in the future, but \nthere is a right way and wrong way to do things.\n  Those who come to the floor say, ``We want to cut taxes and increase \ndefense.'' I want them to come to the floor to say to us, if we intend \nto do that, cut taxes and increase defense, how do you get to where you \nwant to get to, how do you balance the budget? Do you do it by taking \nSocial Security funds? Not with my consent you do not. That is not \nhonest. That is not an honest approach.\n  I hope when the Senator from Nevada offers his amendment that we can \nhave an up-or-down vote on the merits of the amendment and we can \nunderstand what are the virtues of conservatism here: Pay your bills \nand treat money the way you promised people you would treat money. \nThese principles hold especially true with Social Security.\n  We told people, we promise you we will put it in a trust fund, we \npromise you we will keep it there. That will not be the case, if it is \nthen used sometime later to offset tax cuts, much of which will go to \nthe wealthy, and offset defense spending increases at a time when we \nare choking on Federal deficits. That is the dilemma. I hope we can \nclarify this and have a very simple vote after an honest debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the reason this debate is so important is \nbecause we are talking about issues that have enormous implications for \nthe future, and the implications are a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States that would have, as its predicate, \nthat we would loot the Social Security trust funds of $636 billion over \nthe next 7 years in order to have the operating budget of the United \nStates balanced.\n  That is just a fundamentally flawed strategy. It is not right. Any \nCEO in this country, if they went before their board of directors and \nsaid that their \n[[Page S2310]] plan for balancing the operating budget of the \ncorporation was to loot the trust funds of their employees, that \nindividual would be on his or her way to a Federal facility and, as I \nsaid moments ago in the press gallery, it would not be the U.S. \nCongress, it would be the Federal facility they would be headed for. \nThey would be headed for a Federal penitentiary because that is fraud. \nUnfortunately, that is what is occurring with respect to the budget of \nthe United States now.\n  Social Security trust fund surpluses are being used to fund the \noperating expenses of the United States. What is fundamentally wrong \nabout that is that we are using a regressive payroll tax to fund not \nthe retirement systems of Americans but instead we are using those \nfunds to understate the real budget deficit we confront in this \ncountry. And now we have a constitutional amendment before us that \nwould take that approach and put it in the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, that cannot be the result of this balanced budget \namendment debate. We should never allow a trust fund to be looted in \norder to achieve balance, and we should never put that kind of \nconstruct into the Constitution of the United States. That is \nprofoundly wrong.\n  I am just very hopeful that we can get to a vote and a debate on the \namendment that Senator Reid and others of us will be offering. It is an \namendment Senator Reid and I offered last year, along with my colleague \nSenator Dorgan. I understand that there are others who are proposing an \nalternative mechanism and vehicle for the implementing language. Let me \njust say, this Senator would never accept that kind of pale imitation. \nThat is not going to suffice.\n  We are talking about an amendment to the organic law of the United \nStates: The Constitution of the United States. That is the document \nthat each of us swore to uphold when we took the oath of office. We are \ntalking about a Contract With America; that is the contract with \nAmerica that counts.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been listening with interest to the \ndebate on what very likely will be an upcoming amendment with regard to \nwhether or not we are eventually going to get to a vote on the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  As the Chair knows, this Senator has been very much involved in all \nof this because while I think that there are many good reasons for not \nhaving a balanced budget amendment as a part of the Constitution, I \nthink after the years that I have served here and on the Budget \nCommittee, I must say that without that discipline that I think we have \nexhibited in the past by the tendencies that seem to prevail and by the \nfact that we have not even come close to balancing the Federal budget, \nI am convinced that with the reservations that are obviously in order, \nand many of them well taken, this Senator believes that we have to have \na constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget.\n  I think the arguments that are being made today with regard to Social \nSecurity are good ones. Many of my close friends, with whom I have \nworked for many, many years in this body, are supporting that kind of \nan amendment.\n  I guess the question comes down to in this Senator's mind: How are we \ngoing to fashion, if we can, 67 votes in this body to pass a \nconstitutional amendment? The more I see and the more I hear, the more \nfearful I come to the conclusion that maybe it is not possible, maybe \nsome of these votes that were taken pro and con on this issue are going \nto simply give cover to one group or one party or one Member to vote \nagainst the balanced budget amendment.\n  I say in all candor, Mr. President, one of the big problems we have \nis that I am not sure a majority of this body understand the difficulty \nwe have once we have passed a constitutional amendment and assume that \nwill be ratified by three-fourths of the States.\n  Another way of putting it would be that passing the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, as was done with great fervor, with \ngreat fanfare, and with great flag waving on the Contract With America, \nwas the easy part. That was not necessarily the time for celebration. \nThat was done in the House of Representatives, I would suggest, without \nfully informing the Members of the House of Representatives, 435 of \nthem, and certainly not informing the State legislators who are going \nto have to vote, three-fourths of them, before such a constitutional \namendment, if it passes the Senate, would be enforceable.\n  Certainly last, but far from least, I do not believe the American \npeople have been afforded an opportunity to fully understand what all \nof this means. In fact, I am very much concerned because I saw a poll \nthe other day that I suspect is accurate. I think it kind of represents \nwhat I have heard from various sources. That is, that 72 percent of the \nAmerican public strongly support a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget, but 47 percent of the American public think the budget can \nbe balanced by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse.\n  I say to the people of the United States that they have been sorely \nmisled, indeed, if they believe the Federal budget can be balanced by \nthe year 2002 with the elimination of waste, fraud and abuse. No one in \nthis body and no one over on the House of Representatives side really \nbelieves we should have one dollar or one penny of waste, fraud and \nabuse. And I can understand how the public has been abused on that \nbecause of the time and attention that has been paid to $1,400 toilet \nseats and $200 hammers and other things of that nature, which is \nridiculous on its face.\n  There was a half an hour program on the prominent show called \nNightline a couple of weeks ago, a whole half-hour devoted to whether \nor not we should dispose of the $268 million we are spending annually \nto subsidize public radio and public television, and that is a very \nlegitimate debate. There are two sides of discussion on that, and both \nof them can make a point. But when you talk about that, even if we \nwould eliminate any and all assistance, taxpayer assistance to public \nradio and public television, that $238 million, although it is an awful \nlot of money, is such a small, infinitesimal amount of the deficit that \nif we eliminated that and all such programs it would not even put a \nminor, thimble-sized dent in the budget deficit.\n  Another way of putting all of it is that far too much attention is \nbeing focused on shortcomings in the budget process and not enough \nattention is being given to the significant cuts that are going to have \nto be made to balance the budget in the year 2002 as would be required \nunder a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I guess another way of saying this is that I am not sure all of it \nhas been put in proper perspective. I voted earlier today for the \namendment offered by the Democratic leader called the right-to-know-\namendment. I voted for that amendment not because I was particularly \nexcited, nor did I really feel we should go so far as to incorporate \nsuch language as the Daschle amendment, of which I was a cosponsor, \ninto the Constitution of the United States of America.\n  I would guess that probably, if we would have passed that and it had \nbeen included, it would be the first time in the history of the United \nStates of America such language would have been incorporated in with a \nconstitutional amendment. And so I caution with regard to what we \nshould be putting into the Constitution.\n  I was a cosponsor, and I voted for that amendment, trying to have a \nbetter understanding, trying to bring the two sides, the Democrats and \nthe Republicans, together on this issue. And even had it passed, which \nI suspected that it would not have, we maybe could have taken that out \nand gotten back to a constitutional amendment at least somewhat in the \nform of the constitutional amendments that have been passed in the \npast. Certainly I would be one of those to say we should amend the \nConstitution with considerable restraint.\n  Now, back to the matter of Social Security. The Senator has stood at \nthis \n[[Page S2311]] desk before, as I stand here today, to say I think many \ngood points have been made by those who do want to protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund. And I wish to do that also. I have said that even \nif the coming constitutional amendment would be passed without such \nprotection, at least this Senator very likely would not ever agree to \nraid the Social Security trust funds. My only appeal is that possibly \nthere is a way we could sit down and work together to come up with some \ntype of arrangement offering proper guarantees to the logical \nprotection of the Social Security trust fund which I think have been \noutlined very effectively and precisely by many of my colleagues who \nhave spelled out this matter in this Chamber.\n  Let me put it another way, if I might, Mr. President. I would be \nwilling to sit down with anyone, any group, any combination of groups \nto see if we could factor in some type of workable compromise which \nwould get us the 67 votes that are necessary, and I think we should try \nto get, to proceed to have a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget and then refer it to the States.\n  So I would simply like to ask, Mr. President, if there is any way \nthat we could assure--and under those conditions I might vote with my \ncolleagues who are offering the Social Security amendment, if I could \nhave the assurance of some of those who are proposing the amendment \nthat they then would turn around and be one of the 67 votes we need to \npass the constitutional amendment.\n  Putting together 67 votes in the Senate on this issue is going to be \na very difficult task. From the counting that I have done as of now--it \nis not infallible because I think there is some shifting going on, but \nit would appear to me very likely, if we had the vote today, the final \nvote on sending a constitutional amendment to the States by the Senate \nwould fail.\n  Given that concern of mine, I would simply say to my colleagues on \nboth sides of this issue, and both sides on the many other issues that \nare likely to be brought forth on this matter: Let us try to work \ntogether. I do not think anyone has the wisdom, the knowledge, the \nintellect to be able to solve all of these problems. As a body of 100 \npeople who are charged to represent their constituents and the people \nof the United States as a whole, I just hope we can get together. I \nthink there are many of us who share the goal. All of us do not----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I hope we can maybe come together on some kind of \ncompromise, some kind of understanding that does not so weaken and \nchange the constitutional amendment to balance the budget that it will \nnot work.\n  Last but not least, whatever we do, I think we must--we have the \nobligation to go far further than we have as of now, to explain how \ndifficult this will be, and the sacrifices that probably every American \nis going to have to make to get it accomplished.\n  I outlined in a speech 10 days ago some of the major concerns in this \narea, that I would reference as a part of my speech. That might be \nreferred to.\n  Mr. President, I call for cooperation to get a balanced budget \namendment passed by the Senate. That is most important of all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kohl pertaining to the introduction of S. 274 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nturn to the consideration of the original joint resolution to be \noffered by Senators Simon, Breaux, and others regarding Social \nSecurity, and that during the consideration of the Senate joint \nresolution, no amendments be in order and debate be limited to 2 hours \nto be equally divided in the usual form. I further ask that immediately \nfollowing the conclusion or yielding back of the time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the resolution without any intervening debate or \nmotion.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \ndisposition of the Senate joint resolution, the Senate resume \nconsideration of House Joint Resolution 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I respectfully object to the leader's \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is being offered on behalf of \nthe Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, and Senators Daschle, Dorgan, \nConrad, Feinstein, Ford, Harkin, Heflin, Graham, Kohl, Baucus, Boxer, \nHollings, Mikulski, and Leahy.\n  Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It really is. It will \ntake some time during the next few days to talk about this amendment. \nBut it is an amendment to determine what we are going to do about \nSocial Security. In effect, this amendment excludes from the balanced \nbudget amendment the Social Security trust fund as it relates to the \nold-age pension aspect thereof.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the balanced budget amendment. If \nSocial Security is excluded, I will vote for the balanced budget \namendment. As a veteran of a number of debates in this body on this \nissue, I am fairly well versed on persuasive arguments for the balanced \nbudget amendment. There are people who I have heard--including my \nfriend, the senior Senator from Utah--over the years make very, very \npersuasive arguments why it is important that this country have a more \nsound fiscal policy and why it is necessary to have a balanced budget \namendment. Some would say in debating this issue--that is, whether we \nshould include Social Security or exclude it from balanced budget \namendment--that it is a very painful vote, and it perhaps is. This body \nwould be forced to make a determination as to whether or not the \nproceeds of Social Security, and the old-age pension aspect thereof, \nwould be excluded from this balanced budget amendment when it would \nbecome part of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, we have all been called upon as legislators, and those \nwho served as Governor or Lieutenant Governors in States or mayors of \ncities, to make decisions that are difficult sometimes. I remember one \nof the most difficult decisions I had to make as a Senator in this \nbody, which I was relating to my friend, the senior \n[[Page S2312]] Senator from New Mexico, and my colleague, the junior \nSenator from New Mexico, regarding whether a stealth wing should be \ntaken out of the State of Nevada. We had spent the taxpayers' money in \nthis country--about one-half billion dollars--building the secret air \nbase in the deserts of Nevada to test this very exclusive weapon, which \nwas the Stealth fighter bomber. There came a time when it was no longer \nsecret, and therefore the Pentagon made the decision that they would \nmove this Stealth fighter wing from Nevada to New Mexico. It was a \ndifficult decision. It involved many, many jobs, several thousand jobs, \nsomething that was very important to Nevada. But I made the decision \nthat, if the GAO would tell us that it would save this country money to \nmove that wing and that we would be just as secure, I would not object.\n  The General Accounting Office came back in a relatively short period \nof time with the report that it would save money and we would be just \nas strong as a nation if this wing were moved to New Mexico. I \nswallowed hard and watched the wing move to New Mexico without raising \na hand to stop it.\n  Yesterday, I received a call from some of my friends in Nevada that \nthe President's budget called for the elimination of a facility we \nhave--the Bureau of Mines--in Reno doing research. There are not as \nmany jobs, but a job is a job.\n  These are some of the things we have to make decisions on, and it \nappears to me that it is sound fiscal policy to consolidate. And \nperhaps that is the best thing for the country to do. We all have to \nmake tough decisions.\n  This amendment is a tough decision. If we ever are going to balance \nthe budget of the United States, there will have to be a series of very \ndifficult decisions made as to how we will do that. This is different \nthan a simple statute that we are going to amend. It is different \nbecause we are talking about not passing a law; we are talking about \namending the Constitution of the United States.\n  Over the years there have been in this and the other body about 4,000 \nattempts to amend the Constitution. As we know, very, very few have \nbeen accomplished. This is not one of those amendments that is done for \npress releases to be sent home. This is not an attempt made to satisfy \na certain constituency. This is a serious attempt to put language in \nthe Constitution of the United States that would force us to balance \nthe budget. We all know that we have the legal authority to balance the \nbudget right now. But over the decades we have not done a very good job \ndoing that, and, therefore, a majority of the people of this body feel \nthat we should amend the Constitution of the United States to include \nin there a provision mandating a balanced budget. I say a majority. I \nthink we do not know yet that there will be a supermajority; that is, \n67 votes to make this a part of the Constitution. I say now as I have \nsaid before, if Social Security is excluded, I will be one of the 67. \nIf it is not, I will not.\n  I emphasize the U.S. Constitution because, Mr. President, it is \nunlike States balancing their budgets. In the State of Nevada, for \nexample, we just completed the construction of a new State building in \nLas Vegas. That building cost about $400 million. But, no, that is not \na part of the budget that is talked about every year as being a \nbalanced budget in the State of Nevada. The reason that it is not is \nbecause they have bonding authority. Many capital expenditures are \ntaken off budget.\n  This amendment that we have before this body is more stringent than \nthe laws and the constitutions of most all States. Most all States, as \nI mentioned, do not balance their budgets as they say they do because \nthere are capital expenditures which are off budget.\n  This amendment has no smoke and mirrors. If this amendment passes, \neverything will have to be balanced. This will be much different than \nwhen most of us handle our personal lives. If we own a home, we make \npayments on it. Most of us, if we have a car, we make payments on the \ncar, refrigerators, things of that nature. But, if this amendment \npasses, this will not do that. This is not a smoke and mirrors \namendment by any stretch of the imagination.\n  Mr. President, I think that it is important that we recognize that \nbudgeting decisions, assuming we are working on a balanced budget \namendment, will necessarily include all of our operating expenses and \nall of our capital expenditures. That is the legislation that is now \nbefore this body.\n  So I repeat, with all due respect for States that say they balance \ntheir budgets, ours would be honest and truthful budgeting, I think \nmore so than has ever been done at any level of government. Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 guarantees a balanced budget. It does not spell out \nhow we will get there, and I am disappointed that the amendment that we \njust voted on a couple of hours ago failed.\n I think it would have been nice had that passed. I think it would have \ngiven the American public a glidepath of how we are going to arrive at \nthe balanced budget by the year 2002. But that is not what happened. We \nwere only able to get 44 votes.\n\n  The amendment to the Constitution that is pending before this body is \na rule without any exceptions. I believe this balanced budget amendment \nwill ultimately pass because the American people want it to pass. \nIndeed, Mr. President, according to a recent ABC-Washington Post poll, \nwell over 80 percent of the American public wants a balanced budget \namendment to pass. However, when these same people were asked in a \nsubsequent poll, would they want the budget balanced by using Social \nSecurity trust funds, the answer was a resounding 90 percent no.\n  Mr. President, I offered this amendment about a year ago. At that \ntime, I did not know that the American public felt about this the way \nthey did. Had any of us known, there may have been a lot of other \npeople offering the amendment. But we have learned subsequent to last \nyear that the American public feels very strongly about protecting \nSocial Security. I raise this issue not because decisionmaking should \nor ought to be guided by the polls. I believe it should not be, and I \nthink we in political life--at the Federal, State, and local level--\nfollow the polls too much. As my staff will tell anyone who will \nlisten, I am not a believer in polls. Very, very infrequently do I do \npolling.\n  Rather, I raise this issue because much of the rhetoric in the \nbalanced budget debate revolves around carrying out the demands of the \nAmerican people. How often have we heard someone say that the American \npeople are demanding passage of the balanced budget amendment and \nCongress ought to pass it? Well, I think in that same breath we should \nrecognize that they are also demanding action to guard against \nunilateral raiding of the Social Security trust fund to balance the \nFederal budget. Passage of the amendment that is now pending before \nthis body is the only sure-fire assurance that such action will not \noccur.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of promises being thrown around \nduring the balanced budget debate. It should not come as a surprise to \nanyone that in this Chamber and in the other body individuals have said \nthat they will fight against any cut of Social Security. We have some \nspecial interest groups that are saying the same. That is to be \nexpected. There seems to be universal agreement that Social Security \nshould not be used to balance the budget. This agreement, I believe, \ntranscends party lines. Democrats and Republicans alike support \nprotecting Social Security.\n  I have found it interesting to read the Congressional Record, Mr. \nPresident, to see what others are saying about Social Security. When \nthis debate transpired in the other body, I believe it was on the 25th \nof January of this year, a number of people said a number of different \nthings. I had the pleasure of being able to serve in the other body for \na couple of terms and found it a most enjoyable experience. I say that \nthe turnover there has been significant, and I do not know a lot of the \npeople that now serve in that body.\n  However, Mr. President, one of the men that spoke on this issue, one \nof the Members of Congress that spoke on this issue is the Congressman \nthat replaced the former chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, \nCongressman Rostenkowski, by the name of Flanagan. Here is what he \nsaid, among other things:\n\n       The committee shall do nothing to increase Social Security \n     taxes or reduce benefits to achieve that goal.\n\n  [[Page S2313]] That is, balancing the budget. That is what he said.\n  We have another Congressman by the name of Funderburk, who stated:\n\n       The balanced budget amendment will protect Social Security \n     because there will be no more borrowing from the trust funds, \n     which truly protect our Nation's retirees.\n\n  Mr. Hayworth stated:\n\n       One of the previous speakers was quite correct to point out \n     that before there was this contract--\n\n  Meaning the Contract With America that we hear so much about.\n\n     there was enacted a solemn contract with the American people, \n     and we call that Social Security.\n\n  Mr. Wamp indicated:\n\n       We can achieve a balance without touching Social Security. \n     Our party and our leadership are on record opposing cuts in \n     Social Security, and so am I.\n\n  Mr. Chambliss, from the eighth district of Georgia, said:\n\n       Mr. Speaker, let us send a message of assurance to seniors \n     of this great Nation.\n\n  He, of course, is referring to Social Security not being touched.\n  Mr. English of Pennsylvania said:\n\n       At a time when some are talking about a new covenant, we \n     should signal our intent to protect Social Security for those \n     who participate.\n\n  Mr. Young of Florida--and I did not have the pleasure of serving with \nany of the Members I have mentioned until now. I served with Mr. Young \nof Florida. He said, on January 25 of this year:\n\n       It reaffirms what I have long said and supported, that in \n     reducing the Federal budget deficit we should look to cutting \n     spending in those areas which are driving our Nation deeper \n     into debt. That certainly is not the Social Security trust \n     fund, which actually runs an annual surplus--last year $61 \n     billion.\n\n  I could go on with other statements about how Members of the other \nbody talked about the balanced budget amendment. They do not want \nSocial Security to be affected by the balanced budget amendment. They \nare right. It should not be.\n  What my amendment does, Mr. President, is put into writing what we \nhave now only as an oral promise. This disagreement that is the subject \nmatter of this debate seems to center on how best to protect those \ntrust funds. I believe that if I were trying this case to a jury of my \npeers, the jury would return a verdict in favor of this amendment in a \nmatter of minutes. This would not be one where the jury was hung up or \none where they deliberated a long period of time. I would suggest that \nthe debate clearly favors, and will favor, the amendment that the \nSenator from Nevada has offered, along with 14 of his colleagues.\n  Why, Mr. President, do we need to express exemption? Very simple. \nAnything less would be insufficient. If we want to take this off budget \nand exempt it from efforts to balance the budget, it must be done in a \nbinding fashion. I suggest that burying it in implementing legislation, \nas was suggested last week in another debate, is like passing a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution; it has no binding effect. It makes us feel \ngood but, essentially, it is a nonbinding resolution. This language \nwill specifically exclude Social Security.\n  I also submit, Mr. President, that we will hear some debate here on \nthis amendment that will be offered by the senior Senator from Alabama. \nHe, having been former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, is a \nperson who has had long experience on the Judiciary Committee of the \nSenate and somebody we look to for legal advice. He is the Judiciary \nCommittee's legal scholar. He is going to tell this body why this \namendment is essential. If we do not have this amendment--you will hear \nfrom the Senator from Alabama--Social Security must be included in the \nreceipts that will be necessary to balance the budget.\n  Hiding a Social Security exemption in implementing legislation, as I \nsaid, is like playing a shell game with the American people. It is the \nproverbial smoke and mirrors trickery. It is the fig leaf that we have \nheard so much about, or whatever other words that you can connote that \nis a coverup. That is what, in effect, implementing legislation would \nbe.\n  Some want to have their cake and eat it, too. They want to say, \n``Well, we are going to protect Social Security, but we are also going \nto vote for the balanced budget amendment.'' I am not going to do that.\n  Some want to be able to go home and tell their constituents that they \nvoted against touching Social Security. And they may even get by with \nit for a year or two, but it will not be long, because you will have to \ngo after Social Security. And we know that, even if it is more than a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution but a statute that says you want Social \nSecurity, you have the argument from my friend from Alabama, the senior \nSenator, but you also have the argument that there is no place to go. \nYou would have to do that.\n  So, it sounds good, but it is really not what I believe is factual.\n  So I predict the majority of the American people will see through \nthis what I believe is a charade and recognize this proposal, in fact, \nin implementing legislation is offered as a real fig leaf.\n  I want people within the sound of my voice to understand a little bit \nabout the history of Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I first learned about Social Security as a little boy. \nI was born and raised in a very small town in the southern tip of the \nState of Nevada, a place called Searchlight, Nevada. When I grew up, it \nwas a town of less than 250 people. A lot of the Reids lived there. We \nmade up a significant number of the people that lived there. One of the \nReids that lived there during that period of time was my grandmother. \nHer name was Harriet Reid. She was born in England.\n  My grandmother--I can picture her very clearly in my mind's eye, even \nthough she has been dead for many years--was a very short woman and \nvery, very fat. She had trouble walking, and to do her work was very \ndifficult. She had raised eight or nine children.\n  Now, Mr. President, I was a little boy in the late 1940's, but my \ngrandmother got, every month, her old age pension check. That is what \nshe called it, ``My old age pension check.'' That check gave my \ngrandmother, Harriet Reid, it gave her dignity, it gave her \nindependence. Even though she had children that would help her, that \ncheck was a message to everyone that she could make it on her own. She \ndeserved to make it on her own. She worked hard.\n  So I see Social Security in the eyes of my grandmother. And I believe \nthat this amendment is offered on behalf of Harriet Reid and other \ngrandmothers and grandfathers to be.\n  I believe it is important that we understand the reasons for placing \nthis exemption on this balanced budget amendment. My reason, as I have \njust explained, stems from personal reasons and a deeply held \nconviction that the integrity of the Social Security system will be \nviolated unless we do this.\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. In 1935, Social Security passed. It passed, Madam \nPresident, because the American people wanted it to pass. It was really \nat that time, perhaps, an experiment. We did not know if it really \nworked, but it did work.\n  I believe we have heard a lot about the Contract With America. I \nthink that most all the items that my friends are talking about with \nthe Contract With America are good and will help the country.\n  But let us be realistic. The real, valid first contract with America \nwas Social Security. That program has been in existence for 60 years. \nThat is the real contract. And it is a contract that has worked and we \nshould do everything we can to protect the Social Security trust funds.\n  We should do that, Madam President, not only for the Harriet Reids of \nthe world, but also for those children that are now in their beginning \nyears, because we need to provide security for them in their old age, \nalso.\n  President Roosevelt and Members of Congress recognized in 1935 that \nby financing the program by earmarked payroll taxes, we would ensure \nthat a future President and Congress could not morally or politically \nrepeal or mutilate the character of the program.\n  Interestingly, Madam President, President Roosevelt's fears were \nrealized in the early part of the 1980's, when there were attempts made \nto make sweeping cuts in Social Security. Those cuts were repulsed by \nCongress. But Congress came back right away, came back quickly and \nsolved the problems that they were having with Social Security.\n   [[Page S2314]] It was truly a bipartisan commission--Claude Pepper, \nthe man who was known for protecting Social Security; Tip O'Neill, \nPresident Reagan, all these people got together and figured out a way \nto save the Social Security old age pension. And they did a good job. \nSocial Security was not damaged in any way. It was renovated. It was \nrevamped.\n  And we are now celebrating the benefits of that, recognizing that \nlast year there was over $60 billion in surplus, this year over $70 \nbillion in surplus, and those surpluses will continue to increase.\n  So the arguments for defending the Social Security trust funds are \nrooted in the history of the program and that is what is truly unique \nabout our Social Security system. I believe that, in part, it is \nbecause of the structure of the system that Social Security is really \nlike a contract. This is not a giveaway program. This is not welfare \nthat Social Security recipients receive. But, in fact, the employers \nand the employees pay in about 12.5 percent of their salary to put into \na trust fund so that they have some moneys in their later years. So, it \nis their money. They have earned it. They have paid their dues. They \nhave played by the rules.\n  And if you want to know why those of us in Government refer to this \nas the so-called third rail of politics, that is why. People trust that \ntheir funds will be there upon their retirement. It is understandable \nwhy so many are willing and have fought so hard and so long to maintain \nthe integrity of this trust fund.\n  As they used to say in an old advertisement--I believe it was Smith-\nBarney, or one of those companies that sells stocks and bonds--they \nmake their money the old fashioned way, they earn it. That is, in \neffect, what Social Security recipients do and have done.\n  So our obligation as Members of Congress is to recognize the \ncontractual nature of the system and take the necessary steps to honor \nthat agreement.\n  Madam President, our contractual obligation to the people of this \ncountry as it relates to Social Security is similar to the obligation--\nof course, our obligation is on a much larger scale --that I had when I \npracticed law.\n  I had to set up a separate trust fund to put my clients' money in. \nWhen I did that, I could not draw any of that money out for anything \nother than my clients' needs. I could not pay my rent, could not pay my \ncar payment, house payment, rent on the office. I could only use those \nmoneys for my clients. I had a fiduciary duty to my clients to protect \nthose moneys.\n  While lawyers, people who work in banks, and insurance companies \nrecognize the consequences of a fiduciary duty, attorneys are well \naware of the consequences they face for breaching this duty.\n  Any person who violated this fiduciary trust, if they were an \nattorney, would be disbarred. If they were an insurance agent, they \ncould have their license taken away. A real estate agent, the same \nthing. Or they could go to prison. They could go to jail. We have an \nobligation to protect the integrity of the Social Security trust funds. \nWe, too, have fiduciary duty to protect the integrity of these funds, \nnot only as I have mentioned for the seniors of this country, but for \nall working men and women.\n  Madam President, what is this word we are throwing around--fiduciary \nduty? What does it mean? Why does it describe Congress' role in \nmaintaining the Social Security trust fund? I thought it would be \neducational to me--and it gave me an opportunity to look at one of my \nold law books--to talk about from a level perspective, what is a \nfiduciary duty? It means a person holding the character of a trustee \nwith respect to the trust and confidence involved in it and the \nscrupulous good faith and candor which it requires; a person having a \nduty created by his undertaking to act primarily for another's benefit \nin matters connected with such undertaking. This came from Black's Law \nDictionary.\n  It explains that a breach of fiduciary responsibility would make the \ntrustee--and that is what we are--liable to the beneficiaries for any \ndamage caused by such breach.\n  So, Madam President, what penalties do we face for breaching this \nduty? I am sorry to say, not much. I will not be disbarred. I will not \nhave a complaint filed against me with the National Bar Association. \nThe only opportunity that someone has to get back at a Member for \nbreaching our fiduciary duty is in the ballot box.\n  I think they need more protection. I think there needs to be more \nstringent control of the Social Security trust funds than somebody \nsaying, ``If you violate your fiduciary trust, we will vote against \nyou.''\n  My amendment expressly exempts the Social Security trust fund from \nany calculation of Federal deficit. Absent an expressed exemption \nincluded in the constitutional balanced budget amendment, we, the \nguardians of the Social Security trust fund, will be in breach.\n  Unfortunately, Madam President, for the tens of millions of \nbeneficiaries who have paid into this system most all their working \nlives, they will have no remedy. They can have recourse at the ballot \nbox. Sometimes that comes too late. That will not compensate them in \ndollars for their lifelong contribution to the Social Security trust \nfund if we, in effect, raid this fund to balance the budget. It \ncertainly will not help their retirement. The cold, hard fact of the \nmatter is the beneficiaries have a right, but are without a remedy, to \nensure that that right is enforced.\n  I have said the real contract with America is Social Security. And it \nis like a contract. There are many good reasons why the protection of \nthe Social Security trust fund is so important to all Americans. Social \nSecurity is a unique Government program. The program is not, however, \ndifficult to comprehend. Yet its simplicity, I think, Madam President, \nmasks the strong undercurrents of emotions so often espoused when \ndiscussing this Social Security system.\n  People feel so strongly about this issue. Why? Because it involves a \ncontractual agreement that they know that they have with the \nGovernment. The Government and the American people. That is the \ncontract.\n  How many Members have been at town hall meetings where people stand \nup and say, ``Are you going to protect Social Security?'' How many \ntimes have people stood up at Social Security meetings and they say, \n``I am not on welfare. I have worked hard all my life. I want to be \nable to draw my Social Security. Are you going to protect that?''\n  Why is it a contract? This is a word that has been thrown around by \npeople in Government and pundits over the last several months. If we \nstop and think about it, Social Security, I repeat, is best described \nas the true contract with America. It is a contract, or, in other \nterms, an agreement, that benefits all Americans.\n  I have mentioned how we pay into that system. I have mentioned how \npeople who receive that money are not receiving a Government giveaway. \nThey are not collecting money for no reason. I am sure that no one \nenjoys the Social Security payroll deductions that we suffer through on \nour paychecks. It is a lot of money. There is an understanding that in \nmany ways this produces a greater good. We are, in effect, building. We \nare being forced to build a nest egg provided for us in our golden \nyears. That does not seem to be stretching the point at all.\n  To attack Social Security as another Government giveaway program is a \nstraw man. It is a self-financing, self-sustaining, publicly \nadministered contributory retirement program. This program requires \npersonal sacrifice. Through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, \nwhich we call FICA, workers are required to contribute, as we have \ntalked about, 6.2 percent, which is matched by another 6.2 percent by \nthe employers, for 12.4 percent. That is a lot of your paycheck.\n  By law, the funds are required to be held by the Federal Government \nin trust. The key to understanding this system, however, rests in the \nrecognition that all of these dollars that are amassed, the billions \nand soon to be trillions of dollars do not belong to the Federal \nGovernment. They are contributions workers and employers are paying in \nand the workers expect to get back.\n  Our role as Members of this august body is to ensure that there be a \ncontinued vitality of these funds. I believe, in this respect, our \ngreatest obligation is to ensure that retirees receive their \n[[Page S2315]] just compensation. That could apply to people who are 5 \nor 6 years old. We have to ensure that they receive their moneys, as we \ndo someone that is presently drawing Social Security. I say again that \nunless we expressly exempt the Social Security trust funds from any \ncalculation of Federal deficit, we may not be able to meet that \nobligation. Social Security, Madam President, does not contribute to \nthe Federal deficit.\n  Throughout this debate we have talked about rights and obligations, \nboth present and future. I support a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States because I believe that we have an \nobligation to do a better job of balancing the budget than we have been \ndoing. This obligation is owed importantly to future generations of \nfuture Americans.\n  The balanced budget amendment must ultimately provide for a \ngovernment to act in a more fiscally responsible manner. If we do not \nhandle this amendment properly, and my belief if we do not exclude \nSocial Security, we will be not only violating a fiduciary violation \nthat we have, we will be fiscally irresponsible. We must not, through \nthis amendment, loot the Social Security trust fund in order to \neliminate the Federal deficit. This is not fair to the generation which \nhas paid into the system their entire lives, nor is it fair to the \ngenerations in the future that will pay into the system their entire \nlives.\n  In short, because Social Security does not contribute to the Federal \ndeficit in any way, it should not be used to eliminate the Federal \ndeficit.\n  Madam President, we have a chart here. I referred to it as the \nGovernment looting chart, and we have another entitled the same. There \nhave been some who have suggested that the Social Security trust fund \nshould be referred to as the Social Security slush fund. But without \nname calling, we will look at this chart. This chart shows the \nsurpluses as they will accumulate until the year 2002, significant \namounts of money, over $700 billion.\n  We can look at this chart in a different way. It will accomplish the \nsame fact and perhaps it is a little more graphic, Madam President, to \nsee the dollar amounts here.\n  What we would do is show it in this manner. This is how those funds \nare going and should be allowed to accumulate. If we do not have an \nexemption--that is, if my amendment does not pass--in 2002 we will pull \nthis chart out and it will be all white because the moneys will have \nbeen used to balance the budget. That will be a shame.\n  There is no question that the Social Security trust fund surpluses \nare masking the true size of the deficit. In 1995--that is this year--\nwe will take in about $70 billion more than we pay out in benefits out \nof the Social Security trust fund.\n  By the year 2003, Social Security will be running surpluses far in \nexcess of $100 billion a year. By not exempting Social Security in the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment, the smoke and mirror games of \nCongress would simply hide the true deficit problem. Again, the key \nhere is that to the extent that Social Security does not add to the \ndeficit, it ought not be used to eliminate it.\n  I, again, refer to this chart that shows what should accumulate, if \nnothing else happens, in the next 7 years and the amount of money, \nMadam President, that will accumulate during those 7 years in dollar \namounts--over $700 billion, almost a trillion dollars. That should not \nbe used to balance the budget.\n  I stated an hour ago on this floor, and I will state again, some have \nsaid, ``We will have implementing legislation that we are not going to \ndo it,'' and in the House what they did, they had a concurrent \nresolution saying, ``We won't affect Social Security. Why won't you \njust accept it as our word?'' I say that every person who voted for \nthat in the House of Representatives, they certainly have no intention, \nI hope, of raiding the Social Security trust fund, but the resolution \nthey passed is meaningless.\n  Why am I concerned about Social Security? I am concerned about Social \nSecurity because that is where the money is, that is where we have \nlooked before to help balance the budget. I repeat, Willie Sutton, a \nfamous bank robber, got out of jail and they asked him, ``Why did you \nrob banks?'' And he said, ``That's where the money is.''\n  Social Security is where the cash cow is for this Government. Funds \nare running in surplus. We have an obligation to protect that cash cow \nso when people draw down on the Social Security trust fund, they will \nbe able to have a check rather than an IOU.\n  If we do not pass this amendment, this really is a case of robbing \nPeter to pay Paul. Further raiding will certainly occur unless we \nprotect this trust fund.\n  In the late seventies and early eighties, Congress changed the way \nSocial Security was financed. I mentioned that--Claude Pepper, Tip \nO'Neill, President Reagan. The change was a result of Congress' \nrecognition of the large demand on the system that would be created.\n  I should include that the Republican leader was in on that. He was at \nthat time the majority leader of the Senate. This change is the result \nof Congress' recognition of a large demand on the system that would be \ncreated by the retirement of the baby boomer generation. Accordingly, \nthe Social Security system was changed from a pay-as-you-go system to a \nsystem that accumulated large surpluses now to prepare for the vast \nincrease in the number of retirees later.\n  Unfortunately, rather than saving these large surpluses, Congress has \nused them to finance the deficit. This fiscally irresponsible behavior \nis putting us on a collision course toward catastrophe.\n  Madam President, during the Vietnam war, for the first time, the \nSocial Security moneys were used to mask the deficit being developed as \na result of that very unpopular war. So we have had experience in \nCongress of using Social Security moneys to mask the deficit.\n  In the year 2012, Social Security--maybe a little after that, maybe \n2015, maybe 2020--Social Security is going to have to start drawing \ndown. We need to accumulate these huge surpluses now for payout later. \nI served on the Entitlement Commission, a bipartisan group that was \ncharged to look at entitlements, chaired by Republican Senator Danforth \nand Democratic Senator Kerrey from Nebraska. We all know that Social \nSecurity is going to need some adjustment, but let us do it on the \nbasis of Social Security, let us do what we have to do with Social \nSecurity, and not have it when we get around to needing to do something \nand there is no money there.\n  The problem we are facing is clear. Unless we begin saving Social \nSecurity surpluses, unless we begin addressing the needs of the system \nas it stands on its own, we will be leading, I believe, to financial \nArmageddon. That is where we are going if we do not exempt Social \nSecurity from the balanced budget amendment.\n  Specifically exempting Social Security does not mean that we are \nsweeping under the rug, under the carpet, any problem. In fact, we are \nmaking the situation very clear. The situation is this: We want to \nbalance the budget; we want to exclude Social Security trust funds. We \nare saying the reason we need a balanced budget amendment is because we \nare not strong enough, we do not have the courage to do what we have \nthe right to do under the law presently.\n  If we are saying that, and that is one of the reasons that is being \nput forth and has been put forth for a long time as to why we need a \nbalanced budget amendment, it seems to me that that same logic would \ndictate that, Members of Congress, you had better protect Social \nSecurity because otherwise you will not have the courage not to spend \nthose moneys. It would be a lot easier to spend Social Security \nsurpluses than to raise taxes or to cut programs.\n  So we are not sweeping anything under the rug. In fact, we are making \nvery apparent what our problem is.\n  There are few people who will deny that Social Security has some \nproblems that we need to take care of in the long run, but it is in the \nlong run not the short run. Including Social Security in a balanced \nbudget amendment may further exacerbate its already identifiable \nproblem. How should we treat Social Security under the Federal budget?\n  Congress has been struggling with the problems associated with \nSocial \n[[Page S2316]] Security for many years. Historically, however, Madam \nPresident, there seems to be strong congressional intent to protect \nSocial Security. An example of this is how Social Security is treated \nin the Federal budget.\n  In 1990, Congress excluded Social Security from calculations of the \nbudget and largely exempted it from the procedures for developing and \ncontrolling the budget. Its removal from the budget has not changed how \nits funds are handled.\n  Since Social Security's inception, its taxes have been deposited in a \nFederal Treasury and expenditures have been paid from the Treasury. The \nsurplus is credited to trust funds.\n  As I have already mentioned, Social Security has not always been \nconsidered off budget. In 1969, Social Security and other programs that \noperated through trust funds were counted officially in the budget. It \nwas a tax bookkeeping gimmick. This was done administratively and not \nby an act of Congress because we did not have a budgetmaking process at \nthe time. Today, there is strong speculation that the reason it was \nplaced on budget is the reason I have already stated, that in 1969 when \nthe Vietnam war was escalating and it was costing a lot of money, we \nneeded to mask that deficit.\n  There were new changes in how Social Security was treated under the \nbudget in 1974. Under the Congressional Budget Impoundment and Control \nAct, Congress adopted procedures for setting budget goals through \npassage of an annual budget resolution. Like the budgets prepared by \nthe President--like the one that we received yesterday or the day \nbefore--these resolutions were to reflect a unified budget that \nincluded trust fund programs such as Social Security.\n  By the late seventies, Social Security, as we already talked about, \nfaced some new financial problems, and Congress had to deal with the \nincreasing cost to the program. So in 1980, 1981, and ultimately in \n1983, there were benefit cutbacks. At the same time, though, the \nFederal budget deficit remained very large. There was growing concern \nthat the cuts in Social Security were being proposed for budgetary \npurposes rather than for programs that needed to be maintained.\n  Congress responded to these concerns by passing a series of measures \nin 1983, 1985, and 1987. In addition to other things, we made Social \nSecurity a more distinct part of the budget. Points of orders were \nallowed to be raised against budget bills containing Social Security \nchanges. This was a large step forward.\n  By the end of the eighties, Social Security began realizing \nsurpluses, as we talked about earlier today. As a result, Congress \npassed the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990. This excluded Social \nSecurity from the calculations of the budget and exempted it from \nprocedures for controlling spending.\n  The 1990 Budget Enforcement Act put an end to abuse of Social \nSecurity trust funds by declaring them off budget.\n  I think it is interesting to note, Madam President, that that \nlegislation to exclude Social Security trust fund calculations from \ndeficit calculations passed by a vote in this body of 98 to 2. That is \nnot a close call. This body went on record in October 1990 to exclude \nSocial Security trust funds from the deficit calculations by a vote of \n98 to 2.\n  Putting Social Security on budget contradicts clearly Congress' \nintent. It is clear that Social Security's treatment under the Federal \nbudget has been complex; I acknowledge that, and at times confusing; I \nacknowledge that, but Congress has recognized that it is a misuse of \nthe Social Security trust fund to place it on budget. It is a misuse \nbecause it jeopardizes the integrity of the program.\n  Now, off-budget status of these funds is clearly set forth in the \n1990 Budget Act that notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nreceipts and disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \nInsurance Trust Fund shall not be counted as new budget authority, \noutlays, receipts or deficit or surplus for purposes of anything we \ndeal with regarding money, in effect. So it is difficult to examine \nthis section plus the 98-to-2 vote and House Joint Resolution 1, the \nunderlying legislation that is before this body, and not conclude that \nSocial Security is being placed back on budget.\n  Let me tell you why I say that. We are going to have a chart here, \nMadam President, that will show what House Joint Resolution 1 says. And \nif you look at that, it says in section 7 and section 8:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year.\n\n  That is about as clear as it can be, that this should not be \nexceeded.\n  Does this not necessarily include Social Security? If so, does this \nnot run against Congress' historical treatment of Social Security off \nbudget? Would it not overturn Congress' recent decision to confirm the \noff-budget status of Social Security? This overturns the vote we took \nby 98 to 2 to keep Social Security from any way of determining what the \ndeficit is. I respectfully submit that the underlying legislation will \nforce Congress and the President to include Social Security in \nbalancing the budget. I believe that any court reading this all-\ninclusive language would have to conclude that Social Security would be \non budget and thus fair game for being used to balance the budget.\n  The only way to guarantee the integrity of the Social Security trust \nfund is to exempt it from this balanced budget amendment. We would not \nhave to worry about any of these questions if we passed the balanced \nbudget amendment and excluded Social Security. That is the amendment \nnow pending before this body.\n  I believe this would be consistent with Congress' previous actions \nincluding the 98-to-2 vote in October 1990. It would be a reaffirmation \nof Congress' intent to guarantee the integrity of the trust funds.\n  Conversely, the absence of an expressed exemption would result in \ninclusion of the trust funds in the calculation of the deficit. It \nwould yield a radical departure from Congress' longstanding defense of \nthe integrity of the trust funds. I do not want to be a part of that. \nWe must exempt expressly Social Security to ensure that that fund is \nmaintained in its entirety. So that there is no ambiguity, every Member \nof this body needs to support the specific exemption for Social \nSecurity. It is the only way we can ensure that there will not be an \ninjustice perpetrated on the American people.\n  I also want to preempt something that I know will come up because I \nhave heard some comments on this floor about this, that my amendment \nwill create a loophole in the Constitution.\n  That is poppycock. That is diversionary. It will do no such thing. \nThis amendment is narrowly drawn. It is an exemption that applies to a \nreadily identifiable program. So do not be fooled by those who scream \nand shriek and yell and say you are placing the statute in the \nConstitution. Once it becomes part of the Constitution, it is no longer \na statute.\n  If we are all in agreement that Social Security should not be \nincluded for purposes of balancing the budget, then where better to \nenshrine the commitment than in the amendment itself. The fact is there \nis no other alternative. If we leave this out of the balanced budget \namendment, it will go on budget. That is a fact. It will assuredly be \nlooted, and that is a fact.\n  Exemption in enabling legislation is insufficient protection. There \nare some opponents who have stated on this floor previously and who \nwill argue that they, too, oppose balancing the budget by including \nSocial Security trust funds. They believe and they will state that the \nproper place to address this issue is in implementing legislation. Let \nus think about that. We have a constitutional amendment that scholars \nlike the senior Senator from Alabama and others say, if it passes as it \nis written, Social Security will have to be part of the balance. It \nwill not be discretionary with the Congress. It will have to be used to \nbalance the budget.\n  But let us assume that we are not going to use that, we are not going \nto present that argument. What we are going to say is that we are going \nto have a statute that will say you are not going to touch Social \nSecurity.\n  Well, you have two problems. One, it does not supersede what is in \nthe Constitution that says you must include it. And secondly, that \nstatute can be changed any time. We can pass a bill in this body today \nand we can repeal it tomorrow. We can pass a bill in this \n[[Page S2317]] body today and change it next year, the year after. So \nimplementing legislation will not do it.\n  I respectfully suggest that passing a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution is unprecedented. They are talking about offering my \namendment as being unprecedented. All we are dealing with in this body \nuntil we dispose of this balanced budget amendment is unprecedented. \nThis is the first time we have put fiscal policy in the Constitution. \nSo we better get it right.\n  It is unprecedented to place our Nation's fiscal policy in our \nConstitution. If we are going to do so, we must recognize that Social \nSecurity is also part of our Nation's fiscal policy. We are binding \nourselves to a commitment that will require drastic changes in the \nimmediate future. As a matter of equity, as a matter of fairness, we \ncannot bind ourselves to a commitment that puts at great risk a trust \nfund that millions of Americans have paid into all their working lives.\n  Advocates of addressing this issue in enabling legislation contend \nthat the trust funds will be adequately protected if we proceed \nstatutorily. This, Madam President--I do not know how to say it any \ndifferently--is not true. What about future Congresses?\n  If my friend who is managing the bill today at this time, the junior \nSenator from Utah, gave me his word he would not violate Social \nSecurity, I would take him at his word. He is a man of integrity. But \nwhat about his successors? They are not bound by any statement that he \nmakes or any oath that he takes or any commitment he makes. The fact is \nthis resolution as it is presented in this body presents no protection \nfor Social Security. The only way to give it protection is to vote for \nthis amendment that is presented by the Senator from Nevada and 14 \nothers. Assuming, though, that those who say they are going to protect \nit follow through on their words, there is nothing to prevent, as I \nhave already indicated, another Congress from coming along and amending \nthe statute that they have already passed to say you cannot use Social \nSecurity.\n  I believe that there are some who are going to go after Social \nSecurity. I know it to be the case. I was on a national program \nyesterday with former Senator Tsongas, and he candidly stated Social \nSecurity moneys should be used to balance the budget.\n  It is unfortunate but true, there are some who believe, to paraphrase \nour former colleague, Senator Goldwater, that extremism--this is a play \non words on something that Senator Goldwater said on one occasion, \nthat: Extremism in defense of balancing the budget is no vice.\n  I do not believe that. Some do.\n  As I mentioned, I am in favor of balancing the budget. However, a \nline in the sand must be drawn on the issue of Social Security. I am \nwilling to go back to the people of the State of Nevada and say I voted \nagainst a balanced budget amendment because it did not exclude Social \nSecurity. I believe in the integrity of the Social Security System \nenough to take that chance. I believe if we do not do that, we are \ntaking a chance on Social Security, and that is not a chance I want to \ntake. I believe if we do not separate Social Security, it would put us \non a road toward undermining one of the most fundamental agreements we \nhave with the American people. Again, we can only avoid this by passing \nthe amendment before this body.\n  Advocates of a rigid balanced budget amendment say, ``Trust us. We \nwill take care of Social Security in the implementing legislation.'' I \nhave been through that. It will not happen. You cannot do that in the \nenabling legislation or in the implementing legislation. What if a \nchallenge is made a few years down the road and the court looks into \ncongressional intent? What will they see?\n  If my amendment is defeated, a court will probably make the \ndetermination that Congress intended Social Security to be kept on \nbudget. Why? Because specific proposals to exempt Social Security were \nvoted down. They would not even have to look at the implementing \nlegislation. Congressional intent would be evidenced by these votes. \nThat is why it is even more important that this amendment pass. A vote \nagainst it sends the courts a message that congressional intent was to \nallow Social Security to be included in the budget.\n  It would appear we all agree, I hope--I should say the vast majority \nagree. We know over 90 percent of the American public agree that Social \nSecurity should be exempt from the balanced budget amendment. There are \na few, including Republican strategist William Kristol, who conceded \nthe other day on Fox Morning News that there should be an inclusion of \nSocial Security to balance the budget. But the record of support for \nprotecting Social Security is overwhelmingly bipartisan in spite of Mr. \nKristol and in spite of Mr. Tsongas.\n  Again, I think this may well be due to the recognition that Social \nSecurity represents an unbreakable contract with the American people. \nThis also explains why the issue is considered to be the third rail of \npolitics.\n  I do not wish to impugn the statements of those who publicly state \nthey oppose touching Social Security but are unwilling to support an \nexpress exemption. They are Members of the freshman class in the other \nbody, and I read the names of some of them, who are literally trampling \nover themselves to announce their opposition to including Social \nSecurity in the budget. The strong rhetoric emanating from the mouths \nof many should be matched, I believe, by unconditional support for \nlegislation that expresses their concern.\n  The only thing we have had that will exempt Social Security from this \nbalanced budget amendment is the amendment that is being offered by the \nSenator from Nevada with 14 others.\n  Those who are watching this debate should not be under any illusions. \nThere is a significant difference between exempting Social Security in \nthe balanced budget amendment and exempting it in the enabling \nlegislation. The former means you get a new car, fully loaded with all \nthe warranties. The latter is like buying a used car without even \nlooking under the hood.\n  My point, then, is that this is not some arcane legal distinction. \nExempting Social Security in the enabling legislation is not without \nmerits. What it offers is protection of a political kind, and I can \nunderstand that. It is a fig leaf for those who wish to publicly defend \nSocial Security, and I understand that. They know as far as perceptions \nare concerned, supporting this fig leaf allows them, perhaps, to have \ntheir cake and eat it, too.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Utah, mentioned on this floor last \nweek that he supported this because placing an exemption in the \namendment itself would result in the creation of an enormous loophole. \nHe suggested if my amendment were included, the balanced budget \namendment would not be worth the paper it is printed on. Senator Hatch, \nthe senior Senator from Utah, I know what a fine trial lawyer he was. I \nknow, in trying cases, sometimes the best defense is a good offense. I \nrecognize that is probably what my friend from Utah was doing.\n  I disagree with his statement. I disagree with this, and respectfully \nsuggest it is just the opposite. The real loophole would be created \nunless this issue is addressed in the amendment. It is a loophole that \nwill allow future Congresses to loot the Social Security trust funds. \nThe only thing that will not be worth the paper it is written on is the \nSocial Security cards that American workers carry around with them. The \nreal Contract With America, the Social Security agreement we all \nparticipate in throughout our working lifetimes, will be worth very \nlittle. If you really want to close the loopholes, if you really want \nto ensure the continued viability and value of the Social Security \nSystem, then you will support the amendment expressly exempting Social \nSecurity.\n  To accept anything less is an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes \nof the American public.\n  I do not think many people will be hoodwinked by these types of \nmaneuvers. I am confident they will recognize this enabling legislation \nfor what it really is, and that is something to cover, a fig leaf. The \nstakes are very high here for people who are involved in these \nprograms. To understand the importance of this debate, we have to move \nforward beyond all our talk of the Constitution and all the legal \narguments associated with this debate. I \n[[Page S2318]] am referring now to senior citizens and the groups that \nrepresent them.\n  I have here a number of letters from various groups, advocating on \nbehalf of senior citizens. I have here a letter from the National \nAlliance of Senior Citizens. This letter states, among other things: \n``On behalf of the National Alliance of Senior Citizens, this letter is \nto express our strong support for the Reid balanced budget amendment.''\n  This was written last year. I have here a letter from the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons. They, too, Madam President, state their \nsupport. The American Association of Retired Persons believes the \namendment I am offering is a step in the right direction. They are \nopposed to the balanced budget amendment. But they recognize that a \nstep in the right direction is my amendment.\n  We also have the Committee to Preserve Social Security, which \nstrongly supports legislation that is now before this body.\n  The American Association of Retired People states that, ``We applaud \nyour commitment to protecting Social Security.'' This letter is \naddressed to me.\n  We also have a statement from the National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security, and they state without reservation or hesitation that \nthis amendment should be passed.\n  These three letters that I have referred to from these interest \ngroups represent millions of senior citizens. I respectfully suggest \nthat we should listen to what they are saying in behalf of their \nconstituents. These people who are receiving these benefits are playing \nby the rules. Their lifetime of labors went into making this Nation the \nenvy of the world not only for today but for generations past. They \nhave contributed to the Social Security System throughout their lives, \nand they do not deserve to have the rug, in effect, pulled out from \nunder their feet.\n  For many of our Nation's seniors, Social Security is the sole source \nof their income. For some it is supplemental, but for many it is all \nthey have. We have all had instances where seniors are depending on \nSocial Security, and literally every penny is of importance to them. We \nhave been through the debates where we have had seniors who are \ndepending on Social Security who are eating cat food, who are really \ndesperate for money. We must protect this Social Security trust fund. \nThe contribution made by employers and employees is something that we \nmust protect.\n  Madam President, I am not going to go into a lot of detail. I have \nalready told my friend, the senior Senator from Utah, that I spread on \nthe Record on a previous occasion my remarks about the seniors' \ncoalition. If in fact the seniors' coalition gets involved in this \ndebate, I will refer in more detail to the seniors' coalition, and I \nwill reserve the right at some subsequent time to seek the floor to \ntalk about them, if necessary, in some detail, a group that does not \ntruly represent the seniors of this country.\n  Madam President, I voted in favor of the amendment that was just \ndefeated because I would like to have known where these cuts are going \nto come from. I, in fact, cosponsored the amendment that was put \nforward by the Democratic leader.\n  I am concerned, however, for a balanced budget. As of today we have \nnot seen the hard numbers of evidence of a working formula for getting \nus into balance. But I am willing to accept that. It was an up-or-down \nvote, and we lost. But I am not willing to accept a defeat of this \namendment unless I can certainly spread on the Record of this body that \nI cannot, in good conscience, support a balanced budget amendment that \nincludes Social Security moneys to balance the budget. Without a \ndetailed formula, I have no idea what is going to happen to Social \nSecurity. So why not just exclude it?\n  Without a detailed formula, there is no guarantee that a restricted \nenforcement of the balanced budget amendment will not result in the \nwholesale looting of the Social Security trust funds. I believe there \nwill be no choice but to lose the trust funds. In the absence of the \ndetails, I suggest emphatically that it is even more imperative that we \nexpressly exempt Social Security from the balanced budget amendment. \nWithout truth in budgeting, we are placing at risk the entire Social \nSecurity program. Promises are not sufficient. We are talking about \namending the U.S. Constitution. Promises will always be preempted by \nthe Constitution, and that is why my amendment ought to be supported.\n  I repeat that 1935 was the beginning of this Contract With America, \nthe original contract with America. We have established in the Social \nSecurity legislation a trust fund that must be protected. We have a \nfiduciary relationship. We have an obligation of trust to make sure \nthat those moneys are collected and that they are disbursed for the \npurposes for which they were collected. Social Security does not \ncontribute one iota to the Federal deficit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include Senator Feingold as \na sponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are these huge surpluses that are \nbuilding up in the Social Security trust fund that I believe we must \nprotect. Failure to save the surplus could undermine Social Security. \nWe must be concerned how Social Security is treated in the budget. We \nknow that just a few years ago we, by a vote of 98 to 2, said we are \nnot going to put Social Security in any of the problems we have with \ndeficit spending. We cannot reverse that now. That would be unfaithful \non our behalf. We would be unfaithful. Social Security will be treated \nvery stringently in this budget. That is why it is important that \nSocial Security be excluded.\n  I see in this Chamber the junior Senator from South Carolina, a man \nwith a wide range of experience, who was Governor of a State. He \nunderstands budgeting. If our side had seniority, he could be chairman \nof the Budget Committee as we speak; a man who I remember when running \nfor President talked about budget deficit problems, many years ago. He \nis someone who has a lot of wisdom about numbers. But I would bet, \nalthough I am not certain, the great southern State of South Carolina \nwould have the ability when they balance their budgets to have some \nthings off budget. They can have some capital expenditures that are \ndone through bonding at the State level.\n  Mr. President, this budget, if it passes, likely will not have a \ncapital budget in it. It is, therefore, all the more important that we \nprotect Social Security because this balanced budget amendment that is \nbefore this body is the strictest I have ever seen. It is a lot \nstricter than most everyone treats their own budget because in your own \nbudget you have your house off budget. You make payments on that. You \nhave your car off budget. You make payments on that, and the \nrefrigerator and other large items. They now have programs where you \ncan have your children's education off budget. You can make payments on \nthat.\n  So this balanced budget amendment that is now pending before this \nbody--and I accept it--is going to be very stringent and tough. But let \nus exclude Social Security because putting Social Security on budget \ncontradicts congressional intent. Expressed exemption is the only \nguarantee. Exemption in the enabling legislation simply is \ninsufficient.\n  We must do this to protect the integrity of the Social Security trust \nfund. We have heard a great deal about our responsibilities, Mr. \nPresident, to future generations. All of us are aware of our moral \nobligation to provide our children and our grandchildren with a healthy \neconomy free of debts, especially which they did not incur.\n  This, in part, is why I support the idea of amending the Constitution \nto balance the budget. Another obligation we all share, however, is to \nensure that we provide for the younger generation of yesterday, or, \nmore accurately, today's senior citizens. We must ensure that they too \nbe treated in an equitable manner. We honor their lifelong sacrifices \nof honoring the Social Security agreement we made, the original \ncontract with America. We honor their sacrifices by ensuring that the \ntrust funds they paid into all their working lives are not used for \nother purposes. We must honor their sacrifices by exempting the Social \nSecurity trust fund from the balanced budget amendment.\n  I plead with my colleagues to listen to the debate that will ensue in \nthe \n[[Page S2319]] next couple of days, and to have this vote take place \nnot only with your heart, but with your head. The Social Security trust \nfund should be exempted from the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleague from \nNevada give his statement, and tell us again and again and powerfully \nof his commitments to protect the Social Security trust fund.\n  As I have listened to him, I have come to the conclusion that there \ncould be nothing more devastating to the stability and the future of \nthe Social Security trust fund than the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Nevada. I will share that reasoning with you.\n  I know that is not his intent. I know he is acting out of the purest \nof motives. But I must say as strongly as I can in response to what he \nhas said that the route he is suggesting that we go in an effort to \nsupport the Social Security trust fund is indeed the most dangerous way \nwe could possibly go, if we in fact want to preserve that trust fund.\n  Before I give that detail, let me make this comment about the overall \ndebate. I remember last Congress the then-majority leader, the Senator \nfrom Maine, Mr. Mitchell, made one of his typically well-reasoned and \neloquent statements in defense of the purity of the Constitution. He \nreminded us all that we were taking an oath to uphold and defend the \nConstitution when we entered this body, and he said in a pleading \nvoice: Do not do anything that would jeopardize the Constitution. You \nare writing into the Constitu- tion--I am paraphrasing \nrather than a direct quote--you are writing into the Constitution \nmatters that should be left to policy, that should be left to \nlegislation, and you are changing the nature of the Constitution, which \nis our basic law, by proposing this amendment. He pled with us not to \ndo that, on the basis of sound constitutional theory.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I was somewhat moved by the majority leader \nin that case, and I found myself questioning whether or not we really \ndid need to amend the Constitution to get this taken care of. I have \ntalked about how I resolved those differences at another time on the \nfloor, so I will not repeat them here. But I find it very interesting \nthat when we had, as the principal reason why we should defeat this \namendment last year, the plea to keep policy matters out of the \nConstitution, we now have before us, as the principal thing that we \nmust do in order to make this amendment viable, an amendment that \nwrites policy matters into the Constitution, that flies right in the \nface of the advice of the former Senator from Maine, Mr. Mitchell, when \nhe was opposing this 2 years ago.\n  We are going to write statutory language into the Constitution if we \nadopt the Reid amendment and it gets ratified by the States. I think \nthat is foolish. I think that changes the nature of the Constitution \ntremendously and, as I say, I think it is tremendously dangerous to \nSocial Security. Why? Well, I have before me the language of the Reid \namendment, and let us read it. It is very simple, very straightforward. \nIt says:\n\n       The receipts and outlays of the Federal old age and \n     survivors insurance trust fund and the Federal disabilities \n     insurance trust fund used to provide old age survivors and \n     disability benefits shall not be counted as receipts or \n     outlays for the purpose of this article.\n\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from Utah, has already talked about \nthe inappropriateness of writing into the Constitution titles of \nexisting legislation. Let us assume for just a moment, however, that \nthat is an appropriate thing to do. I do not believe for a moment that \nit is, but let us assume that it is. Then we say, all right, ``the \nfunds used to provide old age survivors and disabilities benefits shall \nnot be counted for the purposes of this article.''\n  Mr. President, what is a survivor? The answer to that is very clear. \nA survivor is whatever Congress says it is. So if we want to, in the \nlanguage of the senior Senator from Nevada, use the implementing \nlanguage of statutes to change the system, Congress can change the \ndefinition of survivor and be within the Constitution and loot the \ntrust funds. Suppose Congress says a survivor, for the purpose of this \namendment, is anyone who is alive. You have survived and, by \ndefinition, therefore, we can give you any benefit we want out of this \nfund and we are not violating the Constitution, we are not violating \nthe Reid amendment to the balanced budget amendment. Congress can \ndefine a survivor as anyone who is over 21. Congress can define as a \nsurvivor anyone who has a driver's license and who has lived for 6 \nmonths after having driven. Having driven with some teenagers, I can \naccept that definition. Maybe you are a survivor if you stay alive for \n6 months after receiving your license.\n  Disability benefits. Mr. President, what is a disability? The answer \nis very clear. A disability is whatever Congress decides a disability \nwould be. So Congress could decide, as indeed some groups in our \nsociety already have, that to be a woman is a disability in our \nsociety. Therefore, the money that is in this fund which under the \nConstitution is to be used for disability benefits can be spent on \nbehalf of women and not men. There are others who will then say, oh, \nno, it is not a disability to be a woman, it is a disability to be \noverweight. So we are going to use the money to take care of everybody \nwho is fat. No, it is a disability if you are too short. It is a \ndisability if you are too tall. We have the American With Disabilities \nAct that outlines a whole bunch of disabilities, none of which are \ncurrently covered under Social Security or the disability insurance \ntrust fund. If you are in a wheelchair, we are going to use the funds \nout of this fund to take care of you. We are going to use these funds \nto buy you a wheelchair or build you a ramp in your house, or whatever \nit is Congress decides to do.\n  Mr. President, obviously, the examples I am giving are outlandish; I \nrealize that. I make the point to show that there is, in fact, no \nrestriction whatsoever on future Congresses to make whatever outlandish \ndefinitions they may choose. The one we think we all know is old age. \nWhat is old age? Old age is whatever Congress says it is. Right now, \nCongress says old age is 65--unless you happen to be a Federal employee \nwith a sufficient amount of service to your credit, and then you can \nretire at age 50. Suppose some future Congress says that old age, to \nkeep it all straight, is 50. We can go into the Federal disability \ninsurance trust fund and the old age and survivors insurance trust fund \nand we can take that money to do things for anybody who is 50.\n  The Senator from Nevada has said implementing legislation will not do \nit, we can pass a bill to change it. Yes, we can pass a bill to change \nthe definitions that are under this proposed amendment, and we can, if \nwe want to, gut the Social Security trust fund any time we want to. To \nhold out to somebody the promise that passage of the Reid amendment \nwill guarantee that Social Security will never change and will never be \nin jeopardy is to hold out a promise that is false. To hold out that \nidea, which is well-intentioned, Mr. President, frankly, is misleading.\n  The Senator from Nevada tells us that this is narrowly drawn and says \nthat it will preserve the Social Security trust fund because it is \nnarrowly drawn. I have not gone to law school, so I suppose I cannot \nargue with him in legal terms. But I do understand the English \nlanguage, and I do believe that which I have said demonstrates that it \nis not narrowly drawn; indeed to the contrary, it leaves the door wide \nopen for future Congresses to do all of the things that the Senator \nfrom Nevada suggested that some future Congress might do. He said if we \njust leave it as it is, future Congresses could raid the fund. That is \ntrue. Future Congresses could also abolish it. That is true. Future \nCongresses could, under his amendment, say that there will be no taxes \nconnected with and no outlays made from the Federal old age and \nsurvivors insurance trust fund and cut it off at that point and leave \nthese lines a dead letter in the Constitution. Future Congresses could \ndo all of these things. There is simply no assurance in the Reid \namendment that future Congresses will behave as he believes they will.\n  Now he has said to us--and I accept it in the spirit in which it is \noffered--that \n[[Page S2320]] those of us who say we do not want to attack Social \nSecurity in the present circumstance are acting in good faith and have \ngood motives. And I am grateful to him for his willingness to accept \nour good faith. I accept his good faith.\n  But he raises the specter of future Congresses acting irresponsibly. \nAnd I suggest to you, Mr. President--indeed, I am convinced, Mr. \nPresident--that if future Congresses do decide to act irresponsibly, \nthey can do so just as easily under his amendment as they can now. And, \nindeed, in the matters I have pointed out, they have a greater \ntemptation to do so if the Reid amendment is adopted, because all they \nneed to do, as I have said, is change the definition of a disability, \nchange the definition of a survivor, change the definition of old age, \nand they have those funds then available to them to do with whatever \nthey see fit.\n  Mr. President, I would like to return to the basic issue that I \nraised in the beginning before I got that specific about the Reid \namendment. I wanted to be specific about the Reid amendment because of \nthe time and care with which he took to address his argument and I \nwanted to respond as quickly as I could.\n  Let us go back to the comments that I recall being made by the then \nmajority leader, George Mitchell, when he pleaded with us not to fool \naround with the Constitution on this matter, when he told us, in \neffect: We can do this by statute. If we had the political will, we \ncould balance the budget without changing the Constitution. Why do we \nwant to put a policy matter, a normal legislative issue, into \nconstitutional language?\n  Well, Mr. President, I have been troubled by that argument, as I have \nsaid. I was moved by Senator Mitchell and his comments in that regard. \nI have such tremendous regard and respect for the Constitution that I \nthink it should be amended only rarely and only in extremis.\n  I agree with the argument that we could do this without a \nconstitutional amendment requiring it. Why am I, therefore, standing \nhere as a convert to the balanced budget amendment and defending it?\n  I have resolved this issue in my mind from this analogy.\n  As you know, Mr. President, and as Members of this body probably get \ntired of hearing me say, I am a businessman and I come out of the \nbusiness environment. That is where I get most of my analogies.\n  When a business is established, the first thing that is required, at \nleast under the laws of the States where I have established businesses, \nis the filing with the State authorities of the bylaws. The bylaws lay \nout in clear pattern the constitutional authority, if you will, of the \nbusiness. It says what management can do and cannot do. It lays out the \nstructure. Just as the Constitution of the United States says there \nwill be two Houses of Congress and how many Members there will be in \neach House, two from each State for the Senate, by population for the \nHouse, and so on, the bylaws of the business say how many members there \nwill be on the board of directors, what the power of the board of \ndirectors shall be, and so on and so forth.\n  It is never contemplated in the bylaws that the organizers of the \nbusiness will lay out a specific business plan. That is left up to \nmanagement. The idea is always that annual projections will be made by \nmanagement. Management will be held accountable. Management will have \nto file appropriate accounting reports. Management will have to file \ntax returns and do all of the other things. The bylaws of the business \nsay how management is to operate, but never get into the specifics of \nthe business plan.\n  What we are talking about here is an amendment to the bylaws. And, \nonce again, we find a disconnect, we find an interesting paradox. We \nare being told, on the one hand, we cannot adopt this particular \nbylaw--this particular amendment to the Constitution--unless it is \naccompanied by a detailed business plan, stretching out for 7 years, \ngiving to the last dollar everything that will be done.\n  If you were to say that to an organizer of business, ``We are going \nto require you, before you amend the bylaws of the corporation, to give \nus a 7-year business plan showing how you will operate under this new \namendment,'' management would resign. It would say, ``Under no \ncircumstances can we live with that kind of a requirement.''\n  Now, what is this bylaw saying? Is it indeed a policy statement that \nbelongs in the area of management that should be kept out of the \nConstitution?\n  We are hearing a lot of concern over the three-fifths requirement; \nover the requirement that Congress has to vote three-fifths if it is \ngoing to have a budget that is not in balance. And we are being told, \nindeed, I have been told in hearings before the Joint Economic \nCommittee by Members who are opposed to this amendment, ``No business \nin the world would ever adopt anything like the balanced budget \namendment. No business would ever put its management in that kind of a \nstraitjacket where a minority could block the business plan.''\n  Well, I said in the Joint Economic Committee, and I repeat here, I \nthink I know something about business, and I can identify plenty of \nbusinesses who do indeed put themselves into this kind of circumstance.\n  Again, the analogy, Mr. President: Suppose you had a business and it \nadopted as one of its bylaws that the business could not go into long-\nterm debt without the approval of 60 percent of the members of the \nboard of directors. That would not be an unusual kind of circumstance. \nThe shareholders would feel they would be more protected if the members \nof the board had to come up with not just a majority to put the \ncorporation into debt but a supermajority to put the corporation into \ndebt. That would be an appropriate bylaw. If it were adopted, eyebrows \nwould not go up.\n  Indeed, I have served in circumstances where the board of directors \ndid not require a supermajority before going into an area of long-term \ndebt, they required unanimity. That is unusual, but it exists. We are \nnot asking for that here.\n  We are simply saying the board of directors--in this case, the two \nHouses of Congress--must have a sufficient level of support to gain 60 \npercent of both Houses before that board of directors will allow the \ncorporation to increase its long-term debt, a very reasonable \nrequirement in a set of corporate bylaws.\n  So, once again, the arguments come in and they do not connect with \neach other, the first one saying, ``You shouldn't be putting anything \nlike this in the Constitution at all.''\n  ``Why?''\n  ``Because this is something that is taken care of through \nlegislation.''\n  And then there is the other argument, saying, ``Oh, no; you should \nnot adopt this amendment unless it has legislation in it.'' The two \nsimply do not match.\n  Then the statement, ``Oh, you cannot adopt this balanced budget \namendment until you give us all of the details.'' And then, back on the \nfirst amendment, ``But the Constitution is not the place where you talk \nabout details.''\n  What comes through to me, Mr. President, is that these arguments that \nare being raised against it have the flavor of an old story that I \nremember where two neighbors in a frontier circumstance were meeting. \nThe first neighbor said to the second: ``I have some work to do around \nmy place. I have dropped my ax on a rock and it cut a chip out of the \nblade of the ax and it is worthless to me. I would like to borrow your \nax to help me break up some wood.''\n  The second neighbor thought for a minute and said, ``I am sorry, I \ncan't loan you my ax. I need it to shave with.'' The first fellow went \naway. After he was gone, the wife of the second fellow said, ``What did \nyou tell him that for? That is a silly excuse. You do not shave with \nyour ax.'' And he said ``Well, I didn't want to loan it to him because \nI was afraid I wouldn't get it back. But I didn't want to offend him so \nI did the next best thing.''\n  I think many of the arguments that are being raised are, in fact, \nbeing raised because some of the people raising them really do not want \nto put the Government in a circumstance where it is forced to confront \nthe reality of a balanced budget discipline. But rather than offend \ntheir voters by being upfront about it, they are looking around for \nexcuses like, ``I'm going to use the ax to shave with.''\n   [[Page S2321]] Now, I do not suggest that that is the case with my \nfriend from Nevada. I think he genuinely and with good intentions \nsupports this amendment and believes that it would, indeed, help save \nthe Social Security system. I hope I have made it clear that it would \nnot save the Social Security system from the things that he has \nsuggested.\n  Now, Mr. President, we will address the basic question of whether or \nnot balancing the budget makes sense. There are those who say this is \none of those mirages that is always in the future and no matter how far \nyou move toward it, you never get to it. The balanced budget will \nalways be in the future; we will never, ever, want to do it.\n  I have spoken about this before, but I return to it because it is the \nfundamental question underlying this whole debate. As I have said, I am \na reluctant convert to this debate. I am very reluctant to make changes \nin the Constitution. I look back on our history and say we have gone \nfor over 200 years without a balanced budget amendment. We have done \njust fine. Why do we need it now?\n  Further, I accept the idea that it does come close to introducing \nlegislative and policy issues into the Constitution rather than dealing \nstrictly with fundamental law. I hear all those arguments. I am \nsympathetic to many of them. I come to the conclusion that we must have \na statement in our basic bylaws--in our case, in our Constitution--that \nsays we will resist the historic destabilizing influence in all \ndemocracies. The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] quoted the historian \nwho said that democracies ultimately disintegrate when the people \ndiscover that they can vote themselves largess. That is, when people \ndiscover that they can use their power in a democracy to use Government \npower to pay themselves more than is really there, they ultimately \ndestroy their country.\n  We are not at that point yet. But we are beginning to get so far down \nthat road that I am getting nervous. We need a statement in the \nConstitution that says we will not do that. Thomas Jefferson was afraid \nof that. That is why he raised the balanced budget amendment as an idea \nback in the beginning. They shied away from it. As I say, we have gone \nfor 200 years without needing it. But we are getting there and we are \ngetting there more and more as we go down this slippery slope to \nentitlements.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that we can have entitlements and we can \nhave a balanced budget. The two can coexist. But it will take a \nredefinition of the word ``entitlement'' in order to get America there.\n  Let me share this observation that comes out of my personal \nexperience. I hesitate to raise it, lest some misunderstand its source, \nbut I raise it nonetheless because commentators outside of Utah who \nhave had no religious backing to their point of view have raised it. I \nthink, therefore, it is appropriate.\n  I want to talk briefly about the welfare program of the Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which I am a member. We have an \nentitlement as members of the church under the welfare program. Any \nmember of the church who falls in need is entitled to receive help from \nthe church. As an official of the church, I have been involved in \ndispensing that help. I have seen how it works. I have given vouchers \nto members of my congregation who turned those vouchers into food and \nclothing. I have signed checks to members of my congregation who have \nturned those checks into rent payments or money for their children or \nother vital necessities in their lives.\n  If anything should ever happen to me, I am entitled to go before my \nchurch leaders and say, ``I want some food. I want some clothing. I \nwant some cash to take care of my shelter.'' I am entitled to that as a \nmember of the church if I need it. That is the qualifying phrase to \nthat--entitled. I am entitled to it if I need it.\n  Where does the entitlement come from? The same place that the Senator \nfrom Nevada spoke of--the people who pay into Social Security. I am \nentitled to that from my church because I have gone down to the cannery \non my own, without being paid for it. I have canned peaches. I have cut \nup pears. I have peeled tomatoes. Frankly, I did not do it very \nexpertly, to be sure, but I have done it, and my family has done it. I \nhave gone to the farm out here in Maryland and I have worked on the \nfarm and I have shoveled hay and I have shoveled what was politely \ncalled ``used hay.''\n  I have participated in the programs, and that has created for me a \nsense that I am entitled. I would walk in and face my Mormon bishop \nwithout a moment's hesitation and say to him, this is what has happened \nto me. I am in need. I am entitled to help. And I would walk out with \nmy head held high. If I received that help I would not consider it \ncharity. I have paid into that. I have contributed to it. I am entitled \nto receive it.\n  The difference between that attitude and what we have going on in the \nGovernment is this. What is happening to the entitlement programs in \nthe Government is we are saying, ``You are entitled to it whether you \nneed it or not.''\n  We are in the midst of a baseball strike. We see baseball players \nwhose average salary is $1 million a year. One of those baseball \nplayers could receive disability insurance even if his contract \ncontinued to pay him $1 million a year, because under our program he is \nentitled to it. And because we provide it for him, we cannot provide it \nin the degree, perhaps, that we should to other people who need it far \nmore.\n  We have reached the point where we have said, ``You are going to be \npaid back out of your own funds in the name of entitlement programs, \nGovernment largess, if you just vote for us.'' This is the pattern that \nhas been established years ago. No one Congress is solely responsible. \nNo one Member of Congress is solely responsible. It has built up over \nthe years. It has gone forward over the years.\n  Eventually we get into a circumstance where people are saying, ``I \nwant mine. I want it now.'' You look at them and say, ``Wait a minute, \nyou do not need it. Why do we not save that for someone who does?'' And \nthey say, ``I want it because I am entitled to it whether I need it or \nnot.''\n  That, Mr. President, I think, is the key to getting the budget under \ncontrol. Yes, we have to cut defense. Yes, we have to get rid of the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the Government. Yes, we have to have leaner \nand tighter departments. Yes, we have to do a whole number of things to \nget the Government smaller.\n  But if we learned nothing from the entitlement commission--and \nSenator Kerrey of Nebraska has courageously and honestly and \nforthrightly portrayed this in his statements that have been reported \nclearly in the press--we have learned that if we do not get the overall \nentitlement monster under control, we will succumb to the fate that was \noutlined for us by that historian. Democracy fails when people discover \nthey can vote themselves largess, and when we get in that context and \nin that circumstance, we are going to be in trouble.\n  How do we deal with it? As I say, I have come to the conclusion, \nafter thinking it through, that the way we deal with it is to put into \nour basic bylaws--in our case, our Constitution--a statement that says \nwe will not go down that road. I am not sure that if I were acting \nalone I would have drafted the balanced budget amendment as it is \ncurrently worded. The democratic process requires that we all get \ntogether and we get a consensus or we at least get a majority as to how \nit is done.\n  I might argue with this phrase or that phrase, but I cannot, finally, \nargue with the notion that it does, indeed, belong in the Constitution.\n  Indeed, I have come to the conviction that it belongs nowhere else, \nbecause if the Constitution is going to lay down the fundamental \nconcepts of our country and what we believe, it is going to lay down \nour fundamental rights as individuals in this country and the \nfundamental structure of our Government in this context; it is flawed \nand diminished if it does not have in that list of fundamental \nstructural patterns and fundamental rights a statement that says we \nwill not allow the Government to spend ourselves into bankruptcy.\n  I can think of nothing more fundamental. I can think, as I say, of no \nplace more logical for that statement to be than in the Constitution.\n  So, Mr. President, I have wandered from responding to the senior \nSenator \n[[Page S2322]] from Nevada and his amendment, which is before us, to an \noverall statement of the underlying resolution that is before us and \ngiven you my reasons as to why I am in support of that.\n  I conclude by returning to the issue that is directly before us and \nsummarizing, once again, my conviction that adoption of the Reid \namendment would create the temptation on the part of future Congresses \nto do the very thing that the senior Senator from Nevada is concerned \nabout: That it would create the temptation for future Congresses to \ngive us legislation that would raid the Social Security trust funds.\n  He said our successors are not bound. Absolutely our successors are \nnot bound. Our successors might easily decide to redefine what is a \nsurvivor, redefine what is a disability benefit, redefine what is old \nage in such ways as to use those trust funds for virtually any \npurposes.\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, calls this \na giant loophole. The senior Senator from Nevada refers to that as \npoppycock. I will let the two senior Senators argue that one back and \nforth on a semantic level, but I find myself persuaded that the \nlanguage in the Reid amendment does, indeed, provide such wide latitude \nfor future Congresses that I would come down in agreement with my \nsenior colleague from Utah that it would, indeed, be a huge loophole \nthrough which future Congresses could drive gigantic appropriations if \nthey were so inclined.\n  So, Mr. President, I leave the issue with these observations and \ntrust that they will have contributed something to this particular \ndebate. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly to the \namendment that has been offered by my good friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Nevada, Senator Reid, which states that receipts, \nincluding attributable interest and outlays of the Federal old age and \nsurvivors insurance trust fund and the Federal disability insurance \nfund, shall not be counted as receipts or outlays for the purposes of \nthis article--that being the proposed amendment to the Constitution.\n  In what I hope will not be the outcome of this debate, which is to \nsay the Senate approving such an amendment to the Constitution, at the \nvery least, the Reid provision provides hope for the Social Security \nsystem. It is a slim prospect, given the extraordinary fiscal turmoil \nand tumult, that will follow the adoption of this proposed amendment to \nthe Constitution. But it does declare the interest of the Congress and \nthen of the States in the preservation of Social Security, an issue \nwhich becomes--in my time in the Senate, I have seen one fully-agreed-\nupon, solidly financed, well-administered program, the most successful \nsocial program in the 20th century go from being a given to being a \nproblem and to being problematic. We refer to it as an entitlement.\n  I make the point that the very able majority leader of the House, Mr. \nArmey, corrects us all when he says it is a ``fiduciary \nresponsibility'' of the Federal Government, which is to say these funds \nare not ours to dispose of as we will. We hold them in trust. They are \ncalled trust funds.\n  The revenue stream will continue in surplus--cash surplus--until the \nyear 2012, as we now expect. We can add a year, plus or minus; there is \nthat possibility. Social Security began as a pay-as-you-go system in \nthe depth of the 1930 depression. That you take more out of the economy \nthan you put in seemed to be unwise and it would have been, and we had \ndifficult consequences even so.\n  The 1937 recession was probably, in part, triggered by the 1935 \npayroll tax. But in any event, near a half-century goes by and the \nSocial Security amendments of 1937. Seeing the peculiar demography of \nthe baby boomers and their eventual retirement, that great increase in \nbirths that followed the long, slow level of the 1930's and the Second \nWorld War, we put in place a partially funded system. I was a member of \nthe Finance Committee. I was a member of the committee on conference.\n  We put in place, Mr. President, a cash surplus which, over the \nperiod, would extend--to give you a sense of the proportion, it would \nbuy the New York Stock Exchange. It still flows in cash surplus and \nwill for the better part of 15 to 20 years, in prospect. So great \npraise and thanks to the Senator from Nevada for his effort in this \nregard--reserving always the point that I would like to make at some \ntime that the amendment itself is a huge mistake that I hope we will \nnot make.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me compliment our distinguished \ncolleague from Utah. He certainly attracted my attention when he spoke \nof the Mormon Church. I had the distinct pleasure, with a group of \nSenators, of visiting with his revered father, former Senator Wallace \nBennett, to the Mormon Temple here in Washington, DC.\n  Various members of my staff have been members of the Mormon Church. \nTheir dedication and hard work have been a tremendous inspiration to \nme. A female staffer of mine was making good money, but left to fulfill \nher 2-year commitment to the church by going overseas. She paid for her \nown transportation and, at a very young age, solicited membership for \nthe church for 2 years. I would have hesitated allowing my daughter to \ndo that, but she did and did it with courage and commitment.\n  So I have the greatest respect for the comments of the Senator from \nUtah, but I do find them in some measure strange.\n  For example, when he claims that the Reid amendment creates a \nloophole by allowing Congress to redefine the word ``survivor.'' If \nthat is true, can't we change what is an ``outlay,'' what is a \n``receipt,'' what is an ``estimate,'' what is ``appropriate \nlegislation''? These phrases are already in House Joint Resolution 1, \nthe joint resolution proposing a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States. All of the terms in the underlying \njoint resolution can be changed. There is no question about that.\n  The balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is really proposed \nas a sort of gun to the head of the Congress to bring about discipline. \nAs experience has told me and much to my dismay, Mr. President, it \nbrings about creativity.\n  This morning at the Budget Committee I had the pleasure of \nquestioning the distinguished Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, Dr. Alice Rivlin. I noted that Dr. Rivlin, as the Director of \nour Congressional Budget Office, had been the one individual who more \nthan any other gave integrity and credibility to the budget process. \nShe did an outstanding job then, and I think she is doing an \noutstanding job in the Clinton administration. But I noted that even \nwith her watchful eye, there is a penchant in budget process for \ncreativity.\n  For example, in the President's budget, the majority of proposed tax \ncuts are paid for by cuts in discretionary spending. Under existing \nbudget law, tax cuts can only be offset either by tax increases or by \nentitlement cuts. Thus, the President's budget would cause OMB to \ninitiate a sequester.\n  Additionally, the President's budget counts the sale of assets as \nreceipts. Under procedures that the Congress uses in scoring, using \nassets sales to comply with pay-as-you-go laws subjects a budget \nresolution to another point of order.\n  Third, the President's budget artificially adjusts the discretionary \ncaps upward for inflation and then claims savings by lowering the caps \nto their existing levels. In contrast, the Congressional Budget Office \nin the past has not interpreted the law in this way and may not \nrecognize these savings.\n  Lastly, the reestimation of Medicare and Medicaid outlays in the \nPresident's budget seems overly optimistic. In fact, their estimate by \n2000 is $54 billion less than the level projected by CBO. In raising \nthese issues, I am not trying to criticize the President's budget, I am \nmerely trying to talk about the slippery game of budget estimates from \na standpoint of experience.\n  When the distinguished Senator from Utah cites Jefferson, it brings \nto mind another quote by James Madison in The Federalist Papers. He \nsaid:\n\n       [[Page S2323]] But what is government itself but the \n     greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were \n     angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to \n     govern men, neither external nor internal controls on \n     government would be necessary. In framing a government which \n     is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty \n     lies in this: You must first enable the government to control \n     the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control \n     itself.\n\n  Thus, 207 years ago, Madison saw the very evil that brings us to the \nfloor of the Senate today. We are out of control. I congratulate my \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Nevada, Senator Harry Reid. \nHe brings up an important and absolutely necessary amendment to this \njoint resolution.\n  As Governor of South Carolina, I had to struggle to balance the \nbudget. I knew in the early days that industry was not going to come \nfrom New York and invest in Podunk unless our fiscal house was in \norder. We had to pay the bills. I put in a device which was the \nforerunner of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings whereby expenditures had to be \nwithin receipts with quarterly reports to the Governor. If we failed to \nmeet these targets, we would cut straight across the board. With this \ndiscipline, I got the first AAA credit rating of any State, from Texas \nright on up to Maryland.\n  Since then I have continued to work in the vineyards. In 1984, I ran \nfor President on the ``Fritz freeze,'' as many called it. My colleague, \nSenator Alan Cranston, ran on the nuclear freeze. We had to tell him \nthat down home in South Carolina, they thought that the nuclear freeze \nwas a dessert.\n  The people of America know what is needed in our land. If you talk to \nyour pollster, they scream:\n  ``Oh, don't bring up deficits. The people don't want to hear about \nit. It is confusing. There's no story. They're not interested.''\n  Thus, we have tax increases that no one wants to speak about--a tax \nincrease of $1 billion a day on automatic pilot. The debt has gone up \nto $4.804 trillion. Before long, it will be $5 trillion. The gross \ninterest cost for 1995 will be $339 billion and by next year will \nsurpass $1 billion for every day.\n  There are two things you cannot avoid. One is death and the other is \ntaxes. As far as this Congress and this Senate and this Government \ngoes, you cannot avoid those interest costs. They are the first thing \noff the table that we spend.\n  Incidentally, I might well mention that the gross interest cost in \n1981, when President Ronald Reagan was elected, pledging to balance the \nbudget and put us in the black in 1 year, was $95 billion. As I said \nearlier, it is now in excess of $339 billion. If you subtract it, you \nhave $244 billion added to the interest costs. The deficit this year \nhas been scheduled for $244 billion. Thus, without this tremendous \noverhang of debt, the Federal budget would be in balance.\n  The Republicans talk about promises. If the distinguished former \nPresident had carried through on his promise, we would not be in this \npickle. He came to town and said: ``Whoops, I never realized it was as \nbad as this. I cannot do it in a year. It is going to take 2 or 3 \nyears.'' that is how we moved from 1-year to 3-year budgeting. Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings pushed us out to 5-year budgets. And now, you ought to \ntalk about creativity. Now, in the balanced budget amendment we are \ntalking about 7 years. The next Congress will talk about 10 years.\n  Mister President, Harry Reid, the Senator from Nevada, has a very, \nvery important provision here--one that sheds some light on the \nenormous challenges we face in balancing the budget. I started down \nthis road of a balanced budget amendment with the distinguished \nSenators from Texas and New Hampshire in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. That \nwas a balanced budget amendment. We got a majority of the Democrats on \n14 up-and-down votes to go along with the Republican leadership at that \ntime in 1985. We reduced the deficit in the first full year of Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings from $221 billion down to $150 billion. We were \nsupposed to reduce the deficit further by increments of $36 billion. \nBut then, we began to stray from the targets until in 1990 we did away \nwith fixed targets.\n  Likewise, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution does not \ngive discipline; it gives creativity. That is the hard experience of \nthis gentleman.\n  Now, I wish to yield. I wish to hasten along because really the \nauthority on the subject of Social Security, none other than our senior \nSenator for New York, Senator Moynihan knows the subject intimately. He \nhas a tremendous sense of history, which I admire.\n  He and I realized that many were tempted by the tremendous surpluses \nin the Social Security trust fund. So the distinguished Senator from \nNew York authored, even though I offered it as an amendment, in the \nBudget Committee and in later in the Chamber, what we called a Social \nSecurity Preservation Act--take it off budget. In 1990, we had a vote \nin the Budget Committee, and the vote was 20 to 1, the 1 being my \nleader under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, Senator Gramm from Texas.\n  I can say advisedly I was not surprised, because I went to Senator \nGramm in the initial stages of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings when his initial \nproposal was to cut all entitlements including Social Security.\n  I said, wait a minute. No. 1, you are cutting the program that we \njust voted the taxes to pay for. It is paid for and is in the black. \nNo. 2, it breaches the trust that we created in 1935 and that we have \nrepresented to the senior citizens of America. I am not going to breach \nthat trust, and furthermore, you will not get a single Democratic vote \nto sequester Social Security.\n  We got him to change his tune on that point. But when he voted \nagainst my amendment in the Budget Committee, and when he introduced \nhis own legislation to balance the budget, he went back to his former \nposition. On February 16, 1993, he introduced legislation which, in one \npertinent section, read:\n\n       Exclusion From Budget, Section 13301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act of 1990, as amended, by adding at the end \n     thereof the following: ``This subsection shall not apply to \n     fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 2001.''\n\n  He had taken the section that I enacted into statutory law by a vote \nof 98 to 2 and attempted to change it in order to use the trust funds \nto lessen the chore of balancing the budget.\n  We act like we are not the Government. It is like the San Francisco \n49ers coming into Miami, running up into the grandstand, and hollering, \n``We want a touchdown, we want a touchdown.''\n  It is incumbent upon them to get down on the field and score the \ntouchdown. It is incumbent on Members of Congress to stop the charades.\n  So, when the distinguished majority whip, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi, just 2 days ago says, and I quote, ``Nobody--\nRepublican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, moderate--is even thinking \nabout using Social Security to balance the budget.''--I say, \nrespectfully: False.\n  The experience of this Senator is Members of Congress will try to \nfind a way to use these funds. If you do not include this amendment in \nthe balanced budget amendment, you have effectively voided the Hollings \nstatute. That is the statute on books this minute. But I have found out \nthe hard way now, after 5 years, that it is sometimes easier to get a \nstatute on the books than to get people to follow it. It is like old \nJohn Mitchell, the Attorney General, used to say, ``Watch what we do, \nnot what we say.'' That is the situation we are in.\n  So I would say to my colleagues that I strongly support the Reid \namendment. It is very simple. It is very clear. We have a contract, as \nof 1935. It is an original contract predating Speaker Gingrich's \nContract With America. We have one of Roosevelt's contracts for \nAmerica, back since 1935, that we must honor.\n  Before I close, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record this document, including the different cuts, \nspending cuts and receipts and all for the 7-year budget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Senator Hollings on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: Not enough savings in entitlements. Yes, \n     welfare reform but job program will cost; savings \n     questionable. Yes, health reform can and should save some, \n     but slowing 10 percent growth to 5 percent--not \n     [[Page S2324]] enough savings. No, none on social security; \n     off-budget again.\n       Reality No. 3: Hold the line budget on Defense--no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes, cuts in \n     domestic discretionary--not enough to stop hemorrhaging \n     interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n

Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Utah to come \nforward, or any Senator to come forward with a 1-year budget that puts \nus on a glide path to zero. Earlier today, Republicans were berating \nDr. Rivlin, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget for her \nlack of budget cuts in the President's 1996 budget. But back on \nDecember 18, when they were feeling real bullish, Mr. Kasich, the \ndistinguished chairman of the House Budget Committee now, said: ``In \nJanuary we will really spell this out. In January I am going to bring \nto the floor a revised budget resolution.'' Further down he says: ``We \nwill provide spending savings. You already have outlined them. In the \nmenu list we already have two or three budgets.''\n  They did not care about President Clinton or what the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget was even thinking about. And then he \ncontinues:\n\n       When that is done * * * at the same time we are going to \n     move on the glidepath to zero * * * We will take the savings \n     by cutting spending first and we are going to put them in the \n     bank so nobody across the country, nobody on Main Street, no \n     one on Wall Street is going to think we are going to do is \n     we're going to give out the goodies without cutting \n     government first.\n\n  So I look in the bank, in the lock box. And there is one thing I \nfind, Mr. President. I have the lock box that the chairman of the \nBudget Committee referred to. But the only thing it contains so far are \na pile of Social Security IOU's.\n  Mr. President, let us do like Madison admonished, let us begin to \ncontrol ourselves. We can begin.\n  As President Reagan said: If not us, who? If not now, when?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I know my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from New York, is waiting to speak. I think he is going \nto yield me up to 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I know my distinguished friend, the \nchairman of the Committee on Banking and Urban Affairs, has an \nimportant statement he wishes to make.

Mr. President, last week, the President of the United \nStates went around the will of the people to bail out a mismanaged \nMexican Government and global currency speculators. That was wrong.\n  I am outraged that American taxpayers are being forced to do \nsomething they did not want to do. The President went around the \npeople \n[[Page S2325]] knowing that Congress would not approve a $40 billion \nbailout of Mexico.\n  Never before has a president used $20 billion from our exchange \nstabilization fund to bail out a foreign country. The ESF is not the \nPresident's personal piggy bank. This fund is supposed to be used to \nstabilize the dollar, not the peso. The President was wrong, and I am \noutraged.\n  The President has used scare tactics to justify going around Congress \nto bail out Mexico. The President claimed that world stock markets \nwould crash and floods of illegal immigrants would cross our borders. \nThe President was wrong, and I am outraged.\n  As former FDIC Chairman Bill Seidman testified last week, Mexico's \ncredit crunch can be solved by letting the market work. Mexico and its \ncreditors should be forced to renegotiate its debt. That's the \ncapitalist way. Investors in Mexico might get 50 or 60 or even 70 cents \non the dollar. That is fair. Investors in Mexico took a gamble. If they \nwanted a United States-guaranteed investment, they should have put \ntheir money into a 6-percent C.D., not a 20-percent Mexican pesobono.\n  The President has given in to economic blackmail. Will American \ntaxpayers have to send Mexico $40 billion next time to protect our \nborders from illegal immigration? I am outraged that the President has \nused our exchange stabilization fund to pay blackmail to Mexico.\n  The President has set a terrible precedent. What happens next time \nthe peso collapses? What happens when some other country's currency \ncollapses? The American taxpayer cannot afford to be the world's \nbanker. We cannot afford to bail out global currency speculators every \ntime a foreign currency collapses.\n  The President should not be sending $20 billion to Mexico when \nCongress must cut United States domestic programs to put our own \neconomic house in order. The Governor of my home State has to cut $5 \nbillion from the state budget. We should send $20 billion to New York \nor Florida or California or other States that are in need before we \nsend it to Mexico.\n  Make no mistake about it. Two years from now. Five years from now. I \npredict that this bailout will go down as one of the President's \nbiggest blunders.\n  I predict that this bailout will not work. It is a quick fix and will \ncome back to haunt American taxpayers. They will wind up paying.\n  Let us look at the facts.\n  Mexican political bosses got into this mess to win the August 1994 \nelection. They printed pesos at an outrageous rate. They created the \nillusion that the Mexican economy was still thriving, and then they \ndevalued the peso. That was wrong. It hurt poor and middle-class \nMexicans. We should not bail out mismanaged foreign governments.\n  The President's plan will not force Mexico's ruling party to make \nneeded economic or political reforms. Once our money is shipped to \nMexico, we will have no leverage.\n  Let us look at some of the promises Mexico has made for the $20 \nbillion of American taxpayers' money--promises Mexico cannot keep.\n  Mexico has promised to keep inflation low. But they cannot do that. \nThe peso's devaluation has set off 20 to 30 percent inflation, and the \nMexican Government will have to keep printing pesos to prevent more \nunrest in Chiapas.\n  Mexico has promised to cut spending and to maintain a budget surplus. \nBut that is impossible. Mexico must pay sky-high interest on more than \n$160 billion in debt and faces a recession.\n  Mr. President, let me ask the question. If we cannot balance our \nbudget here, here we are promising $20 billion to Mexico, not a loan \nguarantee. We are going to give it to them. We say as one of the \nconditions we expect you to have a budget surplus. I ask, is that \nrealistic? We cannot balance a budget here. We are not saying Mexico is \ngoing to have a budget surplus. That is ridiculous. It is ludicrous. \nAnd no one could promise you that would take place.\n  Mexico has promised to raise $12 to $14 billion through \nprivatizations. But who is going to invest in Mexico now? How are they \ngoing to bring about privatization?\n  I am outraged that the President's bailout of Mexico will leave \nAmerican taxpayers holding the bag. Now, when we have to make painful \ncuts in the Federal budget, is not the time to be risking American \ntaxpayers' money.\n  The administration assumes that Mexico will pay off its debt. But \nMexico could not pay back United States banks in 1982.\n  The President claims that assured sources of repayment exist. But if \nassured sources of repayment really existed, banks and private \ninvestors would provide money to support Mexico's debt.\n  The President has not obtained real collateral. Mexico has already \npledged its oil reserves as collateral for its existing debt.\n  The President relies solely on a security mechanism involving the New \nYork Fed. But this security mechanism is a mirage. It goes into effect \nonly after a default. Mexico can sell oil only to customers who do not \npay through the New York Fed.\n  When Congress provided $1.5 billion in loan guarantees to New York \nCity and Chrysler, Congress demanded much more collateral. I am shocked \nand outraged that the President has not demanded more collateral from \nMexico for $20 billion.\n  What will the President do if Mexico refuses to pay us back? Will the \nPresident send in the 82d Airborne to seize the oilfields? Of course \nnot. It is preposterous. Will he try to raise U.S. taxes to replenish \nour exchange stabilization fund?\n  The President's bailout will not win us friends south of the border. \nAlready the Mexican people resent the fact that we are making those \nmoneys available on conditions that they speak about. Most Mexicans \noppose the $40 billion bailout.\n  The administration says that it was taken totally by surprise when \nMexico set off this crisis by devaluating the peso on December 20. But \nthe signs of serious trouble in Mexico were present months ago. \nCongress must determine what the administration knew about Mexico and \nwhen.\n  The New York Times, January 24, 1995, reports that the CIA advised \nthe administration in July 1994--6 months before the peso's devaluation \nin December--that Mexico's ruling party was borrowing and spending at a \nfurious pace.\n  We have an obligation to investigate whether the administration's \ninaction or silence caused this crisis. We must find out if the \nadministration advised Mexico to devaluate the peso. Devaluation was a \nterrible mistake. We all admit that now. But who was there and when? \nWhat advice did this administration give, if any, to the Mexican \nGovernment?\n  On January 26, Senators Dole, Lott, Mack, and Abraham asked for \ndocuments concerning the administration's advice to Mexico on currency \ndevaluation. Twelve days later, we still have not received this \ncritical documents.\n  Why have we not received these documents? When will we get them? What \nis the administration hiding? The American people have a right to know.\n  The Banking Committee will hold oversight hearings on the \nadministration's use of the ESF to bail out Mexico.\n  Senator Mack and I will introduce a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nthat the Treasury should, in conjunction with the minority reports \nrequired by the ESF statute, provide the Banking Committee with monthly \ninformation on: First, economic conditions in Mexico, and second, how \nMexico is spending the $20 billion.\n  American taxpayers have the right to know whether their money is \nbeing wasted in Mexico. They have the right to know if the Mexican \nCentral Bank has slowed the peso printing press. They have a right to \nknow if Mexico has stopped spending and balanced its budget.\n  We must hold the administration's feet to the fire. We must blow the \nwhistle if the administration does not make Mexico live up to its \ncommitments--to stop the peso press, to balance its budget and to \nprivatize. We must fight for middle-class American taxpayers, not for \nmismanaged foreign governments and global currency speculators.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy pertaining to the introduction of S. 376 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, opponents of the balanced budget amendment \nhave raised the specter that the balanced budget amendment may somehow \nendanger Social Security. This simply is wrong.\n  First, the balanced budget amendment does not write any particular \nmix of spending cuts or tax increases into the Constitution. It merely \nforces Congress to come up with a plan to balance the budget by a date \ncertain and to continue to balance the budget yearly in the future.\n  Why do we need to do that? Because if you look at the Balanced Budget \nAmendment Debt Tracker--this chart right here--just look at what has \nhappened during these 10 days we have been on the amendment. We have \ngone from $4.8 trillion of national debt with an increase the first day \nof $829 million and each day thereafter right up to where we are now up \nto $8,294,400,000 additional debt from when we started on day 10. While \nwe are debating this amendment, the debt is going up almost $1 billion \na day.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair)\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have to tell you if we keep doing that, \nSocial Security is going to be very, very badly harmed.\n  I have always maintained that I would personally oppose Social \nSecurity benefit cuts. I believe we have made an obligation to our \nretirees that we must keep.\n  What the balanced budget amendment does is to force Congress to \nchoose between spending options constrained by the amount of available \nfunds. This means Congress will have to set priorities in a way it does \nnot now do. I have no doubt that Social Security is well protected in \ntoday's political world and would compete well against all other \nspending.\n  But the balanced budget amendment does not require any particular \ncuts. Suggestions that it would result in Social Security cuts are \nsimply scare tactics by those who wish to defeat the balanced budget \namendment by any means.\n  Second, those worried about the security of the Social Security trust \nfund should support the balanced budget amendment. Robert J. Myers, who \nhas worked in many capacities for the Social Security Administration \nfor nearly four decades, including Chief Actuary and Deputy \nCommissioner said, ``the most serious threat to Social Security is the \ngovernment's fiscal irresponsibility.'' Mr. Myers suggests our current \nprofligacy will result either in the Government raiding the trust fund \nor printing money, either of which will reduce the real value of the \ntrust funds.\n  The real threat to Social Security, our mounting national debt, is \nthe problem we have to face. Although the trust fund is running a \nsurplus now, it will not for long. Under current projections, the trust \nfund will grow until the year 2019, at which point it will begin to \ndeplete its savings. At that point the fund begins living on the \nprincipal and interest built on past principal. In the year 2029, the \ntrust fund will be completely insolvent, having used up all capital and \ninterest earned. At that point Social Security will worsen the national \ndeficit picture substantially and seniors will either have to receive \nbenefits from increased payroll taxes or from general Treasury funds, \nor simply go without. If Congress continues to borrow at current rates, \nit is not clear how able it would be able to borrow or tax enough more \nto cover Social Security deficits.\n  Furthermore, seniors or others living on fixed incomes would be \nhardest hit if the predictions of many noted economists result from our \nhuge national debt. If the country should ever decide to monetize the \ndebt, that is, simply print more money to cover its interest payments, \nthe resulting inflation would hit hardest those living on fixed \nincomes. The Federal Reserve Board would probably avoid that, but if we \nshould ever go down that path, seniors would bear a large part of that \nburden. If inflation returns in any other form because of our debt \nburden, seniors would again be hit very hard.\n  Third, the money in Social Security trust funds is invested in \nGovernment bonds. What this means is the trust fund is simply full of \nIOU's from Congress's increasing debt. In other words, the Government \nis using Social Security taxes to fund our growing deficits, and \nleaving the IOU's in the trust fund. The trust fund reserves are in \nlarge degree only a claim on the general Treasury funds, with no \ncapital backing up that claim. If the country ever gets to the point of \ndefaulting on its debts, the Social Security trust fund would be one of \nthe hardest hit.\n  The country will not be able to pay off that stack of paper that \nbuilds up every day and every month as we borrow from the trust funds \nto pay for the daily running of Government programs. For this reason \nalone Social Security recipients, both current and future, and those \nwho are concerned about them, should strongly support this balanced \nbudget amendment--the only opportunity we have, and frankly the only \nreal opportunity in history to really do something about these \nbudgetary deficits that are running us into bankruptcy.\n  We must get our entire fiscal house in order and keep it that way for \nseniors, for their children, and for their grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to address the exemption proposed by \nthe Senator from Nevada. As politically attractive as this exemption \namendment may be--I am talking about the Reid amendment--it will harm, \nrather than help, senior citizens and thwart the balanced budget \namendment. So I urge its defeat for five reasons.\n  First, the Constitution is not the place to set budget priorities. A \nconstitutional amendment should be timeless and reflect a broad \nconsensus, not make narrow policy decisions. We should not place \ntechnical language or insert statutory programs into the Constitution \nand undercut the simplicity and universality of the amendment.\n  Second, exempting Social Security would open up a loophole in the \namendment, which could avoid the purpose of the amendment or endanger \nSocial Security. What do I mean by that? Congress could pass \nlegislation to fund any number of programs off-budget through the \nSocial Security trust fund. The budget could be balanced simply by \nshifting enough programs into the Social Security trust fund. Moreover, \nif this amendment succeeded in exempting Social Security from the \nbalanced budget rule, as the trust funds begin running deficits, as \nthey are projected to do, there would be no requirement that the trust \nfund remain solvent and no incentive to make it solvent. Under a \nbalanced budget requirement, however, the trust funds would be \nprotected because the Government would be required to have enough \nrevenues to meet its obligations, including those who rely on the trust \nfunds.\n  Third, exempting Social Security would tempt Congress and the \nPresident to take irresponsible actions that threaten the integrity of \nSocial Security. If Social Security is off-budget, Congress would be \ntempted to slash Social Security taxes to trade off other taxes hikes \nor shift the cost of other programs into the Social Security Program to \navoid a three-fifths vote to unbalance the budget. Exempting the Social \nSecurity trust fund would create an incentive for Congress to use the \ntrust fund as an instrument of countercyclical stimulus or social \npolicy or other uses other than as a retirement program, threatening \nthe ability of the trust fund to fulfill its obligations to retirees.\n  Fourth, Exempting Social Security from the amendment is unnecessary \nbecause it preserves the ability of Congress to protect Social \nSecurity, which is politically well-protected.\n  Does anybody doubt that Social Security would compete with any and \nall other Federal programs? I do not think anybody doubts that.\n  The current statutory protections for Social Security would not be \neliminated by the amendment. Congress would be able to further protect \nSocial Security in implementing legislation. Given political realities, \nCongress almost certainly would choose to protect Social Security.\n  The fifth reason why we should not go this route is that the concerns \nunderlying this exemption are misplaced. The motivation for exemptions \nlike this is to ensure that Social Security \n[[Page S2327]] benefits will not be cut. This concern is misplaced for \ntwo reasons. First, passage of the balanced budget amendment does not \nin any way mean Social Security benefits will be reduced. It only \nrequires Congress to choose among competing programs, and Social \nSecurity will compete very well. Second, the biggest threat to Social \nSecurity is our growing debt and concomitant interest payments, both \nbecause the effects of debt-related inflation hurt those on fixed \nincomes and because the Government's use of capital to fund debt slows \nproductivity and income growth. They way to protect Social Security \nbenefits is to support the balanced budget amendment and balance the \nbudget so that the economy will grow, thereby fostering growth in \nSocial Security tax revenues, and by requiring that the government have \nrevenues to meet its obligations, including obligations to retirees.\n  For these reasons I urge the amendment be defeated.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Monday I spoke to the Senate at some \nlength describing the economic policies of the Kennedy, Johnson, and \nNixon administrations which were directed to the problems associated \nwith persistent budget surpluses. It will no doubt surprise many \npersons now proposing to amend the Constitution so as to deal with the \nproblem of persistent budget deficits to learn that only a few decades \nago our tendencies appeared to be just the opposite of those of the \nlast decade or so.\n  On Monday, I spoke to the long tradition that democracies were \ninherently disposed to vote themselves largess, a majority would abuse \nits responsibilities in one way or the other. But, in fact, two \ncenturies of the American experience has not produced\n that, save for this particular time. It happened that, this morning, \nour hugely gifted Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Robert Rubin, came \nbefore the Finance Committee with the President's budget and he showed \nthe effect of the deficit reduction program which we put in place in \nthis floor in moments of high drama in July, 1993, when we provided \n$500 billion in deficit reductions which, in turn, brought about a \nlowering of the deficit premium that had been riding on top of interest \nrates, such that in the end we had a cumulative effect of about $625 \nbillion in deficit reduction.\n\n  That effect could be shown right here. This is Secretary Rubin's \nchart. It says, ``Spending on Government programs is less than taxes \nfor the first time since the 1960's.'' A large event.\n  Now, when he says spending on Government programs, that is all \nGovernment programs excepting payment on the debt, which is not a \nprogram but a requirement.\n  With that provision, in 1994 to 1995, we will have a budget surplus \nof a little less than 1 percent, six-tenths of 1 percent, but a surplus \nfor the period.\n  Now, that is in blue, as the distinguished Presiding Officer can see, \nas are these two blue bars over on the left side of the chart, which is \nthe surplus of 1962 to 1965 under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; 1966 \nto 1969, and that is President Johnson; and there was a slight surplus \nand then a slight deficit in the period 1970 to 1973 under President \nNixon.\n  Our Government then ran surpluses, which its principal financial \nofficer considered to be a major problem to the economy, that being an \nobstacle to full employment, which, under the Employment Act of 1946, \nwas to be the largest economic goal of the country.\n  On Monday, I cited the Office of Management and Budget's explanation \nof the budget for fiscal 1973. This was written by George P. Schultz, \nthen director of the newly established OMB, George Shultz, who was \nlater a most eminent Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State. \nHe stated as such:\n\n       Budget policy. The full-employment budget concept is \n     central to the budget policy of this Administration. Except \n     in emergency conditions, expenditures should not exceed the \n     level at which the budget would be balanced under conditions \n     of full employment.\n\n  Which is to say he had built a deficit into the budget which was the \ndifference between outlays and that would equal revenues at full \nemployment and the actual revenues which came in from less than full \nemployment. We were coping with surpluses, a lag in the revenues that \ncome into the Government in the upward slope of the business cycle, and \nour disposition to spend, if you will, those revenues here in the \nCongress.\n  And once again this surplus in revenues as against programs has \nappeared. It comes miraculously, if you will, but not accidentally. \nThat seems an oxymoron. But I do now know how many really believe that \nwhat we did in 1993 would have this result. But it has done, and there \nit is.\n  And my purpose in all this has been plain enough. I make the point \nthat there is nothing inherent in American democracy that suggests we \namend our basic and abiding law to deal with the fugitive tendencies of \na given moment.\n  These are the tendencies, Mr. President. And, again, by sheer \nhappenstance, I prepared these remarks to be given this afternoon. This \nmorning the Secretary of the Treasury presented us this chart which \nshows us these tendencies. Right here goes the deficit of the period \nfrom the late 1970's to the early 1990's.\n  I rise today to provide documentation as to how a series of one-time \nevents of the 1980's led to our present fiscal disorders even as events \nin the 1990's point to a way out of them; and, again, to state I \nprepared these remarks before I saw this chart. And, indeed, there you \nsee that emergent surplus.\n  On January 26, at the request of Chairman Bob Packwood, the \nCongressional Budget Office, in the person of Director Robert D. \nReischauer, presented the Finance Committee with data comparing current \neconomic forecast and budget projections with those made by CBO before \nthe enactment of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, ERTA as it is \ngenerally known. Here is Dr. Reischauer's testimony.\n\n       Unlike the current ``Economic and Budget Outlook'', CBO's \n     budget reports issued before enactment of the 1981 tax cuts \n     routinely projected that a continuation of current tax and \n     spending laws would lead to large budget surpluses. CBO also \n     warned that such levels of taxes and spending would act as a \n     drag on the economy.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a direct continuation, that view, of the view \nthat went from Walter Heller, as chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisers in 1961 under President Kennedy, to Arthur Okun, as chairman \nunder President Johnson, to Herbert Stein, as chairman under President \nNixon, and budget directors such as Kermit Gordon and George Shultz. \nThey saw the problems of the American Government very much in terms of \npersisting surpluses that depressed economic growth.\n  I continue Dr. Reischauer's testimony:\n\n       The primary reason for those projections was that high \n     inflation was expected to drive up revenues dramatically. \n     Because key features of the Federal individual income tax \n     were not automatically adjusted for inflation, periods of \n     high inflation--such as the late 1970s and early 1980s--\n     pushed individuals into higher tax rate brackets and caused \n     revenues to increase rapidly. In response, policymakers cut \n     taxes every few years on an ad hoc basis--five times in the \n     1970s, for instance.\n\n  Again, to try to reach back to a period which we seem to have \nforgot--and, in fairness, probably no more than a fifth of the Members \nof the House right now and somewhat more of the Senate were here in the \n1970's who could remember that--but we cut taxes five times in the \n1970's just to keep the surplus from growing too large.\n  Note the continuity of the problems faced by our analysts at the \noutset of the 1980's with those faced at the outset of the 1960's. The \nFederal Government was running an unacceptable surplus; a sure remedy \nwas to cut taxes. Dr. Reischauer continued:\n\n       Illustrating this dilemma, in its February 1980 report \n     Five-Year Budget Projections: Fiscal Years 1981-1985, CBO \n     projected that revenues collected under current tax law would \n     climb from about 21 percent of GNP in 1981 to 24 percent by \n     1985. Simple arithmetic pointed to enormous surpluses in the \n     out-years. For example, current-law revenues exceeded outlays \n     by a projected $98 billion for 1984 and $178 billion for \n     1985. Similarly, in its July 1981 report Baseline Budget \n     Projections: Fiscal Years 1982-1986, CBO projected budget \n     surpluses of between $148 billion and $209 billion for 1986, \n     depending on the economic assumptions used.\n       In the same report, CBO estimated that the 1981 tax cuts \n     and other policies that were called for in May 1981 budget \n     resolution would generate a balanced budget or a small \n     deficit, roughly $50 billion by 1984--again, depending on the \n     economic assumptions employed.\n       That budget background led to the 1981 tax cuts. Given the \n     best information available at \n     [[Page S2328]] that time, the Congress and the Administration \n     reasonably thought that significant budget surpluses loomed \n     under current law. Analysts differed, however,\n      on whether the 1981 tax cuts would put the government on a \n     balanced-budget footing or would lead to small budget \n     deficits.\n\n  The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 passed the Senate by an \noverwhelming 67-to-8 vote. I voted for it with the same measure of \nconfidence that had led me to support earlier tax cuts. This was a \nfamiliar situation; well enough understood.\n  So I and others thought. We were ruinously wrong. At a hearing of the \nFinance Committee on January 31, Dale Jorgenson, professor of economics \nat Harvard University, called the 1981 tax cut a fiscal disaster \nbecause the Federal Government stopped raising the revenue it needed.\n  In an instant, deficits, not surpluses, because our problem.\n  For certain, two things happened--beyond the bidding war that \naccompanied the enactment of ERTA, with Democratic Members of Congress \nseeking to outdo the new Republican administration. The first is the \naction of the Federal Reserve designed to bring down the double-digit \ninflation of the late 1970's. In a not unfamiliar sequence, the Fed \nbrought down the economy with it. A deep, deep recession commenced. In \n1982, the unemployment rate reached 9.7 percent, the highest rate \nrecorded since the Employment Act of 1946. Revenues fell off \nprecipitously, largely the result of recession, but more steeply owing \nto the 1981 rate cut.\n  Now to a second, and to my view, more important event. Beginning in \nthe 1970's a body of opinion developed, principally within the \nRepublican Party, which held that Government at the Federal level had \nbecome so large as to be unacceptably intrusive, even oppressive. There \nis a continuity here. All those years trying to spend down surpluses \nhad indeed brought about a great increase in the size of Government. Of \na sudden, deficits, if sizeable enough, gained a new utility. They \ncould be used to reduce the size of Government.\n  This was a powerful idea. Indeed, in July 1980, I contributed an \narticle to the New York Times which argued that, the Republicans had \nbecome the party of ideas and thus that ``could be the onset of the \ntransformation of American politics.'' I argued:\n\n       Not by chance, but by dint of sustained and often complex \n     argument there is a movement to turn Republicans into \n     Populists, a party of the People arrayed against a Democratic \n     party of the State.\n       This is the clue to the across-the-board Republican tax-cut \n     proposal now being offered more or less daily in the Senate \n     by Dole of Kansas, Armstrong of Colorado and their \n     increasingly confident cohorts.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Republicans' dominant idea, at least for the moment, \n     seems to be that the social controls of modern government \n     have become tyrannical or, at the very least, exorbitantly \n     expensive. This oppression--so the strategic analysis goes--\n     is made possible by taxation, such that cutting taxes becomes \n     an objective in its own right, business cycles \n     notwithstanding.\n       Similarly, ``supply-side'' economics speaks to the people \n     as producers, as against the Government as consumer.\n       Within the Republican Party this is put forth as populism \n     and argued for as such * * *. Asked by a commentator whether \n     an across-the-board tax could rally lead to the needed \n     increase in savings, a Republican Senator replied that he \n     took for granted that the people would know what to do with \n     their own money.\n\n  Then came the revolution.\n  Some 4 months after I wrote that article, a new Republican President \nwas elected, himself much committed to this view, and his White House \nstaff fair to obsessed with it. They welcomed deficits for reasons \nwholly at odds with their Democratic, or for that matter, Republican \npredecessors.\n  From the early 1980's, I found myself often on this Senate floor, and \non several occasions in print, making the point that in the Reagan \nWhite House and Office of Management and Budget, a huge gamble was \nbeing made. A crisis was being created by bringing about deficits \nintended to force the Congress to cut back certain programs.\n  I encountered great difficulty getting this idea across. No one \nbelieved what I was saying. The intentional nature of the Reagan \ndeficits was not understood or admitted at the time, nor has it been \nvery widely acknowledged since. Yet it did happen, and it has been well \ndocumented.\n  In a television speech 16 days after his inauguration, President \nReagan clearly stated it:\n\n       There were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be \n     cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know we can lecture \n     our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and \n     breath. Or we can cut their extravagance by simply reducing \n     their allowance.\n\n  The person principally involved, Mr. David Stockman, who was \nPresident Reagan's Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \nwrote a memoir of his time in Washington entitled, ``The Triumph of \nPolitics.'' He described in detail what happened and how it went wrong: \nhow the Reagan Revolution--as based on the immutability of the Laffer \ncurve--had failed. According to Stockman, President Reagan's top \neconomic advisers knew from the very beginning that supply-side \neconomics would not and could not work.\n  That superb journalist and historian, Haynes Johnson, wrote of this \nin his wonderful book, ``Sleepwalking Through History: America Through \nthe Reagan Years,'' published in 1991. Johnson writes that the Reagan \nteam saw:\n\n     * * * the implicit failure of supply-side theory as an \n     opportunity, not a problem * * *. [The] secret solution was \n     to let the federal budget deficits rise, thus leaving \n     Congress no alternative but to cut domestic programs.\n\n  I will simply quote a footnote on page 111, where Johnson says of \nthis Senator:\n\n       [Stockman's] former mentor Moynihan was the first to charge \n     that the Reagan Administration ``consciously and deliberately \n     brought about'' higher deficits to force congressional \n     domestic cuts. Moynihan was denounced and then proven \n     correct, except that the cuts to achieve balanced budgets \n     were never made and the deficits ballooned even higher.\n\n  David Stockman writes in his book, ``If I had to pinpoint the moment \nwhen I ceased to believe that the Reagan Revolution was possible, \nSeptember 11, 1981 * * * would be it.'' It was then that Stockman \nrealized that no huge spending cuts would ever come. He pleaded with \nthe President and his\n colleagues in the Cabinet to do something. But nothing was done. The \nPresident had claimed he would use his pen to veto big spending \nappropriations bills. But of the reality, Stockman wrote:\n\n     * * * the President's pen remained in his pocket. He did not \n     veto a single appropriations bill * * *. Come to think of it, \n     he did use his pen--to sign them * * *. The 1983 deficit had \n     * * * already come in at $208 billion. The case for a major \n     tax increase was overwhelming, unassailable, inescapable, and \n     self-evident. Not to raise taxes when all other avenues were \n     closed was a willful act of ignorance and grotesque \n     irresponsibility. In the entire twentieth-century fiscal \n     history of the Nation, there has been nothing to rival it.\n\n  And so, President Reagan became the biggest spender of them all.\n\n       By the mid-1980's the Reagan transportation budget in \n     constant dollars topped Jimmy Carter's best year by 15 \n     percent, Johnson's by about 40 percent, and Kennedy's by 50 \n     percent. Big Government? That was something for the \n     speechwriters to fight as long as they didn't mention any \n     names * * *. Spending continued largely unabated in all \n     cases.\n\n  I recall George Will speaking to a group of businessmen at breakfast \nin about 1984 and saying, ``I have a door prize of a toaster for anyone \nwho can name one program that President Reagan promised to cut during \nhis 1984 Presidential campaign.'' Everyone in the room started looking \naround at his or her neighbor, clearly wondering, ``Why can't I \nremember one?'' Whereupon Mr. Will came to their rescue, ``Don't feel \nbad about your memory. There was none.''\n  They created a crisis. We indulged ourselves, in the early 1980's, in \na fantasy of young men who perhaps had too much power and too little \nexperience in the real world. They thought they could play with fire, \ncreate a crisis. Well, the fire spread, and the numbers--the damages--\nare well known to all of us. On January 20, 1981, the Federal debt \nstood at $940.5 billion, which was no great cause for concern. Eight \nyears later, it was $2.86 trillion. What had taken our Nation nearly \ntwo centuries to amass had been tripled in just 8 years. By the end of \n1992, it was just over $4 trillion.\n  On December 31, 1983, I published an article in the New Republic \nentitled, \n[[Page S2329]] ``Reagan's Bankrupt Budget,'' in which I noted, ``The \nprojected 8-year growth is $1.64 trillion, bringing us to a total debt, \nby 1989, of $2.58 trillion.'' As it turned out, the total debt in 1989 \nwas $2.86 trillion. Not bad shooting. Four years later it was a little \nover $4 trillion.\n  I have spoken of two events of the 1980's. First, the tax cuts of \n1981 followed by the severe recession of 1982. Next, the development \nwithin the incumbent administration of a grand strategy of using \ndeficits to bring about a reduction in the size of Government, followed \nby a disinclination to cut specific programs. Mr. Stockman's memoirs \nprovide graphic examples of this latter development, including the \ncelebrated counsel he gave the President on how much to cut them. Let \nme in passing mention a possible third event which led in part to the \ngreat increase in debt during the 1980's. This was recently alluded to \nby Lawrence J. Korb in an article in the Washington Post. Mr. Korb, now \nat the Brookings Institution, contends that ``the Reagan buildup'' of \nthe military was part of a deliberate strategy of engaging the Soviet \nUnion in an arms race that would leave them bankrupt. The buildup, Mr. \nKorb continues:\n\n     * * * was based not on military need but upon a strategy of \n     bankrupting the Soviet Union. If the Reagan administration \n     had budgeted only for military purposes, the 1985 budget \n     would have been some $80 billion less. The 1995 defense \n     budget is still at about 85 percent of its average Cold War \n     level, and actually higher [even in inflation adjusted \n     dollars] than it was in 1955 [under Eisenhower] and in 1975 \n     [under Nixon], when the Soviet Empire and Soviet Union were \n     alive and well.\n\n  It is difficult to have been in Washington in those times and not to \nhave been aware of such thinking in the environs of the White House. \nFor the first 4 years of the Reagan administration, I was vice chairman \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and one heard such \nthoughts. By this time, I was convinced that the Soviet Union would \nsoon break up along ethnic lines and largely in consequence of ethnic \nconflict, and so was perhaps more attentive than some. Certainly, \nRaymond L. Garthoff, in his study, ``The Great\n Transition, American-Soviet Relations and the End of the Cold War'' \n[Brookings, 1994] holds to the view that something of this sort took \nplace.\n\n  He writes:\n\n       A final element in President Reagan's personal view was \n     that not only was the Soviet system ideologically bankrupt \n     and therefore vulnerable, but that it was also stretched to \n     the utmost by Soviet military efforts and therefore unable to \n     compete in an intensified arms race. As he put it in a talk \n     with some editors, ``They cannot vastly increase their \n     military productivity because they've already got their \n     people on a starvation diet . . . if we show them [we have] \n     the will and determination to go forward with a military \n     buildup . . . they then have to weigh, do they want to meet \n     us realistically on a program of disarmament or do they want \n     to face a legitimate arms race in which we're racing. But up \n     until now, we've been making unilateral concessions, allowing \n     ours to deteriorate, and they've been building the greatest \n     military machine the world has ever seen. But now they're \n     going to be faced with [the fact] that we could go forward \n     with an arms race and they can't keep up.'' The Soviet system \n     was indeed under growing strain, as would become increasingly \n     evident throughout the 1980s. But most of the premises \n     underlying Reagan's viewpoint were highly questionable: that \n     the United States had not also been active in the arms \n     competition and had been making unilateral concessions, that \n     the Soviet Union was unable to match adequately a further \n     American buildup, and that the Soviet Union would respond to \n     such a buildup by accepting disarmament proposals that the \n     United States would regard as ``realistic'' (that is, would \n     favor the United States more than the SALT II Treaty that had \n     been produced under the strategic arms limitations talks \n     [SALT] conducted by the three preceding administrations but \n     not ratified). But whatever their merit, they represented the \n     thinking of the new president and his administration.\n\n  Just how much this thinking deepened the deficits of the 1980's is \ndifficult to assess. It is now more a matter for historians. But it can \nhardly have helped. And so we come to a compound irony. The great \nstruggles over the nature of the American economic system that dated \nfrom the Progressive Era to the New Deal ended in a quiet acceptance of \nthe private enterprise economy so long as government could pursue \npolicies that produced relatively full employment. Hardly a \nrevolutionary notion, but surely an honorable undertaking. Even so, for \nthe first time, it disposed American government toward deficit \nfinancing. Nothing huge; nothing unmanageable; but real.\n  In 1965, in the first article in the first issue of The Public \nInterest entitled, ``The Professionalization of Reform,'' I set forth \nthe now somewhat embarrassing proposition that Keynesian economics in \ncombination with the statistical feats such as those of the National \nBureau of Economic Research, founded by\n Wesley C. Mitchell at Columbia University, invested us with unimagined \npowers for social good. I was not entirely wrong.\n\n       Governments promise full employment--and then produce it. \n     (in 1964 unemployment, adjusted to conform more or less to \n     United States' definitions, was 2.9 percent in Italy, 2.5 \n     percent in France and Britain, and 0.4 percent in Germany. \n     Consider the contrast with post-World War I.) Governments \n     undertake to expand their economy at a steady rate--and do \n     so. (In 1961 the members of the Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development, which grew out of the Marshall \n     Plan, undertook to increase their output by 50 percent during \n     the decade of the 1960's. The United States at all events is \n     right on schedule.)\n       The ability to predict events, as against controlling them, \n     has developed even more impressively--the Council of Economic \n     Advisers' forecast of GNP for 1964 was off by only $400 \n     million in a total of $623 billion; the unemployment forecast \n     was on the nose.\n\n  And yet I did not entirely see--did not at all see--the serpent \nlurking in that lovely garden.\n\n       The singular nature of the new situation in which the \n     Federal government finds itself is that the immediate supply \n     of resources available for social purposes might actually \n     outrun the immediate demand of established programs. Federal \n     expenditures under existing programs rise at a fairly \n     predictable rate. But, under conditions of economic growth, \n     revenues rise faster. This has given birth to the phenomenon \n     of the ``fiscal drag''--the idea that unless the Federal \n     Government disposes of this annual increment, either by \n     cutting taxes or adding programs, the money taken out of \n     circulation by taxes will slow down economic growth, and \n     could, of course, at a certain point stop it altogether.\n\n  Which is to say, deficit spending as public policy. How that would \nhave troubled FDR. On election night of 1936, he was at Hyde Park \nsurrounded by friends and overwhelmed by the electoral returns. The New \nDeal was triumphant. And so, as Alan Brinkley notes in his forthcoming \nstudy, ``The End of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War,'' \na few days later, boarding a train to return to Washington, he told \nwell-wishers, ``Now I'm going back * * * to do what they call balance \nthe budget and fulfill the first promise of the campaign,'' which in \n1932 had been to balance the budget.\n  In much this manner, the great struggle with the Marxist-Leninist \nvision of the future, and its concrete embodiment in the Soviet Union, \nended with the most assertively conservative administration of the \npost-New Deal, assertively opposed to deficit spending of any kind, \nmore or less clandestinely pursuing just the opposite course.\n  And yet, may we not agree that both these tendencies are now abated, \nif not altogether spent? A post-Keynesian economics is no longer as \nconfident of fiscal policy as was an earlier generation. A post-cold-\nwar foreign policy has no need to concern itself with bankrupting the \nSoviet Union: the region is quite bankrupt enough, and indeed, receives \nAmerican aid. Can we not then look upon our present debt much as the \nTruman and Eisenhower administrations looked upon the debt incurred \nduring World War II. Pay it off and get on with the affairs of the \nNation. World War II, and the cold war were fought, in a legitimate \nsense, to defend the Constitution of the United States against all \nenemies, foreign and domestic. It would be awful if in this moment of \nvictory we should choose to mutilate the basic law of the land for \nwhich so much was sacrificed.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have much more to say. But I am prepared, if the \nmajority leader is willing, to bring the Senate today to a close.\n  So I will suggest the absence of a quorum and see if we can get that \ndone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/08/senate-section/article/S2324-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of \nthe National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of \nthe International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  Executive Order No. 12722 ordered the immediate blocking of all \nproperty and interests in property of the Government of Iraq (including \nthe Central Bank of Iraq), then or thereafter located in the United \nStates or within the possession or control of a United States person. \nThat order also prohibited the importation into the United States of \ngoods and services of Iraqi origin, as well as the exportation of \ngoods, services, and technology from the United States to Iraq. The \norder prohibited travel-related transactions to or from Iraq and the \nperformance of any contract in support of any industrial, commercial, \nor governmental project in Iraq. United States persons were also \nprohibited from granting or extending credit or loans to the Government \nof Iraq.\n  The foregoing prohibitions (as well as the blocking of Government of \nIraq property) were continued and augmented on August 9, 1990, by \nExecutive Order No. 12724, which was issued in order to align the \nsanctions imposed by the United States with United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 661 of August 6, 1990.\n  Executive Order No. 12817 was issued on October 21, 1992, to \nimplement in the United States measures adopted in United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 778 of October 2, 1992. Resolution No. 778 \nrequires U.N. Member States temporarily to transfer to a U.N. escrow \naccount up to $200 million apiece in Iraqi oil sale proceeds paid by \npurchasers after the imposition of U.N. sanctions on Iraq, to finance \nIraqi's obligations for U.N. activities with respect to Iraq, such as \nexpenses to verify Iraqi weapons destruction, and to provide \nhumanitarian assistance in Iraq on a nonpartisan basis. A portion of \nthe escrowed funds will also fund the activities of the U.N. \nCompensation Commission in Geneva, which will handle claims from \nvictims of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Member States also may make \nvoluntary contributions to the account. The funds placed in the escrow \naccount are to be returned, with interest, to the Member States that \ntransferred them to the United Nations, as funds are received from \nfuture sales of Iraqi oil authorized by the U.N. Security Council. No \nMember State is required to fund more than half of the total transfers \nor contributions to the escrow account.\n  This report discusses only matters concerning the national emergency \nwith respect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order No. 12722 and \nmatters relating to Executive Orders Nos. 12724 and 12817 (the \n``Executive orders''). The report covers events from August 2, 1994, \nthrough February 1, 1995.\n  1. There has been one action affecting the Iraqi Sanctions \nRegulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 575 (the ``Regulations''), administered by \nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) of the Department of the \nTreasury, since my last report on August 2, 1994. On February 1, 1995 \n(60 Fed. Reg. 6376), FAC amended the Regulations by adding to the list \nof Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) of Iraq set forth in \nAppendices A (``entities and individuals'') and B (``merchant \nvessels''), the names of 24 cabinet ministers and 6 other senior \nofficials of the Iraqi government, as well as 4 Iraqi state-owned \nbanks, not previously identified as SDNs. Also added to the Appendices \nwere the names of 15 entities, 11 individuals, and 1 vessel that\n were newly identified as Iraqi SDNs in the comprehensive list of SDNs \nfor all sanctions programs administered by FAC that was published in \nthe Federal Register (59 Fed. Reg. 59460) on November 17, 1994. In the \nsame document, FAC also provided additional addresses and aliases for 6 \npreviously identified Iraqi SDNs. This Federal Register publication \nbrings the total number of listed Iraqi SDNs to 66 entities, 82 \nindividuals, and 161 vessels.\n\n  Pursuant to section 575.306 of the Regulations, FAC has determined \nthat these entities and individuals designated as SDNs are owned or \ncontrolled by, or are acting or purporting to act directly or \nindirectly on behalf of, the Government of Iraq, or are agencies, \ninstrumentalities or entities of that government. By virtue of this \ndetermination, all property and interests in property of these entities \nor persons that are in the United States or in the possession or \ncontrol of United States persons are blocked. Further, United States \npersons are prohibited from engaging in transactions with these \nindividuals or entities unless the transactions are licensed by FAC. \nThe designations were made in consultation with the Department of \nState. A copy of the amendment is attached to this report.\n  2. Investigations of possible violations of the Iraqi sanctions \ncontinue to be pursued and appropriate enforcement actions taken. The \nFAC continues its involvement in lawsuits, seeking to prevent the \nunauthorized transfer of blocked Iraqi assets. There are currently 38 \nenforcement actions pending, including nine cases referred by FAC to \nthe U.S. Customs Service for joint investigation. Additional FAC civil \npenalty notices were prepared during the reporting period for \nviolations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the \nRegulations with respect to transactions involving Iraq. Four penalties \ntotaling $26,043 were collected from two banks, one company, and one \nindividual for violations of the prohibitions against transactions \ninvolving Iraq.\n  3. Investigation also continues into the roles played by various \nindividuals and firms outside Iraq in the Iraqi government procurement \nnetwork. These investigations may lead to additions to FAC's listing of \nindividuals and organizations determined to be SDNs of the Government \nof Iraq.\n  4. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 12817 implementing United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution No. 778, on October 26, 1992, FAC directed \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York to establish a blocked account for \nreceipt of certain post August 6, 1990, Iraqi oil sales proceeds, and \nto hold, invest, and transfer these funds as required by the order. On \nOctober 5, 1994, following payments by the Governments of Canada \n($677,756.99), the United Kingdom ($1,740,152.44), and the European \nCommunity ($697,055.93), respectively, to the special United Nations-\ncontrolled account, entitled ``United Nations Security Council \nResolution 778 Escrow Account,'' the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \nwas directed to transfer a corresponding amount of $3,114,965.36 from \nthe blocked account it holds to the United Nations-controlled account. \nSimilarly, on December 16, 1994, following the payment of $721,217.97 \nby the Government of the Netherlands, $3,000,891.06 by the European \nCommunity, $4,936,808.84 by the Government of \n[[Page S2331]] the United Kingdom, $190,476.19 by the Government of \nFrance, and $5,565,913.29 by the Government of Sweden, the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York was directed to transfer a corresponding \namount of $14,415,307.35 to the United Nations-controlled account. \nAgain, on December 28, 1994, following the payment of $853,372.95 by \nthe Government of Denmark, $1,049,719.82 by the European Community, \n$70,716.52 by the Government of France, $625,390.86 by the Government \nof Germany, $1,151,742.01 by the Government of the Netherlands, and \n$1,062,500.00 by the Government of the United Kingdom, the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York was directed to transfer a corresponding \namount of $4,813,442.16 to the United Nations controlled account. \nFinally, on January 13, 1995, following the payment of $796,167.00 by \nthe Government of the Netherlands, $810,949.24 by the Government of \nDenmark, $613,030.61 by the Government of Finland, and $2,049,600.12 by \nthe European Community, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was \ndirected to transfer a corresponding amount of $4,269,746.97 to the \nUnited Nations-controlled account. Cumulative transfers from the \nblocked Federal Reserve Bank of New York account since issuance of \nExecutive Order No. 12817 have amounted to $157,542,187.88 of the up to \n$200 million that the United States is obligated to match from blocked \nIraqi oil payments, pursuant to United Nations Security Council \nResolution 778.\n  5. The Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued a total of 533 \nspecific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to Iraq or Iraqi \nassets since August 1990. Since my last report, 37 specific licenses \nhave been issued. Licenses were issued for transactions such as the \nfiling of legal actions against Iraqi governmental entities, legal \nrepresentation of Iraq, and the exportation to Iraq of donated \nmedicine, medical supplies, food intended for humanitarian relief \npurposes, the execution of powers of attorney relating to the \nadministration of personal assets and decedents' estates in Iraq, and \nthe protection of preexistent intellectual property rights in Iraq.\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from August 2, 1994, through February 1, 1995,\n that are directly attributable to the exercise of powers and \nauthorities conferred by the declaration of a national, emergency with \nrespect to Iraq are reported to be about $2.25 million, most of which \nrepresents wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs \nwere largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly \nin the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the \nOffice of the Under Secretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the \nGeneral Counsel), the Department of State (particularly the Bureau of \nEconomic and Business Affairs, the Bureau of Near East Affairs, the \nBureau of Organization Affairs, and the Office of the Legal Adviser), \nand the Department of Transportation (particularly the U.S. Coast \nGuard).\n\n  7. The United States imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in response \nto Iraq's illegal invasion and occupation of Kuwait, a clear act of \nbrutal aggression. The United States, together with the international \ncommunity, is maintaining economic sanctions against Iraq because the \nIraqi regime has failed to comply fully with United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions. Security Council resolutions on Iraq call for the \nelimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the inviolability of \nthe Iraq-Kuwait boundary, the release of Kuwaiti and other third-\ncountry nationals, compensation for victims of Iraqi aggression, long-\nterm monitoring of weapons of mass destruction capabilities, the return \nof Kuwaiti assets stolen during Iraq's illegal occupation of Kuwait, \nrenunciation of terrorism, an end to internal Iraqi repression of its \nown civilian population, and the facilitation of access of \ninternational relief organizations to all those in need in all parts of \nIraq. More than 4 years after the invasion, a pattern of defiance \npersists: a refusal to account for missing Kuwaiti detainees; failure \nto return Kuwaiti property worth millions of dollars, including weapons \nused by Iraq in its movement of troops to the Kuwaiti border in October \n1994; sponsorship of assassinations in Lebanon and in northern Iraq; \nincomplete declarations to weapons inspectors; and ongoing widespread \nhuman rights violations. As a result, the U.N. sanctions remain in \nplace; the United States will continue to enforce those sanctions under \ndomestic authority.\n  The Baghdad government continues to violate basic human rights of its \nown citizens through systematic repression of minorities and denial of \nhumanitarian assistance. The Government of Iraq has repeatedly said it \nwill not be bound by United Nations Security Council Resolution 688. \nFor more than 3 years, Baghdad has maintained a blockade of food, \nmedicine, and other humanitarian supplies against northern Iraq. The \nIraqi military routinely harasses residents of the north, and has \nattempted to ``Arabize'' the Kurdish, Turcomen, and Assyrian areas in \nthe north. Iraq has not relented in its artillery attacks against \ncivilian population centers in the south, or in its burning and \ndraining operations in the southern marshes, which have forced \nthousands to flee to neighboring States.\n  In 1991, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolutions 706 \nand 712, which would permit Iraq to sell up to $1.6 billion of oil \nunder U.N. auspices to fund the provision of food, medicine, and other \nhumanitarian supplies to the people of Iraq. The resolutions also \nprovide for the payment of compensation to victims of Iraqi aggression \nand other U.N. activities with respect to Iraq. The equitable \ndistribution within Iraq of this humanitarian assistance would be \nsupervised and monitored by the United Nations. The Iraqi regime so far \nhas refused to accept these resolutions and has thereby chosen to \nperpetuate the suffering of its civilian population. More than a year \nago, the Iraqi government informed the United Nations that it would not \nimplement Resolutions 706 and 712.\n  The policies and actions of the Saddam Hussein regime continue to \npose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States, as well as to regional peace and \nsecurity. The U.N. resolutions require that the Security Council be \nassured of Iraq's peaceful intentions in judging its compliance with \nsanctions. Because of Iraq's failure to comply fully with these \nresolutions, the United States will continue to apply economic \nsanctions to deter it from threatening peace and stability in the \nregion.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to designate the Federal Courthouse in Decatur, AL, as \nthe ``Seybourn H. Lynne Federal Courthouse,'' and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  seybourn h. lynne federal courthouse\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesignating the Federal courthouse in Decatur, AL, as the ``Seybourn H. \nLynne Federal Courthouse.'' Judge Seybourn Harris Lynne was appointed \nto the Federal bench by President Harry S. Truman in 1946, and he is \nthe most senior judge in the Federal court system. He has dedicated \nover 53 years of distinguished service to the judicial system, with 46 \nof those years spent on the U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Alabama.\n  Judge Lynne is a native of Decatur, AL, and Auburn University--at \nthat time known as the Alabama Polytechnic Institute--where he \ngraduated with highest distinction. He earned his law degree from the \nUniversity of Alabama in 1930. While in law school, he served as track \ncoach and assistant football coach at the university. Upon graduation \nfrom law school, Judge Lynne practiced law in a partnership formed with \nhis father, Mr. Seybourn Arthur Lynne.\n  In 1934, Seybourn Lynne was elected judge of Morgan County court. He \nremained in that position until January 1941, when he took over the \nduties of judge of the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Alabama. In December \n1942, he resigned from the bench to voluntarily enter the military. \nAfter earning the rank of lieutenant colonel, he was relieved of active \nduty in November 1945 and awarded the Bronze Star Medal for gallant \nservice against the enemy.\n  When an opening occurred on the Federal bench, Alabama Senators \nLister Hill and John Bankhead were called up to recommend an \nappropriate individual to be considered by the White House for \njudgeship. In January 1946, President Truman appointed Judge Lynne to \nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In 1953, \nhe became the chief judge, and in 1973, the senior judge.\n  As chief judge for the northern district of Alabama, Judge Lynne has \nbeen known as an outstanding leader. His knowledge and management \nskills ensured a solid, working relationship between the Federal bench \nand the bar. The northern district has not been burdened with a stale \nand over-ripe docket, and the court's caseload was kept timely and \ncurrent, thanks to the Judge Lynne's leadership.\n  In addition to his leadership responsibilities, Judge Lynne worked \nhard and carried a full caseload. In fact, even in senior status, he \ncontinues to work long hours and keeps a complete docket of cases. Over \nthe years, Judge \n[[Page S2333]] Lynne has been recognized as an outstanding mediator who \noften was able to reconcile competing interests in order to forge a \nthoughtful compromise. A number of businesses and individuals in \nAlabama are growing and thriving today due to his abilities as an \narbiter who was able to settle complex and difficult disputes.\n  The judge has also been a notable community leader, serving in \nchurch, civic, and professional activities. He is a lifetime deacon, \nBible class teacher, and a trustee of Southside Baptist Church. He has \nserved both the crippled children's clinic of Birmingham and the Eye \nFoundation Hospital of Birmingham as trustee. In 1967, he served as the \npresident of the University of Alabama's Alumni Association.\n  Mr. President, it is indeed fitting to honor Judge Lynne for his many \nyears of tireless work on behalf of the State and Federal benches. He \nshines as a living example of the late President Truman's rich legacy, \nand designating the Federal courthouse in Decatur, AL in his honor will \nremain generations to come of his service to our country.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HEFLIN:\n  S. 370. A bill to provide guidelines for the membership of committees \nmaking recommendations on the rules of procedure appointed by the \nJudicial Conference, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                  U.S. Judicial Conference Legislation\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, sections 2071 through 2077 of title 28 of \nthe United States Code are the cluster of statutory provisions \nauthorizing the Supreme Court to issue the rules under which the \nvarious Federal courts function. While there have been many amendments \nto these sections over the years, the group is commonly referred to as \nthe Rules Enabling Act. The original act, adopted in 1934, did not \nprovide for committees to aid the Supreme Court in exercising this \nresponsibility, but Chief Justice Hughes decided to appoint an advisory \ncommittee, whose original membership consisted of 13 members. Former \nAttorney General William Mitchell chaired the committee, which \ncontained four law professors and eight very distinguished lawyers, \nincluding the president of the American Bar Association and the \npresident of the American Law Institute. Between 1935 and the final \npromulgation of the rules in 1938, there were some changes in the \npersonnel. Four practicing lawyers, two professors, and one district \ncourt judge became members of the committee. For the stupendous impact \non the legal system of America, no subsequent rules have had the \ndynamic quality of those original rules.\n  Over time, Congress has refined the system. The assistance of the \ncommittees is now regularized by statute--see 28 U.S.C. section \n2073(a)(2)--and this section of the statute provides that the various \ncommittees, like the early committee, ``shall consist of members of the \nbench and the professional bar and trial and appellate judges.'' The \nmembers are appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States.\n  The rulemaking system, as spread over the various branches of the \ncourt system with rules of civil, criminal, appeals, evidence, \nbankruptcy, and so forth, has on the whole worked fairly well. Suffice \nit to say that today the rules pass from advisory committees to a \ncentral standing committee, and from there go to the Judicial \nConference of the United States, which does in fact exercise a \nmeaningful supervisory function. For example, last year the conference \ndeleted a rule which had been recommended to it by the committee \nstructure in the civil field. After the conference approves a rule, it \nthen passes to the Supreme Court of the United States, whose members \nhave somewhat differing views as to what function they can be expected \nactually to perform; there is some sentiment for letting the process \nstop with the Judicial Conference. Next, the rules pass to Congress, \nand if it does not disapprove them within 180 days, they become \neffective.\n  I turn now to the exact matter at issue. I can most easily do so by \nquoting from a statement by the American Bar Association, dated March \n28, 1994, to the relevant committee of the Judicial Conference:\n\n       In 1935, when work was begun on the Federal rules, the \n     advisory committee that did the drafting was comprised of \n     nine lawyers and four academics; there were no judges \n     involved. In 1960, when the advisory committee was \n     reconstituted, a majority of its members were practicing \n     lawyers. As late as 1981, 40 percent of the advisory \n     committee were practitioners. Today, no more than 4 members \n     of the key panel of 13 civil rules drafters are trial \n     lawyers. While the inclusion of judges in the process has had \n     undoubted benefit, the near-total exclusion of practicing \n     trial lawyers has skewed the process and its product. We are \n     not confident, as a consequence, that the process has \n     produced rules that respond to the concerns of litigants and \n     the lawyers who represent them in court. This trend must be \n     reversed and lawyers restored to a position of real \n     responsibility in the rules drafting process. In order to do \n     this most effectively, and to benefit from the positive and \n     valuable contributions of practicing lawyers to the rules \n     process, the membership on all the advisory committees should \n     be expanded to include more bar representation.\n\n  I believe this position is well taken. Clearly a gulf has arisen \nbetween the rulemakers and the bar, which must live under those rules. \nIn connection with the civil rules of last year, the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Courts and Administrative Practice, which I chair, held \nhearings on the proposed rules changes, and we were overwhelmed by \nrepresentatives of the bar strenuously objecting to several of the \nproposed rule changes. Both the House and Senate relevant committees \nconcluded that the bar protests should be honored and that the rules \nshould be changed; however, tangles in our own procedures prevented the \nmore objectionable proposals from being deleted and all of the proposed \nchanges went into effect on December 1, 1993.\n  The bill I offer today will restore the composition of these \ncommittees which existed from the original rules in 1935 until \napproximately 1980 and which have been altered only in very recent \ntimes.\n  This bill provides that a majority of all the rules committees shall \nbe drawn from the practicing bar. It by no means diminishes the \nvaluable role of academics and of judges, but it would restore to the \nbar a voice of responsibility.\n  At the present time, under our statutes, the rules committees conduct \nextensive hearings. These become so crowded that individual \npresentations are necessarily brief, but they are balanced in the sense \nof giving broad scope to those who may participate. What is presented \nat those hearings, what is developed by the committee reporters and \nstaff, and what is proposed by the various committee members themselves \nare all put into a mix which must be finally shaped by the committee \nitself. In my judgment, those committees are seriously lacking in \nbalance. Their work product goes to the Judicial Conference, by \ndefinition composed entirely of judges; and assuming that the Supreme \nCourt stays in the process, then to that body which is of course \ncomposed entirely of judges. Somewhere in the process, making rules \nunder which the courts shall function and the bar of the country shall \ndo its business, there should be more room for the effective voice of \nthe bar itself.\n  My proposal does not limit the broad discretion of the Chief Justice \nof the United States, who will continue to select the membership of the \nvarious committees subject only to the restriction that a majority \nshould be members of the bar. I comfortably leave it to his good \njudgment as to how to achieve balanced committees.\n  I offer this bill, to provide that the majority of the various \ncommittees shall be composed of practicing lawyers, in order to restore \nthat balance, and I urge its consideration by my colleagues in the \nSenate. Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 370\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MEMBERSHIP OF COMMITTEES MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON \n                   RULES OF PROCEDURE.\n\n       Section 2073(a)(2) of title 28, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking out the second sentence and inserting in \n     lieu thereof ``Each such committee shall have a majority of \n     members of the practicing bar, and also shall have members of \n     the bench (including trial and appellate judges) and \n     academics.''.\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\n      By Mr. HEFLIN:\n  S. 371. A bill to make administrative and jurisdictional amendments \npertaining to the United States Court of Federal Claims and the judges \nthereof in order to promote efficiency and fairness, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   FEDERAL CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION ACT\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \namend title 28 of the United States Code to improve the Federal Claims \nlitigation process before the United States Court of Federal Claims and \nto assist the court in providing complete justice in cases that come \nbefore it. This legislation will also insure fair treatment for the \nregular and senior judges of the court by providing certain benefits \nequivalent to those available to other Federal trial judges. Enactment \nof this bill will provide the citizens of the United States with a more \nfair and complete remedy and the United States with a more effective \nforum for the resolution of claims against the Government.\n  The Court of Federal Claims is the Nation's primary forum for \nmonetary claims against the Federal Government. The court has \njurisdiction to entertain suits for money against the United States \nthat are founded upon the Constitution, an act of Congress, an \nExecutive order, a regulation of an executive department, or contract \nwith the United States and that do not sound in tort. The court hears \nmajor patent cases, Government contract suits, tax refund suits, fifth \namendment takings cases and Indian claims, among other types of \nlawsuits. This national court and its judges hear cases in every State \nand territory of the United States for the convenience of the \nlitigants, the witnesses and the Government. This benefits our judicial \nsystem and Nation by making the promise of fair dealing a reality.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today will make administrative \nand jurisdictional changes with the result that the court's resources \nare preserved and utilized to the maximum extent and the jurisdiction \nof the court is clarified for the benefit of all. The ultimate result \nwill be a more user-friendly forum which gets to the merits of \ncontroversies faster. In a moment, I will comment on all of the various \nsections of the bill, but first I would like to take this opportunity \nto comment on the need for the jurisdictional provisions of the bill.\n  A potential litigant should be able to examine chapter 91 of title \n28, United States Code, which commences with the Tucker Act, section \n1491, and to determine whether the court has jurisdiction of his claim \nand what relief is available. Of course, there are miscellaneous other \nprovisions extending jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims, for \nexample, 28 U.S.C. section 1346(a)(1), tax refund suits; 42 U.S.C. \nsection 300aa-11, Vaccine-injury compensation cases; and 50 U.S.C. app. \nsection 1989b-4(h), Japanese internment compensation appeals.\n  Chapter 91 of title 28 should be sufficiently clear so that even \nlawyers throughout the country who rarely handle claims against the \nGovernment could consult the code and find reliable answers. \nRegrettably, this is not the current situation. Instead, a typical \nclaimant is met with a barrage of assertions that the court lacks \njurisdiction to address the claim and/or lacks power to award relief \nrequested even in those cases where jurisdiction is conceded.\n  The amendments relating to jurisdiction in section 8 of the bill will \nresult in clarity that will make access to the courts less costly by \npermitting the court to get to the real merits of the cases, rather \nthan waste resources dealing with\n preliminary and peripheral issues, and these changes will result in \nreal civil justice reform.\n\n  The legislation that I am introducing today will repeal 28 U.S.C. \n1500, which has heretofore denied Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction \nover any claim with respect to which the plaintiff has pending a suit \nin any other court. Although, on its face, section 1500 may appear to \nprevent wasteful duplication, in practice it has had precisely the \nopposite effect. Elimination of this jurisdictional bar to suits \nrelated to cases in other courts will eliminate much wasteful \nlitigation over nonmerits issues and will leave the court free to deal \nwith potential duplication through the discretionary means of staying \narguable duplicative litigation, if the matter is being addressed in \nanother forum, or of proceeding with the case, if the matter appears to \nbe stalled in the other forum.\n  As currently construed section 1500 does not permit duplication of \nsuits even if the Court of Federal Claims action was filed first and \nhas received concentrated attention over a number of years. This \nsituation can result in a major waste of resources by litigants and the \ncourt. Repeal of section 1500 will also allow the plaintiff to protect \nitself against the running of the statue of limitations by the wrong \ninitial choice in this confusing area.\n  In this day of electronic communication, computer tracking of cases \nand centralized docket control by the justice department, the \nGovernment will always know if a related claim is pending in two \ndifferent courts and can request exercise of discretion by one or both \ncourts to prevent duplicative litigation. Repeal of section 1500 would \nsave untold wasted effort litigating over such marginal issues as \nwhether a claim in the district court really is the same as one in the \nCourt of Federal Claims.\n  Further, in cases which constitute review of administrative agency \naction, the potential litigant should be able to know with absolute \ncertainty what standard of review will be applied. In the proposed \nbill, the standard of review in the Administrative Procedure Act of \n1946 will be made explicitly applicable. Although one would naturally \nassume from the face of 5 U.S.C. section 706 that these standards \nalready apply in the Court of Federal Claims, there is some doubt and \nconfusion over precisely which standards apply and the source of such \nstandards. The proposed bill will end this confusion so that potential \nand actual litigants can know with certainty which standards will apply \nand where to find them.\n  No legitimate interests are served by having the parties guess and \nlitigate about the extent of the court's jurisdiction and powers or \nover the standard of review applicable in agency-review cases. \nEnactment of this bill will end such waste and keep everyone's focus on \nthe merits of a given case and effective steps toward resolution of \ncontroversy. It will instill confidence that in the Court of Federal \nClaims, and every litigant, including the Government, will receive \nprompt and efficient justice.\n  Let me provide a brief summary of my bill:\n  Section 1 states that this act shall be cited as the ``Court of \nFederal Claims Administration Act.''\n  Section 2 will provide that in the event a judge is not reappointed, \nthe judge will nonetheless remain in regular active status until his or \nher successor is appointed and takes office, thus insuring that the \ncourt will always have a full compliment of regular active judges.\n  Section 3 will provide that judges of the Court of Federal Claims \nshall have authority to serve on the territorial courts when, and only \nwhen, their services are needed and are requested by or on behalf of \nsuch courts.\n  Section 4 will simply clarify what is already assumed by all \nconcerning the official duty station of retired judges on senior \nstatus. It will provide that the place where a retired judge of the \nCourt of Federal Claims maintains his or her actual residence shall be \ndeemed to be his or her official duty station. This is consistent with \nthe current provision applicable to other Federal trial courts.\n  Section 5 will provide for Court of Federal Claims membership on the \nJudicial Conference of the United States. Currently, there is no Court \nof Federal Claims representation on the judicial conference, even \nthough the court is within the jurisdiction of the conference and \nderives its funding and administrative support from the administrative \noffice of the U.S. courts which in turn operates under the supervision \nand direction of the judicial conference.\n  Section 6 will provide that the chief judge of the Court of Federal \nClaims may call periodic judicial conferences, which will include \nactive participation of the bar, to consider the business of the court \nand improvements in the administration of justice in the court. This \nwill make explicit the authority \n[[Page S2335]] which has traditionally been assumed and exercised by \nthe court in conducting its business.\n  Section 7 will amend section 797 of title 28 to provide that the \nchief judge of the Court of Federal Claims is authorized to recall a \nformerly disabled judge who retires under the disability provisions of \ncourt's judicial retirement system if there is adequate demonstration \nof recovery from disability. This provision will match one currently \napplicable to formerly disabled judges of other Federal courts and will \nensure maximum use of all available resources to deal with the court's \ncaseload.\n  Section 8 makes several modifications to statutory provisions \npertaining to Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction in order to save \nrecurring litigation regarding where claims should be filed, to define \nwhat judicial powers the court may exercise, and to specify what \nstandards of review will apply in certain cases. Together, these \nchanges will save untold resources of litigants and the court, and will \nmake the court a more efficient forum for lawyers and parties to \nlitigate their monetary claims against the Government.\n  In addition, this section would extend to the court ancillary \njurisdiction under the Federal Tort Claims Act when such a claim is \ndirectly related to one otherwise plainly within the subject-matter \njurisdiction of the court. This will avoid wasteful and duplicative \nlitigation by authorizing the Federal Claims Court to address and \ndispose of the entire controversy in cases within its jurisdiction when \na related claim, although sounding in tort, may fairly be deemed to \narise from the same operative facts as the primary claim within the \ncourt's jurisdiction.\n  Section 9 will ensure that Court of Federal Claims judges over age 65 \nwho are on senior status will receive the same treatment as other \nFederal trial judges on senior status insofar as Social Security taxes \nand payments are concerned.\n  Section 10 amends title 28 to clarify that the judges of the Court of \nFederal Claims are judicial officers eligible for coverage under \nannuity, insurance, and other programs available under title 5 of the \nUnited States Code and will extend to those judges the opportunity to \ncontinue Federal life insurance coverage after retirement in the same \nmanner as all other Federal trial judges in the judicial branch.\n  In summary, this bill will make the Court of Federal Claims more \nefficient and productive, resulting in benefits to the litigating \npublic, the Government and the country as a whole. The United States \nCourt of Federal Claims is an important part of the Federal court \nsystem. The creation of this court by the Congress responds to a very \nbasic democratic imperative--fair dealing by the Government in disputes \nbetween the Government and the private citizen. As Abraham Lincoln \nnoted: ``It is as much the duty of the Government to render prompt \njustice against itself, in favor of citizens, as it is to administer \nthe same, between private individuals.'' These amendments will allow it \nto better comply with its mandate and assist it in providing improved \nservice to litigants and to the entire country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 371\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for making a temporary judgeship for the \nnorthern district of Alabama permanent, and creating a new judgeship \nfor the middle district of Alabama; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            JUDGESHIPS FOR U.S. DISTRICT COURTS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to provide \nfor making a temporary judgeship for the northern district of Alabama \npermanent, and creating a new judgeship for the middle district of \nAlabama. The need for these judgeships has arisen pursuant to an \nincrease in cases filed in both of these districts, as well as the \nfilings as projected in the future. Further, the need is intensified by \nthe judges, who are currently in a senior status in these districts, \nreducing their caseloads as they move toward full retirement.\n  Currently the 2 districts are served by 10 permanent district judges; \n7 in the northern district and 3 in the middle district. The bill I am \nintroducing would make permanent a temporary judgeship, authorized in \n1990, in the northern district. This conversion from a temporary \njudgeship to a permanent position was approved by the Judicial \nConference in September 1994. The addition of one more permanent \nposition to the middle district of Alabama's district court is \nwarranted, among other factors, due to the increased case filings which \nhave been experienced in that district over the past several years.\n  In the past few years the increasing case filings and caseloads of \nall of the district court judges has been managed well by the courts \nusing their available judicial resources. As the senior judges take on \nless cases, the remaining judges find themselves in situations in which \nthey find it more and more difficult to manage their growing dockets in \na timely manner. This not only affects the day-to-day operations of the \ncourt, but it also will inevitably affect litigants, by lengthening the \ntime for disposition of a case, from what is now one of the fastest \ndisposition periods in the Nation to a significantly slower pace.\n  I would like to identify several factors which are similar in both \ndistricts and will result in loss of judicial expediency unless \naddressed. First, the reduced role of senior judges has increased the \nactual volume of cases which each district judge must handle; each \ndistrict judge will have less time available to spend on each assigned \ncase. Second, the increasing number of case filings will further reduce \nthe capacity of the judges to devote time and attention to each case. \nAnd finally, both districts forecast an increase in the total number of \ncriminal felony cases as well as the number of multidefendant criminal \nfelony cases. To maintain the outstanding case management that \nlitigants have come to expect in these courts, and rightly deserve in \nthe all Federal courts, the factors stated above can be dealt with by \nmaking permanent the position in the northern district and by creating \none new position for the middle district.\n  Although these two districts have many concerns which are similar, \nthey also are facing problems unique to each respective court. In the \nnorthern district of Alabama, we are asking that the temporary \njudgeship, authorized in 1990, be made permanent. This district had the \nhighest pending cases per judge, according to the latest official data. \nFurthermore, it had the highest civil filings in the Nation for the 12-\nmonth period ending in September 1993. This high number of case filings \nalong with the previous caseloads, actually support a request for a \nninth judgeship, but we believe that the conversion of the temporary \njudgeship to the eight permanent judgeships will enable the district to \ncompetently handle its caseload.\n  The middle district faces substantial problems in caseloads per \njudge. For the year ending June 30, 1994, the weighted case filing per \njudge had increased to 556, representing a 12.5-percent increase over a \n5-year period. Weighted case filings of 556 cases per judge places that \ncourt second within the eleventh circuit and ninth in the Nation. \nDuring the statistical year ending June 30, 1994, the judges of the \nmiddle district averaged 650 case terminations per judge, which places \nthat court first in the circuit and first in the Nation. With only \nthree full-time judges and the near full retirement of the two senior \njudges the middle district may soon face dire consequences.\n  The judges in both the middle and northern districts of Alabama have \nproven, that even with what some court would consider impossible \ncaseloads, they have had the ability to dispose of cases in periods \nequal or better than the national average. To allow these district \ncourts to continue their work and avoid substantial impairment in their \nability to deliver justice we need to be assured that they have the \nnecessary judicial resources. My bill, which provides for a fourth \njudgeship in the middle district and conversion of the northern \ndistrict's temporary judgeship to a permanent position, supplies these \nresources.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 373. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide for \nState management of solid waste, to reduce and regulate the interstate \ntransportation of solid wastes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n     THE STATE REGULATION AND MANAGEMENT OF SOLID WASTE ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am today introducing--for the fourth \nCongress in a row--legislation that would grant States the authority to \nregulate the flow of solid waste across their borders and meet the \nenvironmental objectives of increased recycling and waste reduction.\n  In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the shipment of garbage \nacross State lines for the purposes of disposal is a form of commerce \nand thus entitled to protection under the commerce clause of the \nConstitution. Due to the fact that States cannot control shipments of \nimported garbage, the States have no ability to plan for the disposal \nof solid waste generated within their own borders or to preserve \nlandfill capacity for their own future needs. The only way for States \nto regulate the flow of garbage is for Congress to explicitly grant \nthem that authority. That is what the legislation I am introducing \ntoday would do.\n  For years now, the United States overall landfill capacity has been \nshrinking. From 1988 to 1991 the number of operating landfills dropped \nfrom 8,000 to 5,812, a 27-percent decrease. At the same time, the \namount of solid waste that is shipped across State borders for disposal \nhas grown. The more heavily populated regions of the country produce \nmore solid waste and have less capacity for additional landfill sties. \nThese States have been shipping solid wastes out of their own \njurisdictions and into landfills in States, like my State of Louisiana, \nwhich, for the moment, have some capacity to receive it. However, this \ncapacity will continue to disappear so long as States have no ability \nto control the amount of waste that comes into their territory for \ndisposal.\n  My State of Louisiana has had some experiences of its own related to \nthe interstate shipment of municipal wastes. The most infamous incident \nwas that of the so-called poo poo choo choo that brought 63 carloads of \nmunicipal waste--in this case stinking \n[[Page S2337]] sewage sludge--from Baltimore to railroad sidings near \nShriever, Labadieville, and Donaldsonville, LA in 1989. These 63 open \ncars full of rehydrated sludge were to be disposed of in a landfill. \nInstead, they sat on sidings near these towns for weeks. Finally, the \nprivate landfill operator in question found an alternative disposal \nsite and the train cars headed out of town.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would provide States with the \nauthority they need to regulate incoming shipments of garbage in return \nfor a commitment by the States to plan for the disposal of their own \nwastes and a commitment to increased recycling and waste reduction \nefforts. Each State would be required to develop a solid waste \nmanagement plan that would include a 20-year projection of how solid \nwastes generated within their own borders would be managed. The plan \nmust demonstrate that solid waste will be managed in accordance with \nthe following priorities; First, States must take steps to reduce the \namount of waste generated within their own borders; second, States must \nencourage recycling, energy and resource recovery. Only as a third and \nfinal option should States consider landfills, incinerators and other \noptions of disposal.\n  Each State will be required to demonstrate that is complies with this \nwaste management hierarchy and has issued all appropriate permits for \ncapacity sufficient to manage their own solid wastes for a rolling \nperiod of 5 years.\n  The Federal Government, working with the States, will be required to \nprovide technical and financial assistance to local communities to meet \nthe requirements of the plan. Any out-of-State wastes must be managed \nin accordance with State plans and may not impede the ability of States \nto manage their own solid waste.\n  Only after a State has an approved plan in place, will it be granted \nthe authority to refuse to accept waste from out-of-State sources and \nto charge higher disposal fees for a load of garbage based on its State \nof origin. Half of the proceeds from high out-of-State fees will go the \nlocality where the garbage is being disposed of and may only be used \nfor solid waste management activities.\n  Mr. President, a number of similar bills have been introduced on this \nsame subject over the last several years. Most of these measures did \nnot adequately address all of the issues surrounding the disposal of \nsolid waste and shipments across State borders. I strongly believe that \na planning process and the priorization of waste reduction, recycling \nand disposal options on a State-by-State basis should be a part of the \nsolution to the ongoing controversy over interstate garbage shipments.\n  I hope that we will be able to finally dispose of this issue this \nyear. I encourage my colleagues to address it in the comprehensive \nmanner outlined in this legislation.

A bill to amend chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, \nrelating to protective orders, sealing of cases, disclosures of \ndiscovery information in civil actions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n              [[Page S2339]] THE COURT SECRECY ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that I first \npresented in the last Congress, legislation that addresses the \ntroubling use of secrecy in our courts, which we have been studying in \nthe Judiciary Committee since 1990.\n  Far too often, the court system allows vital information that is \ndiscovered in litigation, and which directly bears on public health and \nsafety, to be covered up: to be shielded from mothers, fathers, and \nchildren whose lives are potentially at stake, and from the public \nofficials we have appointed to protect our health and safety.\n  This happens because of the use of so-called protective orders--\nreally gag orders issued by courts--that are designed to keep \ninformation discovered in the course of litigation secret and \nundisclosed.\n  Mr. President, these secrecy arrangements are far from benign. Last \nyear, the manufacturers of silicon breast implants agreed to a record \n$4 billion settlement of product liability claims. Most Americans do \nnot know that studies indicating the hazards of breast implants were \nuncovered as early as 1984 in litigation. But the sad truth is that \nbecause of a protective order that was issued when that case was \nsettled, in the mid 1980's this critical knowledge remained buried, \nhidden from public view, and from the FDA.\n  Ultimately, it wasn't until 1992--more than 7 years and literally \ntens of thousands of victims later--that the real story about silicon \nimplants came out. How can anyone tell the countless thousands of \nbreast implant victims that court secrecy isn't a real problem that \ndemands our attention?\n  And there are other unfortunate examples of court secrecy. For over a \ndecade, Miracle Recreation, A U.S. playground equipment company, \nmarketed a merry-go-round that caused serious injuries to scores of \nsmall children, including severed fingers and feet.\n  Lawsuits brought against the manufacturer were confidentially \nsettled, preventing the public and the Consumer Products Safety \nCommission from learning about the hazard. It took more than a decade \nfor regulators to discover the defeat, and for the company to recall \nthe merry-go-round.\n  There are yet more cases which we have detailed in past hearings. But \nperhaps the more troubling question is, What other secrets, currently \nheld under lock and key, could be saving lives if they were made \npublic?\n  Having said all this, we must in fairness recognize that there is \nanother side to this problem. Privacy is a cherished possession, and \nbusiness information is an important commodity. For this reason, the \ncourts must, in some cases, keep trade secrets and other business \ninformation confidential.\n  But, in my opinion, today's balance of these interests is entirely \ninadequate. Our legislation will ensure that courts do not carelessly \nand automatically sanction secrecy when the health and safety of the \nAmerican public is at stake. At the same time, the bill will allow \ndefendants to obtain secrecy orders when the need for privacy is \nsignificant and substantial.\n  The thrust of our legislation is straightforward. In cases affecting \npublic health and safety, courts would be required to apply a balancing \ntest: They could permit secrecy only if the need for privacy outweighs \nthe public need to know about potential health or safety hazards.\n  Moreover, courts could not, under the measure, issue protective \norders that would prevent disclosures to regulatory agencies. In this \nway, our bill will bring crucial information out of the darkness and \ninto the light.\n  I should note that we have made progress in this issue in the past \nyear. A majority of members of the Judiciary Committee voted last year \nfor a court secrecy proposal that was essentially identical to the bill \nwe introduce today. And even the Federal judiciary has attempted to \ntackle the problem, through the proposal they are now advancing is, in \nmy view, an incomplete solution.\n  To attack the problem of excessive court secrecy is not to attack the \nbusiness community. Most of the time, businesses seek protective orders \nfor legitimate reasons. And although some critics may dispute that \nbusinesses care about public health and safety, as a former \nbusinessman, I know that they do.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me note that we in the country take \npride in our judicial system for many good reasons. Our courts are \namong the finest, and the fairest in the world. But the time has come \nfor us to ask: Fair to whom?\n  Yes, the courts must be fair to defendants, and that is why I support \nproduct liability reform. But because the courts as public \ninstitutions, and because justice is a public good, our court system \nmust also do its part to help protect the public when appropriate, and \nnot just individual plaintiffs and defendants.\n  The bill we introduce today helps achieve this important goal; it \nhelps ensure that the public and regulators will learn about hazardous \nand defective products.\n  So I look forward to the support of my colleagues--on both sides of \nthe aisle--who believe, as I do, that when health and safety are at \nstake, there must be reasonable limit to the use of secrecy in our \ncourts.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM:\n  S. 375. A bill to impose a moratorium on sanctions under the Clean \nAir Act with respect to marginal and moderate ozone nonattainment areas \nand with respect to enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n             CLEAN AIR ACT SANCTIONS MORATORIUM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that \nprovides a much needed respite for the States from the onerous and \ninappropriate sanctions of the Clean Air Act. In its bureaucratic \nfervor to implement regulations and administrative procedures, the EPA \nhas shown a near complete disregard of the States' interests or the \nactual facts of the situation at hand. This bill prohibits the \nimplementation of these draconian sanctions and will give us time to \nanalyze more fully the Clean Air Act and the method of its \nimplementation.\n  The Clean Air Act is a well-intentioned attempt to resolve the \ncompeting interests of ecological preservation and economic growth. But \nas is usually the case with complex and patronizing Federal attempts to \nsolve local problems from Washington, it misses the mark. Throughout \nthis country communities are revolting against the EPA's enforcement of \nthe Clean Air Act and their edicts that States and localities must \nimplement a series of centralized automobile tailpipe testing \nprocedures. Unfortunately, the EPA has allowed its enforcement \nbureaucrats concentrate solely on the means of this act rather than the \nends.\n  A particularly egregious example of this lock of regulatory good \nsense occurred in my State of Michigan. Three western Michigan counties \nwere previously found by EPA to exceed the national ambient air quality \nstandards for ozone, which is a product of chemical reactions between \nvolatile organic compounds such as petroleum vapors, and oxygenated \nnitrogen, with summer sun and heat acting as the catalyst. Now I am \nheartened by EPA Administrator Browner's decision last night to \nredesignate these counties as in attainment. But I believe it was only \nthe threat of legislative action like this that forced the EPA to \nrevisit its strategy of enforcement.\n  Because of these ozone levels, the EPA previously directed Michigan \nto implement by July 1995 an ozone reduction plan that would reduce by \nat least 15 percent the ozone producing volatile organic compound \nemissions. As part of this reduction plan, the EPA determined that only \ncentralized automobile tailpipe exhaust inspection and maintenance \nprocedures--otherwise known as IM240 tests, because the test takes 240 \nseconds to administer--are 100 percent effective in reducing emissions. \nThese tests require the local citizens to travel as far as 50 miles to \ntesting facilities, then to another facility to repair the exhaust \nsystem determined by this test to be defective, and then back to the \nfirst testing facility for another test, possibly to start the whole \nprocess again.\n  The EPA unilaterally decided that any State's testing procedure that \nallows for testing and repair at the same facility is only 50 percent \nas effective as test-only facility procedures. Their \n[[Page S2340]] decision was based upon the idea that test-and-repair \nfacilities are rife with corruption and therefore pass automobiles \nwhich have defective exhaust systems. But the evidence shows otherwise. \nIn Georgia, where both test-and-repair and test-only facilities \noperate, the two procedures were shown to have nearly identical rates \nof properly identifying vehicles with faulty exhaust systems, tampered \nexhaust systems, and that the test-and-repair facilities effectively \ndiscovered tampered vehicles. Furthermore, the General Accounting \nOffice reported in 1992 that 25 percent of the vehicles tested by EPA \nusing the IM240 procedures failed an initial emissions test but passed \na second, even though no repairs were made to the vehicles. This \nphenomenon of flipper vehicles, where the same vehicle can have \nradically differing emission levels at different times, contributes as \nmuch as 20 percent of overall tailpipe emissions. As Douglas Lawson of \nthe Desert Research Institute has determined through exhaustive \nanalysis of I procedures, ``As long as there are vehicles with \nemissions variability on the road, an I/M program that relies upon \nscheduled testing is likely not be very effective.'' Which brings me to \nthe critical point of analysis which EPA consistently missed: how much \ndo test-only facility procedures actually reduce emissions over test-\nand-repair facility procedures?\n  The answer is ``not much.'' In fact, Mr. Lawson's previous comment is \nconsistently supported by the evidence at hand, including a very \ncomprehensive policy analysis by the Rand Corp. It states:\n\n       Existing national data, limited as it is, suggest little \n     difference in measures of effectiveness between centralized \n     and decentralized I/M programs. There is no empirical basis \n     to choose between different program types. And, no single \n     component, be it centralized IM240 or remote sensing \n     technology is likely to be the ``silver bullet'' that lowers \n     emission levels for a significant faction of gross polluting \n     vehicles.\n\n  It goes on to point out: ``The centralized/decentralized debate is \nless significant than a serious effort to rethink the entire Smog Check \nsystem and more generally, all programs to enhance Inspection and \nMaintenance.'' It is not an issue of test-and-repair facilities versus \ntest-only facilities, but rather an issue of the whole inspection and \nmaintenance process mentality.\n  The EPA nevertheless stuck doggedly by its centralized test-only \nprocedures. When my staff requested a summary of EPA's analysis of this\n issue, EPA sent 28 pages of data analyzing the differing rates of \ntampering detection and testing efficiency between centralized and \ndecentralized programs. Only one-half page, however, examined the \ncrucial issue of whether test-only procedures reduced overall \nemissions. EPA's analysis compared Arizona's emission levels under \ntest-only procedures to Indiana's emission levels with no I \nprocedures at all. From the data that Arizona has lower emission \nlevels, the EPA concludes test-only is superior to test-and-repair. \nThese leaps of logic, although convenient for pressing forth \nundesirable regulations, make for poor public policy.\n\n  Such serious breaks in logic highlight the EPA's inability to view \nthis issue in its totality. It is apparently paralyzed in its analysis \nby an overwhelming desire to implement centralized I procedures. \nAssistant EPA Administrator for Air Mary Nichols said as much before my \nsenior Michigan colleague's hearing on this issue last fall. She \nstated:\n\n       . . . anybody who has bothered to buy a car that meets \n     current emissions standards is owed an opportunity to have a \n     good inspection test done to make sure that car is \n     maintaining the emissions that it was designed to meet, \n     because if it is not, it should be getting repaired, and if \n     it is repaired, they are likely to experience better \n     performance and better fuel economy.\n\n  To the EPA, the only way to create such an opportunity is for the \nFederal Government to force all car owners to have their cars tested \nand repaired, so that they can rest assured their cars are operating \nproperly. Once again, members of the Clinton administration are out of \ntouch and are missing the point. We must protect our constituencies and \ntake the action necessary to stop this patronizing and intrusive \nbehavior in the future.\n  As a result of this convoluted logic, States are forced to adopt \ncentralized test-only programs because the EPA halves the emission \nreduction credits for decentralized test-and-repair programs within the \nState's emission reduction programs. If they do not adopt these \ncentralized procedures, the EPA will reject their emission reduction \nplan and place sanctions on the State. These sanctions include the \nwithholding of millions in Federal highway funds and Federal pollution \nreduction program grants, Federal takeovers of State emission reduction \nplans, and two-for-one emission offset requirements where no new \nemission producing facilities can be constructed unless the expected \nnew emissions are offset by two times that level of emissions at other \nfacilities in the area. I assume no facility operates and produces \nemissions unless it does so at a profit, so I seriously doubt any \nfacility will be shut down to make way for new facilities. These \noffsets would have effectively halted industrial growth in the area, \nand all because EPA wrongly wanted cars tested and repaired at separate \nfacilities.\n  This situation may even have seemed reasonable, given the existing \nlaw, if these areas were at fault for their allegedly high levels of \nozone, but that was not the case. Because the emissions that chemically \nreact to create ozone can travel in the air stream, the ozone levels \nexperienced in one area may be the result of emissions from hundreds of \nmiles away. Such was the case with the three counties in western \nMichigan. The three western Michigan counties of Kent, Ottawa, and \nMuskegon were all found by EPA to have ozone levels above the national \nambient air quality standard of 120 parts per billion. The ozone \ncontributions from the northern Indiana, northern Illinois, and \nWisconsin, however, provided over 98 percent of the ozone that resulted \nin nonattainment. In fact, even if these three counties were to reduce \ntheir emission levels to zero, the ozone levels would actually increase \nas the overwhelming ozone transport from the West drifted into the \nregion. Furthermore, even though the EPA claimed reducing western \nMichigan emissions would reduce ozone levels in northern Indiana during \nthat four per cent of the year when winds are from the northeast, such \nemissions are irrelevant to that area. The Lake Michigan Air Directors \nConsortium executive director Stephen Gerritson told my colleague \nSenator Levin in hearings last fall that western Michigan emissions did \nnot cause ozone nonattainment in northern Indiana. In fact, the area \nimpacted by these very infrequent western Michigan transported \nemissions is currently in attainment. The regulatory actions of the \nEPA, in their misguided attempt to solve western Michigan's supposed \nozone problem, would have actually made it worse.\n  In light of this action, the Governor of Michigan halted the further \nimplementation of such an unnecessary program last month. In the face \nof similarly bold exercises of States' rights, the EPA's Administrator \nreached out to the Governors in what I believe was an attempt to save \nthe Clean Air Act from full congressional review. The EPA knows it is \nin trouble. When our loyal opposition held control of the Congress, the \nEPA would brook no complaints from the States that the EPA's tyrannical \nregulatory measures were unnecessary or ineffective. Instead, the EPA \nmarched forward with an agenda to impinge States' rights, halt economic \ngrowth and force the citizenry to abide by their ideas as to what was \nin the citizenry's collective best interest.\n  We must review the Clean Air Act in it totality. It is based upon bad \nscience, bad procedures, and focuses on the wrong issues. The \ntechnology of emission detection, control, and abatement advances \nexponentially, and any legislation that attempts to protect our \nenvironment\n through invasive command and control techniques favored by anti-\nindustrialist, anti-growth, anti-business forces in the EPA is bound to \nfail. Such a review, however, will not be quick. The Clean Air Act is \nthe longest, most complex piece of legislation ever passed, and took \nyears to develop. It will take time to develop feasible replacements. \nFurthermore, as I have stated on this floor before, environmental \nlegislation such as the Clean Air Act is one of the most notorious \nexamples of an unfunded mandate. We must establish a window in which we \ncan review this act and \n[[Page S2341]] know that our constituents will be safe from egregious \nEPA action.\n  This bill establishes such a window. Upon its enactment, the EPA will \nbe prohibited, for 2 years, from imposing sanctions under sections \n110(m) or 179 of the Clean Air Act, withhold pollution abatement grants \nsection 105, or federalize a State's program under section 110(c). I \nexplained the sanctions and enforcement actions before, but quickly, \nthe section 100(m) and 179 sanctions include the loss of Federal \nhighway funds and two-for-one emission offsets. These moratoria will \napply to actions taken in response to a State's failure to submit or \nimplement a pollution reduction plan in response to marginal or \nmoderate ozone nonattainment. It will also prohibit both the EPA and \nthe Highway Administration from taking similarly adverse action, such \nas withholding Federal highway funds, for failure to implement enhanced \nautomobile inspection and maintenance procedures. The moratoria would \nexist for 2 years from enactment but would not apply to sanctions \nalready applied. While these moratoria are in effect, we will have the \ntime and liberty to analyze closely the Clean Air Act, and secure the \nassurances that our States will not be subject to these outrageous \nsanctions and actions. Last month, a bipartisan group of 33 State \nenvironmental directors, working through the National Association of \nGovernors, called for such a moratorium while the States work with the \nEPA to define a more workable solution. Governor Engler of Michigan has \nfully supported such a moratorium.\n  Although the EPA rectified the problem for my constituents last \nnight, it still remains for other areas, such as in Virginia, Texas, \nand Rhode Island. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the EPA could \nnot just as easily reverse this decision and put my constituents back \nin exactly the same quandary as before. I recommend that my colleagues \njoin with me in preventing such a thing from happening.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 376\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. OZONE NONATTAINMENT AREAS.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the 2-year period beginning on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency shall take no enforcement \n     action with respect to an area designated nonattainment for \n     ozone that is classified as a Marginal Area or Moderate Area \n     under section 181 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7511).\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``enforcement \n     action'' means--\n       (1) the withholding of a grant under section 105 of the \n     Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7405);\n       (2) the promulgation of a Federal implementation plan under \n     section 110(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7410); and\n       (3) the imposition of a sanction under section 110(m) or \n     179 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7410(m), 7509).\n       (c) Applicability.--Subsection (a) does not preclude the \n     continued application of a sanction that was imposed prior to \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 2. ENHANCED VEHICLE INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS.\n\n       During the 2-year period beginning on the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency and the Administrator of the Federal \n     Highway Administration of the Department of Transportation \n     may not take any adverse action, against a State with respect \n     to a failure of an enhanced vehicle inspection and \n     maintenance program under section 182(c)(3) of the Clean Air \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7511a(c)(3)), under--\n       (1) section 176 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7506);\n       (2) chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code;\n       (3) subpart T of part 51, or subpart A of part 93, of title \n     40, Code of Federal Regulations (commonly known as the \n     ``transportation conformity rule''); or\n       (4) part 6, 51, or 93 of title 40, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (commonly known as the ``general conformity \n     rule'').\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 376. A bill to resolve the current labor dispute involving major \nleague baseball, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n\n\n                      baseball strike legislation\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, President Clinton has submitted \nlegislation to Congress to resolve the baseball strike by establishing \na fair and equitable procedure for binding arbitration of the dispute.\n  The legislation would establish a National Baseball Dispute \nResolution Panel composed of three impartial individuals, appointed by \nthe President, with expertise in the resolution of labor-management \ndisputes. The panel would be empowered to take testimony, conduct \nhearings and compel the production of relevant financial information \nfrom all parties. At the conclusion of that process, the panel would \nissue a decision setting forth the terms of an agreement that would be \nbinding on both sides of this dispute.\n  Under the terms of the proposed legislation, the panel would be \nrequired, in making its decision, to take into account a number of \nfactors, including the history of collective bargaining agreements \nbetween the parties, the owners' ability to pay, the impact on \ncommunities that benefit from major league baseball, the unique status \nof major league baseball, and the best interests of the game.\n  President Clinton and his special baseball mediator, William J. \nUsery, deserve great credit for the efforts they have made in recent \nmonths, and especially in recent days, to achieve a satisfactory \nresolution of this long and bitter controversy.\n  Clearly, at this moment in time, Members of Congress are divided \nabout whether legislation is appropriate. A great deal will turn on \ndevelopments in coming days, especially whether baseball fans across \nthe country feel that action by Congress is needed.\n  All of us hope that a way can still be found for the parties to \nresolve this controversy themselves. It is too early to tell whether \nthe events of recent days have given enough new impetus to the parties \nto reach such a resolution.\n  If not, then I believe Congress should act, and I look forward to \nworking with others in the Senate and House to achieve the goal that \nall of us share--to save the 1995 baseball season, to do so in a way \nthat is fair to owners and players alike, and do so in time for opening \nday--on schedule. Red Sox fans want baseball to begin on opening day as \nfans do all around the country. We should do all we can to make sure \nAmerica's pastime goes on as scheduled.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/08/senate-section/article/S2332-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2341-S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 12\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Pell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 12, a bill to amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage savings and investment \nthrough individual retirement accounts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 104\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. Kyl] was added as a cosponsor of S. 104, a bill to establish the \nposition of Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism within the office of the \nSecretary of State.\n\n\n                                 S. 198\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from Florida \n[Mr. Mack] was added as a cosponsor of S. 198, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to permit medicare select policies to \nbe offered in all States, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 241\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 241, a bill to increase \nthe penalties for sexual exploitation of children, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 275\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 275, a bill to \nestablish a temporary moratorium on the Interagency Memorandum of \nAgreement Concerning Wetlands Determinations until enactment of a law \nthat is the successor to the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade \nAct of 1990, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 281\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the names of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Stevens], and the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 281, a bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to \nchange the date for the beginning of the Vietnam \n[[Page S2342]] era for the purpose of veterans benefits from August 5, \n1964, to December 22, 1961.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 18\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hollings, the names of the Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Dodd], and the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] were \nadded as cosponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 18, a joint resolution \nproposing an amendment to the Constitution relative to contributions \nand expenditures intended to affect elections for Federal, State, and \nlocal office.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/08/senate-section/article/S2341-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  REID (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 236\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Conrad, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Ford, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Heflin, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nBaucus, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Hollings, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \nLeahy) proposed an amendment to the joint resolution (H.J.
