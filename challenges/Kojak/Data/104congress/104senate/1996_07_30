HART\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is a pleasure today to introduce to \nmy colleagues the Reverend Charles Hart. Reverend Hart understood \nChrist's words when he told his disciples, ``Where your treasure is, \nthere your heart will be also.'' Charles Hart's treasure has been in \nhis service to God by acting on his faith with the skills that he has \nbeen given and blessed with.\n  Reverend Hart earned his undergraduate degree at Arlington College in \nLong Beach, CA. While Reverend Hart's first love was baseball, finance \nand his faith won out in his life. He began his career with Security \nPacific Bank while at the same time serving as the associate pastor of \nSouth Bay Church of God in Torrance, CA.\n  Reverend Hart's skill in finance led to a successful career in the \nsecular world of banking. While this type of success can bring \nsatisfaction, it did not bring to him the deepest satisfaction that \ncomes from serving God full time. At that point, Reverend Hart decided \nto use his skills as a development officer for a small Christian \nliberal arts college in California. Reverend Hart has continued in his \ncapacity by lending financial expertise to Christian institutions \nthroughout this career.\n  From Azusa Pacific University, he went on to Warner Pacific College \nin Portland where he still serves as a member of the board of trustees. \nHe has also assisted Wycliffe Bible Translators in raising funds to \ntranslate God's word to all nationalities and is currently working with \nthe Associated Churches of God in Oregon and Southwest Washington in \nsecuring expansion funds. Reverend Hart has also worked to share the \ntreasure of his faith with others in the business community through his \n25-year involvement with the Christian Businessmen's Committee.\n  God provides us all with special skills, and Reverend Hart is a prime \nexample that we can use those skills to better ourselves and the world \nin which we live.\n  Again, on behalf of my Senate colleagues, we are privileged that \nReverend Hart is willing to fulfill the duties of Senate Chaplain \ntoday, and I would like to officially welcome him to this Chamber. Also \naccompanying him today is his wife, Sally, and his son, Ken Hart, who \nis my press secretary, and Ken's wife, Sheila.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9085-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum is noted.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What is the \nbusiness before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Currently, there is 20 minutes equally divided \nbetween the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Louisiana. At \n9:50 a.m., we will recognize Senator McCain for remarks concerning his \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just state for Senator Johnston's benefit, we \nhave, as he probably knows, reached an agreement with Senator McCain on \nhis report language. I think he will find that satisfactory.\n  So, when Senator McCain arrives, when his time has expired, we will \ndo this second-degree amendment, and then we will vote, if he desires a \nrollcall vote; if not, we will adopt the amendment.\n  What would be the next order of business after that amendment is \ndisposed of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous-consent order from last night \ntalks about a 10 a.m. vote, with 2 minutes allotted to each side and a \nvote on the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the next amendment after that, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Following that, amendment No. 5095, which is \nanother McCain amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On advanced light water reactor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And there are 2 minutes on each side on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Again, 2 minutes on that, and then we will \nmove to a Bumpers amendment No. 5096.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to yield now--we only have about 6 minutes--\nif the Senator from Louisiana would like to speak to the light water \nreactor amendment or whatever he would like to speak to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5095\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNew Mexico. There is a McCain amendment on cutting the funds, $22 \nmillion for the light water reactor. This is the fifth year of a 5-year \nprogram.\n  There are many reasons to be against the McCain amendment, but the \nclearest, most indelible, most compelling reason is that to cut these \nfunds now would subject the U.S. Government to greater penalties for \ntermination costs than it would be to finish it.\n  Moreover, the U.S. Government would lose, according to Terry Lash, \nwho is the Director of the Department of Energy office in charge of \nthis, the U.S. Government would lose up to $125 million to which they \nwould otherwise be entitled. The reason for that is, the AP-600, which \nis the reactor, which is 90 percent complete would be completed by this \nlast year. When the first of those is sold, the Federal Government is \nentitled to a $25 million recoupment, plus $4 million for every reactor \nsold after that, plus the United States Government is entitled right \nnow to $3 million from GE for reactors already sold under this program \nto Taiwan and others in the pipeline.\n  For the United States to, in effect, break their contract and \nterminate, subjects the Government not only to a greater amount in loss \nbut the loss of future revenues as well.\n\n  Mr. President, the AP-600, which is the Westinghouse reactor, which \nwould be finished under this program, is exactly what all of us in the \nCongress have been saying all this time that we ought to be doing; that \nis, it is a passively safe reactor, it is one generically designed and \nis, I believe, going to be a very hot item, particularly in Asia. The \nChinese have already obligated themselves to 6,000 megawatts of nuclear \npower between now and the year 2000 using Russian technology, Canadian \ntechnology, and French technology, because we do not permit our nuclear \ntechnology to go to China after Tiananmen Square. We expect that that \nnegotiation will take place in the not too far distant future to allow \nAmerican nuclear technologies to get in on that huge market.\n  In the first decade after the year 2000, the Chinese expect to do \nanother 11,000 megawatts, many, many billions of dollars, and they have \na longstanding relationship with Westinghouse, they like the AP-600, \nand we ought to have it finished.\n  So, Mr. President, you can finish it for less money than to terminate \nit, and then you lose all the additional funds you would get.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we will not be so foolish as in a fit of \nantinuclear pique to go out and accept one of these bumper-sticker-type \narguments that this is corporate welfare. The fact of the matter is \nthat the corporations involved here, relying upon the Government, have \nput up almost $500 million to get this program finished, and now it \ntakes another $22 million to finish the program and the Congress is \nsaying, ``Let's not do it.'' If this argument was to have been made and \nthis decision was to have been made, it should have been made back in \n1992 when the Energy Policy Act was up, when the issue was debated and \nwhen the Congress decided to go ahead with the program.\n  To stop it at the 11th hour at greater cost than to complete it is \nnothing short of madness, which is not to say that the Congress has not \ndone that kind of thing before. We have done some exceedingly foolish \nthings in this Senate before, as my colleagues all know. But at least \nwe should not go into this one, which not only would be exceedingly \nfoolish but exceedingly simple and exceedingly easy to understand. It \nought to be easy for anyone to understand that you should not terminate \na program that costs more money to terminate than to continue.\n  Moreover, there would be a huge amount of potential profits to be \nlost and a very, very useful technology.\n  One final note, Mr. President. I note that the United States is now \ngetting serious about global warming, and in the New York Times of July \n17, 1996, there is an article entitled ``In a Shift, the U.S. Will Seek \na Binding Agreement by Nations To Combat Global Warming.''\n  Mr. President, if we are, in fact, serious about global warming--and \nI will submit that to the conscience and intelligence and state of \nknowledge of each Senator as to whether you are or not serious about \nglobal warming--I can tell you that there is one solution that stands \nout above all the rest, and that is nuclear energy, if you really are \nserious about global warming, because how else are you going to \ngenerate large amounts of power?\n  We have a huge amount of money in this bill for renewables. We have \nincreased it. You know, I am for it. But, Mr. President, if you think \nyou are going to solve global warming by something short of major \npowerplants at a time when there is huge growth in the world, \nindustrial growth, I believe, Mr. President, you would be mistaken.\n  All over the Pacific rim where there are these enormous rates of \ngrowth, unparalleled in the history of the world for a region of such \nhuge populations to be growing at such leaps and bounds, there is also \nan air pollution problem of unprecedented severity. That is why the \nChinese and the Indonesians and the Japanese are very serious about a \nbig nuclear program. All of those nations are. And American technology \nshould be able to compete. This technology, which is almost complete,\n\n[[Page S9087]]\n\nabout 90 percent complete, would be America's best way to get into that \nglobal competition.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will vote against the McCain \namendment when it is brought up, the McCain amendment with respect to \nthe advanced light water program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Arizona has the time from \n9:50 to 10 a.m. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5094\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New \nMexico for his agreement on our changes to his amendment. I appreciate \nthat very much. I do want to make it clear, though, that we are talking \nabout a very important issue here; that is, the differentiation between \nreport language and bill language. The report language is sometimes \nignored. I understand that many of our Members are very frustrated from \ntime to time when report language is ignored.\n  The administration does sometimes ignore report language at its own \nperil. We know that if the administration acts in direct contradiction \nto report language that Members will come up with numerous ways to \nforce the administration to do their bidding.\n  The effective language contained in this bill--before the amendment--\nI believe was dangerous for two reasons. First, by giving report \nlanguage the force of law, we essentially passed statutory language \nthat has not been agreed to by both Houses and signed into law. This \nis, on its face, unconstitutional.\n  Mr. President, let me just quote from Justice Scalia where he said:\n\n       As anyone familiar with modern-day drafting of \n     congressional committee reports is well aware, the references \n     to the cases were inserted, at best by a committee staff \n     member on his or her own initiative, and at worst by a \n     committee staff member at the suggestion of a lawyer-\n     lobbyist; and the purpose of those references was not \n     primarily to inform the Members of Congress what the bill \n     meant. . .\n\n  Mr. President, as I have been around here about 10 years, I agree \nwith Justice Scalia. I have seen it time after time. Mr. President, the \nD.C. Circuit Court, in International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, \nLocal Union No. 474 versus NLRB noted:\n\n       . . . [w]hile a committee report may ordinarily be used to \n     interpret unclear language contained in a statute, a \n     committee report cannot serve as an independent statutory \n     source having force of law.\n\n  And in Rubin versus U.S., the eighth circuit court stated:\n\n       A conference report, moreover, is just that--a report, not \n     a legislative act requiring the votes of the requisite number \n     of legislators.\n\n  Second, by codifying report language, which is written by the staffs \nof the 13 full committee chairmen, you have essentially disenfranchised \nevery other Senator of his or her right to amend legislation. Report \nlanguage cannot be amended. I cannot stand on the floor of the Senate \nand try to amend and change report language. The minority party cannot \nchange report language. No one but that chairman that writes it can \ndictate what is in report language.\n  Mr. President, codifying report language is creative budget chicanery \nand an affront to this institution and the Constitution, and it should \nnot be done. If a Member of Congress wants to force the administration \nto take a certain specific action, whether to spend money on a project \nor do something else, then that Senator has the right to offer an \namendment.\n  We all know the rules here. An amendment can be debated, further \namended, filibustered, or tabled. But report language cannot be \ntouched. Therefore, it should not be codified into law.\n  Mr. President, the Office of Management and Budget specifically \nmentioned its opposition to this language in the statement of \nadministration policy. OMB is correct in that this provision should be \nstruck from the bill.\n  I recognize that report language has been codified in the past. It \nwas wrong then, and it is wrong now. We should not do this ever, in my \nview.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the concern of the Senator from New \nMexico concerning the lack of cooperation on the part of the \nadministration to carry out the will of Congress and the will \nespecially expressed in legislation that he has so much expertise and \nknowledge of, and I respect all that.\n  I appreciate the fact that Senator Domenici has modified his \namendment. I also understand why he would want a report on how the \nDepartment is spending those appropriated funds. I would point out in \npassing, although I certainly agree with the amendment, that one of my \ngoals has been to reduce the number of reports that flow over to the \nCongress and are demanded by the Congress of the executive branch.\n  But, in this case, I understand the urgency that the Senator from New \nMexico feels is associated with this language and with the efforts that \nhe has made on behalf of the people of this country and, in the form of \nhis chairmanship, this very proper appropriations subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The leader has asked that I make the following \nunanimous-consent request. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote schedule at 10 a.m. be postponed until 10:15--that is because \nof an emergency that our leader recognizes--with the time before that \nbeing equally divided, if we want to use the time. We can yield it to \nother Senators.\n  I say to Senator McCain, let me thank you for your efforts with \nreference to the report language that essentially was put in this bill \nat my request. I do understand that language that I have in the bill \nthat says:\n\n       Notwithstanding [other provisions of the law,] funds made \n     available by this Act . . . shall be available only for \n     the purposes for which they have been made available by \n     this Act and only in accordance with the recommendations \n     contained in this report.\n\n  We are going to strike that with your amendment, and we are going to \noffer a second-degree amendment that requires regular reports to this \nsubcommittee on how it has complied with this bill.\n  I am going to cite only four or five examples of what I consider \negregious departures from the intent of the bill. I will give you one. \nWe worked very hard on technology transfer, and we got that to a dollar \nnumber of $150 million. It had been higher. The administration wanted \nless. We worked it out. We debated it. The Secretary decided to use \nonly $50 million of it, and to put $100 million somewhere else at her \nchoosing.\n  That is nice. It is just that, for many of us who worked hard on \nthese issues, it is sort of insulting to go through all this work and \nhave it happen. We accepted, after debate, an amendment by Senator \nKerrey with reference to a certain math and science initiative which \nthe Department was requested and in report language required to do it. \nIt was a half million dollars. Totally ignored. The money went \nsomewhere else.\n  The McCain amendment would strike ``and only in accordance with the \nrecommendations contained in this report.''\n  Why is the language necessary?\n  The act provides funds in very large chunks. For example, the act \nprovides $2.749 billion for energy supply, research, and development.\n  Only the report indicates that $247 million should go to solar and \nrenewably energy programs--that is not in the act.\n  Only the report indicates that $389 million is for biological and \nenvironmental research which funds the Human Genome Program--that is \nnot in the act.\n  Without the proposed language, the DOE does not have to follow the \nSenate's guidance.\n  Last year, I worked hard to provide $150 million for technology \ntransfer--but it was only in the report and so DOE provided only $50 \nmillion.\n  Last year, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska included report language that \n$500,000 should go to the Nebraska math and science initiative--DOE did \nnot provide the money--they did not have to, it was just report \nlanguage.\n  Last year, Congress eliminated funding for in-house energy \nmanagement--private sector companies now offer the service for free. \nBut, Congress only eliminated the program in report language so DOE \nprovide $4 million for the program--after Congress thought we had \neliminated it.\n  Financial irregularities abound at the DOE:\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\n  Funds have been reprogrammed from their original purpose to purposes \nspecifically denied by the Congress last year;\n  The Department created a furlough relief fund to augment \nappropriations specifically reduced by Congress;\n  A recent draft inspector general report noted that the Department \ndeliberately ignored a statutory funding limitation on the use of \nrepresentational expenses and spent more than appropriated for \nreceptions.\n  The language is necessary for two reasons:\n  First, it is the only way funding for programs of interest to Members \ncan be assured, and;\n  Second, without it, the Department can ignore congressional intent.\n  Frankly, the Secretary and her administrative assistants understand \nthe concern we have about departures from what is the clear intent. I \nwill just ask those who are for renewable energy, if they know that we \njust put a very large sum of money in, and in report language we \nrecommend the renewables that you just alluded to, I say to Senator \nJohnston.\n  Obviously, if the Secretary wants to, the way they act on other \nthings, they could decide to cut that in half and spend the money \nelsewhere. Now, we go through a lot of effort on those kinds of issues. \nFrankly, I believe we must do something.\n  So you are right. My language went too far. I think language that \ncomes after it saying we want you to report to us, we will set the \nright tone.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5121 To Amendment No. 5094\n\n(Purpose: Second degree amendment to the McCain first degree amendment \n                       regarding report language)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk, to the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to consider the second-\ndegree amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5121 to amendment No. 5094.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n       On line 3 of amendment number 5094, strike ``Act'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following: ``Act. The Department \n     of Energy shall report monthly to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the House and Senate on the Department of \n     Energy's adherence to the recommendations included in the \n     accompanying report.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, if Senator McCain is willing, we \nwill adopt the second-degree amendment by voice vote.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I compliment the Senator from Arizona on this amendment. It \nis the first time that I have been aware of language that, in effect, \nincorporates the committee report language as a part of the bill. The \ncommittee report language cannot be amended, and if we are going to \nstart down this road, we are going to rue the day we began on this \njourney.\n  I hope we will not have a voice vote in this. Have the yeas and nays \nbeen ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nunderlying amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think we ought to have a vote and let that record be \nthere for all to see in the future.\n  Let me ask a question without losing my right to the floor, Mr. \nPresident. Does the distinguished Senator from Arizona know of any \nother bill, appropriations bill, in the recent past or ever in the \npast, that has utilized this approach of incorporating amendment \nlanguage as a part of the bill?\n  I have been unaware of it if this has been done before.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Answering a question like that to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia is like asking a minor league baseball \nplayer to pitch the World Series.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is all corporate knowledge on these \nissues, and I bow to his knowledge. He has been intimately involved in \nthis process for so long. I believe I am correct in responding when I \nsay I know of no other case, except one case that took place sometime \nin the mid-1980's when this particular instance happened, but I have \nnot heard of it before.\n  I ask in return, does the Senator from West Virginia know of any \nplace where this happened?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not know, but that is not to say that \nit has not been done. It may have escaped my attention, but whether or \nnot it has been done heretofore, I think we ought to put a stop to it \nif it has been done. I think it ought to be stopped now.\n  I congratulate the Senator on his amendment. I shall object to \nvitiating the yeas and nays on this amendment if the request is made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment to the McCain amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5121) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5095\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to discuss very briefly the other \namendment that I have pending. I, of course respect the views of the \nSenator from Louisiana. Let me state at the beginning I am a supporter \nof nuclear energy and I believe at some point in our history we may \nturn back to that as a source of power for our energy needs.\n  Continuing the advanced light-water reactor program is a mistake. I \npoint out that this program has already received more than $230 million \nover the past 5 years. This amendment does not create any termination \ncosts of the program. The contract between Westinghouse and the \nDepartment of Energy specifically provides reimbursement for costs \nincurred as a result of termination, ``shall be subject to the \navailability of appropriated funds.''\n  General Electric recently announced it is canceling its simplified \nboiling water reactor after receiving $50 million from the Department \nof Energy under the program because ``extensive evaluations of the \nmarket competitiveness of the 600-megawatt-size advanced light-water \nreactor have not established the commercial viability of these \ndesigns.'' The Westinghouse AP-600 is a similarly designed reactor that \nis scheduled to receive advanced light-water reactor support and is of \na similar size and design and is facing similar market forces that led \nGeneral Electric to cancel that program.\n  These facts are significant because the Government cannot recoup its \ncosts for reactors not sold. The Westinghouse reactor is like the \ncanceled reactor and will likely never be sold, and no costs can be \nrecouped.\n  Last year, there was opposition to end funding for the advanced \nlight-water reactor program by arguing that this year, fiscal year \n1996, would be the fifth year of the 5-year program. Now, a year later, \nthe same argument is being made.\n  The way to end this taxpayer subsidy is by the will of the Congress \nexercised here today. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support \nthe amendment. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 5094, as Amended\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on the first amendment by Senator \nMcCain, as amended by the second-degree amendment, we are working to \ntry to get that adopted.\n  Senator Byrd, let me suggest we are ready to acknowledge openly that \nthe amendment went too far. The intention, I still feel very \ncomfortable with, because I believe the Department truly in egregious \nways violates the intent and spirit by moving money around, but I think \nSenator Byrd has made the case, and Senator McCain has made the case. \nClearly it is not going to happen.\n  I think the Senate knows that we are not going to be doing this, but \nI would like to make sure that what comes out of the Senate is kind of \nbalanced, that the Department does not get the idea that they have all \nthe latitude in the world and will never be called to task. I think \nthis would better be served, overall, if we just proceed to adopt the \namendment by voice vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think the two managers have made a very salient point. I \nhave discussed this matter with them privately and the majority manager \nhas stated the case well. I am willing to yield to their request that \nwe vitiate the yeas and nays but I hope the distinguished Senator from \nArizona will continue his superb surveillance of bill\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\nlanguage in the future so that we will be aware of any future attempt \nto incorporate, in essence, incorporate committee report language into \nthe bill as a law.\n\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas \nand nays be vitiated, and we proceed to the McCain amendment, as \namended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment before the Senate is amendment 5094, as amended with \nthe Domenici amendment. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5094), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5095\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment under consideration now is \namendment numbered 5095.\n  The Chair reminds Senators that by unanimous consent rollcall votes \nwill commence at 10:15. Sponsors of the amendment and their opponents \nhave 2 minutes each with which to comment on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is the understanding of Senator \nMcCain from Arizona and the manager of the bill that Senator McCain has \nan additional 10 minutes reserved on the light water reactor amendment. \nHe has indicated to me he would like to vitiate that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That was before final passage that I ask to vitiate that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, 10 minutes before final passage. He asks that that \nbe vitiated at this point. On his behalf, I ask unanimous consent that \nit be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Has all the \ntime provided been used on the second McCain amendment on the light \nwater reactor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each proponent and opponent are reserved 2 \nminutes each for debate. By previous agreement, votes will not commence \nuntil 10:15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator McCain does not desire any further time at this \npoint, and Senator Johnston needs no more time. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the 2 minutes each be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the second McCain \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 5095.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Frahm] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5096\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. According to the previous agreement, there are \nnow 2 minutes equally divided on the motion to table the Bumpers \namendment No. 5096. The Senate is reminded that the rollcall vote on \nthe motion to table the Bumpers amendment will be reduced to 10 \nminutes.\n  The Senate will be in order. Members who wish to converse, please \nretire to the cloakrooms.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. This amendment deals with an account in this bill called \nweapons activities. This account has $516 million more than it had last \nyear, which is a 14-percent increase--14 percent. Incidentally, it is \n$300 million above the House, $269 million more than the President \nrequested. My amendment simply takes them down to a 7-percent increase.\n  It is the account where you deal with testing. And we have had a \ntesting moratorium for 3 years. Under the START Treaty we are going to \ngo from 24,000 weapons and 25 types to 3,500 and 7 types. We are \nincreasing the budget to do all of that by 14 percent. If they cannot \nget by with a 7-percent increase, they ought to be abandoned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, has a motion been made to table my \namendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The motion has been.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. President, the United States is committed now to a new stockpile \nstewardship program because we no longer will do underground testing. \nThis amendment will take $269 million out of the stockpile stewardship, \nwhich means the building of the scientific capacity to make sure our \nnuclear weapons are adequate and trustworthy, a whole new effort on the \npart of the Department of Energy's DOD activities.\n  Stockpile management is part of that. The maintenance of backup \nfacilities to this stockpile stewardship are in States like Texas, \nMissouri, and INEL in Idaho, and also there is program direction for \nthat entire new program.\n  Frankly, in essence, we get the same increase in defense spending \nthat the other parts of defense get. I think if we want a robust \nnuclear deterrent that is trustworthy and safe, and do not want to \nbuild any new ones, we better not take any risks with this part of the \ndefense budget. And that is why I move to table. I believe we are right \nin our assessments. We want to leave that money in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the question now occurs on agreeing to the \nmotion to lay on the table the amendment No. 5096 offered by the \nSenator from Arkansas, [Mr. Bumpers]. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. Those wishing to table the Bumpers amendment will vote yea. \nThose opposing the tabling of the Bumpers amendment will vote nay. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Frahm] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell] is \nabsent because of a funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nRhode Island [Mr. Pell] would vote ``nay.''\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\n  The result was announced--yeas 61, nays 37, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 250 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--61\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--37\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pryor\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Frahm\n     Pell\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 5096) was agreed \nto.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5106\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask to move now to the Feingold \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Feingold \namendment.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this matter is of great importance to \nthe Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank my friend from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. President, it is said that the great Chief Ten Bears in his later \nlife after being deprived of his freedom by Government troops, was \nasked if the U.S. Government had made his people any promises. His \nanswer was this: ``They made us many promises, more than I can \nremember. And they broke all but one: they promised to take our land \nand they took it.''\n  Mr. President, no matter how you sugarcoat this bitter pill--you can \ncoat it in economic terms, you can coat it in environmental terms, you \ncan coat it in endangered species terms but under all the sugarcoating, \nthe bitter pill of another broken promise remains.\n  I was not here when the Animas La Plata was authorized in 1968. Few \nof my colleagues were, but I knew Wayne Aspinall, the congressman of \nWestern Colorado who had such great vision to include it in the \noriginal authorization, with both the Central Arizona Project and the \nCentral Utah Project--of the three, only the Animas La Plata \nlanguishes. Wayne Aspinall was a man of great vision who helped the \ndesert bloom where only parched land had been.\n  Unlike the Senator from Wisconsin, I was here in 1988 when, after \ncareful negotiations between the two Colorado Indian tribes, the States \nof Colorado and New Mexico, and nine separate Government agencies, we \nreached an agreement to share the scarce water in the San Juan Basin \nbetween Indians and their non-Indian neighbors. The tribes agreed to \ndrop their lawsuit against the Federal Government, which they would \nhave surely won since they have such ironclad priority rights in water \nmatters, in return for a cash settlement and an agreement by this \nGovernment to proceed with a water storage project for both Indian and \nnon-Indians to share. Two public votes were taken of all the people \naffected, and both the repayment contract for the water users and the \ncompromise itself were overwhelmingly accepted by the people of \nsouthwest Colorado and northern New Mexico.\n\n  Still, as in matters such as this, there will always be voices of \nopposition, some saying we went too far and others saying we did not go \nfar enough. We in this body have all experienced that reaction. \nHowever, since the 1988 agreement and subsequent law that I authored \nwhich implemented the agreement, those voices of opposition have made \nup in shrillness what they lack in reason and fairness. Yet, even above \nthe Sierra Club's carping, virtually every elected official from the \nlocal level to the President of the United States supports this \nproject. In fact, President Clinton had $10 million designated in his \nbudget for this project. President Bush supported it, as did President \nReagan before him. All of the Colorado delegation, save one person, \nsupport the project and voted for the necessary appropriations on the \nHouse side. The lone Member who opposed it neither lives in Colorado \nnor cares about abiding by this agreement, even though she voted for it \nin 1988. Our Governor supports it, our attorney general supports it, \nand all of Colorado's major newspapers support it.\n  I ask those who want to strip the appropriation for this project just \nhow is the State of Colorado going to be repaid under the Feingold \namendment, if it prevails, for the $30 million we have spent of \ntaxpayers' money as our part of the agreement? Who is going to repay \nthe almost $60 million of taxpayers' money that the Federal Government \nhas paid both of the tribes to drop the original lawsuit? Who will pay \nthe hundreds of Indian and non-Indian ranchers who risk losing their \nwater rights should the tribes go back to court, win the lawsuit, and \nclaim their rightfully owned water, thereby drying up what some say is \nas much as one-fourth of all non-Indian irrigated farmland in the \nvalley? Who pays for litigation when the Department of the Interior is \nput in the position where the Bureau of Indian Affairs has to defend \nthe Indian tribes against its fellow agency, the Bureau of Reclamation, \nfor nonperformance? The answer is that the taxpayer pays untold \nlitigation fees on both sides.\n  While many colleagues bring charts and graphs to the floor of the \nSenate to emphasize a point--there seems to be a common belief in this \nbody that if you have a graph or chart, or it is written somehow, that \nit automatically becomes true--I bring two objects of great reverence \nto traditional Indian people. These objects are from a culture that did \nnot need protection from one another by a written contract. They \nrepresent a culture that believed your word was your bond, in which \nhonor was held in highest esteem. They represent a culture which never \nbroke a treaty with the U.S. Government. Traditional Indian people \ncommitted nothing to written contract and yet believed that great \nnations, like great men, must honor their agreements. Yet, from the \ntime the first Indian affixed his fingerprint to the first document \nwith the U.S. Government, which he could not read and little \nunderstood, he has learned the hard way that all too often this \nGovernment does not keep its word.\n  This is a pipe, Mr. President. In traditional Indian beliefs, before \nany words of import were spoken, a pipe like this was smoked. The \ntraditional belief is that the smoke would take your words to the \nCreator. One does not lie or break his word to the Creator.\n  This is a fan, a wing from Wanbli, the eagle who was designated by \nthe Creator as the keeper of the Earth to oversee his children and to \nsee that they did the right thing. I submit that the actions of this \nbody, which begins its deliberations each day with prayer, could learn \nat least as much from the objects as they can from all the paper \ndocuments to which this Government subscribes. Why be a party to a \nlegal document if we are going to break it?\n  Just last week, this body reaffirmed its commitment to North Vietnam, \nof all places, to the tune of $1.5 million in order to teach them the \nAmerican system of law. Shall we also teach them\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\nthat under our system of law it is perfectly acceptable to deceive \npeople, to enter into agreements and to unilaterally break our word? \nHow can we teach the Vietnamese a code of conduct based on legal \nagreements if we do not practice that code ourselves? Perhaps we should \ntell them that these principles of law do not apply to American \nIndians. They apply to everyone else, but not to American Indians. It \nis easy to break our word to American Indians--we have done it lots of \ntimes.\n\n  In fact, Mr. President, from 1492 at Columbus' landing until the \n1900's when the new century began, according to the National Congress \nof American Indians, 473 treaties were signed. Of those, 371 were \nratified by this body, the U.S. Senate. Some, as you know, were written \nvirtually at gunpoint and others through clever maneuvering on the part \nof Government negotiators. Yet, as the American Indian lost more and \nmore, as they lost their land, as they lost their water, as they lost \ntheir families and, finally, their freedom, they never broke a single \ntreaty with the U.S. Government. How many has the Government broken \nwith the Indians? I defy anybody in this Chamber to give me that \nnumber. I had to look it up myself. Mr. President, they broke every \nsingle one. They broke every one with the American Indian.\n  I note with interest, Mr. President, there are a number of Indian \npeople sitting in the gallery today as silent witnesses to our \ndeliberations. I have to say that I salute them for their patience. I \nask my colleagues to look into their hearts before voting on this \namendment. Do not just compare statistics and charts and graphs and \nnotes. Ask yourself, do you want to add one more broken promise to this \ninfamous total of broken promises? Do you want to make this vote No. \n474 in broken promises? America is better than this, Mr. President. The \nAmerican people are better than this. Let us keep our promise. Let us \ndo the right thing and table this amendment.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a number of letters of support for this project. They \ninclude a letter from the City of Durango; a letter from the attorney \ngeneral of the State of Colorado; a letter from the Native American \nRights Fund; a letter from the Colorado House of Representatives; a \nletter from the Colorado General Assembly; and a Denver Post article \ndated July 28, 1996.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              City of Durango,\n\n                                       Durango, CO, July 10, 1996.\n       Honorable Members of the House of Representatives: The City \n     Council of the City of Durango, Colorado, urges your support \n     of ongoing funding for the Animas-La Plata Project.\n       The public water supply needs of this community have been \n     put on hold for over a decade in anticipation that \n     Congressional commitments associated with the project would \n     be honored and funding would be authorized in a timely \n     fashion.\n       The Animas-La Plata Project remains as the most economical \n     and efficient means of addressing the future water supply \n     needs of this region. Failure by Congress to provide \n     additional funding for the project at this time may bring \n     about its demise, thereby thrusting the responsibility of \n     developing future water resource needs back into the \n     shoulders of the local governments and Indian Tribes in this \n     region, thus eliminating the economies of scale inherent in \n     the federal project.\n       Accordingly, we ask your positive support in providing \n     continued funding of the Animas-La Plata Project.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lee R. Goddard,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of Colorado,\n\n\n                                            Department of Law,\n\n                                         Denver, CO, July 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Dick Zimmer\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Zimmer: I am writing to you to urge \n     your continued support of the Animas-La Plata Project. We \n     must not simply walk away from the solemn commitments made to \n     the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes in the Colorado \n     Ute Indian Water Rights Final Settlement Agreement and the \n     Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988. The \n     Animas-La Plata Project should go forward because it settles \n     long-standing Tribal water claims.\n       It is important to remember the reasons this project is \n     necessary. In 1976 the United States, on behalf of the \n     Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribes filed an \n     application in Colorado water court for adjudication of their \n     reserved water rights on numerous tributaries covering \n     virtually all of southwestern Colorado. If these rights were \n     confirmed, numerous vested water rights would become junior \n     to the Tribes' water rights. Cities, industry, farmers, \n     ranchers and numerous other water users feared that the \n     Tribes could take water from existing uses and could \n     frustrate future non-tribal development.\n       The underlying agreement took years to negotiate and was \n     based on commitments and compromises made by all parties, \n     Native Americans and non-native Americans alike. A look at \n     the general purposes set out in the settlement agreement \n     confirms the very importance of us meeting our obligations. \n     That agreement finally determined all rights and claims of \n     the Tribes for water, settled existing disputes and removed \n     causes of future controversy among the Tribes, State of \n     Colorado, the U.S. concerning the rights to beneficially use \n     water in southwestern Colorado. It secured for the Tribes an \n     opportunity to generate revenue from the use of reserved \n     water rights obtained under the agreement.\n       Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, if parts of the \n     Animas-La Plata project are not completed by the year 2000, \n     the Tribes have the option to go back to water court and \n     pursue their original claims in the Animas and La Plata river \n     systems. The result could be costly litigation between the \n     U.S., State, and individual water right holders throughout \n     the region. Further uncertainty regarding the practical use \n     and value of many water rights would exist.\n       Congress has recognized its contractual and moral \n     obligations to the parties of the settlement agreement by \n     continuing to fund the project. Congress further recognized \n     the project's importance by requiring the Bureau of \n     Reclamation to construct the project without further delay in \n     legislation passed last year.\n       Critics have stated that the settlement agreement can no \n     longer be met. That, I believe, is a surprise to many of \n     those parties to the agreement. To completely scrap the \n     project by no longer funding it will wreak havoc on economies \n     and water administration in the State of Colorado. The Tribes \n     would most likely be forced to reopen their claims in a long \n     and costly court battle. Certainty, with respect to these \n     reserved rights could not be expected for many more years, \n     perhaps decades.\n       Both the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes strongly \n     support building Animas-La Plata to implement the Settlement \n     Agreement. In fact, the Tribes have filed a civil action \n     against the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. \n     District Court in Denver to compel EPA to fulfill its \n     contractual and statutory duties to the Tribes and refrain \n     from obstructing construction of the project.\n       The economic viability of the project has been criticized. \n     However, as the Bureau points out in its report, the analysis \n     does not take into account the tangible and intangible \n     benefits of resolving the Tribes' reserved rights claims \n     without lengthy, costly litigation that would pit Indian and \n     non-Indian neighbors against each other.\n       The project will comply, as required by law, with the \n     Endangered Species Act and all other applicable environmental \n     statutes. The environmental effects of Animas-La Plata are \n     carefully considered and addressed in the April 1996 Final \n     Supplement to the Final Environmental Statement (FSFES). \n     Extensive mitigation measures are proposed for the project.\n       Some project critics have urged that further studies be \n     done on the Project. Further studies would do nothing more \n     than delay the project beyond the settlement agreement \n     deadline and further escalate costs. Alternatives were \n     considered in the 1980 environmental impact statement, they \n     were considered again during negotiation of the Settlement \n     Agreement, and the Bureau took a fresh and extremely thorough \n     look at them in the FSFES, which took over four years to \n     complete.\n       The Settlement Agreement requires that Animas-La Plata be \n     built without further delay. The State of Colorado has \n     already spent over $11,000,000 to implement the Settlement \n     Agreement, with an additional $48,000,000 set aside in \n     escrow. The United States should likewise honor its \n     commitment to the Tribes and the settlement. I strongly urge \n     you to oppose any attempt to delete appropriations for the \n     Animas-La Plata Project from the 1997 Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations Bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gale A.

Their goal was to share invaluable water \n     resources and provide the Tribes with water\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\n     promised them more than a century ago. Since the settlement \n     became law in 1988, the Tribes and project sponsors have \n     fully cooperated with federal agencies and complied with \n     environmental law.\n       It is now time for the federal government to live up to its \n     moral and legal obligation to the Tribes. Denying funding and \n     forcing negotiation of a new deal is an extreme step which \n     breaches the United States' trust responsibility.\n       Please vote against any amendment which would cut off \n     funding for the Animas-La Plata Project and the Colorado Ute \n     Tribes' Settlement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John E.

But prospects are good that the Senate will keep \n     the project alive.\n       The thinly populated Rocky Mountain states have little \n     clout in the House, where environmental groups waged a \n     concerted assault on the water project. As Colorado Rep. \n     Scott McInnis whose 3rd District would host the project, \n     notes, it's easy for a member of Congress from the East or \n     South to please environmentalists by voting against a water \n     project in Colorado. But the Senate--where the sparsely \n     settled Rocky Mountain states have the same two senators as \n     larger states do--is a much more favorable battleground for \n     the West. And in Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only Native \n     American now serving in Congress, the project has a powerful \n     champion.\n       ``Look for Ben Campbell to come out swinging,'' a project \n     supporter told a Post editor Thursday, the day after the \n     House vote. We didn't have to look for long--Campbell called \n     minutes later to reaffirm his support for the project.\n       ``The Senate Appropriations Committee has already \n     appropriated $9.5 million for Animas-La Plata,'' Campbell \n     said. ``I think it will stay in on the floor and stay in the \n     bill later after we go to conference with the House.\n       ``A lot of those House members who voted against Animas-La \n     Plata weren't here in 1988 when the Indian Settlement Act \n     passed and the project was authorized,'' Campbell said. \n     ``There have been 270 treaties between the U.S. government \n     and the Indians and they have all been broken, without \n     exception. I would hope this is not another broken promise.''\n       We share Campbell's hopes, for selfish as well as moral, \n     reasons. As part of the 1988 settlement, the Southern Ute and \n     Ute Mountain Ute tribes agreed to abide by the ``law of the \n     river,'' a complex set of regulations that includes the \n     Colorado River Compact. But if Congress repudiates its own \n     pledge to convert the abstract Indian water rights into ``wet \n     water'' the tribes can actually use to preserve their \n     lifestyle, the Utes can return to court. In the process, they \n     could rip huge holes in the fabric of state water law and of \n     the Colorado River Compact itself.\n       That is decidedly not what the Utes want. What they want is \n     what they deserve--their water. We trust the Senate will \n     recognize that the Animas-La Plata project is the only \n     practical way to meet a long-standing obligation to a people \n     who have been cheated far too many times.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, an amendment to strike funding for the \nAnimas-LaPlata project is an attempt to further delay a project that \nwas first authorized by Congress in 1968 and is the cornerstone to \nfulfilling the provisions of the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights \nSettlement Act, enacted and signed into law by President Bush in 1988.\n  It seems to be that assumption of many people that ``a feasibility of \nthe project study'' has not been completed, or that ``feasible \nalternatives that may be available to fulfill the water rights of the \nUte tribes'', have not been explored. Frankly, Mr. President, the \nSenator from Wisconsin is mistaken.\n  In an effort to further clarify the record, I would like to share \nwith my colleagues a brief chronology of events that show that all \npossible alternatives have been explored, debated, and even voted on in \nvarious public referendums.\n  In 1968: Congress authorized the Colorado River Basin Project Act.\n  Congress appropriated funds for advance studies.\n  In 1974-1977: the Southwestern Water Conservation District and the \nBureau of Reclamation sponsored a thorough process of public \ninvolvement that compared four major alternatives and dozens of sub-\nalternatives for each of the four major plans. In total, approximately \n100 alternatives were considered.\n  In 1979: The Definite Plan Report, detailing the new configuration of \nRidges Basin and Southern Ute Reservoirs is completed.\n  Endangered Species Act, nonjeopardy opinion on Animas-La Plata \nproject is issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  In 1980: The final environmental statement is completed.\n  In 1986: The Department of the Interior accepts cost-sharing \narrangement that calls for State and local entities to provide 38 \npercent of the upfront funding.\n  Enactment of the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act.\n  In 1987 and in 1990, voters in La Plata County, CO, and in San Juan \nCounty, NM, overwhelmingly endorsed BOR's construction of the ALP \nproject.\n\n  October 6, 1991: Ground breaking ceremony is held in Durango.\n  In 1992, the San Juan River Recovery Implementation Program was \nexecuted with the dual goals of the recovery of the endangered fish in \nthe San Juan River and allowing water development to go forward.\n  And as recently as the last 2 months, again the city of Durango, in a \nvote of confidence for the project, approved a resolution in support of \nthe ALP project.\n  Since 1992, the project has been mired down in litigation by project \nopponents involving a laundry list of environmental related issues.\n\n[[Page S9093]]\n\n  The fact is that the Ute Indian Tribes own the water rights to the \nAnimas La Plata system by virtue of various treaties with the U.S. \nGovernment. These treaty rights have been upheld by the Supreme Court \nof the United States when disputes have arisen in other States.\n  The tribes and the water districts chose negotiation over litigation. \nRather than engage in expensive and divisive legal battles, the tribes \nand the citizens of Colorado and New Mexico chose to pursue a \nnegotiated settlement. The Ute Tribes agreed to share their water with \nall people. The people came together in partnership and cooperation \nwith the Federal Government to reach a mutually beneficial solution: \nthe construction of the Animas La Plata project. Their settlement \nagreement was executed on December 10, 1986. The Settlement Act was \nratified by Congress and signed into law on November 3, 1988.\n  The Settlement Act also approved a cost-sharing agreement. The water \ndistricts and the States of Colorado and New Mexico have put their \nmoney where their mouth is--and have already lived up to the terms of \nthese agreements. Consider that:\n  First, the State of Colorado has committed $30 million to the \nsettlement of the tribes' water rights claims, has expended $6 million \nto construct a domestic pipeline from the Cortez municipal water \ntreatment plant to the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation at Towaoc, \nand has contributed $5 million to the tribal development funds;\n  Second, the U.S. Congress has appropriated and turned over to the Ute \nmountain Ute and Southern Ute Indian Tribes $49.5 million as part of \ntheir tribal development funds, and\n  Third, water user organizations have signed repayment contracts with \nReclamation.\n  The construction of the ALP project is the only missing piece to the \nsuccessful implementation of the settlement agreement and the \nSettlement Act. It is time that the U.S. Government kept its' \ncommitment to the people.\n  Historically, this country has chosen to ignore its obligations to \nour Indian people. Members of the Ute Tribes had been living in a state \nof poverty that can only be described as obscene. Their only source of \ndrinking water was from ditches dug in the ground. I find it most \ndistressing that the same groups and special interests who are now \nscrambling to block this project also, in other contexts, hold \nthemselves out as the only real defenders of minority rights in this \ncountry.\n  This project would provide adequate water reserves to not only the \nUte Nation, but to people in southwestern Colorado, northern New \nMexico, and other downstream users who rely on this water system for a \nvariety of crucial needs which range from endangered species protection \nto safe drinking water in towns and cities--perhaps even filling \nswimming pools for some of our critics.\n  The Southern Ute Indians and the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribes have \nrejected any buy out proposals. They simply want decent and reliable \nwater supplies--using their own water--for their people. In exchange, \nall the people of the area will benefit. The Sierra Club, National \nWildlife, and other opponents are apparently willing to spend even more \nhundreds of millions of tax dollars to buy off the Indians than it \nwould cost to complete the project.\n  Mr. President, on March 1, of last year Secretary Babbitt testified \nbefore the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water \nDevelopment, that the Department of Interior has devoted the resources \nof his agency to carrying out the will of Congress on the ALP project, \nand will continue to do so.\n  He further stated that ``the Benefit/Cost issue has already been \nsettled and decided by the Congress.'' And further that ``it is no \nlonger on the table as far as his [Secretary Babbitt's] experience over \n30 years across the West. And that is not an issue that any court is \ngoing to take up.\n  And more recently, the Director of the Colorado Department of Natural \nResources earlier this year testified before the House Energy and Water \nSubcommittee in support of the Animas-LaPlata project.\n  In conclusion, I would like to include for the record several items \nthat includes a letter from a Mr. Harrick Roth, chairman of the \nColorado Forum, that appeared in the Denver Post.\n  He writes:\n\n       There are no secrets about ALP. There are 25 years of \n     documents produced by the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. \n     Fish and Wildlife Service, the Colorado River Salinity \n     Control Project, the EPA, the New Mexico Interstate River \n     Commission, the Colorado Water Conservation Board and the \n     Colorado Water and Power authority--just to name a few.\n\n  On the question of meeting the needs of the native Americans, he \nwrites:\n\n       To the Editor: You have done it yet again. Treat Indians as \n     our wards, you say. Give them ``taxpayer'' welfare benefits. \n     Your ``howevers'' continue as you argue that it will be \n     cheaper for taxpayers to take any alternative course. Since \n     paleface Americans, like yourselves and myself, have made it \n     historical practice to break treaties with Native American \n     nations and relegate tribes to ``reservations'' of limited \n     geography, your editorial prescribes ``continue the \n     course!!''.\n\n  Just yesterday, July 28, yet another article appeared in the Denver \nPost in support of the ALP project.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is, there has been exhaustive efforts \nto accommodate all parties from an environmental perspective and an \neconomic perspective. The completion of this project will summarily \nfulfill the obligations of the Federal Government to the Ute Indian \nTribes. For these reasons would ask my colleagues to oppose this \namendment that seeks to strike funding for the Animas-LaPlata project.\n  Mr. President, is the time appropriate now to move to table the \nFeingold amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is appropriate.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I, therefore, move to table the Feingold amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion before the body is the motion to \ntable the Feingold amendment No. 5106. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, there will be 2 minutes \nequally divided between the Senators.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I recognize there \nare strong feelings on this project and deep divisions in the region. I \nsay to the junior Senator from Colorado, we must honor our commitment \nto this tribe. The question is how to honor the commitment.\n  This project was first authorized in 1968. As I understand it, it had \nlittle or nothing to do at that time with the issue of water for the \nnative American tribe. Three decades later, it has not been built. \nRealistically, my colleagues, it will never be built. It is not \neconomically or fiscally feasible that we keep spending money on it. \nThere are legitimate Indian needs that should be addressed and have to \nbe addressed. Remember, only one-third of the water concerned here will \ngo to native American tribes; two-thirds goes to others. Yet, there are \nsubstantial questions, in the end, under this project, that the tribes \nin consideration here will be able to obtain the water.\n  This project is dead. Let us return to the drawing board and scale \nthis down so it can meet our commitment without wasting substantial \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  I urge the members to support the amendment and oppose the motion to \ntable.\n  I want to make a few remarks to clarify several points in the \ncommittee report dealing with the Animas-La Plata water project. The \ncommittee report contains a discussion of the status of efforts by the \nBureau of Reclamation to comply with numerous laws applicable to the \nproject. It is my understanding that the committee report simply sets \nforth the views of the committee and is not intended to waive any \nprovision of law or to declare that the Bureau's efforts at compliance \nare sufficient to satisfy any law.\n  I want to make it clear, for the record, that the committee report \ncannot have the effect of circumventing\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\nthe jurisdiction or procedures of any administrative agency with \nrespect to the Animas-La Plata project.\n  It is important to make this clear because the project has been and \nis at present the subject of litigation concerning compliance with \nvarious environmental and reclamation laws. The committee report cannot \nhave the effect of making any factual findings which would usurp the \njurisdiction of the courts or the relevant administrative agencies with \nrespect to whether the Animas-La Plata project is in compliance with \napplicable environmental, financial, and reclamation laws.\n  I expect that the Congress will be revisiting the future of this \nproject, regardless of the outcome this year, and it is important in \nthe meantime that there be no misunderstanding as to the applicability \nof existing laws which constrain further development.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to compliment the distinguished \njunior Senator from Colorado. I believe that was as elegant a speech as \nwe have ever heard. It did not take him very long, but he made the \npoint.\n  Actually, the United States of America has committed to two Indian \ntribes for which this project would proceed. I believe he stated it \nright. People with different ideas and different justifications enter \nthis case, but I believe that the project has been proven technically \nsound. It has continued to receive the full support of those who will \nput it together and finalize it.\n  I think the Senator has put the final touches on it with his argument \nthat we ought to live up to our commitments to the Indian people.\n  I might suggest, although all the water does not go to the Indian \npeople, that there are non-Indian people who have been relying on this \nwater and waiting for it, also. They should not be ignored just because \nsome people want to now change midstream.\n  I hope we support the motion to table and move on to take this to \nconference with the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment by the Senator from Wisconsin. Despite its superficial \nappeal, the effects of his amendment would be devastating not only to \nthe Ute Tribes in Colorado, but also for every other tribe and State \nwho are attempting to resolve disputes over water rights through \nnegotiated settlement rather than endless litigation.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin pretends that his amendment will save \nmoney--he is wrong. Indian litigation is the closest this country has \ncome to the situation Dickens described in Bleak House. There are law \nfirms that probably can no longer even remember who the partner was who \nfirst brought the litigation, but generations have profited--\ngenerations of lawyers both within and without the Government.\n  The Colorado Ute Settlement Act was a remarkable accomplishment, and \nit has served as a model for other settlements in Utah and Arizona. It \nwould be unconscionable to overturn that settlement, especially for the \nspecious arguments put forward by the opponents.\n  Mr. President, even Secretary Babbitt has grudgingly endorsed \ncompletion of the Animas-La Plata project because of the importance of \nfulfilling the Federal obligations under the negotiated settlement. \nRemember, this is Secretary Babbitt--the Secretary who wants to take \ndown a really big Federal dam, the Secretary who has waged an incessant \nwar against farmers, ranchers, miners, and those who work the land to \nproduce the food, fiber, and material to support this Nation. This is \nthe Secretary who repeatedly has decried what he views as an \nindividualistic concept of private property and who has attacked State \njurisdiction over water resources. This is the Secretary who would have \nused the Reclamation Reform Act as a lever for Federal regulation of \nfarm operations and proposed Federal definitions of what constituted \nbeneficial use to override State water law in his proposed lower \nColorado regulations. Even this Secretary, no friend to any farmer, \nIndian or non-Indian, has supported funding the Animas-LaPlata project.\n  Mr. President, the funding in this appropriation measure is not some \nincidental addition from the Congress. This administration requested \n$10 million for the Animas-LaPlata project for work on the Ridges Basin \nDam and Reservoir, and for preconstruction activities, cultural \nresource mitigation, environmental compliance, and endangered species \nstudies. I hesitate to mention that the Fish and Wildlife Service is \nproximately responsible for the situation on the San Juan, and at least \nin this Senator's view, should bear all the costs associated with \nspecies recovery and mitigation. This administration--the same one that \nopposed $5 million to provide potable water to the rural residents at \nFort Peck--this administration supports funding this project. That is \nhow important having the Federal Government fulfill its obligations \nunder the Colorado Ute Settlement Act is.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the amendment by the Senator from Wisconsin \nand urge my colleagues to support the action taken by the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Colorado to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Wisconsin. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the next amendment is the Grams \namendment with reference to ARC.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5105\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair's record shows the next amendment in \norder is McCain amendment No. 5105. Does the Senator from New Mexico \nrequest the Grams amendment be taken up next?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe it is appropriate to withdraw that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 5105) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5100\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Grams amendment. There \nare 2 minutes equally divided. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, thank you very much. This is a very \nmoderate and very straightforward amendment. All it does is simply \nadopt the\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\nfunding of the Appalachian Regional Commission----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senate will be \nin order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I just say to the Senators who are walking out of \nhere, in 2 minutes, we are going to start voting again on this \namendment. So it might be best to stay around.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, again, as I said, this is a very moderate and \nstraightforward amendment. All it does is simply adopt the funding for \nthe Appalachian Regional Commission at the House-passed level of $10 \nmillion less than that approved by the Senate.\n  It requires that the commission provide a specific plan for future \ndownsizing. Like many Federal programs, the ARC was created back in \n1965 as a temporary response--temporary response--to poverty in \nAppalachia.\n  Today, over 30 years later and despite the infusion of more than $7 \nbillion of taxpayer money into the region, we are still pouring money \ninto the area under the pretext of fighting poverty. This program is \none of 62 Federal economic development programs. The ARC is the only \nmajor Government agency targeted toward a specific region of the \ncountry.\n  This program has outlived its original mandate. It is ineffective and \nit is expensive and simply does not work. American taxpayers can no \nlonger afford such extravagant spending. That is why CBO, the Senate, \nthe House budget committees all recommended elimination of the ARC. \nEven President Clinton recommended reducing it by $500 million in \nbudget authority and $300 million in outlays over the next 5 years. \nAlthough I strongly believe the ARC should be terminated, the Grams-\nMcCain amendment does not zero out funding for the ARC, nor does it \nreduce it significantly. It simply reduces the level of funding to that \napproved by the House of $155 million, not the $165 million in the \nSenate budget. It also provides a specific plan for future downsizing. \nI urge my colleagues to support this very moderate amendment. Thank \nyou, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will note that while we have been \nobserving 2 minutes equally divided, there is not an agreement limiting \ndebate on this amendment to that level. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, we strongly oppose the Grams-McCain \namendment and strongly support the Appalachian Regional Commission at \nthis level. Mr. President, this has been an effective program to fight \npoverty in Appalachia. Appalachia is still one of the most expensive \nplaces to build roads, one of the poorest places on the face of the \nUnited States, and one of the most needed functions of Government that \nI can think of.\n  It is an ongoing program that brings roads and access to people in \nthe mountains and hollows and poor areas of West Virginia and other \nStates in Appalachia. We strongly oppose the Grams amendment and \nsupport Senator Domenici's motion to table.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Grams \namendment to further reduce spending for the Appalachian Regional \nCommission. ARC serves parts of 13 States including 39 counties in my \nState, and I'm disappointed to see that may colleague from Minnesota is \nstill not convinced of the importance of this program.\n  The people of eastern Kentucky have much to be proud. That region of \nthe country has a strong tradition of producing some of this country's \nmost gifted musicians, writers, and artists. But, unfortunately, they \nalso produce something none of us are particularly proud of--poverty.\n  Back in 1993, the Washington Post wrote that ``the last time the \nUnited States fought a war on poverty here, poverty won.'' That's \nbecause the forces at work manufacturing this region's double-digit \npoverty figures and all the social disintegration that comes with those \nfigures, are deeply imbedded in a region that was subjected to a \ncentury of economic exploitation and geographic isolation.\n  While poverty claimed victory 30 years ago in the first years of \nPresident Johnson's admirable battle, those of us with a deep-seated \ncommitment to the Appalachian region knew that the task of undoing a \ncentury of destruction would not be quick in coming. ARC was borne of \nthis commitment to see the battle against entrenched poverty through to \nthe end--to the time when poverty would no longer be the norm.\n  And in fact ARC has had a dramatic effect in improving the lives of \nAppalachian citizens, including cutting the region's poverty rate in \nhalf, reducing the infant mortality rate by two-thirds, doubling the \npercentage of high school graduates, slowing the regions out migration, \nand reducing unemployment rates.\n  With 115 of the region's 399 counties still classified as \neconomically distressed, we certainly cannot say we have won the war. \nBut, we can say that we have weakened poverty's hold on this region. * \n* * that we have given the proud people of this region a finger hold in \nthe climb back to self-sufficiency and productivity.\n  My colleagues should be aware that the ARC's fiscal year 1996 \nappropriation represents a cut of almost 40 percent from the fiscal \nyear 1995 funding level, while the bill we're considering today makes \nan additional cut of $5 million for fiscal year 1997. We have already \nhad this debate last year, when my colleague also made an attempt to \ncripple this program and to cripple the Nation's ability to move an \nentire region of the country from poverty to productivity.\n  On August 1 of last year, a very similar amendment offered by the \nSenator from Minnesota was tabled by a vote of 60 to 38. His amendment \nfailed last year for the same reasons it should not prevail today. ARC \nis doing its job--helping communities put in place the building blocks \nof social and economic development to create self-sustaining local \neconomies that can become contributors to the Nation's resources rather \nthan drains on the Nation's resources.\n  It does this by providing the glue money that leverages other \ninvestment from the private sector, other Federal programs, or State \nand local funds. Since 1992, in my State alone ARC has provided over \n$80 million that in turn leveraged more than $115 million in additional \nfunds. These were for a wide range of projects from water and sewage \nsystems to tourism to adult literacy.\n  And as my colleagues pointed out last year, the ARC that is \naccomplishing this mission is lean and efficient. When it comes to \nadministrative and personnel expenses you'd be hard pressed to find an \nagency as efficient. Total overhead accounts for less than 4 percent of \nall expenditures with State Governors contributing 50 percent of those \nadministrative costs.\n  I can assure you, those Governors wouldn't be made that contribution \nin these tight fiscal times if they didn't believe they were getting \ntheir money's worth.\n  But, ARC work is far from done. As the national highway system began \ncris-crossing the country tieing State's together and creating jobs in \nits wake, the mountainous Appalachian region was left behind.\n  Today, ARC's highway project has had a tremendous impact on the \nregion. A 1987 survey showed that between 1980 and 1986, 560,000 jobs \nwere created in the Appalachian counties with a major highway--4 times \nthat of counties without.\n  With only 76 percent of the 3,025 mile Appalachian development \nhighway system constructed or under contract, those figures tell all \ntoo clearly why it's so important to let ARC complete its work.\n  The same is true with ARC's involvement with a wide range of other\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\nprojects from health care to job training to water treatment to small \nbusiness assistance. And, even with ARC funding, Appalachia receives 11 \npercent less in total per capita Federal spending than the national \naverage.\n  And, I hope my colleagues will remember that this debate takes place \njust 1 week after this body made huge changes in the welfare program. \nWe cannot ignore the total impact of changes to the welfare system and \ncrippling cuts in ARC to this region of the country.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in defeating this \namendment and sending a strong signal to the people of Appalachia that \nwe support their tremendous efforts to move their region forward and \nsecure productive and prosperous futures for their children.\n  Also, the Senator from Minnesota said that this duplicated a lot of \nother Federal programs. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nstatement that shows that it does not duplicate other Federal programs \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             ARC Does Not Duplicate Other Federal Programs\n\n       Many distressed Appalachian communities lack the resources \n     to meet the match requirement of other federal programs, \n     making them unable to take advantage of programs from EDA, \n     FmHA, HUD, Education or other agencies. Rather than \n     duplicating these other programs, ARC funds essentially make \n     the programs available to communities that otherwise could \n     not take advantage of them. In that sense our funds are \n     supplemental, not duplicative. This increases federal \n     participation in Appalachian areas, which was a part of the \n     original purpose of ARC. [The administration of these ARC \n     grants then goes through the basic agency whose program we \n     are supplementing.]\n       ARC funds are more flexible than programs from other \n     federal agencies, allowing states and communities to tailor \n     the projects to their individual needs. An ARC project, for \n     example, could include elements of an EDA project, a FmHA \n     project, or a HUD project, while it would not have been fully \n     eligible for funding under any single program at another \n     federal agency.\n       ARC projects originate from the local level and are \n     determined by each state's governor. Unlike most other \n     federal programs, this lets the governors decide which \n     projects will receive federal funding.\n       Up until ISTEA in 1991, the ARC highway program was not on \n     the regular federal highway system. ISTEA added all but \n     roughly 240 miles of ARC highways to the National Highway \n     System. Separate highway funding is important for several \n     reasons. First, for those miles not covered by ISTEA the ARC \n     funding is the only federal source. Second, ARC funding \n     allows the highways to be constructed sooner than they might \n     be if they were funded solely through ISTEA. This is in \n     keeping with the commitment that the nation made to this \n     region almost 30 years ago to break down the isolation that \n     had plagued the region and ink it to national and \n     international commerce. Third, ARC sees highways as elements \n     of an economic development strategy, rather than just a \n     transportation strategy.\n       Even with ARC's special assistance to the region, \n     Appalachia receives 11% less in total per capita federal \n     spending (including grants, contracts, and transfer payments) \n     than the national average.\n\n\n                 why special assistance to appalachia?\n\n       ARC was designed to address the special problems of an \n     entire region that had suffered from over a hundred years of \n     neglect, a region marked by profound problems of persistent \n     and widespread economic distress in a concentrated geographic \n     area that set it apart from the economic mainstream of the \n     nation.\n       The economic problems of Appalachia are long-term, \n     widespread and fundamental. They are not, for example, the \n     result of short-term cyclical changes in the economy (to \n     which programs like EDA are designed to respond). Rather, the \n     region's economic troubles extend back for at least four \n     generations. Few other areas of the country have economic \n     problems that are so deeply ingrained. In addition, ARC's \n     problems reach broadly across state lines, affecting the \n     economies of the 13 states. This is not a case of sporadic \n     distress that affect single counties. Instead, it is the \n     result of region-wide historic patterns of underdevelopment, \n     isolation, exploitation and migration. Only a couple of other \n     areas of the country have such profound economic problems \n     that sweep across state lines the way Appalachia does.\n       The economic challenges faced by communities in Appalachia \n     ultimately dampen the growth of the American economy. They \n     create a drain on the national economy, through lowered \n     productivity and reduced output, diminished economic growth \n     and investment, increased government support through transfer \n     payments, and a lowered standard of living. Half of the \n     counties in the ARC region receive federal transfer payments \n     in excess of the national average on a per capita basis. \n     Until we help these people and communities move into the \n     economic mainstream, they will continue to be a drain on the \n     national resources, diminishing our national wealth. It is, \n     therefore, in the interest of California, or Wisconsin or \n     Florida to help Appalachian communities become economically \n     strong and contributing their fair share to the national \n     wealth.\n       Even with ARC's special assistance, Appalachia receives 11% \n     less in per capita federal spending than the national \n     average. Total per capita federal spending (including grants, \n     contracts, and transfer payments) in Appalachia is $4407, \n     while the national average is $4,917. Rather than giving \n     Appalachia something ``extra,'' ARC just helps the region \n     come closer to getting its fair share of federal resources.\n       From its creation ARC has worked to develop regional \n     solutions to these economic problems that reach across state \n     lines. Much of the Commission's success flows from this \n     regional approach. No other federal program is deliberately \n     designed to address problems on a multistate basis.\n\n\n                        general accomplishments\n\n       ARC's diverse programs have produced tangible results \n     across the region:\n       Water and Sewer Systems. ARC funding brought the first \n     sewer lines and clean drinking water to 700,000 residents of \n     Appalachian counties designated as ``distressed'' due to high \n     rates of poverty and unemployment, and low per capita income. \n     This often corrected severe public health problems. About \n     2,000 new water and/or sewer systems have provided the \n     infrastructure needed for job creation. As a result of these \n     projects, thousands of jobs have been created or retained.\n       Access to Health Care. A network of more than 400 primary \n     health care clinics and hospitals has been completed with ARC \n     funding and now serves some 4 million Appalachians a year. \n     More than 5,000 new physicians have opened practices in \n     Appalachia just since 1980. Infant mortality has dropped from \n     26.5 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 8.3 in \n     1994.\n       Child Care Centers. ARC has supported child development in \n     the Region by helping build child care centers that offer \n     low-income families a full range of educational, health and \n     social services. These services have assisted more than \n     220,000 pre-school-age children and allowed mothers to earn \n     income needed to keep their families above the poverty line.\n       Educational Advancement. ARC has helped construct and/or \n     equip more than 700 vocational and technical education \n     facilities serving more than 500,000 students a year. In \n     1965, only 32% of Appalachians over age 25 had finished high \n     school. Today, that figure has risen to 68.4% Among young \n     adults age 18-24, 77% of Appalachians have completed 12 or \n     more years of school, compared with the national average of \n     76%.\n       Job Skills Training. In the past 10 years, about 60,000 \n     workers who lack a high school diploma or GED have been \n     retrained through basic skills training in the workplace. The \n     skills of more than 30,000 other workers have been upgraded \n     to compete for high-tech jobs or to provide specific skills \n     required by local employers.\n       Affordable Housing. Housing shortages have been alleviated \n     by the rehabilitation and construction of more than 14,000 \n     housing units, especially in areas hampered by the lack of \n     construction sites and construction loans. ARC has pioneered \n     innovative approaches to housing development finance to make \n     home ownership more affordable.\n       Leveraged Investments. A sample of 556 ARC community \n     development projects that were funded between 1983 and 1996 \n     showed that those grants had leveraged over $7.3 billion in \n     private sector investments in the region.\n       Small Business Assistance. ARC grants to revolving loan \n     funds in ten stated totaled $18.7 million, thereby assisting \n     822 small businesses--the source of some 8,000 new jobs in \n     Appalachia. In the past, small businesses could not start and \n     grow due to the lack of capital and conservative lending \n     practices in small towns and rural areas, sources of most new \n     jobs in Appalachia. The ARC loan program has leveraged $328.9 \n     million of small business investment in the region--a ratio \n     of almost 20 to 1.\n       Local Leadership Development. ARC has actively supported \n     the Local Development District (LDD) concept, which was in \n     its infancy in 1965. These 69 multi-county local planning and \n     development agencies foster cooperation in decision-making \n     and leadership development among hundreds of locally-elected \n     officials and private citizens who serve on their boards. \n     LDDs have strengthened the ability of local governments to \n     provide efficient, modern services to their constituents.\n\n\n                     socioeconomic accomplishments\n\n       ARC's investments in the region have yielded impressive \n     measurable improvement in the lives of the people of \n     Appalachia and in the economic condition of the region.\n       The poverty rate in has been cut in half, falling from \n     31.1% in 1960 to 15.2% in 1990.\n       The infant mortality rate has been cut by two-thirds, going \n     from 26.5 (deaths per thousand births) in 1960 to 8.3 in \n     1994.\n       Per capita income has improved dramatically. In 1960, the \n     region's income was 78.1% of the national average. Today it \n     is 83.5% of the national average.\n       The percentage of adults with a high school degree has \n     doubled from 32.8% in 1960 to 68.4% in 1990.\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\n       Among adults age 18-24, the high school graduation rate now \n     equals the national average (78%).\n       Overall employment rates now approximate the national \n     average.\n       New outmigration has slowed, from 12.2% during the 1950s to \n     2.2% in the 1980s.\n       Population in growing. Between 1990 and 1995, the region's \n     population increased 4.6% with all parts of Appalachia \n     showing growth over the five-year period.\n       Thirty-eight counties now have economies which are \n     performing at or near national norms of income, employment, \n     and poverty.\n\n\n                        the task is not yet done\n\n       Despite the significant progress the region has made, many \n     portions of Appalachia still do not participate fully in the \n     strength of the American economy. In a word, Appalachia has \n     become a region of contrasts in the past 30 years. The region \n     has made enormous strides, but because it began so far behind \n     the rest of the nation, there is need for continued special \n     assistance that will make these hundreds of communities and \n     millions of people contributors to, rather than drains on, \n     the national resources.\n       115 of ARC's 399 countries are classified as severely \n     distressed. This means that they suffer from unemployment \n     rates that are at least 150% of the national average, poverty \n     rates that are at least 150% of the national average, and per \n     capita incomes that are no more than \\2/3\\ of the national \n     average. These are areas of persistent and widespread \n     economic distress.\n       The region of contrasts means that while northern and \n     southern Appalachia have done relatively well, central \n     Appalachia is still severely distressed. In all three \n     sections, the non-metro counties lag the nation on almost all \n     socioeconomic measures.\n       The poverty rate for Appalachia is 16% higher than the \n     national average.\n       Appalachia's per capita income is only 83% ($17,406) of the \n     U.S. average ($20,800).\n       Over 20% of the youth in northern and southern rural areas \n     are growing up in poverty, and an even higher 34% of youth in \n     central Appalachia live in poverty.\n       Across the region as a whole, rural Appalachia is poorer \n     than the rest of rural America, and metropolitan Appalachia \n     is poorer than the rest of metropolitan America.\n       The problems are particularly acute in Central Appalachia, \n     where the poverty rate is 27% rural per capita income is \n     still only two-thirds of the national average, and \n     unemployment rates are almost double the national average.\n       The Appalachian Regional Development Highway System, the \n     federal government's commitment to ending the region's \n     isolation, is only 76% complete, with major segments not yet \n     under contract for construction.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that over 60 Members \nvoted for tabling last time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Minnesota that would reduce the Committee \nrecommendation for the Appalachian Regional Commission from $165 \nmillion to $155.3 million. The House and Senate have voted on three \ndifferent occasions against efforts to terminate or reduce funding for \nARC, and I urge the Senate to reject again this attempt to penalize \nAppalachia.\n  The Committee recommendation already reduces ARC by $5 million below \nthe amount requested in the President's Budget. The recommendation of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee is $17 million below the amount \napproved by the Senate last year for ARC. And when compared to prior \nyear funding levels, ARC has already borne more than its fair share of \ndeficit reduction in this appropriations bill. When compared to the \nfiscal year 1995 funding level for ARC, the amount recommended in the \nbill by the Appropriations Committee is down $117 million, or 41 \npercent. Let me repeat--in two years, the funding for this agency has \ndecreased by $117 million.\n  Mr. President, the Committee's recommendation is a responsible one. \nFunding for ARC is already reduced below the President's budget. The \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill is within its 602(b) allocation. \nBecause of the efforts of Senator Domenici, the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee has a higher allocation than the House. As a result, \nadditional funds are allocated throughout the bill to produce a more \nbalanced, reasoned approach to funding for the programs in the bill. \nThe Senate version of the Energy and Water bill provides more funding \nthan the House bill for several programs--not just ARC. For example, \nfunding for flood control along the Mississippi River and its \ntributaries is above the House level, as is funding for the Bureau of \nReclamation construction (which benefits just the 17 States west of the \nMississippi River). The Senate bill provides considerably more funding \nthan the House bill for Atomic Energy Defense Activities. However, it \nis only ARC that is targeted for further reduction.\n\n  I cannot help but wonder if this type of amendment would be proposed \nif the name of this agency were the Rural Development Commission. Is it \nappropriate for the Senate to punish the people who are served by an \nagency's programs by virtue of where they live? I do not believe this \nis the tradition of the Senate. The Senate supports those who are in \nneed--whether it is through quick response with additional funds when \ndisaster occurs, or through assistance to improve the opportunities \navailable to those who are struggling.\n  Mr. President, there are any number of programs in the Government \nthat benefit a limited geographic area of the country. But in making \ndecisions about Federal programs, the Appropriations Committee does not \ntarget spending reductions for programs based solely on geographic \ncriteria. There are any number of programs that continue to receive \nfunding even though they might not benefit all areas equally. In the \nInterior bill, for example, we appropriated over $113 million in fiscal \nyear 1996 for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, even though 67 \npercent of the funds went to just eight States. Similarly, the Oregon \nand California Grant Lands account, which benefits just one State, \ncontinues to receive funding. So it is extremely unfair to suggest that \nthe ARC funding should be reduced simply because of the reference to \nAppalachia in the title.\n  The mission of ARC is straightforward--to provide an effective \nregional development program that will create economic opportunity in \ndistressed areas so that communities are better positioned to \ncontribute to the national economy. Traditionally, there has been a \ngreat disparity in poverty and income levels between Appalachia \nand other parts of the country. And while great strides have been made, \nthere is still much to be done. The programs of the ARC have \ncontributed to improvements in the ability of the region to address the \ndisparity in poverty and income levels between Appalachia and other \nparts of the country. Despite the progress in recent years, there is \nstill much to be done. The income level in Appalachia is only 84 \npercent of the national average. The poverty rate in Appalachia is 16 \npercent above the national average. When it comes to United States \nexpenditures on a per capita basis, even with the ARC funding, \nAppalachia receives 11 percent less in per capita Federal spending than \nthe national average.\n\n  Mr. President, the programs of ARC help communities to develop their \nresources so that they will contribute to the Nation's economy. Many of \nthe communities which benefit from the resources provided to ARC are \nwithout some of the most basic of services, including water and sewer \ninfrastructure, access to health care, and decent roadways. Unless a \ntransportation network is put in place that provides access to and from \nthe rest of the Nation, Appalachia will remain isolated, and thus \nremoved from competing for jobs with other population centers.\n  Some 30 years after establishment of the Appalachian Regional \nCorridor Highways, this network of 3,025 miles of highway is only about \n76 percent complete. At the funding levels recommended in this bill, it \nwill be well into the next century before this highway system is \ncompleted. The amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota will \ndelay further this access to safe and modern highways. The people of \nAppalachia deserve better from the United States Senate.\n  Sadly, there are still children in Appalachia who lack decent \ntransportation routes to school. There are still pregnant women, \nelderly citizens and others who lack adequate, modern road access to \narea hospitals. There are thousands upon thousands of people who find \nit difficult to obtain sustainable, well-paying jobs because of poor \nroad access to major employment centers. The ARC's limited resources \nplay an important role in improving these circumstances. We should not \nreduce our efforts when so much work remains to be done.\n  ARC's programs do not duplicate those of other Federal agencies. The \nhighway funds in ARC are the only source of Federal funding for \nAppalachian miles not covered in the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nAct\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\n[ISTEA]. Because of the poverty in Appalachia, many communities are \nunable to qualify for other Federal programs because they can't meet \nthe matching requirements for local cost-sharing. How are communities \never to improve their circumstances if they are never given a helping \nhand? Because of the situations that exist in some of the small, \nisolated communities of Appalachia, flexibility is critical to \nsuccessful problem solving. Thus, an existing program in one Federal \nagency may not suit the need--but the flexible nature of the ARC \nprogram does help solve problems.\n  The ARC was not set up as a temporary agency. It was set up to deal \nwith long-term, wide-spread fundamental problems in Appalachia. The \nproblems with which ARC deals are not short term in nature. Rather, ARC \ndeals with region wide problems of under development, isolation, and \neconomic disparity. In no other region of the country do such problems \nstretch across such a vast area.\n  Mr. President, we hear a great deal of talk in this body about \nempowering local communities and States to make decisions about what \nworks best for them. The structure of the Appalachian Regional \nCommission does just that. ARC operates from the bottom up--projects \noriginate at the local level, and the Commission is comprised of the \nGovernors of the thirteen States in the region, along with a Federal \nco-chairman. At present, there are eight Republican and five Democratic \nGovernors who serve on the Commission and who have endorsed its \ncontinuation. No policy can be set or any money spent unless the \nFederal representative and a majority of the Governors reach agreement.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to reject this amendment. This agency \nis already funded $117 million below the fiscal year 1995 level, $17 \nmillion below the fiscal year 1996 level approved by the Senate, and $5 \nmillion below the fiscal year 1997 budget request level. Cuts are \nalready being imposed on the ARC. I urge the Senate to stand by its \nearlier votes in support of the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Grams amendment. It would be a mistake to cut funding for \nthe Appalachian Regional Commission, a small and valuable agency that \nhas earned strong, bipartisan support here in Congress and in the 13 \nStates it serves.\n  Some Senators may think this is an amendment that only affects those \nof us representing Appalachian States. I want to explain why everyone \nin this body has reason to reject this amendment and its call for \nanother cut in the ARC.\n  The people of every State have a stake in the economic strength of \nthe rest of the country. When floods ravage the Midwest or the Gulf \nStates; when a major defense installation or space center is located in \na State like Texas or Alabama; when payments are made to farmers for \ncrop support or losses; when California, Colorado, or some other \nWestern State needs water to survive; when Federal research labs are \nplaced in New Mexico or Massachusetts--when any of this support and \nassistance is extended, it is the country's way of investing in each \nregion and in the future of Americans everywhere.\n  The Appalachian Regional Commission is the Federal Government's \nprincipal means of helping one distinct part of the country overcome \nsome very real barriers. Its mission is to act as a Federal partner \nwith the States of the Appalachian region--to overcome barriers from \ngeography to infrastucture to poverty, and to lay the foundation for \neconomic growth and prosperity.\n  The ARC has not exploded in size or scope or funding. Quite the \nopposite. In fact, as the dividends of its work have come through, \nCongress has been able to reduce its budget in the recent years.\n  This agency is a success story, and it is in the national interest to \nkeep its work going to get the job done.\n  In many parts of the region, major progress has been achieved. But \nthe ARC's job is not quite finished, and the agency needs adequate \nfunding to continue its partnership with West Virginia and the \nAppalachian region to finish the foundation we need for more growth, \nmore jobs, and more hope for our people.\n  In the bill before us, ARC's budget is cut by $5 million from last \nyear's level. And more importantly, Senators should know that last \nyear's level was set after ARC was cut by close to 40 percent from its \nfiscal year 1995 funding. The ARC and the States served by this small \nagency are doing their share of sacrifice for deficit reduction. The \nappropriation in this year's bill is fully consistent with the budget \nresolution, which assumed the continuation of the ARC. Its funding \nshould not be further reduced.\n  The Grams amendment would cause real damage to the agency and to the \nparts of the Appalachian region where ARC's resources and expertise are \nstill needed.\n  As a former Governor, and now as a U.S. Senator from West Virginia, I \nknow vividly the value of the ARC and how it improves the lives of many \nhard-working citizens. Whether the funding is used for new water and \nsewer systems, physician recruitment, adult literacy programs, or the \nAppalachian corridor highways, it has made the difference in West \nVirginia, Kentucky, and the other Appalachian States.\n  The highways are the most visible and best known investments made by \nthe ARC for the people of Appalachia. As of today, over two-thirds of \nthe ARC highway system have been completed. But if the ARC is further \ncut, the job of bringing the Appalachian States up to the level of non-\nAppalachian States will be further delayed or never achieved at all.\n  At this very moment, some of these highways are called highways \nhalfway to nowhere, because they are just that--half built, and only \nhalfway to their destination.\n  The job has to be completed, so these highways become highways the \nwhole way to somewhere. And that somewhere is called jobs and \nprosperity that will benefit the rest of the country, too. Appalachia \nsimply wants to be connected to our national grid of highways. Parts of \nthe region weren't lucky enough to come out as flat land, so the job \ntakes longer and costs more. But it is essential in giving the people \nand families in this part of the United States of America a shot--a \nchance to be rewarded for a work ethic and commitment with real \neconomic opportunity and a decent quality of life.\n  I won't speak for my colleagues from other Appalachian States, but \nWest Virginia was not exactly the winner in the original Interstate \nHighway System. And Senators here represent many States that were. As a \nresult, areas of my State have suffered, economically and in human \nterms. Without roads, people are shut off from jobs. That's obvious. \nBut without roads, people also can't get decent health care. Dropping \nout of school is easier sometimes than taking a 2-hour bus ride because \nthe roads aren't there.\n  Long before it was fashionable, ARC used a from-the-bottom-up \napproach to addressing local needs rather than a top-down, one-size-\nfits-all mandate of the type that has become all too familiar to \ncitizens dealing with Federal agencies. It works, too.\n  I urge everyone in this body to keep a promise made to a region that \nhas been short-shrifted. Each region is unique. Solutions have to \ndiffer, depending on our circumstances. When it comes to Appalachia, a \nsmall agency called the Appalachian Regional Commission should finish \nits work. Cutting its budget further will only create more problems and \nmore costs that should be avoided. I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthe Grams amendment, and again, I remind everyone that it is in the \nentire Nation's interest to invest in each region and each State in \nways that deal with their needs and their potential.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to an amendment \noffered by Senator Grams of Minnesota which would drastically reduce \nfunding for the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n  At a time when we are correctly terminating or scaling back outdated \nFederal programs, I believe the Appalachian Regional Commission is the \ntype of Federal initiative we should be encouraging. It is important to \nrecognize that the ARC uses its limited Federal dollars to leverage \nadditional State and local funding. This successful partnership enables \ncommunities in Virginia to have tailored programs which help\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\nthem respond to a variety of grass-roots needs.\n  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, 21 counties rely heavily on the \nassistance they receive from the Appalachian Regional Commission. \nIncome levels for this region of Virginia further indicate that on \naverage my constituents who reside in this region have incomes which \nare $6,000 below the average per capita income for the rest of the \nNation.\n  In 1960, when the ARC was created, the poverty rate in Virginia's \nAppalachian region was 24.4 percent. Since that time the ARC has helped \nslash the region's poverty rate in half. However, we are still a long \nway from achieving the U.S. average poverty level of 13.1 and also the \nregional poverty level of other ARC-member States of 15.2 percent.\n  In addition to the progress made on the region's staggering poverty \nrate, the ARC has made important inroads curbing several other problems \ninherent in Appalachia. Since the inception of the ARC, the infant \nmortality rate in the region has fallen by two thirds. The high school \ngraduation rate has doubled, and unemployment rates have significantly \ndeclined.\n  Even with these substantial improvements, however, the region still \nlags behind the rest of the Nation in all of these categories. Of the \n339 counties within the purview of the ARC, 115 are classified as \neconomically distressed. Meanwhile, the ARC continues with a 40-percent \nreduction from fiscal year 1995, and the pending Senate appropriations \nbill contains a further reduction of $5 billion from fiscal year 1996.\n  With these statistics in mind, I would like to offer some specific \npoints one should keep in mind regarding the effectiveness of ARC \nprograms, its relationship with the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the \ndirect impact that this relationship has on the private sector.\n  In recent years, a significant portion of ARC funds have been \ndedicated to local economic development efforts. Were it not for this \nassistance, the LENOWISCO Planning District and Wise County would not \nhave been able to complete construction of the water and sewage lines \nto provide utility services to the Wise County Industrial Park at \nBlackwood. These lines were financed by a $500,000 grant from the ARC \nand a $600,000 grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration. \nThe construction of these utilities to serve a new industrial park has \nattracted a major wood products manufacturing facility which has \ncreated 175 new jobs for the community.\n\n  The Fifth Planning District serving the Allegheny Highlands of \nVirginia is a prominent example of leveraging other State and local \nfunds and stimulating economic development with partial funding from \nthe ARC. For fiscal year 1995 with $350,000 from the ARC, the Allegheny \nRegional Commerce Center in Clifton Forge, VA was established. This new \nindustrial center already has a commitment from 2 industries bringing \nnew employment opportunities for over 220 persons.\n  The ARC funds for this project has generated an additional $500,000 \nin State funds, $450,000 from the Virginia Department of \nTransportation, $145,000 from Allegheny County, and $168,173 from the \nAllegheny Highlands Economic Development Authority. As a result of a \nlimited Federal commitment, there is almost a 4 to 1 ratio of non-\nFederal dollars compared to Federal funds.\n  In many cases these funds have been the sole source of funding for \nlocal planning efforts for appropriate community development. For \nexample, such funds have been used to prepare and update comprehensive \nplans which are required by Virginia State law to be updated every 5 \nyears in revise zoning, subdivision, and other land use ordinances. In \naddition funds are used to prepare labor force studies or marketing \nplans to guide industrial development sites.\n  Mr. President, the mission of the Appalachian Regional Commission is \nas relevant today as it was when the program was created. This rural \nregion of our Nation remains beset with many geographic obstacles that \nhave kept it isolated from industrial expansion. It is a region that \nhas been attempting to diversify its economy from its dependency on one \nindustry--coal mining--to other stable employment opportunities. It is \na program that provides essential services and stimulates the \ncontributions of State and local funds.\n  I urge the Senate to reject the Grams amendment and supply the \nnecessary funding for this crucial and important program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \nmotion to lay on the table the Grams amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. Those in favor of tabling the Grams amendment will vote \naye. Those opposed to tabling the Grams amendment will vote no. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Frahm] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

I understand Senator Wellstone has a colloquy in lieu \nof an amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Biomass Rural Electricity Projects\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me be quite brief because I know we \nare going to a final vote. One of the more exciting developments for \nrural America are biomass rural electricity projects. I was in Granite \nFalls, MN, yesterday, and the high school auditorium was filled with \ncitizens excited about a project with the alfalfa producers co-op. This \nis biomass rural electricity. This is a value-added, farmer-owned co-\nop. This is rural economic development. This is environmentally sound. \nThis is new products for agriculture. It is renewable energy.\n  The question I ask the managers of the bill is, will these projects \nbe eligible for consideration for funding in fiscal 1997 out of the \nfunds provided? My concern, as the Senator from Minnesota, is that, as \na matter of fact, these kinds of projects, based upon this renewable \nenergy policy, based upon this concern about the environment and rural \neconomic development, will be eligible for funding.\n  So my question, one more time, is whether or not these projects will \nbe eligible for consideration of funding in fiscal 1997 out of the \nfunds provided.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the answer is, yes, these projects for \nbiomass electric will be eligible, and the Department should give full \nconsideration to these projects along with those mentioned in the \ncommittee report. These appear to be promising technologies, and we \nwill urge the department to fully consider them.\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have listened to the colloquy and \nreviewed it before. I agree.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank both the Senator from Louisiana \nand the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5122\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5122.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 22, line 17, following ``$92,629,000'' insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That in addition to any \n     other payments which it is required to make under subchapter \n     III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5, United States \n     Code, the Department of Energy shall remit to the Office of \n     Personnel Management for deposit in the Treasury of the \n     United States to the credit of the Civil Service Retirement \n     and Disability Fund an amount equal to 15 percent of the \n     final basic pay of each employee who is covered under \n     subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5 to whom \n     a voluntary separation incentive has bee paid under this \n     paragraph''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yesterday we accepted an amendment to \nthe bill to provide the Secretary of Energy with buyout authority in \nfiscal year 1997. If buyouts are offered, the Civil Service Retirement \nand Disability Fund would be required to make previously unanticipated \npayments which results in a scoring issue.\n  The technical amendment I offer will resolve the scoring issue by \ndirecting the Secretary of Energy to make appropriate payments to the \nCivil Service Retirement and Disability Fund on behalf of employees who \naccept buyouts.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5122) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n            the advanced computational technology initiative\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to enter into a colloquy with the bill \nmanager, Senator Domenici, and Senator Bennett. The Advanced \nComputational Technology Initiative [ACTI] is an ongoing DOE advanced \nR Program involving joint research efforts by the national labs and \nthe oil and gas industry. The program pairs the unique supercomputing \ncapabilities of DOE's nine multi-purpose National Laboratories with the \ndomestic oil and natural gas industry. These research capabilities that \nwould not otherwise be readily available will enable American industry \nto solve some of the grand challenge problems that exist in exploration \nand production geophysics, engineering, and geoscience.\n  Mr. BENNETT. This program is a collaborative effort that will produce \nsignificant energy security benefits. For example, the program is \nadvancing technology to reduce the costs of acquiring seismic data and \nenhance 3D simulation using advanced visualization and virtual reality \nin reservoir engineering. These advances will bring down development \ncosts in marginal areas thereby increasing net production and reducing \nthe surface impacts of oil drilling. The application of advanced \ntechnologies will enhance oil recovery from current producing areas in \nPrudhoe Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Appalachian Basin.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Federal funding supports the national lab and \nuniversity components, no Federal funds go to the industry. The \nprojects have been selected on a competitive basis to ensure only \nrelevant and widely beneficial research is supported by DOE. Industry \ncontributes over 50 percent on a cost-sharing basis.\n  Mr. BENNETT. In order to adequately fund this program, $9,000,000 \nunder Engineering and Geosciences in Basic Energy Sciences, and \n$5,000,000 in computational technology research in other energy \nresearch programs must be committed to the Department's Advanced \nComputational Technology Initiative.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with my colleagues as to the value of the ACTI \nProgram and support Department funding of the program at this level.\n\n\n                  solar, wind, and renewables account\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with the chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee regarding the amendment that was adopted yesterday \nrestoring funding to the solar, wind, and renewables account. Is it the \nchairman's understanding that $23.072 million has been transferred into \nthe solar and renewables account in this appropriations measure, \nleaving a total of $269.713 million for the solar and renewable energy \naccount.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Is it also your understanding that of this $23.072 \nmillion in the amendment, $16.5 million shall be for an increase in \nwind energy systems of which $2 million shall be for the Kotzebue, \nAlaska project. In addition, the amendment would provide increases of \n$2.0 million for international solar, $1.5 million for solar thermal; \n$1.0 million for resource assessment; $1.072 million for the renewable \nenergy production incentive program; and $1 million for the utility \nclimate challenge program.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct, Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to thank the managers of this bill for \ntheir assistance with this important amendment.\n\n\n                                  Inel\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nCraig, and I, should like to engage the chairman of the Senate Energy \nand Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Domenici, in a colloquy for \npurposes of clarification regarding the status of two INEL projects, \nfunding for which is not specific in the report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, under the Defense Environmental \nRestoration and Waste Management account for the Department of Energy; \nmore specifically within the nuclear material and facility \nstabilization section, it is stated that the ``Committee is aware that \nthe Idaho National Engineering Laboratory has been designated the lead \nlab under DOE's National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program and that the \nDepartment has acknowledged that increased funding will be needed to \ncarry out the additional responsibilities.'' In this regard, Mr. \nPresident, the Committee--Energy and Water Appropriations--\nrecommendation is consistent with the Senate authorizing committee \naction for this activity.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. As the distinguished chairman of the Senate Energy \nand Water Appropriations Subcommittee, the Senator from New Mexico, \nknows, the Senate Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1997, H.R. \n3230, also authorizes funding under the nuclear material and facility \nstabilization provision for spent fuel vulnerabilities associated with \nactivities at INEL's power burst facility. Was it the intent of the \ncommittee recommendation, to be consistent with the Senate authorizing \ncommittee action for the national spent fuel activity, to also include \nfunding for this provision?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. While the two INEL projects under the National Spent \nNuclear Fuel Program were not actually described in report language, it \nwas the intent of the committee to include both activities for funding \nunder this section--nuclear material and facility stabilization.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from New Mexico indulge me in turning to \nanother section of the energy and water appropriations bill, S. 1959; \nspecifically the Waste Management Program under the Defense \nenvironmental restoration and waste management section for further \nclarification?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Certainly.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill also \nprovided authorization for a surety program at the INEL to improve \nwaste minimization efforts in the new stockpile management \nmodernization program. Was it the intent of the committee to also \nprovide funding for this activity within the waste management section, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\nreceived an additional $138.4 million from the President's budget \nrequest?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The DOE Waste Management Program seeks to protect the \npublic and workers by seeking to minimize, treat, store, and dispose of \nradioactive, hazardous, mixed and sanitary waste generated by past and \nongoing operations at DOE facilities, which is consistent with the \nsurety program.\n\n\n                    Indian Energy Resources Program\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Included in this appropriations bill is funding for the \nIndian Energy Resources Grant program, which was originally authorized \nin the Energy Policy Act of 1992. As the Senator from New Mexico knows \nwell, in its short history, this program has been put to good use in \nproviding up to a 50-percent match for funding for sorely needed energy \nprojects in Native communities.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I share the sentiments of the Senator from Alaska \nregarding the importance of the grants provided under the Indian Energy \nResources Program.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate that the Senator's work on this year's bill \nincluded funding for three important renewable energy projects in \nAlaska--two are clean, small hydroelectric projects to partially or \nfully replace 100 percent diesel-generated electricity in rural parts \nof Alaska, which are predominantly Native. Funding for the third \nproject will be for the construction of a transmission intertie to \nbring energy from a recently completed hydroelectric project to several \ncommunities.\n  For rural Alaska, electric power is still expensive and limited in \nsupply. Electricity is produced in rural Native villages by burning \ndiesel fuel that is brought in to the villages during the summer months \nand stored in fuel tanks. For the past two decades the State of Alaska \nhas been able to provide subsidies to rural Alaskans through its Power \nCost Equalization Program. Because the oil fields of Alaska's North \nSlope are now in decline, however, and because development of the known \noil field on the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nis still restricted, the State's continuation of this program is \nuncertain.\n  Rural Alaskans, therefore could be facing an increase in their energy \nbills on the order of 30 cents to more than $1 per kilowatt hour. The \nnational average for electric power is just 7 to 8 cents per kilowatt \nhour. For this reason, development of renewable energy and energy \ntransmission projects in rural Alaska is all the more important.\n  My only disappointment regarding this program is that, with the \nlimited funding we are able to provide this year, several worthy \nprojects, such as the hydroelectric projects proposed for Old Harbor \nand Admiralty Island, Alaska, were not funded. Additionally, the \nauthorization for the Indian Energy Resources Program is only through \nfiscal year 1997.\n  It is my hope that the Department of Energy will give what support it \ncan to Native projects such as the Old Harbor and Admiralty Island \nhydroelectric projects this year. I also fully support the \nreauthorization of this program.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator that we would have hoped to \nprovide funding to all the proposed worthy projects. As this was simply \nnot possible, however, the absence of earmarks should not prohibit the \nDepartment of Energy from providing technical and financial assistance \nwhere possible. This program has been important to Indian projects in \nmy State as well, and I look forward to working with the Senator from \nAlaska in its continuation.\n\n\n                   title xvi water recycling program\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from New Mexico, the distinguished \nchairman of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee for his \nleadership on this bill. I particularly wish to thank the Senator for \nhis personal commitment to the Bureau of Reclamation's title XVI water \nrecycling program. As the Senator knows, I am a strong advocate of this \nprogram. In arid Western States like Utah, water reuse is the next \nlogical step, both economically and environmentally toward guaranteeing \nmore dependable water supplies for our cities and towns.\n  As the Senator knows, I have sponsored legislation to expand the \nexisting title XVI program which I am hopeful will be enacted this \nyear. This legislation includes projects in my own State of Utah as \nwell as projects in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and California. In \nanticipation of the enactment of that legislation, I have asked the \ndistinguished chairman to seek the inclusion of certain language in the \nconference report accompanying this bill at the proper time. This \nlanguage that would instruct the Bureau of Reclamation to make \navailable to other water recycling projects authorized under title XVI \nany funds appropriated by this bill of title XVI projects that the \nBureau may be unable to obligate for whatever reasons when it is \npossible.\n  Would the distinguished chairman agree to seek the inclusion of this \nlanguage in the conference report?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Utah is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for his courtesy in this regard.\n\n\n                 advanced reservoir management program\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to point out to my \ncolleagues the importance of an initiative within the Department of \nEnergy [DOE] that represents the proper partnership role for the \nDepartment and our private sector. I speak of the advanced reservoir \nmanagement [ARM] project that has been funded under the Defense \nActivities, Technology Transfer account within the Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill. This program takes advantage of the unique \ncomputer capabilities of our national lab stockpile stewardship \ninitiative and the common problems facing the independent oil and gas \nproducers of the country. These problems involve complex legacy \ndatabases and require advanced computational challenges that are simply \nbeyond the grasp of most independent oil and gas producers to solve on \ntheir own. This program represents a new model for industry-lab \npartnerships and serves the Nation by enhancing the stockpile \nstewardship mission while contributing to essential new knowledge and \ncapability in our energy sector. In doing so, this partnership \ncontributes to both our national defense and to the Nation's energy \nsecurity. I suggest that this program should continue to be an \nimportant part of the DOE mission.\n\n\n            formerly utilized sites remedial action program\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I wonder if the chairman will yield for a \nmoment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield to my friend from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Thank you, Mr. President. Tonawanda, NY, is home to \nseven sites that are on the Department of Energy's Formerly Utilized \nSites Remedial Action Program [FUSRAP] list. Four of these sites--\nAshland 1, Ashland 2, Seaway Industrial Park and Linde Air Products--\nare collectively known as the Tonawanda Site. The Tonawanda site is a \nlegacy of the Manhattan Project and contains approximately 350,000 \ncubic yards of radioactive waste. For 18 years, the Department of \nEnergy has engaged in study after study and has spent over $20 million \nto determine how to permanently dispose of this waste. There is no \nsupport for Tonawanda's 80,000 residents for siting this waste within \nthe town. For 50 years they have had to endure this waste and the \nblight it has cast upon their town. They are sick of it and they want \nit gone.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I may add, the citizens of Tonawanda, through their \nelected officials, have engaged our offices and have asked Senator \nD'Amato and me to request that the Congress give direction to the \nDepartment of Energy in order to start the process towards removal and \ndisposal of this waste. We both agreed that we would do what we could \nto relieve the town's burden. Now, Mr. President, this is a daunting \ntask requiring many tens of millions of dollars. We do not believe for \na moment that it will be easy. However, we are here today to ask the \nchairman's assistance with the next step.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the Department of Energy has indicated \nthat moving this waste will be expensive, however, we are not aware of \nany fixed price of what it would cost to remove, transport and dispose \nof this waste. We do not know if a business, operating in the open \nmarket, can present a reasonable, competitive bid. We do not know \nbecause no bids have been put forth by the Department that would \ndetermine the private sector's\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\nability to manage this waste. Hence, the waste remains where it is, the \nstudies continue and the citizens of Tonawanda grow frustrated.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Department should at least explore the options \navailable to them. The private sector may be able to present a bid that \nwould speed-up the clean-up of the Tonawanda site in a cost-effective \nmanner. Maybe it cannot. The problem is the Department of Energy is \nreluctant to even find out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate hearing the concerns of my friends from \nNew York. I can understand their wanting to see this site cleaned-up as \nquickly and efficiently as possible. I can also understand the concerns \nof the citizens of Tonawanda--they will only be pleased with the total \nremoval of this 350,000 cubic yards of radioactive waste. Finally, I \ncan understand the funding constraints of the FUSRAP program within the \nDepartment of Energy that can make decisions like these very difficult. \nNevertheless, I believe that the Senators from the State of New York \nhave a right to find out what analyses the Department of Energy \npossesses that indicate that removal, transportation and off-site \nstorage appear unacceptable to the Department.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend from New Mexico for his indulgence.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the chairman, as well.\n\n\n                  Renewable and Conservation Resources\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, if I might have the attention of my \nfriend from New Mexico, the distinguished manager of the pending \nlegislation, I would like to clarify a clerical error which appeared in \nthe Senate committee report on this legislation. The item I seek to \nclarify involves the role of the Bonneville Power Administration in \nadvancing the use of renewable energy resources and promoting energy \nconservation in the Pacific Northwest.\n  The following language was included in the subcommittee report to \naccompany S. 1959:\n\n       Renewable Resource Development.--The Committee understands \n     that the BPA, in keeping with the goals of the 1980 Northwest \n     Power Planning and Conservation Act, is involved in four \n     renewable resource demonstration projects in the region. The \n     Committee supports BPA's efforts to confirm and expand the \n     supply of renewable resources in the Northwest, and expects \n     BPA to complete the two wind and two geothermal projects it \n     has underway. Completing these projects will lay the \n     foundation for building a renewable marketplace in the \n     region, and will benefit both the environment and the local \n     economy. The Committee understands that BPA may spend up to \n     $40,000,000 each year on these projects once they are all in \n     service, and encourages BPA to move forward expeditiously on \n     their completion. The Committee directs BPA to prepare a \n     report on the progress of this program by March 1, 1997.\n\n  Subsequently, during the markup of S. 1959 in the full Appropriations \nCommittee, language on renewable energy was agreed to which was \nintended to replace, not be added to, the above subcommittee report \nlanguage. The language is as follows:\n\n       Renewable and conservation resources.--The Committee \n     continues to strongly support conservation and renewable \n     energy resources. These resources remain the foundation for a \n     sustainable energy future in the Pacific Northwest as the \n     region approaches the new century. The Committee strongly \n     encourages the Bonneville Power Administration, the Northwest \n     Power Planning Council, and other participants in the \n     regional review being conducted by the Governors of the four \n     Northwest States, to explore all innovative measures to \n     assure achievement of pace-setting energy conservation and \n     renewable resource targets in the coming decade. The \n     Committee urges that new mechanisms be defined to assure \n     adequate funding to sustain and substantially expand energy \n     conservation and renewable resources as the electric power \n     industry transitions to a more deregulated energy \n     marketplace. While the Committee recognizes the BPA's need to \n     remain competitive and assure its payments to the U.S. \n     Treasury, BPA should make every effort to fulfill the \n     commitments it has made to renewable energy and energy \n     conservation resources.\n\n  To summarize, the paragraph entitled, ``Renewable and conservation \nresources,'' adopted in the full committee markup, was meant to replace \nthe paragraph entitled, ``Renewable Resource Development'', which was \nadopted in the subcommittee markup.\n  My purpose in speaking on this issue is to clarify this point with \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Domenici. Does the Senator from \nNew Mexico's understanding of committee's intent comport with what I \njust described.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon has accurately \ndescribed the intent of the committee. I thank my friend for clarifying \nthe committee's intent with regard to this clerical error.\n\n\n                       renewable energy programs\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate Energy and \nWater Appropriations bill includes my amendment that increase funding \nfor renewable energy programs. My amendment restore $23 million to \nsolar and wind energy programs, bringing funding to these programs up \nto last year's levels.\n  Mr. President, renewable energy technologies represent our best hopes \nfor reducing air pollution, creating jobs and decreasing our reliance \non imported oil and finite supplies of fossil fuels. These programs \npromise to supply economically competitive and commercially viable \nenergy, while also assisting our Nation in reducing greenhouse gases \nand oil imports. I believe that the Nation should be looking toward \nalternative forms and sources of energy, not taking a step backward by \ncutting funding for these programs.\n  My own State of Delaware has a long tradition in solar energy. In \n1972, the University of Delaware established one of the first \nphotovoltaic laboratories in the Nation. The University has been \ninstrumental in developing solar photovoltaic energy, the same type of \nenergy that powers solar watches and calculators.\n  Delaware has a major solar energy manufacturer, Astro Power, which is \nnow the fastest growing manufacturer of photovoltaic cells in the \nworld. In collaboration with the University of Delaware and Astro \nPower, Delaware's major utility--Delmarva Power & Light--has installed \nan innovative solar energy system that has successfully demonstrated \nthe use of solar power to satisfy peak electrical demand.\n  Through this collaboration, my State has demonstrated that solar \nenergy technology can be an economically competitive and commercially \nviable energy alternative for the utility industry.\n  It is vital that we continue to manufacture these solar cell products \nwith the high performance, high quality, and low costs required to \nsuccessfully compete worldwide. Investment in Department of Energy \nsolar and renewable energy programs has put us on the threshold of \nexplosive growth. Continuation of the present renewable energy programs \nis required to achieve the goal of a healthy photovoltaic industry in \nthe United States.\n  While the solar energy industries might have evolved in some form on \ntheir own, the Federal investment has accelerated the transition from \nthe laboratory bench to commercial markets in a way that has already \naccrued valuable economic benefits to the Nation.\n  The solar energy industries--like Astro Power--have already created \nthousands of jobs and helped to reduce our trade deficit through \nexports of solar energy systems overseas, mostly to developing nations, \nwhere 2 billion people are still without access to electricity.\n  International markets for solar energy systems are virtually \nexploding, due to several key market trends. Most notably, solar energy \nis already one of the lowest cost options available to developing \ncountries that cannot afford to build large, expensive centralized \npower generation facilities with elaborate distribution systems.\n  The governments of Japan, Germany, and Australia are investing \nheavily in aggressive technology and market development in partnership \nwith their own solar energy industries. Until recently, Japan and \nGermany held the lead in world market share for photovoltaics; the \nUnited States has only recently recaptured international market \ndominance. Cutting funding for commercializing these technologies would \nhave a chilling effect on the U.S. industry's ability to compete on an \ninternational scale in these billion-dollar markets of today and \ntomorrow. The employment potential of renewables represents a minimum \nof 15,000 new jobs this decade with nearly 120,000 the next decade.\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\n  It is imperative that this Senate support solar and renewable energy \ntechnologies and be a partner to an energy future that addresses our \neconomic needs in an environmentally acceptable manner. My State has \ndone and will continue to do its part. I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate will look to the future and do their part in securing a safe and \nreliable energy future by supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before final passage of this bill I wanted \nto make a few points.\n  First, I want to thank the managers of the bill. Their job is a \nthankless task and they deserve great credit for moving this important \nmeasure with such speed through the Senate.\n  But, Mr. President, this bill is fundamentally a flawed measure. As \nis the custom in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, we put into \nstatute all of the Army Corps of Engineer projects. This practice is \nvery disconcerting.\n  After carefully examining where such funds are to be spent, one comes \nto the conclusion that the needs of the States represented by members \nof the Appropriations Committee have more weight than the needs of \nother States. It is for this reason that we should end this practice of \nearmarking Army Corps funds.\n  Instead, Mr. President, we should develop a system where the States \nand the Corps work together, develop a priority list based on national \nneeds, and then that list is funded from a lump sum. Such a practice \nwould eliminate the earmaking of this money as it now occurs and \nwould--I believe--prove much more fair.\n  I am also concerned that some of the projects in the bill are fully \nfunded by the Federal Government while others are not.\n  I note that on page 5 of the bill a project in Shreveport, LA is \nfunded ``at full Federal expense.'' I wonder why this is being done.\n  On page 7, we do the same thing with a project in West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, it is these kinds of earmarks that I believe we should \nall be concerned.\n  Additionally, on page 11 of the bill, section 108, we are funding a \nwharf at the Charleston Riverfront Park in West Virginia. Why aren't \nthere similar sections for other parks?\n  Mr. President, it is this constant earmarking that leaves me no \nchoice but to vote against this bill. I would hope that in the future \nwe could develop a better system for spending this money.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1959, the fiscal \nyear 1997 energy and water development appropriations bill.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senate is restoring funding for \nrenewable energy programs. A portion of the restored funds will go to \nsupport a Federal interagency board, The Committee on Renewable Energy \nCommerce and Trade [CORECT]. This program came out of legislation \nauthored by Senator Hatfield and myself in the 97th Congress which \nPresident Reagan signed. The premise of the legislation was simple: \nbuild effectiveness of Government export assistance programs by having \nFederal agencies work together, team together. CORECT has worked well. \nNot only has United States industry identified nearly $2 billion of \npotential in Latin America alone, but global sales for United States \nrenewable energy equipment and services have more than doubled over the \nlast few years.\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor including funding for a particular project--the restoration of \nwetlands on the Williamson River in Oregon.\n  This project is one of the results of an environmental initiative by \nmy colleague, Senator Hatfield, over the past several years.\n  When endangered fish concerns and other environmental problems \nstarted coming to light on the Upper Klamath River in the southern part \nof our state, it was Senator Hatfield who provided funding and \ndirection to all the Federal agencies involved to work together on \nsolutions, instead of standing around blaming each other for the \nproblems. And, it was Senator Hatfield who got them to bring the local \nstakeholders together to work in league with the agencies in \nconsidering those problems and trying to agree on solutions--not in the \ncourts, but sitting down face to face with each other.\n  The people at that table--including the farmers who use water from \nthe Bureau of Reclamation's Klamath project, the Klamath Tribe, hydro \ngenerators, other commercial interests, Oregon Trout, and the Nature \nConservancy--probably won't ever achieve perfect harmony. They each \nhave their own priorities. But working together, they have been able to \nagree on positive steps to take to solve some of the environmental \nproblems in the Upper Klamath Basin--and the Tulana Farms wetlands \nrestoration project at the mouth of the Williamson River is one of \nthose.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service identified this restoration as a key \nelement in restoring two endangered fish species on the river, and the \nNature Conservancy worked with CH2MHill to design the project in such a \nway that it adds flexibility to the use of the hydro and irrigation \nprojects on the river, rather than constraining it.\n  They also designed the project to keep a parcel of the Tulana Farms \nproperty in agricultural production, because of its role as an \nimportant source of seed potatoes for neighboring farmers.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to address the sorts of \nproblems people are facing on the Upper Klamath. But I am proud to say \nthat the Klamath Basin Working Group working with the Klamath Ecosystem \nRestoration Office did not simply pass the responsibility for solving \nthese problems--or the bill--to the Federal Government.\n  They have taken on a substantial part of that responsibility. The \nrestoration work and management of the project will be done by the \nNature Conservancy. PacifiCorp and the New Earth Co., both of which \nhave operations on the Upper Klamath system, are contributing $4 \nmillion of private funding to the project.\n  Complaining about a problem is a whole lot easier than solving it, \nespecially when a solution affects lots of different interests, and \nlots of different people. I want to congratulate the people who have \nworked together to make this project possible, and urge my colleagues \nto support the work they have taken on.\n\n\n         tva competing with private sector on engineering work\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Congress has for many years provided a \nspecific appropriation to fund the Environmental Research Center in \nMuscle Shoal, AL, until last year, when Congress directed TVA to begin \nlooking for ways to finance the Center's operations with funds other \nthan appropriations.\n  The Chairman of TVA's Board, Craven Crowell, acknowledged this past \nMarch in testimony before our subcommittee that TVA had prepared a plan \nto continue operating the Environmental Research Center using outside \nfunding sources. It has recently come to my attention that one of the \nways TVA plans to continue the Center's operation is to compete for \nwork with the private sector.\n  Under the latest effort, TVA has produced and distributed materials \nintended to capitalize on their in-house expertise and resources to \nperform private sector engineering work. These services include: \nconstructed wetland for wastewater treatment; removal of underground \nstorage tanks; site assessment; environmental restoration; groundwater \nmonitoring, and hazardous waste management. In Mississippi alone, there \nare over 78 private firms, many of them small businesses, who already \nprovide these services.\n  TVA's marketing of these activities to the private sector has not \nonly created a competitive challenge because of TVA's reputation and \nresources, but their Government status has created a greater financial \nand marketing disadvantage to hundreds of private, small business \nengineering firms across the seven State Tennessee Valley region who \nare capable and have an excellent track record in performing these \nkinds of activities.\n  I have serious concerns whenever the Federal Government or quasi-\ngovernmental agencies attempt to unfairly compete with the private \nsector. I raise this issue today as we consider the energy and water \nappropriations bill because our friends in the other body have proposed \nto eliminate funding for the Environmental Research Center. The effect \nof their provision will be for TVA to accelerate its efforts to compete \nfor private sector work.\n\n[[Page S9104]]\n\n  I encourage the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee to look \ninto this issue to ensure that TVA is not unfairly competing with \nprivate sector engineering consulting firms.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \nthe budget impact of S. 1959, the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Act, 1997.\n  This bill as reported provides $20.3 billion in budget authority and \n$13.1 billion in new outlays to fund the civil programs of the Army \nCorps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, certain independent \nagencies, and most of the activities of the Department of Energy. When \noutlays from prior year budget authority and other actions are taken \ninto account, this bill provides a total of $19.9 billion in outlays.\n  The subcommittee met its budget authority allocation for defense and \nnondefense. The bill falls below its defense discretionary outlay \nallocation by $305 million and its nondefense discretionary outlay \nallocation by $13 million.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   ENERGY AND WATER SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL  \n               [Fiscal year 1997, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget            \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................  .........      2,863\n    S. 1959, as reported to the Senate............     11,600      8,065\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.......................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal defense discretionary..............     11,600     10,928\n                                                   =====================\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................  .........      3,970\n    S. 1959, as reported to the Senate............      8,708      4,986\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.......................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary...........      8,708      8,956\n                                                   =====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................  .........  .........\n    S. 1959, as reported to the Senate............  .........  .........\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                       \n     Budget.......................................  .........  .........\n      Resolutoin assumptions......................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory..........................  .........  .........\n                                                   =====================\n      Adjusted bill total.........................     20,308     19,884\n                                                   =====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary.........................     11,600     11,233\n    Nondefense discretionary......................      8,708      8,969\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund............  .........  .........\n    Mandatory.....................................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Total allocation............................     20,308     20,202\n                                                   =====================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n    Defense discretionary.........................  .........       -305\n    Nondefense discretionary......................  .........        -13\n    VIolent crime reduction trust fund............

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING UNITED STATES \n                   SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement \n     is set to expire on July 31, 1996;\n       (2) The Governments of the United States and Japan are \n     currently engaged in negotiations over the terms of a new \n     United States-Japan agreement on semiconductors;\n       (3) The President of the United States and the Prime \n     Minister of Japan agreed at the G-7 Summit in June that their \n     two governments should conclude a mutually acceptable outcome \n     of the semiconductor dispute by July 31, 1996, and that there \n     should be a continuing role for the two governments in the \n     new agreement;\n       (4) The current United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade \n     Agreement has put in place both government-to-government and \n     industry-to-industry mechanisms which have played a vital \n     role in allowing cooperation to replace conflict in this \n     important high technology sector such as by providing for \n     joint calculation of foreign market share in Japan, \n     deterrence of dumping, and promotion of industrial \n     cooperation in the design-in of foreign semiconductor \n     devices;\n       (5) Despite the increased foreign share of the Japanese \n     semiconductor market since 1986, a gap still remains between \n     the share United States and other foreign semiconductor \n     makers are able to capture in the world market outside of \n     Japan through their competitiveness and the sales of these \n     suppliers in the Japanese market, and that gap is consistent \n     across the full range of semiconductor products as well as a \n     full range of end-use applications;\n       (6) The competitiveness and health of the United States \n     semiconductor industry is of critical importance to the \n     United States' overall economic well-being as well as the \n     nation's high technology defense capabilities;\n       (7) The economic interests of both the United States and \n     Japan are best served by well-functioning, open markets and \n     deterrence of dumping in all sectors, including \n     semiconductors;\n       (8) The Government of Japan continues to oppose an \n     agreement that (A) ensures continued calculation of foreign \n     market share in Japan according to the formula set forth in \n     the current agreement, and (B) provides for continuation of \n     current measures to deter renewed dumping of semiconductors \n     in the United States and in the third country markets; and\n       (9) The United States Senate on June 19, 1996, unanimously \n     adopted a sense of the Senate resolution that the President \n     should take all necessary and appropriate actions to ensure \n     the continuation of a government-to-government United States-\n     Japan semiconductor trade agreement before the current \n     agreement expires on July 31, 1996.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that if \n     a new United States-Japan Semiconductor Agreement is not \n     concluded by July 31, 1996, that (1) ensures continued \n     calculation of foreign market share in Japan according to the \n     formula set forth in the current agreement, and (2) provides \n     for continuation of current measures to deter renewed dumping \n     of semiconductors in the United States and in third country \n     markets, the President shall--\n       (A) Direct the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative and the Department of Commerce to establish a \n     system to provide for unilateral United States Government \n     calculation and publication of the foreign share of the \n     Japanese semiconductor market, according to the formula set \n     forth in the current agreement;\n       (B) Report to the Congress on a quarterly basis regarding \n     the progress, or lack thereof, in increasing foreign market \n     access to the Japanese semiconductor market; and\n       (C) Take all necessary and appropriate actions to ensure \n     that all United States trade laws with respect to foreign \n     market access and injurious dumping are expeditiously and \n     vigorously enforced with respect to U.S.-Japan semiconductor \n     trade, as appropriate.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act, 1997''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe bill was passed, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. 1959, \nthe fiscal year 1997 energy and water development appropriations bill, \nbe indefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its \namendments, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The motion was agreed to; and the Presiding Officer (Mr. Ashcroft) \nappointed Mr. Domenici, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Gorton, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Burns, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nHollings, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kerrey and Mrs. Murray conferees on the part of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the combined staff--the \nRepublican staff and the Democratic staff--for the marvelous job they \ndid. I, most of all, thank all the Senators for being as cooperative as \nthey were. This is a bill that is not singular in purpose but has an \nawful lot of facets to it. We were able in 2 days to complete it, and \nthat is because we got great cooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9085-5", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5119\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand that there is a pending \namendment before the Senate, which is the Chafee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The pending amendment \nis the amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand the amendment has been cleared \nby both sides of the aisle, including the authorizing committee chair \nand ranking member. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFord and Senator Frist be added as cosponsors to the Chafee amendment \nand that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5119) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Murray was good enough to \nfile on my behalf an amendment dealing with a recently adopted rule on \nthe acceptable uses of the Senate Internet Services. I have some very \nserious concerns about this new rule, concerns that many of my \ncolleagues in the Senate share.\n  Senator Ford and Senator Warner have worked closely with me on this \nissue and I think we have reached a compromise which is very reasonable \nand accommodating for both the Rules Committee and the Senators who \nwould be affected by the new Internet policy. I would like to thank \nthem for agreeing to take another look at this policy. As a result of \nthat compromise, I have withdrawn my amendment and am looking forward \nto working with the members of the Rules Committee and other Senators \nwho are interested in the Senate Internet policy over the next 2 \nmonths. During that time, implementation of the rule dealing with \npromotional or commercial links on Senate home pages will be delayed.\n  I do want to take a moment to inform other Senators who may not have \nhad a chance to read the new Senate Internet policy, about the issue my \namendment addressed. On July 22, 1996, the Senate Committee on Rules \nand Administration adopted a policy for the use of the U.S. Senate \nInternet Services. Among other things, the rule states that ``The use \nof Senate Internet Services for personal, promotional, commercial, or \npartisan political campaign purposes is prohibited.''\n  Now most of those restrictions I would agree are appropriate and \nprudent. But I am concerned about the ambiguity of the terms \n``promotional'' and ``commercial''. My amendment would have clarified \nthat language by allowing a ``home state exemption''--similar to the \none that is included under the gift rule to allow gifts of home State \nproducts. Under my amendment, Senators would have been allowed to link \nto sites, businesses, and organizations in their home State as long as \nthose links are accompanied by a disclaimer stating that the link is \nnot an endorsement of the products, locations, or services they \nfeature.\n  Like many Senators I have links on my Web page to places and \norganizations in my home State. My home page is a virtual office for \npeople who may not be able to get to my offices in Montpelier or \nBurlington. Without the links to Vermont sites it would be a pretty \nuninviting place--no native Vermont art on the walls, no calendar of \nevents, and no directory of places to go and things to see while you \nare in the area. That's not the kind of hospitality I like to show \npeople who have taken the time to visit my office.\n  Under the July 22 rule, I will probably have to eliminate most of the \nhome state links on my Senate Web page or defend my decision to keep \nthose links before the Senate Ethics Committee. However I won't be \nalone--over half of my colleagues in the Senate have similar links on \ntheir Web pages to tourist spots, businesses or event listings in their \nhome States, including most of the members of the Rules Committee \nitself. Mr. President, I do not believe that is what the committee \nintended. I do not believe that most Members are aware of this rule and \nthe affect that it will have on the individuality of their home pages.\n  The Internet is a new milestone in communication which the Senate \nshould be using to the advantage of all States. But it is also a \nrapidly changing field, and I understand completely the difficulty that \nSenator Ford, Senator Warner and the other members of the Rules \nCommittee have had in setting down a policy for Senate use of the \nInternet. The World Wide Web is uncharted territory when it comes to \ndrawing the line between what is an appropriate use of Senate resources \nand what is not. But by opening up this dialog between all interested \nSenators, we can will go a long way toward finding that balance.\n  This will certainly not be the last time that the Senate grapples \nwith the problem of fitting advances in telecommunications technology \nto a government body that pre-dates the pony express. However, I hope \nthat the process we are establishing now of open communication between \nSenators who are deeply interested in this emerging technology and the \nRules Committee, will continue as we travel down this road.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I ask what the current business of the \nSenate is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is to be recognized for up to 20 minutes, followed \nimmediately by a vote on passage of the bill.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I noted the absence of a quorum and thought \nperhaps there was a timeframe open here for me to introduce a bill; \nhowever, I see the Senator from West Virginia is here and prepared to \ngo ahead.\n  Under the previous order, I am happy to abide by that and will do \nthis at another time.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time did the Senator need to introduce his bill?\n  Mr. COATS. There is no rush on this. I think we should stick with \nwhat was agreed upon.\n  Mr. BYRD. I probably have more time under the order than I will use.\n  Mr. COATS. I just want to introduce legislation. I can probably do it \nin 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the Senator 2 minutes, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat he may speak as in morning business and introduce a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Coats pertaining to the introduction of S. 2000 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3754, the Fiscal \nYear 1997 Legislative Appropriations Bill. This is the second year, I \nbelieve, that the distinguished Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] has \nchaired the Legislative subcommittee and it is also the second year \nthat the equally distinguished Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] \nhas served as the ranking member of the subcommittee. Both Senators are \nto be commended for the efforts that they have made to ensure that the \nlegislative branch of Government does its share in contributing toward \ndeficit reduction.\n  As has been stated, the pending measure contains funding levels that \nare below the previous year's budget by a little over $22 million, or \naround 1 percent. Further, the proposed fiscal year 1997 funding level, \nin total, is $13 million less than what the legislative branch had 6 \nyears ago in fiscal year 1991. So when we consider the cost increases \nthat have occurred over this 6\n\n[[Page S9117]]\n\nyear period, the legislative branch has taken a significant reduction \nin funding.\n  I note that the largest reduction contained in the bill is to the \nbudget of the General Accounting Office, for which a reduction of $44 \nmillion is recommended, as well as a personnel ceiling of 3,500 \npositions. That reduction fulfills a commitment made by the GAO to \nreduce its budget by 25 percent over a 2-year period. But for that 44 \nmillion-dollar reduction, the pending measure would, in fact, show an \nincrease above fiscal year 1996.\n  Overall, I believe that this bill recognizes the fact that we have \nreached the bottom of the barrel as far as further reductions in the \nlegislative branch budget. A large portion of the legislative branch \nbudget is for personnel whose purpose is to assist Members of the House \nand Senate in carrying out their responsibilities. It is my strongly \nheld belief that we must be very careful in the future to avoid any \nfurther arbitrary reductions in the legislative branch. We have reached \nthe point, by making such dramatic reductions in staff throughout the \nlegislative branch, that it is affecting the ability of Members to \nadequately address issues of national importance which arise in \nCongress every day and to adequately serve the people who send us here. \nIn fact, let me take this opportunity to congratulate a very \ncommendable group of individuals. Who are they? The United States \nSenate staff.\n  Senators like to think of themselves as akin to stars in the heavens, \ngiving off light, and giving off heat, energy and brilliance--separate \nand distinct suns in orbits all of our own, as it were, creating their \nvery own blinding illumination. In truth our lights would be very dim \nindeed without the dedicated hard work and unbelievable loyalty of \nthose who labor so long on our behalf and on behalf of our \nconstituents.\n  The people who open our mail, who read our mail and who answer much \nof our mail, the people who answer our telephones, and take a great \ndeal of guff in the process on many occasions, the people who research \nour issues, the people who prepare our press releases, the people who \nwork on the Nation's problems, as well as on the problems of our \nrespective States, the people on the committees who craft legislative \nlanguage. I doubt that there is a Senator here--there may be one--who \npersonally writes his own bills, the bills that he introduces. The \npeople who intercede on behalf of our constituents when we cannot do so \nourselves, the people who toil on the Senate floor, the people who \nnegotiate far into the night, I am talking about our committee staffs \nin particular here, negotiate far into the night to reconcile \nintractable differences with Members of the other body sometimes, long \nafter Senators have gone home and gone to bed. All of these individuals \nunselfishly give countless hours and energies in order to serve \nSenators and to benefit their country.\n\n  Some of those staff members may have certain advantages, this is \ntrue. But these are very special people, and they are special people \nwho are mostly unsung and very often unappreciated. Daily, they combine \ndemanding, stressful, and difficult careers with equally demanding \nprivate lives. When they leave home in the morning, they often have no \nidea what time they may return to their loved ones at night. Many of \nus, Senators, are here in that same boat. We do not know what time we \nare going to get to go home at night. But certainly those employees do \nnot for the most part. Still they manage to rear children and cook and \nclean and carry out the hundreds of other chores which must be \nperformed in their personal lives weekly, despite impossible hours.\n  Every Senator in this body, each and every Member on both sides of \nthe aisle, is deeply in their debt, as are our constituents and the \nNation as a whole.\n  So we are supposed to pay them well, and in many instances, or most \ninstances, I think we do pay them well. But not always, by any means.\n  That is why I am particularly concerned that this year those same \ncapable, hard-working, largely uncomplaining individuals have been \nsingled out, not for praise, but, at least indirectly, for scorn. It is \nmy understanding that, for the first time in the years in which there \nhave been cost-of-living adjustments, the staff of the U.S. Senate are \nalone--alone--among all Federal employees in this land in their failure \nto receive the COLA. Staffers of the House of Representatives have been \nauthorized to receive their COLAS, the entire rest of the Federal work \nforce has already received a cost-of-living adjustment, including the \nemployees who staff the Federal judiciary.\n  I often wonder. It strikes me as strange that Senators, many \nSenators, in thinking of reducing personnel and of not increasing \nsalaries of the staff or of Members themselves, do not dare touch the \njudiciary. They do not want to touch the judiciary.\n  So staffers of the Federal judiciary have received the cost-of-living \nadjustment. I do not regret that. I am not complaining about that. But \nonly Senate staffers have been singled out for this special kind of \nstrange and unfair treatment. I cannot fathom any substantive reason \nfor such gross unfairness. I cannot understand why such a situation has \nbeen allowed to develop. I am sure it is not intended to be punitive, \nbut in a way it is punitive. When our staffs in the Senate look across \nat the other end of the Capitol and see the staffs of the House, when \nthey look across the street and see the staffs of the judiciary, and \nwhen they look down Pennsylvania Avenue and see the staffs of the \nexecutive branch who received their COLA's, how could our staffs, how \ncould our committee staffs, help but wonder, why is this? Why the \ndifference? Why the discrimination?\n  Unlike most of the Federal work force that normally receives any \napproved cost-of-living adjustment automatically, Senate staffers may \nonly receive such COLA if their respective Senator approves the \nincrease for each member of his or her staff. Senators do not have to \ngive the COLA to anyone on their staffs or anyone on their committee \nstaffs who is under their jurisdiction if they do not wish to. But, \nthis year even the option for Senators to do so has been effectively \ntaken away from Members.\n\n  I would like to at least have the option. I would at least like to be \nable to pass the COLA's on to the lower paid members of my staff. I \nwould like to make that judgment based on each staff person's merits. \nBut that option I do not have. No other Senator has that option this \nyear.\n  Do I hear deficit cutting given as a reason for such disparity? If we \nwanted to make a serious reduction in the deficit through this means, \nwe could prohibit the cost-of-living adjustment for anyone and everyone \nin the Federal Government in the first place, including the judicial \nbranch. No. Serious deficit reduction is not the issue here. Some sort \nof misguided symbolism can be the only reason for such an unwarranted \nslap in the face for our own loyal employees in the Senate on our \npersonal staffs and on committee staffs.\n  In my opinion, this is a very poor way to thank the hundreds of \npeople who toil to make Senators the celestial heavenly bodies that we \nsometimes believe we are. It is pretty shabby treatment, if you ask me.\n  In a city that is as expensive to live in and work in as is \nWashington, DC, how can any Senator be comfortable knowing that we are \ntreating the very people who help us to serve our constituents in such \na fashion?\n  I thank the managers of the bill. They have included moneys so that \nthe COLA's can be passed on for the coming year. I hope that the \nleadership will authorize that this be done.\n  I think the extreme matter should be rectified immediately for this \nyear and should not be repeated in 1997. Why? Because common decency \nand fairness demand it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Funds provided in this Act for bonuses and cash \n     awards for employees of the Department of Transportation \n     shall be reduced by $513,604 which limits fiscal year 1997 \n     obligation authority to no more than $25,448,300: Provided, \n     That this provision shall be applied to funds for Senior \n     Executive Service bonuses, merit pay, and other bonuses and \n     cash awards.\n       Sec. 344. Hereinafter, the National Passenger Railroad \n     Corporation shall be exempted from any State or local law \n     relating to the payment or delivery of abandoned or unclaimed \n     personal property to any government authority, including any \n     provision for the enforcement thereof, with respect to \n     passenger rail tickets for which no refund has been or may be \n     claimed, and such law shall not apply to funds held by Amtrak \n     as a result of the purchase of tickets after April 30, 1972 \n     for which no refund has been claimed.\n       Sec. 345.

Voluntary Separation Incentives for Employees.--\n       (a) Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     in order to avoid or minimize the need for involuntary \n     separations due to a reduction in force, reorganization, \n     transfer of function, or other similar action, the Secretary \n     of Transportation may pay, or authorize the payment of, \n     voluntary separation incentive payments to employees of the \n     United States Coast Guard, Research and Special Programs \n     Administration, St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, \n     Office of the Secretary, Federal Railroad Administration, and \n     employees of the Department in positions targeted for \n     reduction under the National Performance Review who separate \n     from Federal service voluntarily through September 30, 2000 \n     (whether by retirement or resignation).\n\n[[Page S9126]]\n\n       (b) Agency strategic plan.--The Secretary shall submit, for \n     review and approval, a strategic plan to the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget prior to obligating any \n     resources for voluntary separation incentive payments allowed \n     under this Act.\n       (1) The plan shall--\n       (A) include the number and amounts of voluntary separation \n     incentive payments to be offered;\n       (B) specify how the voluntary separation incentives will \n     achieve downsizing goals;\n       (C) include a proposed time period for the payment of such \n     incentives; and\n       (D) include the positions and functions to be reduced or \n     eliminated identified by organizational unit, geographic \n     location or occupational category and grade level.\n       (2) A voluntary separation incentive payment under this \n     section may be paid to any eligible employee only to the \n     extent necessary to eliminate the positions and functions \n     identified by the strategic plan.\n       (c) Conditions and amount of payments.--In order to receive \n     a voluntary separation incentive payment, an employee must \n     separate from service with the Department (whether by \n     retirement or resignation) within the applicable period of \n     time specified in the agency plan. An employee's agreement to \n     separate with an incentive payment is binding upon the \n     employee and the Department, unless the employee and the \n     Department mutually agree otherwise.\n       (1) A voluntary separation incentive payment shall be paid \n     in a lump sum after the employee's separation and be equal to \n     the lesser of--\n       (A) an amount equal to the amount the employee would have \n     been entitled to receive under section 5595(c) of title 5, \n     United States Code (without adjustment for any previous \n     payment made under such section), if the employee were \n     entitled to payment under such section; or\n       (B) if the employee separates during--\n\n       (i) fiscal year 1997, $25,000;\n       (ii) fiscal year 1998, $20,000;\n       (iii) fiscal year 1999, $15,000;\n       (iv) fiscal year 2000, $10,000;\n\n       (3) not be a basis for payment, and shall not be included \n     in the computation of any other type of benefit;\n       (4) not be taken into account in determining the amount of \n     any severance pay to which the employee may be entitled under \n     section 5595 of title 5, United States Code, based on any \n     other separation;\n       (5) be available from appropriations or funds available for \n     the payment of the basic pay of the employee.\n       (d) Effect of subsequent employment with the government.--\n     An employee who has received a voluntary separation incentive \n     payment under this section and accepts employment with, or \n     enters into a personal services contract with, any Federal \n     agency or instrumentality of the United States within 5 years \n     after the date of the separation on which the payment is \n     based shall be required to repay the entire amount of the \n     incentive payment to the Department.\n       (1) The repayment required under this subsection may be \n     waived only by the Secretary.\n       (e) Additional agency contributions to the retirement \n     fund.--\n       (1) In general.--In addition to any other payments which it \n     is required to make under subchapter III of chapter 83 or \n     chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, the Department \n     shall remit to the Office of Personnel Management for deposit \n     in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the \n     Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount equal \n     to 15 percent of the final basic pay of each employee of the \n     Department covered by chapters 83 or 84 of title 5, United \n     States Code, to whom a voluntary separation incentive payment \n     has been made.\n       (2) Definition.--For the purpose of this section, the term \n     ``final basic pay,'' with respect to an employee, means the \n     total amount of basic pay which would be payable for a year \n     of service by such employee, computed using the employee's \n     final rate of basic pay, and, if last serving on other than a \n     full-time basis, with appropriate adjustment therefor.\n       (f) Voluntary release program.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the Department shall implement regulations \n     that shall permit its employees, who are not scheduled for \n     separation by RIF, to volunteer for RIF separation in place \n     of other employees who are scheduled for RIF separation until \n     September 30, 2000.\n       (g) Continuance of government share of health benefits \n     coverage.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Department shall pay the Government share of the health \n     benefits coverage of any of its employees separated by RIF \n     for up to 18 months following the employee's separation from \n     Federal service, provided that the employee pays his \n     requisite share of such costs over the same 18 month period.\n\n               TITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS HIGHWAY PROVISIONS\n\n       [Sec. 401.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to present \nthe fiscal 1997 appropriations bill dealing with the Department of \nTransportation and related agencies. The subcommittee allocation was \n$11.95 billion in budget authority and $35.453 billion in outlays. This \nallocation is $240 million lower in budget authority than the House's \nallocation when they passed the bill on June 28.\n\n[[Page S9127]]\n\n  In spite of this limitation, I am proud of this bill because it \naddresses a number of concerns of not only the administration and my \ncolleagues but also the American people. I should point out, however, \nthat the bill is right at its allocation for both budget authority and \noutlays. So any amendments that increased spending would have to be \noffset with the necessary cuts to other parts of the bill.\n  This bill provides funding above that requested by the administration \nand above that provided by the House in two areas of critical \nimportance: Safety and infrastructure development.\n  In the safety area, this bill provides the Federal Aviation \nAdministration funding for 250 additional air traffic controllers.\n  In the FAA's regulation and certification area, the bill provides for \nmore than 250 additional staff, including airworthiness inspectors, \nairline operations inspectors, certification inspectors of engineers \nand pilots, and manufacturing inspectors. However, in light of and in \nresponse to the ValuJet crash, there is also funding for an additional \n130 hazardous materials inspectors in the aviation area. These \ninspectors were not originally requested by the administration, nor \nwere they funded in the House appropriations bill. And the bill also \nprovides 20 new inspectors for the Research and Special Programs \nAdministration, the lead agency within the Department of Transportation \nregarding hazardous materials.\n  Global air transportation of hazardous materials has been growing at \na steady rate of approximately 7 percent per year. The majority of \nthese goods--60 percent--are transported on passenger-carrying \nequipment. And, according to the FAA, the reported incidence in air \ntransportation associated with this type of cargo has increased 122 \npercent since 1991.\n  Although the FAA with its given resources monitors the compliance of \nsuch carriers to the extent possible, it is estimated that almost 80 \npercent of the problems associated with this type of cargo originates \nwith shippers. I believe that the traveling public needs an acceptable \nlevel of safety that can be achieved, not only with air carrier \ninspections but also with targeted inspections of freight forwarders, \nrepair stations, and commercial shippers.\n  Therefore, this bill has funding of approximately $12 million above \nthe administration's request to address these safety problems. I \nbelieve that this is important to point out in light of the TWA Flight \n800 tragedy.\n  This bill fully funds the administration's request for operational \nsecurity of $71.9 million which funds approximately 780 security \npersonnel. This is a 6.6 percent increase over what was provided in \nfiscal year 1996.\n  The bill also provides the full amount requested at research funding \nfor explosives and weapons detection. That is $27.3 million.\n\n  In addition to increasing a number of positions in the aviation \ncontrol, regulation, safety, and security areas, the bill provides an \nairport improvement program grant funding level of $1.46 billion, $160 \nmillion above the House's level, and $110 million above the \nadministration's level.\n  I want to emphasize again, Mr. President, that this bill is still \nunder the House allocation.\n  In the Coast Guard area, the subcommittee has provided funding for \nvery critical maintenance activities, and is $14.3 million above the \nHouse level. The House cut was appealed directly to me by the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard who felt that a continued level was \nnecessary in maintenance in the aircraft and boat area, which severely \nhamper the operational effectiveness of the Coast Guard in 1997.\n  I should also point out that the committee has not rescinded previous \nyears' funds for the vessel traffic service systems, known as the VTS, \nand has provided the requested $6 million for these VTS systems in \n1997. However, there is report language directing the Coast Guard to \ntone down their ambitious plans and to develop a common platform and \ncommon architecture for a vessel traffic system before proceeding in \nthe future.\n  In the highway area, the committee rejected the administration's \nrequest that would have made some previously exempt highway programs \npart of the overall obligation ceiling, and would have rescinded $300 \nmillion of previously authorized ISTEA highway projects. Despite the \nbudget constraints, there is an increase of $100 million over the House \nlevel for the Federal aid highway program of $17.6 billion. And there \nis $250 million for the State Infrastructure Bank Program, which was \nnot funded in the House bill.\n  In the rail area, the committee has increased funding for the House \nbill by providing $200 million as requested for the Northeast Corridor \nImprovement Program, and provides $130 million above the House mark for \nthe Amtrak Capital Program. We have also fully funded, as has the \nHouse, the $80 million requested for high-speed transits. In the \ntransit area, we are slightly less than $100 million above the House in \nthe formula grants program, and are $235 million above the House in the \ndiscretionary grants program. These funds are for rail modernization \nprojects, transit new starts, and bus and bus related projects.\n  So you can see, despite having a lower 602(b) allocation in budget \nauthority than the House, we have provided significant funding \nincreases for areas that I feel very strongly about; namely, \ninfrastructure improvement and safety related activities.\n  I believe that summarizes the bill. This year we received 770 \nseparate requests from Senators, totaling $16.3 billion in earmarks and \nspecific requests. It is difficult to balance these varied and \nsometimes conflicting needs, but I think this bill does a good job \nperforming that balancing act while providing needed funds for safety \nimprovement and infrastructure investments.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my colleague and former \nchairman of the subcommittee, a man who has been very supportive and \nhelpful in crafting this bipartisan bill that we bring to the floor \ntoday, Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Hatfield, for his ever \nconstructive work and comments. This may be the last bill on \ntransportation that Senator Hatfield will manage. Long after his \nactions as a Senator, as a leader in the Senate, and as someone whom we \nall admire and respect, I hope we will continue our friendship and \ncontact, but I will say a little bit more about that in a couple \nmoments, if I may.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Senate amendments to \nH.R. 3675, the transportation appropriations bill for fiscal 1997. The \nbill, as we know, was reported unanimously by the Appropriations \nCommittee on Thursday, July 18. It would be my hope we could get a \nsimilarly unanimous vote for Senate passage of the bill.\n  Given the overall funding limitations that we face in this year's \nappropriations process, I think the bill before us does an excellent \njob in distributing scarce resources among the Nation's critical \ntransportation needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this moment that Michael \nBrennan, a legislative fellow from the Department of Transportation who \nworks with us, be granted privileges of the floor during the Senate \nconsideration of H.R. 3675 and the conference report that will \naccompany this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this transportation bill comes before \nthe Senate and before the Congress at a very sensitive moment in our \ndiscussions and deliberations here. The image of TWA Flight 800 is \nfresh in our mind. We all now grieve with those who lost loved ones, \nhorrified at the shock that families, in some cases, lost two or three \nmembers of the family. One man lost his wife and two children. We can \nhardly comprehend the pain and the anguish that must go with something \nlike that.\n  What an odd coincidence that at the moment we are considering how \nmuch money we spend on transportation, including safety in the air and \nsafety in other modes of transportation, we face a time when, again, we \nwish that we could have done more, if it was possible, to prevent \nsomething like that.\n  I think it is important as we consider what the investment is going \nto be in transportation infrastructure in our society we not lose sight \nof what took\n\n[[Page S9128]]\n\nplace on that fateful day when TWA 800 went down. But we also cannot \neasily forget the ValuJet crash, the problem with the Delta Air Lines \nairplane as it was taking off and the mother and child were killed even \nthough the airplane never got into the air; the engine disintegrated \nand tore into the fuselage.\n  We, unfortunately, can recall an accident in New Jersey and an \naccident in Maryland on the rails when Amtrak, in the Maryland \ninstance, and, in New Jersey, the New Jersey Transit Co. lost people as \na result of a crash. We are all too familiar with what happens on our \nhighways each day in each State; that when we invest in transportation, \nit is not simply another way to spend money; that it has a real life-\nand-death effect on the way people move between work and home or \nrecreation and home or shopping and home; and that when we look at what \nhappens with our air quality--and everybody is concerned about what we \nleave to future generations--we try to improve it the best way we can. \nAnd the significant way to do that is through effective investments in \ntransportation.\n  For the knowledge of the body--and I think everyone is aware of it, \nbut I remind you even though it may be redundant--the United States, \namong the most advanced nations in the world, spends the least as a \npercentage of GDP on transportation infrastructure. When we look at the \nper capita spending in the United States on transportation \ninfrastructure spending, we are the equivalent of some of the more \nprimitive or more backward nations of the world, those on the African \nContinent, poor, poverty-stricken nations. I hope this year we \nrecognize this is one area in which we cannot afford to skimp.\n  This is an excellent bill considering the appropriations we had to \nwork with. It is a much more balanced approach than the House-passed \nbill. The bill does an excellent job of addressing to the maximum \ndegree possible--and I emphasize the maximum degree possible--the \npriorities of all Members as well as the priorities of the \nadministration. It is a testament to Chairman Hatfield's cooperative \neffort that there is not even a hint of a veto overshadowing this bill. \nThe administration has seen that the chairman has worked almost magic \nin terms of getting the appropriate balance with resources still too \nlittle, in my view.\n  For the Federal Aviation Administration, the bill includes additional \nfunds requested by the administration to address the specific problems \nassociated with the transportation of hazardous materials. These \nmaterials have been implicated as the possible cause of the recent \ntragic ValuJet crash.\n  Moreover, as we await answers to the many questions surrounding the \ntragedy on TWA flight 800, I think it is important to point out that \nthe bill before us fully funds the administration's requested increase \nfor civil aviation security.\n  For the Coast Guard, the bill comes close to fully funding the \nCommandant's request for operations and acquisition. The Coast Guard \nhas implemented its own well-designed streamlining plan to reduce \ncosts, and I am pleased that they will not be required to endure \nfurther reductions as part of this bill.\n  We depend on the Coast Guard to be ever ready and at their post in \nthe event of all kinds of national contingencies, whether it is for \nemergency response to marine accidents and oilspills, search and \nrescue, national security, or, as we have seen most recently, the \ncollection of evidence and debris from the TWA tragedy.\n  We depend on the Coast Guard to be ready to serve on a moment's \nnotice. I was in East Moriches, Long Island, a week ago Saturday \nshortly after the crash occurred, and I couldn't have been more proud \nof the Coast Guard, who was there as quickly as possible. I flew with \nthe helicopter pilot who was the first Coast Guard pilot on the scene. \nHe said when the sea was still burning, it looked like an inferno. And \nI saw the loyalty, despite the terrible stress, and the commitment of \neach of them, their having counseling and review of their own emotions, \nbecause in each case, they see themselves and they see their own \nfamilies.\n  The Coast Guard is a fantastic branch of service, Mr. President. \nAgain, I do not want to leave out the NTSB and the FBI and the Navy and \nthe others who are working so diligently to try to provide the answers \nthat we hope will come soon. But a branch of service like the Coast \nGuard often does not get the credit that it deserves as we give them \never-more assignments. As one coastal State Senator, I assure you that \nthey have served us well over last year, over the many years in the \npast.\n  Within the Federal Highway Administration, the Appropriations \nCommittee has been able to find sufficient resources to allow full \nfunding for prior-year highway projects. The bill before us provides an \noverall increase in the obligation ceiling for highway formula funds.\n  Within the Federal Transit Administration, the bill before us \nachieves a new high in the funding of transit discretionary capital \ngrants, and while the bill freezes operations assistance at the fiscal \n1996 level, it provides an increase for transit formula capital \nassistance.\n  I am especially pleased with the committee's recommendations for the \nFederal Railroad Administration. The House-passed bill singled out \nAmtrak for some truly destructive funding cuts. The bill before us \ntakes a much more balanced approach, and it provides full funding for \nthe President's request for the Northeast Corridor Improvement Program \nand the special one-time appropriations for new high-speed train \nassists.\n  The bill also provides an increase for Amtrak's capital account, \npermitting them to invest in capital equipment, in trackage, in signs, \nin electrification. The only way Amtrak can hope to become self-\nsufficient is if it has adequate funds to invest in its deteriorating \ncapital plant. The bill before us makes a sizable investment toward \nthat goal.\n  While there are some questions raised about Amtrak and its service in \nthe highly populated Northeast Corridor, I remind our colleagues that \nwere it not for Amtrak, and if we want to provide the same level of \ntransportation facility to those who travel between Boston, New York, \nand Washington, we need something like 10,000 DC-9's a year to pick up \nthat slack. Imagine, 10,000 extra airplane flights a year over our \nskies with all the noise and all the congestion and everything else.\n  So, once again, the funds that we are investing are funds that have a \nsignificant effect on the quality of life of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, it is with some pain that I must make note of the \nfact--and I have made note of the fact--that this will be the last \nappropriations bill that Senator Hatfield will manage in his capacity \nas subcommittee chairman. In many ways, I hope it is the last and hope \nthat it will get to the President and get signed and we don't have to \ndo this one over again. We shouldn't have to. But as always, his \nopenness and fair mindedness has brought an ability to get things \nthrough the maze and bring it to this point and we hope soon to the \nPresident's desk.\n\n  In his 2 years as chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, \nSenator Hatfield has certainly distinguished himself as an informed and \nwise policymaker in the transportation arena. I have always admired his \nleadership, and I will always treasure his friendship. Mr. President, \nit is obvious there is only one person I would rather see as chairman \nof that subcommittee than Senator Hatfield. I will not go any further. \nJust a joke.\n  Once again, I commend this bill to all my colleagues, and I hope that \nthey will work with us to support the passage of the bill and that it \ndoes not become a forum for other discussions. It is late in the year; \nit is late in the week. We will soon be departing this place for other \nactivities back home, and it would be too bad if this bill became a \nforum for debate that is unrelated particularly to transportation \nmatters.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3675, the \ntransportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997. I have been a \nmember of the Subcommittee on Transportation for many years, and was \nonce chairman of the subcommittee. I have long been an advocate for \nincreased and sustained funding for our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure.\n\n[[Page S9129]]\n\n  The transportation appropriations bill is the preeminent contributor \nto our Nation's annual investment in infrastructure. Our Nation's \neconomic prosperity depends heavily on the adequacy of our highways, \nour airports, our railroads, and our transit systems. As such, this is \na critically important bill for the overall economic health of the \nNation.\n  This bill also finances our entire Federal effort in the area of \ntransportation safety, including the safety and security of our \naviation and rail systems. The recent explosion on TWA Flight 800, \nwhich has been alluded to here already, and the associated loss of \nlife, serve as a cruel reminder of the critical safety mission executed \nby our Department of Transportation.\n  I congratulate Senator Hatfield, the Transportation Subcommittee \nchairman, and I congratulate the ranking member of the Transportation \nSubcommittee, Senator Lautenberg, for their expeditious action, their \nskillful and dedicated work on this bill.\n  Given the overall limitations we face for this year's appropriations \nbills, I believe that this bill represents a fair and balanced approach \nto the transportation needs of cities and communities throughout the \nNation.\n  And I am particularly pleased that the committee rejected what I \nbelieve to be an ill-considered proposal by the administration that \nwould have placed a cap on previously funded obligations for highway \nprojects. Indeed, the bill before us provides an overall increase in \nthe Federal aid highway obligation ceiling which provides critically \nneeded highway funding for all 50 States.\n  So I commend Chairman Hatfield and Senator Lautenberg for presenting \nto the Senate a bill that is free of controversial authorizing \nlegislation. On balance, although I would support substantially more \nfunding for the Nation's infrastructure than we are able to provide in \nthis bill, I believe that H.R. 3675 deserves the support of all \nSenators.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I congratulate the efforts of the \nsubcommittee staff--Pat McCann, Anne Miano, and Joyce Rose for the \nmajority, and Peter Rogoff and Carole Geagley for the minority--for \ntheir outstanding work on this very important measure.\n  This is the last time that Senator Hatfield will manage this \ntransportation bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  I thank him for his long and illustrious service to the Senate, to \nhis State, and to the Nation. I thank him for his steadfast friendship \nover the years. I thank him for his bipartisanship, his true \nbipartisanship, that he has demonstrated not only on this bill but on \nmany other bills and which has been a hallmark of his service in this \nbody. He has tremendous courage. As far as I am concerned, he is one of \nthose few men and women in the history of the Senate who is truly a \nprofile in courage.\n  I thank both the chairman and the ranking member again, as I say, for \ntheir services to the Senate and to the people of this country and to \nthe country itself.\n  Emerson must have had men like these in mind when he said:\n\n     Not gold, but only men can make a nation great and strong;\n     Men who for truth and honor's sake stand fast and labor long;\n     Real men who work while others sleep,\n     Who dare while others fly.\n     They build a nation's pillars deep\n     And lift them to the sky.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague and ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, Senator Lautenberg, for his kind personal \nremarks. It has been a great pleasure and honor to work with Senator \nLautenberg in this role. I am grateful to him for his many suggestions \nand recommendations.\n  I think, I say to Senator Lautenberg, if you and I were to really put \nthe focus on the hard work and the effort and the accomplishment of \nthis subcommittee, we would have to really look to our staff--your \nstaff, Peter Rogoff, and my staff, Pat McCann and Anne Miano--who \nworked so well, beautifully together, meshing our common interests, \ncrafting a bill that we are able to stand here and defend before the \nSenate.\n  I say, of Senator Byrd's very generous and kind remarks, that he has \nbeen a mentor. I should be thanking him for those remarks because I am \nsure that, like many, if not most of the Senate who have watched and \nlistened to Senator Byrd over the years, we have learned a great deal \nnot only about the Senate's history, but about the way legislation \nproceeds and the cooperation, collaboration that must be achieved on \nboth sides of the aisle to pass legislation. I am very grateful for his \nmost generous remarks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments \nbe considered and agreed to en bloc and that they be considered as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendment and that no points \nof order be waived thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to, en bloc.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 5123 Through 5125, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I have three technical amendments that I \noffer on behalf of the committee. They have been cleared on both sides, \ncorrecting the spelling, other such technical matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5123 through 5125) were agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I believe the parliamentary situation is \nthe bill is open for further amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Perhaps there are none, and we could go to third \nreading. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5126\n\n (Purpose: To fully fund the President's request for Aviation Security \n                               Research)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes \n     amendment numbered 5126.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, line 17, strike ``132,500,000'' and insert \n     ``132,499,000''.\n       On page 14, line 22, strike ``187,000,000'' and insert \n     ``188,490,000''.\n       On page 38, line 5, strike ``200,000,000'' and insert \n     ``198,510,000''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this fully funds the President's \nrequest for aviation security research. It is offset in budget \nauthority as well as outlays.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. It is cleared on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5126) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment \nwas adopted.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want the Record to be clear that \nthis is ``human factors research for security.'' That is the title \nunder which this legislation is proposed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, would the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes. I would be happy to yield for a question from the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I understand the committee has included $6 \nmillion in the transportation appropriations bill for the development \nof vessel traffic service systems or VTS systems by the Coast Guard. I \nwanted to briefly ask the chairman whether it is the intent of the \ncommittee's report language that the Coast Guard undertake a review of \nthis system, including the costs associated with implementing the \nprogram, before proceeding with their plans to install these systems in \nvarious ports around the country, including Mobile, AL.\n  The GAO report that the committee refers to in its report identified \nserious underestimations of the cost of the VTS 2000 program. I \ncontinue to have serious reservations about this system and the Coast \nGuard's current plan for its implementation and use. It would appear \nthat the GAO has raised many important issues that need to be resolved \nbefore the Coast Guard proceeds in the implementation of this program. \nIt is the intent of the committee that such a review take place by the \nCoast Guard before it proceeds with the VTS program?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes. The report language directs the Coast Guard to \ntone down their ambitious plans, and to develop a common platform and \ncommon architecture for vessel traffic systems before proceeding in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I appreciate the chairman's assurances on this matter.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am concerned that the committee report \ndoes not contain bus and bus facility funds for the Regional \nTransportation Commission of Clark County, NV. The RTC's CAT System has \nwitnessed phenomenal growth and has seen an annual increase of \nridership of over 36\n\n[[Page S9131]]\n\npercent. Its service hours and service miles per bus is more than \ndouble that of any other transit system in the United States.\n  The RTC has requested $5 million to complete its integrated bus \nmaintenance facilities project to properly maintain and store its \nequipment fleet, and $5 million for new rolling stock to initiate \nexpress bus commuter service. Past transportation appropriations bills \nhave provided funding for this project, recognizing its need and \nsignificance.\n  While I appreciate the many demands on the Senate for bus \ndiscretionary funds, I urge the chairman to give full consideration to \nthe needs of Clark County, NV for this important funding.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada is correct that \nthe RTC of Clark County is certainly a worthy candidate for \ndiscretionary bus and bus facility funds. In fiscal year 1996, nearly \n$17 million was provided for the project. I look forward to working \nwith the Senator to make every effort to assist in advancing its \nproject.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee for his efforts during the \nappropriation process. I appreciate the fact that the Senate \ntransportation appropriation report includes $30 million for bus and \nbus-related facilities in the State of Ohio. I would, however, like to \nmake sure that this $30 million will be made available to the Ohio \nDepartment of Transportation to be used for bus and bus-related \nfacilities in a manner determined by the Ohio Department of \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I say to Senator DeWine that it is the intent of the \nAppropriations Committee that the $30 million earmarked in Senate \nReport 104-325 for Ohio bus and bus-related facilities be available to \nthe Ohio Department of Transportation to be used for bus and bus-\nrelated facilities in a manner determined by the Ohio Department of \nTransportation.\n  Mr. President, we have a list of notifications of Members that \nindicated they wished to present an amendment--about a dozen. I invite \nMembers to the floor to present those amendments. We are going to have \nto finish this bill tonight, as the leader indicated earlier, and I \nhope the Senators would see fit, if they are interested in pursuing \nthese amendments, to appear on the floor and make their presentation.\n  At some point in time I think the courtesy of waiting for those \namendments will expire, and I will suggest we might go to a third \nreading of the bill and pass the bill. My patience is growing less at \nthis point in time. I think every Senator is busy. I have many things I \ncan do rather than stand here waiting for other Senators.\n  I make a very strong appeal to Senators, and if their staffs are \npresent, to alert those Senators that we are here to do business. If \nnot, we will go to third reading.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 5127 and 5128, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk, en \nbloc, on behalf of Senator Kohl and Senator Bond, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] proposes amendments \n     numbered 5127 and 5128, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5127\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n   establish the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation as a \n                    performance-based organization)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n       Sec.  . It is the Sense of the Senate that Congress should \n     actively consider legislation to establish the Saint Lawrence \n     Seaway Development Corporation as a performance-based \n     organization on a pilot basis beginning in fiscal year 1998.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5128\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress concerning the use of \n   full and open competition in procurement for the Federal Aviation \n    Administration and to require an independent assessment of the \n acquisition management system of the Federal Aviation Administration)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION PROCUREMENT.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration \n     should promote and encourage the use of full and open \n     competition as the preferred method of procurement for the \n     Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (b) Independent Assessment.--Not later than December 31, \n     1997, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration shall--\n       (1) take such action as may be necessary to provide for an \n     independent assessment of the acquisition management system \n     of the Federal Aviation Administration that includes a review \n     of any efforts of the Administrator in promoting and \n     encouraging the use of full and open competition as the \n     preferred method of procurement with respect to any contract \n     that involves an amount greater than $50,000,000; and\n       (2) submit to the Congress a report on the findings of that \n     independent assessment.\n       (c) Full and Open Competition Defined.--For purposes of \n     this section, the term ``full and open competition'' has the \n     meaning provided that term in section 4(6) of the Office of \n     Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(6)).\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, these two amendments have been cleared \non both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments (No. 5127 and 5128), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I make an observation that the \namendments on the list that we have are all legislation--matters \nrelating to legislation on an appropriations bill. We have indicated \nthat in cases of emergency and timeframe problems, if they are cleared \nby the authorizing chairman and the authorizing committee ranking \nmember, we would accept them. But we will not accept legislation on \nthis appropriations bill.\n  Our leadership, both Republican and Democratic, has already stated \nthat we would try to resist all riders on appropriations bills, which \nheld us up a great deal in the last fiscal year and caused us to go, in \npart, into that situation where we had five appropriation bills that we \nhad to incorporate in an omnibus package 7 months into the fiscal year. \nWe are very desperately trying to avoid that this year. I am proud to \nsay that by the end of this week we will have passed nine appropriation \nbills here in the Senate. I have already signed, today, the conference \nreport on the agricultural appropriations bill. We are hoping to have \nfive bills passed in the conference, ready for floor action, at the end \nof this week.\n  So we are making very significant progress. We will report out the \nnumber 12 appropriation bill from our committee, State, Justice, \nCommerce, on Thursday of this week. We will report the last bill on the \nfirst week in September, Labor-HHS. That would give us a schedule that \nthe Republican leader has put together, by which we would be able to \nmeet that October deadline a week to 10 days before the expiration of \nthis fiscal year. What a contrast to last year, and one that I would \nlike to be able to achieve.\n  So, again, I want to say that we have been here now for about a half-\nhour waiting for amendments. I informed the Republican leader about 15 \nminutes ago that we were in this situation, waiting for some kind of \naction, and that I wanted to consider third reading at an appropriate \ntime, which, to me, would be right now. But I am not the leader and, \nconsequently, I will confer with the leadership on that kind of a \ndecision. But I have to, again, assure our colleagues that we want to \ndo business with them. We want to consider their amendments that have \nbeen cleared by both the chairman and the ranking member of authorizing \ncommittees, because most all of them are authorization actions. And \nthat is a bipartisan policy that our leadership has\n\n[[Page S9132]]\n\nestablished and which this committee leadership has also agreed to.\n\n  I do not know what more we can say to require some action.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, to lend some further impetus to the \nremarks of the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, I would \nplead with my colleagues on the Democratic side to get down here if you \nwant to do business. I think it is a very poor reflection on what has \nto be done to set the stage for transportation investments in the year \nbeginning October 1, a chance to establish the fact that things are \nhappening, that we are responding to the need for transportation \ninvestment. For us to stand here while little, if anything, takes \nplace, I think, reflects very poorly on the commitment to getting the \njob done.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we heard from Senator Hatfield, to come on \ndown, present your amendments, present the argument, and see if you can \nwin the case. If the amendments are important, then I fail to see that \nthere is no urgency to getting them down here, get them on the floor, \nand let us discuss them.\n  This is the transportation bill. We are talking about billions of \ndollars. We are talking about safety. We are talking about the way our \nNation competes with other countries. We are talking about quality of \nair. We are talking about the consumption of fuel. We are talking about \nso many things here in this bill, and to permit it to languish while we \nsit here kind of staring at one another is, I think, unacceptable.\n  So I hope that we can encourage leadership on both sides, and the \nSenators on both sides, to get with it, get done, get going so we can \nget on to the next piece of business, or the next pieces of business \nwhich are very important.\n  With that, I note the absence of interest and the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5129\n\n(Purpose: To respond to the tragic explosion of a sugar beet processing \n  plant in Western Nebraska and to provide for the safe and efficient \n               interstate transportation of sugar beets)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment on behalf of \nSenators Kerrey and Exon to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mr. Kerrey, for \n     himself and Mr. Exon, proposes an amendment numbered 5129.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       49 U.S.C. App. 2311 is amended by adding the following new \n     subsection:\n       (D) Nebraska--In addition to vehicles which the State of \n     Nebraska may continue to allow to be operated under \n     paragraphs (1)(a) and (1)(B) of this section, the State of \n     Nebraska may allow longer combination vehicles that were not \n     in actual operation on June 1, 1991 to be operated within its \n     boundaries to transport sugar beets and from the field where \n     such sugar beets are harvested to storage, market, factory or \n     stockpile or from stockpile to storage, market or factory. \n     This provision shall expire on September 30, 1997.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this is one of those examples of a \nlegislative action that has been cleared by the ranking member and the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, so under the exigencies of the \nsituation in Nebraska, it has been cleared on both sides to be adopted \nhere today on our bill.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5129) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5130\n\n (Purpose: To allow funds previously appropriated for a highway safety \n   improvement project in Michigan to be used for construction of a \n                  highway that is part of the project)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Levin of Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mr. Levin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5130.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. HIGHWAY SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT, MICHIGAN.\n\n       Of the amount appropriated for the highway safety \n     improvement project, Michigan, under the matter under the \n     heading ``Surface Transportation Projects'' under the heading \n     ``FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION'' in title I of the \n     Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1995 (Public Law 103-331; 108 Stat. \n     2478), for the purposes of right-of-way acquisition for \n     Baldwin Road, and engineering, right-of-way acquisition, and \n     construction between Walton Boulevard and Dixie Highway, \n     $2,000,000 shall be made available for construction of \n     Baldwin Road.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this is an amendment by the Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, that would move some money from one account to \nanother account to handle a situation in Michigan. This is not \nlegislation on an appropriations bill, and there is a zero budget \nimpact.\n  I believe it has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. So, \ntherefore, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5130) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, we are now approaching 50 minutes that \nwe have waited here for Senators to arrive to offer amendments--50 \nwasted minutes. I really think we have approached the time for calling \nof third reading on this bill and vote this bill out, since we have not \nhad response from Senators.\n  Is the Senator from North Dakota awaiting to present an amendment? I \nrefrain from asking for third reading at this point.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5131\n\n(Purpose: To require investigation of anticompetitive practices in air \n                            transportation)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5131.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 6 after ``$53,376,000,'' insert the \n     following: ``of which such sums as necessary shall be used to \n     investigate anticompetitive practices in air transportation, \n     enforce Section 41712 of Title 49, and report to Congress by \n     the end of the fiscal year on its progress to address \n     anticompetitive practices, and''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have a couple of amendments. The \namendment I have just offered is an amendment that talks about the \nissue of anticompetitive practices in the airline industry. I know \nthere are some in Congress who think that the deregulation of the \nairline industry has been a wonderful bonanza for our country. But \nthere are some of us who live in the more sparsely populated areas of \nour\n\n[[Page S9133]]\n\ncountry who do not believe it has been such a bonanza. The sparsely \npopulated States like North Dakota, for example, have less airline \nservice now and pay more for it than prior to deregulation.\n  I am not a big fan of airline deregulation. I think I would be a big \nfan if I lived in Chicago and traveled to New York and Los Angeles, \nbecause then I would have far more carriers competing, lower prices, \nand a wide variety of flights to take. I suppose for folks who live in \nthose markets, this has been a wonderful bonanza. For folks who live \nelsewhere, it has not worked out so well.\n  One of the interesting things about deregulation is that even when \nyou deregulate an industry like the airlines you must also continue to \nhave some kind of referee so that when someone does something that \ndistorts the market or injures the market, that someone can step in, an \nauthority can step in and say, ``No, this is a practice that is \nanticompetitive.''\n  The whole notion of deregulation is to set free the competitive \nforces by which, through competition, you have more service and lower \nprices. But there are practices that are or can be inherently \nanticompetitive, even under deregulation. That is especially the case \nin rural areas.\n  Let me give you a couple of instances. Last week, in North Dakota we \nlearned that a jet carrier that had started up a couple of years ago to \nprovide regional jet service to our State and some other rural areas \nwas going to discontinue service in North Dakota. Now, that is not so \nunusual. We have lost Continental Airlines from North Dakota. We have \nlost Delta Airlines. We have lost American Airlines. Now we lose \nFrontier Airlines. We are getting accustomed to losing airlines under \nderegulation. We have one large dominant carrier left in North Dakota. \nIt is a good carrier. I think it is a good company. I speak well of it. \nI admire its service. I think it does well. But we do not do well when \nwe do not have competition. When you do not have competition, you have \nless service and pay higher prices.\n  Now, a regional jet carrier starts up to provide some regional jet \nservice competition. What happens under today's deregulation \nenvironment when they try to do that? The large carriers squash them \nlike bugs. They say, ``We do not want competition. We do not want a new \ncarrier to start up.''\n  So what do they do? Well, first of all, under deregulation, the large \ncarriers have no requirement at all to have any sort of code-sharing \nwith any new carrier. Take the airline that started in North Dakota to \nfly to the Denver hub. The Denver hub is dominated by one carrier, one \nof the largest airline companies in the country. That carrier says to a \nnew jet service, ``We have no interest in cooperating with you in any \nway. We are not interested in offering you code-sharing in any \ncircumstance.'' And if you want to make money you make money hauling \npeople from point A to point B, and that is it--from Bismarck, ND, to \nDenver, CO. Of course most people are not traveling from Bismarck to \nDenver. They are traveling from Bismarck to Denver and then to Los \nAngeles, to Chicago, to Phoenix, to San Francisco, or elsewhere.\n  The result is, because a large carrier prohibits or simply refuses to \ncooperate in any way--especially with code-sharing--with a startup \ncarrier, the startup carrier is severely disadvantaged.\n  In addition to that, the large carrier will go to the travel agents \nin those communities and say, ``I tell you what, we do not want you to \nticket on this new competitive airline. We want you to ticket with us. \nGo a more circuitous route, travel more miles, but travel with us. What \nwe will do is pay the travel agents' override commissions.'' They \neffectively say to travel agents, ``If you keep people off this new \nairline, we will pay you to do it.'' Of course, when the new airline \nleaves that community and no longer serves, all these overrides, the \npayments to the travel agents, will be gone. But that is the way this \npractice works.\n\n  Fundamentally, anticompetitive practices by airlines who have gotten \nbig enough to wield the economic clout, the sheer muscle power, injure \nthe startup companies. If I dominate a hub, say in Minneapolis, Denver, \nor some other hub, I will describe the kind of competition I have in \nand out of that hub, because I can enforce that competition. I can \nenforce it by keeping people out and by letting in only those who I \nchoose to let in. Now, that is the circumstance under deregulation \nwithout a referee.\n  Now, I happen to think we do not have a very aggressive effort in the \nDepartment of Transportation dealing with these issues of \nanticompetitive behavior or anticompetitive practices. Am I critical of \nDOT? Yes, I have been after them for 2 years on these issues. If I am a \nnew carrier that starts up to provide jet service from North Dakota to \nDenver, for example, I do not even show up on the first one or two \ncomputer screens when a travel agent in Los Angeles decides it will \nbook a flight from Los Angeles to North Dakota and back. I do not show \nup on the screen as providing jet service. That is anticompetitive. It \nis a computer reservation system, controlled by a dominate carrier that \nis anticompetitive.\n  There are a number of anticompetitive practices that occur and not \nmuch is done about it. For 2 years I have been after the Department of \nTransportation to do something about it. They drag their feet for a \nyear and a half, and now there is some work, maybe they are starting to \ndo some things--probably too late, maybe not aggressive enough. My hope \nis that perhaps in the near future we will see the Department of \nTransportation do what it ought to do--become the referee, the arbiter \nof fairness, in what is competitive and what is anticompetitive in this \nindustry.\n  The amendment I have offered simply says that the Secretary of \nTransportation shall use such funds as is necessary to investigate \nanticompetitive practices in air transportation, to enforce section \n41712 of title 49, and to report to Congress by the end of the fiscal \nyear on its progress to address anticompetitive practices.\n  I hope if this is accepted, and I understand it will be, that the \nSecretary of Transportation will take this seriously and do \naggressively what it should have been doing the last couple of years.\n  I understand some people would like there to be no discussion on \namendments that are offered that are being accepted. I am sorry about \nthat, but the fact is I have also been waiting here for an hour, and \nwhen I offer an amendment, I intend to be able to speak on it as I \nwish.\n  I have a couple of other amendments that I will offer. But I ask that \nthis amendment be accepted, if it is acceptable to the majority and \nminority.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think the Senator from North Dakota \nmakes a very good case. Despite the fact that I come from one of the \nmost active transportation centers of the country, New Jersey, and we \nare the most densely populated State, we need access to aviation and so \nforth. I agree that the problems that have developed since deregulation \nhave not always been things that we anticipated.\n  I talked with the Secretary of Transportation, and I made the point \nthat the distinguished Senator from North Dakota made so eloquently \njust now on the floor. He tells me--and I am sure this is nothing new \nto the Senator from North Dakota--about the fact that United Airlines \nhas agreed with the cooperative baggage arrangements and cooperative \nticketing, though code sharing has not yet become part of the picture.\n  Unfortunately, in the deregulated mode, the contracts are between \nairlines. But I am assured that the Secretary will be looking at the \nanticompetitive situation of small rural airports around the country, \nwhether jet service is available and why it is discontinued. I have \nthat commitment to him. I pass that on to the Senator from North \nDakota, so he has a basis for review as time goes by.\n  We continue to subsidize essential air service in the hope that we \nwill be of some help. Meanwhile, I think the Senator has a good point. \nWe accept his amendment from this side. I assume that the other side \nalso is agreeable.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, has there been a modification of the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator sent up a modified version of the \namendment, which is before us at this time.\n\n[[Page S9134]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Has the Senator modified his amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not technically.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator makes a good point. The clerk did not \nfully read the amendment by our request. I wonder if we could just have \na reminder about what is an item to item 1 and 2, where it starts----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I merely want to find out, is the Senator \ngoing to modify the amendment in the form I have before me? This is \namendment No. 5131, is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I can clear that up. I only offered one \namendment. It is at the desk. It is the amendment that I had cleared \nthrough the manager.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I misunderstood the situation. I thought it was being \nmodified from its original form.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The original amendment was never offered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well. Really, as an original sponsor of the whole \nconcept of the essential air service, I am pleased to see this \namendment come forth in this form. We would have had to oppose the \ncreation of a new office. But this does not do that, so we are prepared \nto accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5131) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5132\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce the level of funding for the National Railroad \n                         Passenger Corporation)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCAIN] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5132.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following,\n       On page 25, strike lines 9 through 14, provided that the \n     $200,000,000 thus saved be made available to the Secretary \n     for high priority rail, aviation and highway safety purposes.\n       On page 29, line 6, strike ``$592,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$462,000,000''.\n       On page 29, line 9, strike ``$250,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$120,000,000, provided that the $130,000,000 thus saved be \n     made available to the Secretary for high priority rail, \n     aviation and highway safety purposes.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask if the managers would like to agree \nto a time agreement. I would be more than happy to discuss that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am interested in a time agreement if the Senator would \nindicate how long he might want.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the managers are agreeable, 15 minutes on a side. \nSenator Biden asked to be notified at the time of the presentation of \nthe amendment. He also said he would agree to a time agreement, but he \nwould like to have time to debate this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator wishes time to contact the Senator from \nDelaware. If the Senator will proceed, we will try to get a time \nagreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I fully intend to enter into a time \nagreement with the managers of the bill at the appropriate time when \nthey come up with a proposal.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would restore Amtrak's funding to the \nHouse passed level and provide the savings to the Secretary of \nTransportation for high priority rail, highway, and aviation safety \npurposes.\n  The House overwhelmingly passed the fiscal 1997 Transportation \nappropriations bill by a vote of 403 to 2 and appropriated a total of \n$462 million for Amtrak's operating expenses and capital improvements.\n  The Senate has added $330 million to this bill for Amtrak's capital \naccounts, adding $200 million for the Northeast Corridor Improvement \nProgram which the House did not fund at all. This amounts to at least a \n61-percent increase in Amtrak funding over the House appropriated \nlevels. While I understand that some of my colleagues believe that if \nwe continue to throw additional money at Amtrak, its financial problems \nwill disappear, I believe the House-passed funding levels are more than \nsufficient and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I also know that some will come to the floor to argue that unless we \ngive Amtrak this massive increase in capital grants over and above the \nHouse-passed level, Amtrak will find it even harder to reach self-\nsufficiency. While their intentions may be good, we have been \nrepeatedly promised that with increased expenditures Amtrak will become \nself-sufficient. That has never been the case before. I do not believe \nthat will be the case today.\n  Amtrak began in 1971 as a 2-year experiment. Since its creation in \n1971, Amtrak has cost the American taxpayer about 418 billion. This $18 \nbillion has gone to subsidizing rail transportation for less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent of America's intercity rail passengers. In addition, \na recent study by economists Wendell Cox and Jean Love found that the \nvast majority of Amtrak riders earn more than $40,000 a year.\n  Let me just show my colleagues Amtrak funding from 1995. In 1995, \nthere will be allotted to the State of New York $215.862 million; to \nthe State of California, $119.531 million; the State of Pennsylvania, \n$11.945 million; the State of Washington $108.787 million. Those four \nStates will receive $556.125 million. A percentage of the funding----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me finish my statement, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have the floor. I ask for the regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would appreciate it if the Senator from New Jersey \nwould observe the regular order. I said to him I do not wish to yield \nthe floor at this time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from New Jersey does not need a lesson on \nprotocol.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from New Jersey obviously needs a lesson on \nthe rules of the Senate because he interrupted me again as I have the \nfloor.\n  I ask the Chair for the floor again. I hope that the Senator from New \nJersey will not interrupt again as long as I choose not to yield the \nfloor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on chart No. 2, I would like to show \nAmtrak revenues and expenses for fiscal years 1988 through 1994. As we \ncan see, the expenses continue to go up and the revenues are basically \nflat.\n  This second chart reveals how, over the years, Amtrak's expenses have \nsteadily grown at an accelerated pace while revenue have remained \nvirtually the same. I believe this shows that Amtrak's problems are \nfundamental and the only question is whether the Federal Government \nwill, at a minimum, put some limits on the amount of taxpayer dollars \nwe are willing to lose to a failed experiment.\n  The point made by this third chart is basic. Amtrak appropriations \nhave grown over its 25-year existence, and despite this fact, Amtrak \nstill never seems to have enough Federal subsidization to cover its \nlosses.\n  Mr. President, I remember with great clarity in 1983 when I came to \nthe House of Representatives of the United States when I was visited by \na man that I admired as much as any man I have ever known in my life, \nthe former Secretary of the Navy who I had known on my tour in the \nNavy, Mr. Graham Claytor, Secretary Graham Claytor. Secretary Claytor \nwas then President of Amtrak, and Secretary Claytor assured me that \nAmtrak funding would no longer be needed after 5 years; absolutely that \nwould be the end because Secretary Claytor, and the other people who \nran Amtrak and other Members of Congress, said that after 5 years there \nwould be no need for any more Federal funding because Amtrak would be \nself-sufficient.\n  I would be glad to include for the Record how time after time after \ntime over many previous years since 1971 that the assurances were given \nto this body and to the American taxpayers. ``Do not worry. Four or 5 \nyears from now the funding required for Amtrak will be finished.''\n\n[[Page S9135]]\n\n  Mr. President, on October 8, 1995, George Will wrote a very \ninteresting and entertaining article that I would like to quote. He \nsays:\n       Long ago, before Washington decided it did everything so \n     well it should start running a passenger railroad, American \n     slang included a phrase used to express dismay about \n     mismanagement of organizations. The phrase is ``Helluva way \n     to run a railroad.'' Speaking of Amtrak . . .\n       Congress is speaking of it because conservatives are in a \n     Margaret Thatcher mood. It was said she cold not see an \n     institution without swatting it with her handbag. \n     Republicans, who praise governmental minimalism, can hardly \n     close their year of glory without asking why the government \n     is in the railroad business.\n       In a sense it has been for more than a century. The word \n     ``cordial'' hardly suggests the intimacy between government--\n     federal and state--and railroads in the 19th century, when 10 \n     percent of the public domain was given in land grants to the \n     transcontinental railroads. The Union Pacific was given one-\n     tenth of Nebraska--4,845,997 acres.\n       Amtrak began, as did so much that makes today's \n     conservatives cross, under Richard Nixon, during whose \n     administration there occurred the largest peacetime expansion \n     of government power in American history (wage and price \n     controls) and the creation of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \n     forced busing and racial set-asides. He failed to get \n     Congress to enact a new entitlement, a guaranteed annual \n     income, and to embark on what is now called ``industrial \n     policy'' by funding development of a supersonic transport \n     aircraft.\n       ``All through grade school,'' said Nixon, ``my ambition was \n     to become a railroad engineer.'' Would that he had. In March \n     1970, the largest operator of passenger trains, Penn Central, \n     on the verge of bankruptcy, sought permission to end \n     passenger service west of Harrisburg and Buffalo. For that, \n     government deserved a portion of blame, the Interstate \n     Commerce Commission having resisted rate increases \n     commensurate with wage increases unions were winning. In a \n     textbook example of how bad government begets more \n     government, Amtrak was born.\n       It began operations in 1971, ostensibly as a two-year \n     experiment. It has lost money since 1971, partly because it \n     has been a mini-welfare state appended to the welfare state: \n     It has been forbidden to contract out union jobs, and laid-\n     off workers have been entitled to six years of severance pay. \n     So, having helped make private railroads anemic (jet \n     aircraft, better highways and inept railroad management \n     contributed mightily to the anemia), the government piled on \n     Amtrak its mandates that would keep it running in the red.\n       Helluva way to run a railroad? What do you expect from \n     something created in defiance of market forces and regarded \n     by its creators, the political class, as several varieties of \n     pork, including an entitlement for small communities that \n     want the government to guarantee continuing rail service for \n     which there is weak demand?\n       Recently a full-page magazine ad by Amtrak bore this \n     message at the bottom of the page: ``No federal funds were \n     used to pay for this message.'' What mendacity. Money is \n     fungible, so taxpayers paid for as large a portion of the \n     cost of that ad as they pay of the overall costs of Amtrak--\n     about 20 percent. And Amtrak's ads are not producing \n     congestion down at the old railroad depot. Amtrak carries \n     less than one percent of the people who travel between \n     cities, and half of its passengers are in the Northeast \n     Corridor. Most passengers are middle class, many of them \n     business travelers. Almost all have air or long-haul bus \n     transportation alternatives.\n       Defenders of the subsidies say, as defenders of subsidies \n     do, that we are all benefiting so much that the subsidies \n     ``pay for themselves.'' Their argument is that because of \n     passenger trains, highways are less congested, air is less \n     polluted, we are delaying the evil day when federal money \n     will have to help build another airport for Boston, and so \n     on. There is some truth in all these arguments and a lot in \n     this one: Government even more heavily subsidizes air and \n     road passengers. United Airlines is not expected to build \n     airports, and Greyhound is not responsible for maintaining \n     the highways.\n       However, Congress is poised to shrink Amtrak subsidies from \n     more than $700 million next year to zero by 2002 at the \n     latest, when Amtrak is scheduled to be privatized.\n  That obviously, has not been the case since Mr. Will wrote this \narticle.\n  Mr. Will continues:\n\n       Its roadbed needs work, especially in the Northeast, and \n     its rolling stock is old (the average car is 23 years old), \n     so even with more reasonable work rules and more latitude to \n     rationalize routes, privatization may not be possible. But \n     trying to get the government out of railroading is not \n     optional if the conservatives' determination to rationalize \n     government is real.\n\n  Mr. President, this money that I am asking to be reduced would go to \nmuch needed rail, air, and road safety. We all realize how much safety \nis important; indeed, uppermost in the minds of many people as a result \nof some of the aircraft accidents that have taken place, some of the \nrail accidents that have taken place in America, and also some of the \ncontinued terrible tragedies that afflict the highways day in and day \nout.\n  So, Mr. President, I wonder if the managers of the bill are ready to \nenter into a time agreement?\n  In the meantime, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that on this amendment there be \na time agreement with 30 minutes on the side of those who oppose \nSenator McCain's amendment and another 5 minutes for Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If we can modify that, and that is that there be no \nsecond-degree amendments prior to a motion to table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That time is on or in relation to this amendment and \nthat there be no second-degree amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment by the Senator from Arizona. Cutting funding for Amtrak back \nto the inadequate level set by the House would be a big mistake and \nvery bad public policy, in my view. It would be a formula for failure \nfor the only intercity passenger rail service we have in America. The \namendment would frustrate Amtrak's ongoing attempts to become self-\nsufficient. Instead of saving any money, it would waste funds already \nprovided for passenger rail by virtually guaranteeing the demise of \nAmtrak.\n  It is a formula for failure, Mr. President, because it prevents \nAmtrak from completing the comprehensive reforms it needs to eventually \nbecome self-sufficient in its day-to-day operations.\n  I know my friends have heard me over the last 20 years make this same \npoint. But no passenger rail service in the world--and passenger rail \nplays an important role all over the world--no passenger rail service \nin the world is, in fact, operated without public support for its \ncapital needs. Whether it is in Europe or Japan, the most advanced \nindustrialized economies in the world, not one passenger rail system in \nthe world operates without support for its capital needs. It is these \ncapital investments, the improvements to the Northeast corridor to \ncarry high-speed trains and funds to purchase new locomotives and \npassenger cars for the western part of the United States as well as the \nNortheast corridor, that the McCain amendment hits the hardest.\n  Without upgrades to the bridges, without straightening out the \ncurves, without completion of the electrification of the rail \nconnections between Washington and Boston, Amtrak would be unable to \nattract the additional passengers it needs to earn more operating \nincome.\n  Mr. President, we have put Amtrak on a very strict diet. We have cut \nservice. We have cut subsidies. We have gotten a commitment that they \nwill be self-sufficient by the year 2001. Amtrak on the east coast \nworks on an electrification system, overhead electrical wires, and we \nhave spent millions of dollars to upgrade the system from New York to \nBoston to allow high-speed Metroliner runs from Boston all the way to \nWashington. We have had to upgrade the bridges. We are well beyond New \nHaven and working our way up. This amendment would stop that project \ncold, absolutely cold.\n  The Senate is on record in support of providing a half cent from the \nFederal gasoline tax to provide for Amtrak's\n\n[[Page S9136]]\n\ncapital budget. This is a step that I believe has to be taken as soon \nas possible. But until then, Amtrak will continue to require adequate \nfunding through the appropriations process. I have been working here \nalong with my colleague, Senator Roth, and others for years and years \nto get a dedicated source of funding for Amtrak. We are on the verge of \ndoing that. Once that is done, one-half cent would provide $600 million \na year in capital costs.\n  That dedicated capital fund would be able to underwrite the capital \ncost of the entire Amtrak system coast to coast. But, in the meantime, \nabsent that funding source, to eliminate the Northeast corridor \nimprovements and decimate the remainder of their capital budget \nnationwide would literally be the end of the railroad. It becomes a \nself-fulfilling prophecy. We say we want this outfit to be self-\nsufficient, and the very things needed to make it self-sufficient are \nthe things we are going to deny it before we get to that point.\n  My friend from Arizona said, I am told, that the average Amtrak \npassenger makes $40,000 a year and does not need a subsidy, et cetera, \net cetera, et cetera. I would like to put this thing in focus. My \nWestern colleagues come to us in the East, and they say, ``An integral \npart of our economy is water.'' They point out to us, time and again, \nthat we need to vote to subsidize their farmers, to subsidize their \ncities, to subsidize their drinking water. And we do. We spend tens of \nbillions of dollars a year--tens of billions of dollars a year.\n  I will never forget the first time, as a young man, I flew from the \neast coast to the west coast. I will never forget flying over the \nfoothills of the Rocky Mountains and then on the other side, seeing all \nthese concentric circles on the ground. I wondered what they were, \nthese concentric circles. I had been in an airplane before, but I had \nnever flown coast to coast.\n  All of a sudden, I realized that is my mother's tax dollars, on \nSocial Security. That is my tax dollars. It is my dad's tax dollars, on \nSocial Security. Subsidizing what? Subsidizing western farm areas, \nsubsidizing Senator McCain's in-laws and himself and others' drinking \nwater. That is OK with me. We are one nation. The purpose of one nation \nis for each part of the country to work together. The whole is greater \nthan the sum of the parts. All the parts of the Nation need different \nthings. I do not hear Senator McCain or other Western Senators coming \nhere and saying: You know, let us do away with subsidizing those \nfarmers. Let us do away with subsidizing the water John Doe drinks in \nPhoenix, AZ. And I am not here doing that.\n  But rail passenger service is critical to my section of the country \nand to the west coast. It is critical. If we eliminate Amtrak, how many \nmore lanes of interstate highway are we going to be able to put in? \nWhat is it going to do to the environment? What is it going to do to \nthe air? All Amtrak wants is a shot, a chance, a shot to make \nthemselves self-sufficient.\n  I will not be on the floor trying to restore Amtrak money for \noperating costs if we get the half-cent gas tax, a measly half cent. \nBut the fact of the matter is, the House Transportation Committee and \nCongressman Wolf cut this significantly, the same amount that my friend \nand colleague from Arizona wants to cut it. Senator Hatfield and \nSenator Lautenberg and their colleagues in the Appropriations Committee \nhave repaired the damage done by the House bill. And, as the chairman \nof the House Transportation Committee, Congressman Wolf, admitted, the \nHouse levels were wholly inadequate and were intended to force the \nadoption of the half-cent proposal.\n  I am not sure what I think of that strategy, but I certainly agree \nthat Amtrak funding levels in the House bill, the levels called for in \nSenator McCain's amendment, would be totally inadequate. The McCain \namendment is a proposal to kill Amtrak; let there be no mistake about \nthat. As a small State in the Northeast corridor, Delaware would be \nhard hit by the loss of a major part of its transportation system. As a \nmajor center for the repair and maintenance of railroads for more than \na century, Delaware also faces the loss of important jobs under the \nsevere cuts in the Northeast corridor and the capital budget of Amtrak. \nBut as Senator Lautenberg forcefully argued, Amtrak plays a key role in \nthe whole country's transportation system. As Senator Hatfield, the \ndistinguished departing chair of the Appropriations Committee, well \nknows, the west coast is a major beneficiary of passenger rail as well.\n  I acknowledge that, because of all the cuts we made in Amtrak over \nthe past, not every State or region benefits equally from Amtrak. I \nacknowledge that. But I do not benefit from the water subsidies either. \nDelaware farmers do not benefit like the farmers from Arizona. My \nmother does not benefit, like the Senator's family does. I understand \nthat. That is America.\n\n  Senator McCain comes from a desert. I come from a place where there \nis a lot of water. I come from a place where we are overgrown with \nhighways, where we have trouble breathing the air. Passenger rail is \nneeded to relieve traffic congestion and air pollution. It is needed \nbadly.\n  I will leave Senator McCain's water alone if he leaves my railroad \nalone.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I have 1 more minute?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 1 more minute to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I want to stress that Amtrak is not important to just one \npart of the country or to just a few customers. I understand the \ndistinguished majority leader has been assured by his constituents of \nthe importance of Amtrak to the State of Mississippi. If Amtrak were an \nairline, it would be the largest air carrier in the country. Amtrak is \nthe single largest individual passenger carrier on the east coast, and \nto replace Amtrak's service in the East, as well as around the country, \nwould require more lanes of interstate highway and more air pollution, \nmore airport construction, additional safety concerns and increased \ncongestion for all parts of the Nation. So let us not kid ourselves \nthat Amtrak is not important to all parts of our country. But I agree, \nit is of particular importance to my State and the east coast.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member, and I yield back the 12 \nsecond I may have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has approved full funding for Amtrak operations, capital \nsupport, and the Northeast Corridor Improvement Program. I regret this \namendment to cut funding for Amtrak by $173 million is being offered.\n  Amtrak, as has been pointed out, provides service for millions of \nAmericans, a competitive service at a competitive price. Through a \nmodern nationwide passenger rail system, traffic congestion, and air \npollution are reduced by this fuel-efficient alternative to highway and \nair travel. I certainly recognize that Amtrak cannot survive much \nlonger as a viable entity in its current financial condition. Many of \nus are familiar with the oft-cited GAO report documenting the widening \ngap between Amtrak's revenues and expenses since the beginning of this \ndecade. For the past 2 years, the question facing Congress is, what \nshould we do about Amtrak? I do not think anyone believes that simply \nincreasing or even continuing in perpetuity Amtrak's annual subsidy are \nwise solutions. Instead, a better solution has been proposed. This \nsolution, partially embodied within the Amtrak authorization bill, will \nenable Amtrak to operate as much like a private business as possible.\n  Separate legislation, which constitutes the second part of this \nproposal, would redirect one-half cent of the Federal gas tax to a new \npassenger rail trust fund similar to those existing for highway and air \ntravel.\n  I will just say this. Transporting people has never been a profitable \nbusiness for railroads. At least it certainly has not been in the past \n50 years. So, I believe it is unfortunate that prospects for passage of \nthis Amtrak authorization bill and legislation to redirect the half \ncent of the Federal gas tax, is being proposed. I think if there is no\n\n[[Page S9137]]\n\nAmtrak authorization bill and no steady revenue source to allow Amtrak \nto modernize and privatize, there is going to be trouble. That is the \nsituation we have today. Funding for Amtrak operations and capital \nsupport in the Northeast corridor are urgently required for the short-\nterm survival of intercity passenger rail service. Amtrak does want to \nend its dependence on Federal subsidies. However, until such a plan is \nin place, Amtrak simply must have the yearly support needed to continue \nat a minimal level.\n  I am a user of Amtrak, Mr. President. It is very important to the \nsection of the country I have, and, therefore, I urge the opposition \nand, indeed, the defeat of the amendment proposed by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \njust heard the statement by Senator Chafee and agree with his comments. \nI would like to find a way for Amtrak to become more self-sufficient. I \nwould like to find an additional revenue source for Amtrak. But the \nfact is, until that occurs, if we do not provide adequate funding, \nthere will not be an Amtrak that represents a national rail system \nproviding service across the country.\n  If this amendment is adopted, we will be left only with a Northeast \ncorridor service for Amtrak, period. There will be no other Amtrak in \nthe rest of the country. We will have service in the Northeast \ncorridor, and we will have no other service anywhere else. I don't \nthink that advances the interest of a country that does need a mix of \ntransportation services, including rail passenger service.\n  In fact, the committee cut the Amtrak funding by about $40 million \nfrom last year. This amendment would then reduce it another couple \nhundred million dollars. This does not, in my judgment, move us in the \nright direction. It moves us exactly in the wrong direction, if you \nbelieve that we ought to have some kind of rail passenger system as a \nnational system.\n  If you believe it only ought to be regional, then you probably will \nend up all right with this, although I don't think it provides \nsufficient funding. But if you believe we ought to have a national rail \npassenger system, then this amendment would severely injure the \nopportunity to do that, because we would not have a national rail \npassenger system if this amendment is adopted.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for the time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 13 minutes, 43 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How many?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes, 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The other side has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself so much time as I will \nuse between now and the 13 minutes plus.\n  Mr. President, I indicate my strong opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arizona. It almost sounds like a vendetta. \nTalk about $18 billion worth of spending on Amtrak--my gosh, we spend \nover $8 billion a year on aviation; we spend over $20 billion a year on \nhighways. Amtrak is the only serious railroad opportunity we have for \npassengers, and it has continued to prove its merit and its worth as \ntime has gone by. Amtrak's farebox comes closer to its revenues than \nany other major passenger rail service in the world.\n  It is ridiculous for the United States of America not to have a \nsignificant passenger rail service. Just look at what would happen in \nthe Northeast corridor where it is believed that we service almost 100 \nmillion people. The Northeast corridor would need 10,000 full DC-9's a \nyear to carry the traffic. Well, perhaps that's not true. Maybe we \ncould push them onto the highways. We could put some 11 million people \nin their cars and tell them to drive between New York and Washington or \nBoston and Washington or Boston and New York or Boston and New Haven or \nBoston and Hartford or Boston and Providence. Get in your cars, use \nmore gas, take up more time, that will mean more congestion, more foul \nair. That is what the alternative is.\n  I have never seen anything so shortsighted in my life, but the speech \nsounds good--throw out statistics that have no merit in fact. One says \nwe allocate by State, as I saw the chart displayed by the Senator from \nArizona, at which time when I had a question, he refused to answer it. \nThat is his privilege. He had the floor, and he is right, he did have \nthe floor. But there is also something around here called common \ncourtesy. But we pass on that these days.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter in hand from no fewer than 19 of the \nNation's Governors, both Republican and Democratic Governors, urging \nadequate capital funding for Amtrak. Among the Governors that have \nurged the committee to provide adequate capital funding of Amtrak are \nseveral who are mentioned as the potential Vice President to the \nnominee--the likely nominee--of the Republican Party: Gov. Tom Ridge \nfrom the State of Pennsylvania; my own Governor, very popular, very \nthoughtful, very well thought of, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman; Governor \nPataki of New York; Governor Weld of Massachusetts; and Governor \nRowland of Connecticut. I dare say, probably six Vice Presidential \ncandidates there.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter sent to Senator Hatfield and \nmyself from 19 of the Nation's Governors be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nrecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 25, 1996.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee, Capitol Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     Ranking Member, Appropriations Subcommittee on \n         Transportation, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatfield and Lautenberg: As you consider \n     various options for the FY 1997 Transportation Appropriations \n     bill, we urge you to provide adequate capital funding for the \n     National Passenger Rail Corporation (Amtrak). The General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) estimated that in order to keep \n     Amtrak running and to reduce its dependence on federal \n     operating assistance, Amtrak requires an annual capital \n     subsidy of $500 to $600 million. Amtrak, the Administration \n     and GAO agree that the future reduction of Amtrak's federal \n     operating subsidy is dependent on continued capital \n     investment in Amtrak's infrastructure.\n       Specifically, we urge you to support, at an absolute \n     minimum, last year's level of funding for general capital--\n     $230 million--and the Northeast Corridor Improvement \n     Program--$115 million. These funding levels are consistent \n     with the assumptions made in the recently-adopted budget \n     resolution and with the authorizations levels which have \n     passed the House and are pending in the Senate.\n       As you are aware, the Amtrak Board of Directors is strongly \n     committed to eliminating its dependence on federal operating \n     assistance over the next six years. Amtrak's ability to \n     continue to reduce its operating costs, however, is dependent \n     on adequate federal capital support.\n       While we realize the complex and difficult decisions you \n     face this year with respect to funding transportation \n     programs, we urge you to carefully consider the productivity \n     improvements that have been made at Amtrak and to support an \n     ongoing federal role in maintaining this nation's rail \n     system, even as the federal operating subsidy is phased out.\n           Sincerely,\n         Tom Carper, Governor, State of Delaware, Gaston Caperton \n           Governor, State of West Virginia; Howard Dean, \n           Governor, State of Vermont; George Pataki, Governor, \n           State of New York; Ben Nelson, Governor, State of \n           Nebraska; Bill Weld, Governor, State of Massachusetts; \n           Zell Miller, Governor, State of Georgia; John Rowland, \n           Governor, State of Connecticut; Roy Romer, Governor, \n           State of Colorado; Parris Glendening, Governor, State \n           of Maryland; Tom Ridge, Governor, State of \n           Pennsylvania; Mike Lowry, Governor, State of \n           Washington; Christine Whitman, Governor, State of New \n           Jersey; Bob Miller, Governor, State of Nevada, Mel \n           Carnahan, Governor, State of Missouri; Evan Bayh, \n           Governor, State of Indiana; Lawton Chiles, Governor, \n           State of Florida; Jim Guy Tucker, Governor, State of \n           Arkansas; Angus King, Governor, State of Maine.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in recent years, as Amtrak has been \nrequired to reduce service and, in some cases, eliminate service to \nseveral States, I have noticed that some of the loudest complaints have \ncome from some of our States in the West and in the Midwest. I \nappreciate the fact the\n\n[[Page S9138]]\n\nSenator from North Dakota had comments to make in favor of Amtrak \nservice.\n  A lot of people are complaining that we have reduced or eliminated \nAmtrak service. Well, they just don't have the income, and when you \nthink of what it takes to put this system in shape, it is de minimis \ncompared to the service that is being offered. We can dress it up in \nvarious terms: high-income people ride the train. See what it looks \nlike and see people getting on there with tattered luggage and not able \nto figure out another way to get there. It is easy to stand on a high \nhorse and criticize those who ride Amtrak. Try it; you may like it.\n  The fact of the matter is, while Amtrak's funding levels, as \ncontained in this bill, are higher than the House-passed level, they \nstill remain far lower than the level requested by the administration. \nThe Senator from Arizona wants to take the funding down by almost $400 \nmillion, when we worked like the devil, skimped and saved and moved and \nchanged to try and get a balanced funding bill, a balanced \ntransportation bill. And the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], worked \nvery hard to do that.\n  So, Mr. President, the House Appropriations Committee made a \ncalculated judgment to extract the vast majority of its transportation \ncuts from Amtrak's budget. I do not agree with those priorities, and \nneither does the chairman of the committee itself.\n  The one thing that we ought to be aware of is that if we eliminate \nAmtrak, we eliminate a serious asset that this country of ours \nrequires. We are the only country in the world, the only country of the \nmore developed countries in the world that does not recognize that you \nhave to invest and you have to subsidize its national passenger rail \nsystem. Get on the TGV in France or get on the bullet trains in Japan; \nthe Government pays an awful lot more on a proportionate basis than we \nare willing to put in Amtrak at our most generous moments.\n  Mr. President, I yield for a minute or so to my friend from Delaware \nwho has asked to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much time does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask for 1 minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I see my friend from Arizona is still on \nthe floor. In terms of subsidies, I point out again, because the \nargument was made, there is a little thing called the central Arizona \nwater project. That is 3.5 billion bucks that my mom is helping to pay \nfor. She will never drink a drop of the water, but Arizona needs it. It \nis $3.5 billion needed, badly needed--$3.5 billion.\n  But our country needs Amtrak as well, on the west coast and on the \neast coast. I yield whatever time I have left.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Arizona asked for the floor. It is \nall right with me.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is an indication that the chairman will not be \nable to get back in the time we thought he would get back. I think \nthere are going to be others that seek time on this bill. Will the \nSenator agree we would extend time on each side for another 10 minutes? \nI ask unanimous consent that the current time agreement be extended for \n10 additional minutes for Senator McCain and 10 additional minutes for \nSenator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. While my friend from Delaware is still on the floor, I \nwill say there is no one obviously that knows Amtrak better than the \nSenator from Delaware, who every evening travels and takes advantage of \nthat opportunity to be back in Delaware with his family and with his \nfriends and his constituents. And I, for one, respect and admire that \ndedication that the Senator from Delaware has displayed to both his \nfamily and the people that he represents. It is obvious why they keep \nsending him back here.\n  The Senator from Delaware also mentioned to me that if we did cut \nAmtrak, we would probably get a lot more speeches from the Senator from \nDelaware, which I would find enlightening, but others may not.\n  I understand the commitment that the Senator from Delaware has. I \npoint out, the central Arizona project, as the Senator from Delaware \nknows, was completed, and the State of Arizona will be repaying the \nFederal Government for the cost of that.\n  It is obvious that your then-dollars are not the same as now-dollars. \nI know the Senator from Delaware appreciates that. My problem is, I say \nto the Senator from Delaware, this is an unending subsidy, apparently, \nwhen the Amtrak authorities themselves maintain every few years that \nthere is only a few more years of subsidy.\n  My question to the Senator from Delaware is, as they cut more and \nmore service, and basically you are left with the Northeast Corridor \nand the San Diego-LA route, which is basically what is left, and it is \nno longer a national rail system for any intents and purposes, how long \nwould this system, which originally was conceived in 1971 to last for 2 \nyears--2 years of subsidies was the deal when it began in 1971--how \nlong will be the requirement to have these subsidies provided by the \ntaxpayers for which one-half of 1 percent of all of the users of \ntransportation, rail transportation, in America, make use of? That is, \nI think, a legitimate question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would be happy to take 30 seconds to answer the \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time. I yield \ntime to the Senator from Delaware from my time to respond.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think it is a mistake, but in fact the \nCongress has agreed--any subsidy would end by the year 2001. The only \nreasonable way for that to occur, Mr. President, is if in fact we are \nable to get that half-cent trust fund set up. But whether we get that \nor not, in the year 2001 this is gone. I think Amtrak made a mistake \nagreeing to that, to be completely honest with my friend. But that is \nthe answer to the question.\n  The drop-dead date is the year 2001. In my view, they will not make \nit--to be completely candid with my friend--they will not make it \nunless they get that half-cent trust fund.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say with all due respect to the Senator \nfrom Delaware, wasn't that what they said in 1971 when they said it \nwill only be 2 more years? And wasn't that what they said in 1983 when \nGraham Claytor, a man I respect more than almost any other man I have \never known, said, ``In 4 years we'll be done''? They said, ``In 4 years \nwe'll be done.'' It is always, always, always 4 or 5 years out, I say \nto the Senator from Delaware. Really what it has proved is that once \nyou start a system on the Federal dole, it is going to continue \nforever. And that is the case here, unfortunately, with Amtrak, and why \nthis amendment will not prevail again.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the manager yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Absolutely. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my friend from Arizona makes at least two \nvalid points--and many more--but two valid points. One is that if \nAmtrak is out of business, I will be here. I will have to be in \nWashington; and it means I will not be running out of here after the \nlast vote to get the train home, which means I will get to speak more. \nThat may be inducement enough for my colleagues to vote to continue to \nsubsidize Amtrak, so I am not here late at night debating.\n  But another truism that the Senator stated is that this has been a \nsubsidy. It is an ongoing subsidy. But when he puts it in the context \nof being on the dole, you have to put it in the context of all other \ntransportation systems. We subsidize airline tickets more. The average \nincome of people flying in airlines, I suspect, is as high or higher\n\n[[Page S9139]]\n\nthan anyone getting on an Amtrak train.\n  We subsidize those airline tickets a number of ways. They are tax \ndeductible for business expenses. We build the airports. We build the \ntowers and pay the air traffic controllers, et cetera, et cetera, et \ncetera. We also subsidize the highways beyond what we collect in the \nhighway trust fund moneys.\n  So, Mr. President, all modes of transportation in the United States \nare subsidized. It seems to me rational public policy would dictate us \nto look at what makes sense. Different regions have different \nrequirements. I see my friend from North Dakota is here. Amtrak is \nuseful to him, but he does not need Amtrak as much as he needs \nhighways. In Delaware we do not need any more highways. We cannot \nafford any more highways in my State or the State of Rhode Island or \nthe State of New Jersey or the State of New York and so on and so \nforth.\n  So every region of the country has different needs. It is true. They \nare all subsidized. And the question here is, it seems to me, the \nappropriate question is, What is an appropriate amount of subsidy? And \nit seems to me when Amtrak, having its budget cut by a third over the \nlast couple years, having trimmed down significantly, this is not an \nappropriate cut. I thank the Chair for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Chair and the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I rise to oppose the amendment offered by my colleague from Arizona, \nMr. McCain.\n  Before I outline my reasons for opposing this amendment, I would like \nto thank my friend and colleague, Senator Hatfield, chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Transportation, and Senator Lautenberg, a very strong \nsupporter of passenger rail, for their work on this bill. I believe \nthis bill is a tremendous and necessary improvement over the one passed \nby the House, and we have these two gentlemen to thank for that.\n  Regarding the amendment offered by my colleague from Arizona, I think \nthe point made by the Senator from Delaware is very valid. All of the \nmodes of transportation are subsidized to a degree. We hear much about \nthe much vaunted Swiss railroad system. They are subsidized. The one in \nFrance is subsidized. The one in Japan is subsidized. But in return for \nthat subsidization, the people of the area get a service and a greater \ndegree of safety and comfort that they would not get otherwise.\n\n  As some of my colleagues are aware, I wrote a book on this subject \nsome 30 years ago, ``Megalopolis Unbound.'' And the book remains \ncurrent today because so little has been done in those 30 years.\n  I hope that we will sustain the effort of the Transportation \nsubcommittee and keep the money in for Amtrak. I am hopeful that, by \ndoing so, we can really make progress in enhancing intercity high speed \npassenger rail. In so doing, perhaps we can avoid having a future \nMember of Congress come along 30 years from now, as I am now, lamenting \nthat much more needs to be done, and how very little has changed in the \nintervening years.\n  We should also recognize that modernizing and enhancing, not \nshortchanging, passenger rail is the current trend in Europe and Asia. \nThese various nations are providing their people a form of efficient \nand safe transportation.\n  Mr. President, as one who helped shepherd through Congress the High \nSpeed Ground Transportation Act of 1965, it has been my long-held \nbelief that passenger rail service is the most fuel-efficient; the \nleast environmentally disruptive; and ultimately, will be the least \nexpensive mode of transportation.\n  Finally, there is another thought here. We accept the idea that \nelevated vertical transportation should be free but not horizontal \ntransportation like the subway because it is horizontal. I can remember \nwhen I was a boy there were buildings in Europe--still some in Europe--\nbuildings in New York where you put a nickel in order to be transported \nup or down. I think this also should be kept in mind.\n  So for all these reasons, I believe that the money--the subsidy, if \nyou want to call it that--for Amtrak should be preserved because it is \ngiving our people service that the citizenry should expect. I thank the \nmanagers of this bill for their very fine efforts, efforts I am pleased \nto support. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, it is all very enjoyable to debate and discuss issues \nwith the Senator from Delaware. And I believe that he makes valid \npoints. I also hope that we do not spend too much time on this \namendment and others so he will be able to take his taxpayer-subsidized \ntrip back to Delaware tonight.\n  Mr. President, I point out that less than one-half of 1 percent of \nAmerica's inner-city rail passengers are subsidized by this program. It \nhas been long recognized by Democrats and Republicans alike that we \nneed to curtail this ever-increasing subsidy.\n  As early as 1979, President Carter's Secretary of Transportation, \nBrock Adams, acknowledged that. I quote back in 1979.\n\n       We can no longer afford to provide disproportionately large \n     and continually increasing amounts of Federal funds for a \n     passenger service that is used by less than one-half of 1 \n     percent of the inner city traveling public.\n\n  Again, in 1988, the President's Commission on Privatization, \nestablished by President Reagan, recommended, as part of a multiyear \nplan to move to privatize Amtrak, that ``Federal subsidies should be \nincrementally reduced and a deadline should be set for the Department \nof Transportation to decide whether Amtrak or portions of its operation \nshould be continued.''\n  Mr. President, again, I would like to see a deadline that is adhered \nto. I think when we have a program that began initially in 1971, that \nwas only supposed to be there for 2 years, and now in the year 1996 we \nhave a policy of some 4 or 5 years from now, it is time we really got \nrealistic. If there is some cynicism on the part of some of us about \nthese dates that continue to slide every 4 or 5 years, I think it is \njustified.\n  Mr. President, the money that is cut out of this appropriation, I \npoint out again, will be used for aviation safety, rail safety, and \nhighway safety, which, obviously, have a great claim to limited \ntaxpayers' funds, greater, I think, than the rail service has been, \nwhich has not been able to obtain self-sufficiency in the last 25 \nyears.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from New Jersey would yield 1 \nminute to respond to a point?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Arizona made a point that I think \nprobably will mischaracterize something. The implication was that the \nfolks in the inner cities really do not get any subsidy in this area.\n  My understanding is that in this bill there is $4.4 billion in \nsubsidy for mass transit systems. Obviously, virtually all of the \ncities that have mass transit systems are getting subsidized on an \nongoing basis, and part of this is paid for by folks in Bismarck and \nFargo. That is fine. I support that. But I do not want people listening \nto this debate to understand there is not a subsidy for mass transit \nbecause there is a $4.4 billion subsidy.\n  The point I was making before was that I do not object to deciding as \na public investment we want to retain an Amtrak system that is a \nnational system. In fact, it still is a national system, but will not \nbe under the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona. I \npersonally make the observation that I think it is a good investment to \nmake.\n  I respect the Senator from Arizona, but we disagree on this, because \nI happen to think this represents a good investment as part of our \ntransportation system.\n  I did want to clear up the point on whether or not mass transit is \nsubsidized. Of course it is. It is subsidized substantially--by $4.4 \nbillion in this bill alone.\n\n[[Page S9140]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McCain \namendment. It is clear what he is trying to do is kill Amtrak. This is \nwrong.\n  Amtrak is integral in transporting people across this great country \nof ours--not just in the Northeast, although the Northeast, which has \nhorrible problems with traffic and air pollution and everything \nconnected with it, needs to go to railroads, needs to utilize the \nrailroads more than it does now for personal transportation.\n  In addition to that, with the overload on our airplanes, trying to \nshuttle back and forth to New York and to Boston, the fast trains, \nwhich this would essentially eliminate, will resolve that horrible \nproblem, much to the benefit of the people in this Nation.\n  Amtrak can survive on its own. We are working toward that goal. Over \nthe last 2 years, Amtrak has restructured itself and is working to be \nfree of Federal support in 5 years. I think they will make it.\n  Mr. President, do not kill our national railroad now. Give Amtrak \ntime to build up the business and let Congress be responsible and pass \nthe Amtrak authorization bill and move the half-cent gas tax to Amtrak. \nWe must not eliminate Federal support until these plans are in place, \nuntil they have been given a chance to demonstrate they can work. I am \nconfident they can.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator McCain's \namendment that would cut capital funding for Amtrak. This funding cut \nwill cripple the Northeast Corridor Improvement Program and threaten \nthe viability of passenger rail in this country. It is my understanding \nthat if the Senate votes in favor of these cuts, it will have far-\nreaching effects nationwide.\n  The reduction in capital could mean the termination of the High Speed \nRail Program that has the potential to revive passenger rail as an \nimportant component of our national transportation system. It will also \nimpair Amtrak's heavy overhaul and maintenance capabilities--much of \nwhich is done in Delaware's Amtrak shops. Shortchanging maintenance \nwill contribute to further decline of rolling stock and locomotives, \nreducing the quality of service, and discouraging potential passengers \nfrom choosing Amtrak.\n  This is a formula for failure, not a plan to make Amtrak self-\nsufficient or to secure the place of passenger in our country's \ntransportation system.\n  Mr. President, we are all working toward an Amtrak which operates \nwithout a Federal operating subsidy, which provides quality service, \nand which is financially stable. Amtrak now covers approximately 80 \npercent of its operating costs with self-generated revenue, up from 48 \npercent in 1981. Yet we also know that no intercity rail passenger \nservice anywhere in the world operates without some degree of public \nsector financial support.\n  Investment in all modes of transportation is important, but we have \ngone about it in a lopsided way. Purchasing power for Federal highway \nprograms has increased by 48 percent from 1982 to 1996. It has \nincreased 78 percent for aviation, but has decreased 46 percent for \npassenger rail. In fact, Amtrak currently receives less than 3 percent \nof all Federal transportation spending. To attain balance, we must \nbalance our financial support to all transportation components, \nincluding passenger rail service.\n  Capital funding is necessary for Amtrak's future. New capital \ninvestments will allow Amtrak to operate more efficiently. With new \nequipment, Amtrak will attract substantial new ridership with increased \nrevenues. It currently costs Amtrak $60 million per year to operate and \nmaintain its old equipment, which frequently breaks down and often \nrequires parts to be specially made.\n  As many Members in the Senate are aware, I am working to provide a \ndedicated source of capital funding for Amtrak. The Senate has \noverwhelmingly supported my legislation that would give Amtrak one-half \ncent for capital expenditures. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able \nto pass this legislation into law. However, I will continue to work \nhard and make these speeches until this legislation is passed.\n  Amtrak cannot survive without capital funding. If we do not provide \nfunding for Amtrak, we will have no other option but to watch Amtrak \ncollapse. This amendment does not move us in the right direction. If \nthis Congress wants a national passenger rail system, it will continue \nto vote for capital funding for Amtrak.\n  I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the return of the distinguished \nchairman of the committee and the subcommittee. I really do not have \nanything more to add to this debate. I would be glad to discuss it \nfurther if the Senator from Oregon desires.\n  However, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time at any \ntime that is convenient for the distinguished manager of the bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the side of the Senator from New Jersey, 7 \nminutes 32 seconds; and on the other side, 7 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thought I heard the Senator from Arizona yield \nback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He made an offer to the Senator from Oregon \nthat was not responded to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will take such time as remains out \nof the time that I have to make a couple of points.\n  We hear that the subsidy for passenger rail service is an egregious \npurpose, something that ought not be done, and we talk about the \nsubsidy per passenger.\n  However, we neglect to talk about the fact that there is over $2 \nbillion a year that goes into maintaining FAA's services. That has \nnothing to do with the trust fund. That is out of the taxpayers' \npocket--$2 billion a year. Those who are paying into the trust fund by \nvirtue of a ticket tax, when that is operating, pay into the fund when, \nin fact, they may not use a particular routing or particular region \nwhen they pay that tax.\n  If we start to cut up the country into how much did you pay for how \nmuch service--I think the Senator from Delaware made the point very \nclearly when he described the need to subsidize water projects, \nirrigation projects, and flood control projects out West. It is a very \ndivisive approach, I think, to what this country of ours is supposed to \nbe as a single nation.\n  Just to remind those who are concerned about what would happen if we \ndid not have the Amtrak service that is now available--those services \nwould not be available, I assure you, if we further diminish the \nassistance that the Federal Government gives to Amtrak. Yes, the needs \nhave been miscalculated over the years. Yes, they have grown \nsubstantially. But so has the population. The population of the country \nhas grown significantly. To no one's surprise, much of that population \ngrowth is in the urban areas where rail is an essential factor.\n  Here we fail to recognize that passenger rail service is part of a \nbalanced transportation structure that we need in a society in a \ncountry as large as ours.\n  Commuter lines in States like Rhode Island, Connecticut, \nMassachusetts, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey all use \nNortheast corridor lines that are owned by Amtrak. They have to \nfunction; otherwise, the costs for commuting would increase \nsubstantially, or maybe they would not be able to function altogether.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will defeat this amendment. I think it is \nvery short-sighted and neglects to recognize what the needs of this \ncountry are, at a time when we are straining with every mode of \ntransportation, including aviation, including highways, and including \nrail. We are underinvested in transportation infrastructure and we have \nto continue to plow ahead, whether we like it or not, if we are to be a \nmobile society, operating with as much efficiency as we can.\n  Mr. President, I note Chairman Hatfield is here on the floor, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator from Arizona indicated to me he would be \nwilling to yield back his time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am willing to yield back the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, has the Senator from Arizona yielded \nback his time?\n\n[[Page S9141]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to table the McCain amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 5132 offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Frahm] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate be in order.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would just like to report to the \nSenate we have a few amendments yet, perhaps about 20, that we have to \ndispose of tonight. We will have rollcalls on some of them. There is no \nwindow. We are going to complete them. We had the window this afternoon \nfor an hour and 10 minutes when Senator Lautenberg and I were ready to \ndo business and nobody appeared. That was our window. So we will \ncontinue straight through now until we finish.\n  Mr. President, I would ask now that I may yield to Senator McCain for \n2 minutes and then the Senator from Ohio, [Mr. DeWine], has an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for setting a \ndate certain for us to bring up the important and compelling issues \nconcerning aviation safety and strengthening airport security.\n  We know how important this issue is to the American people. I had \nintended earlier to bring up some of the provisions of that bill as an \namendment on this appropriations bill, something I do not like to do. \nThe majority leader has assured us he will bring this up on a date \ncertain in September, and I believe that is a very important. I know my \ncolleagues are in agreement with me as to how important it is to bring \nup these issues. We have to strengthen airport security. We have to \nimprove aviation safety in America. It is an obligation we have to all \nof our citizens.\n  I hope in September, when we bring up this issue, we will be able to \nact on it quickly. I intend to work with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to develop a set of amendments under the leadership of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler, who \nhas played a key and vital role in all of this legislation.\n  Finally, I thank the 17 brave souls who voted with me on the last \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5133\n\n(Purpose: To provide funds and incentives for closures of rail-highway \n                               crossings)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself, Mr. Lugar, \n     and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 5133.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Section 120(c) of title 23, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting ``rail-highway crossing \n     closure,'' after ``carpooling and vanpooling,''.\n       (b) Section 130 of such title is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(i) Incentive Payments for At-Grade Crossing Closures.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this section and subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a State \n     may, from sums available to the State under this section, \n     make incentive payments to local governments in the State \n     upon the permanent closure by such governments of public at-\n     grade rail-way-highway crossings under the jurisdiction of \n     such governments.\n       ``(2) Incentive payments by railroads.--A State may not \n     make an incentive payment under paragraph (1) to a local \n     government with respect to the closure of a crossing unless \n     the railroad owning the tracks on which the crossing is \n     located makes an incentive payment to the government with \n     respect to the closure.\n       ``(3) Amount of state payment.--The amount of the incentive \n     payment payable to a local government by a State under \n     paragraph (1) with respect to a crossing may not exceed the \n     lesser of--\n       ``(A) the amount of the incentive payment paid to the \n     government with respect to the crossing by the railroad \n     concerned under paragraph (2); or\n       ``(B) $7,500.\n       ``(4) Use of state payments.--A local government receiving \n     an incentive payment from a State under paragraph (1) shall \n     use the amount of the incentive payment for transportation \n     safety improvements.''.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this amendment is being offered by myself, \nSenator Lugar, and Senator Biden, and it really is a fairly simple \namendment.\n  First of all, it costs no money.\n  Second, it gives States more tools, more flexibility to deal with a \nvery serious problem in this country, and that problem is that each \nyear we lose over 500 people who are killed in collisions between \nautomobiles and trains. In fact, the figure last year was 559 people--\n559 people died last year in auto-train accidents, 36 of them in my \nhome State of Ohio.\n  In preparing this amendment, and having some understanding of the \nproblem going back to my time as Lieutenant Governor in Ohio when I \nworked on this problem, I put together a meeting in my office where we \nbrought together all the experts in this field. They sat down for 2, \n2\\1/2\\ hours and discussed this. Then they got together again. One of \nthe ideas they came up with is contained in this amendment.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is a simple one. It would make America's \nrailroad crossings a lot safer--500 people are killed each year in \nthese train-vehicle collisions. Fifty percent of these accidents occur \nat crossings that are already equipped with active warning devices--50 \npercent. So simply adding more warning devices, therefore, is not a \ncomplete solution to the problem.\n  Some of these railroad crossings are just simply too dangerous. They \nare life-threatening. They are not needed, and they ought to be closed. \nWe all know though from our own experience that people do become \naccustomed to taking certain routes and communities get used to certain \ntraffic patterns. That is why it is sometimes very difficult for \nlocalities to close these crossings, for local officials to make this \ndecision, even when it is clear on safety grounds that a particular \ncrossing simply needs to be closed.\n  Clearly, the local communities need some help, and that is the \npurpose of\n\n[[Page S9142]]\n\nthis amendment. Again, this idea did not come from me. This idea came \nfrom the safety experts who have looked at this, both in government and \noutside of government.\n  Currently, the Federal Government pays 90 percent of the cost of \nclosing a railroad highway grade crossing, but other grade crossing \nsafety projects, such as traffic signs, guard rails and traffic lights, \nare eligible for 100 percent Federal funding.\n  My amendment will make grade crossing closure projects eligible for \nthat same 100 percent Federal funding. This will help remove the \ncurrent incentive against closure projects. Let me emphasize, this is a \nState decision that will be made by the State, and that is out of the \nsame pot of money. No additional funds will be utilized. If the safest \nthing to do is to close a very dangerous railroad crossing, localities \nshould have an incentive to do that.\n  Let me again point out this amendment does not involve new Federal \nmoney. The CBO says no additional contract authority would be \nnecessary. The money for this amendment is already allocated for \ncrossing safety purposes, for the very purpose we are talking about. \nAll we are trying to do in this amendment, Senator Lugar, Senator Biden \nand myself, is to deploy that money in the most rational and effective \nway. Again, that decision is being made by the local authorities.\n  The second part of my amendment provides up to $7,500--again, out of \nthe same pot of money--to a local highway authority for each crossing \nclosed. Mr. President, $7,500 is an incentive to that local community \nif the State decides that is the best way to spend this money.\n  Furthermore, the railroad itself that is operating the crossing under \nthis amendment has to match the money. This means up to $15,000 for a \nlocal community to close a railroad crossing. In other words, it \ncreates an incentive to get the job done.\n  Safety does not come about by accident. It comes about when concerned \npeople exercise the necessary level of prudence and the necessary level \nof vigilance. I have been working with the railroads, with the Federal \nRailroad Administration and with the Federal Highway Administration on \nthese issues for some time now, and I believe this amendment embodies a \ncommonsense approach to this very real issue of railroad safety. Mr. \nPresident, we have worked with the Federal Railroad Administration to \ndevelop this amendment, and the amendment has been endorsed by the \nAssociation of American Railroads.\n  In conclusion, let me summarize again, this costs no additional \nFederal dollars. Every safety expert that we have consulted says this \nis the thing to do. It is the most cost-effective way to preserve \nlives. We can close these railroad crossings, frankly, at a fraction of \nthe cost to install the gates and the flashers. They cost anywhere \nbetween $130,00 and $135,000, and it takes some time to get them \ninstalled.\n  This amendment will provide more flexibility to the States to deal \nwith this hazard. It has the endorsement of all the safety experts, as \nwell as Senator Biden, Senator Lugar and myself. And, Mr. President, if \nwe needed any other incentive to pass this amendment, let me just hold \nthis chart up. This is a listing for the most immediate year available. \nThis is 1995: ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Statistics by State.'' I \ndid not have time to have this blown up, but I am going to read a \ncouple of these, if I could. It has every State. If any Members want to \nsee how many fatalities occurred in their home States, they can do \nthat. South Carolina, just last year, 111 accidents, 61 injuries, 6 \nfatalities. Looking at the State of California, 191 accidents last \nyear, 69 injuries, 28 fatalities. We go on and on and on.\n  This is a very simple amendment. It is no cost to taxpayers and gives \nmore flexibility to States, to people who have to make the decisions to \nspend the finite dollars to try to save lives. I believe this amendment \nwill save lives, and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Ohio will \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I certainly will.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. As the Senator knows, we have a strict position, known \nhere, that we do not accept legislation on appropriations unless it is \ncleared by the authorizing committee chairman and ranking member. We \nhave accommodated Senators where they have cleared that with the \nauthorizing committee, but this is not in our jurisdiction. I am asking \nthe question as to whether or not the Senator has had clearance from \nthe Environment and Public Works chairman and the ranking member.\n  Mr. DeWINE. We do not have any direct clearance. If I could finish my \nanswer? The reality is, this is the only train that is moving. If we do \nnot have the opportunity to put it in now, the Senator is well aware it \nis not going to happen for months and months and months. It is such a \nsimple amendment. I have found no one who, on the substance, is opposed \nto it. I cannot find anyone opposed to it. That is why we are looking \nat this as the opportunity to, frankly, save some lives and give the \nlocal communities the flexibility they need. It is of such a \nnoncontroversial nature, that is why I am here.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I agree the amendment is very meritorious, but it does \nnot comply with our rules. I will have to move to table this and reject \nit as such. I would prefer to have, maybe, the amendment temporarily \nset aside until you can confer with our two colleagues who are the \nauthorizers. If they clear it, we will accept the amendment.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will be more than happy to temporarily set aside the \nconsideration of the amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  Has the Senator made the request to temporarily lay aside his \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I was \ndistracted for a moment. I would like to be recognized in my own right \nto make a few comments about the amendment being offered by the Senator \nfrom Ohio. I ask that I be added as a cosponsor.\n  What was the suggestion of the managers of the bill? What was the \nunanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The request was to temporarily lay aside the amendment \nuntil the Senator from Ohio conferred with the authorizing leadership, \nand then to turn to the next amendment to be offered once it is \ntemporarily laid aside, which is the Exon-Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Ohio has agreed to withdraw his amendment?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I have agreed to temporarily lay it aside with the \nunderstanding the amendment will continue to pend.\n  Mr. EXON. I simply ask the Senator from Ohio, I would like to be a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  I remind the Senate, and the managers of the bill, this Senator \noffered a five-point program last year with regard to grade crossings. \nThree of the five were accepted and are now part of the law. The two \nthings that were not agreed to, basically on that side of the aisle, \nlast year are now incorporated in the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  So I congratulate him for his leadership in this area. I simply \nremind all we should have done this last year. I hope we can do it this \nyear in some form. So I thank my friend from Ohio. I am very pleased to \nbe added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is to set the amendment aside. Is \nthere objection?\n  Without objection, the Senator from Nebraska is added as a cosponsor.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5134\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the Surface Transportation Board from increasing \n                               user fees)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Conrad, Senator Harkin, and Senator Exon. I send the amendment \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Conrad, Mr. Exon, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5134.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S9143]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On line 12 on page 41 after the semicolon, insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That none of the funds \n     appropriated in this Act or otherwise made available may be \n     used to increase fees for services in connection with \n     licensing and related service fees, pursuant to 49 CFR Part \n     1002, STB Ex Parte No. 542, for services in connection with \n     rail maximum rate complaints,''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Conrad and Senator Exon is an amendment that \ndeals with the fees charged by the Surface Transportation Board for the \nfiling of a complaint by a shipper, a farmer or a grain elevator that \nmight feel is necessary to file against a railroad company that is \novercharging.\n  We have largely deregulated the railroad companies in this country. \nWe have abolished the Interstate Commerce Commission and established \nthe Surface Transportation Board. The question is, Where does a farmer \nor a grain elevator or some other small shipper go when they feel that \nthe railroad is overcharging them? They file a complaint, under the \ncurrent circumstances, with the new Surface Transportation Board.\n  Previously, when a shipper was to file a complaint, they would be \nrequired to pay a $1,000 fee in order to file a complaint against a \nrailroad company saying, ``This railroad company is overcharging. I am \ncomplaining and want a hearing and want some facts to be developed, and \nI want a judgment about my complaint.'' So they would file a complaint \nand pay a $1,000 fee.\n  The Surface Transportation Board issued a proposal, under the \nadministration's directive to increase user fees.\n  The Surface Transportation Board proposed to increase the fees from \n$1,000 to $23,000, roughly, for those who file a complaint against a \nrailroad company.\n  They are saying that if you are a family farmer or you are a small \ngrain elevator or machinery and equipment dealer and you have a \ncomplaint against a big railroad company--and most of them are big--in \norder to file that complaint, instead of paying a $1,000 fee, we are \ngoing to increase it to a $23,000 fee.\n  Some of us happen to think that that is way out of line--not just out \nof line but way out of line--and we do not believe the Surface \nTransportation Board ought to do that.\n  I have talked to the Chair of the Surface Transportation Board, \nsomeone for whom I have great respect. I think she is doing a good job. \nShe said, ``Well, we were told that we were going to have to find our \nmoney from fees, so we had to put out a schedule.''\n  My expectation is they will not come up with those kind of fees in \ntheir final determination. But what we want to make sure of today is, \nin an era of deregulation of railroads where you have very large \nsignificant concentrations of economic power, that that economic power \nis not wielded against small shippers in a punitive way.\n  We believe small shippers ought to be able to make a complaint \nagainst a predatory pricing practice on the part of a railroad company \nwithout having to fork over $23,000. All that means is a lot of small \nshippers are told, ``You don't have the ability to file a complaint \nanymore. There is no way for you to complain against a railroad because \nwe are pricing you out of existence. You can't afford to complain.''\n  What this amendment that I have offered on behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues does is it says:\n\n       . . . none of the funds appropriated in this Act or \n     otherwise made available may be used to increase fees for \n     services in connection with licensing and related service \n     fees pursuant to 49 CFR Part 102, STB Ex Parte No. 542, for \n     services in connection with rail maximum rate complaints.\n\n  Very simply, we are saying you cannot increase the fees for small \nshippers who are going to make a complaint against the railway \ncompanies. You cannot increase them from $1,000 to $23,000, not from \n$1,000 to $13,000. You cannot increase them.\n  We happen to think in this age where we have deregulated the railroad \ncompanies, where we have a significant concentration of economic power \nthat it is fundamentally unfair to small shippers, especially as I \nmentioned to farmers and grain elevators, to say to them, We have \nallowed them to concentrate economic power, and when they overcharge \nyou, you are going to have to fork over $23,000 if you feel like you \nneed to complain about it.\n  Some of us say it is fundamentally unfair. We will not stand for it. \nWe want the Senate to be on record to say none of those funds will be \nused for those fees. There are other fees they can charge. They can \nincrease them. I am not here complaining about that. That is a decision \nthey can make, but at least with respect to these fees, with respect to \nsmall shippers who make complaints about these railways, I say let's \nfreeze these fees and let's not price those folks out of the ability to \nmake complaints against railway companies who overcharge.\n  Let me make a final point. I come from a part of the country that has \nhad some experience with railroads. I come from North Dakota where a \nso-called ``prairie fire,'' which was a political fire, began in the \nearly 1900's. The controversy was about banks and railroads and big \ngrain millers taking advantage of our farmers. Big interests with large \nconcentrations of economic power that were taking money from the \npockets of our farmers.\n  That created a populist prairie fire out in my part of the country \nthat said, ``We're not going to stand for it.'' Those folks in the \nearly 1900's would not have stood for this, and we should not stand for \nit in 1996 either.\n  Mr. President, let me yield the floor and have the Senator from \nNebraska speak on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Iowa [Mr. Harkin] be added as a cosponsor to the amendment just \noffered by my friend and colleague from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for a \nvery thoughtful amendment that is vitally important if you understand \nthe peril, or the potential peril, maybe is a better word for it, that \nsmall shippers find themselves in today.\n  There probably has been no one in the U.S. Senate today who has spent \nmore time and effort in committee and on the floor with regard to \nrailroad matters generally, including grade crossing safety. I fought \nvery hard for the Interstate Commerce Commission. When it was obvious \nthat was not going to prevail for long, I was one of the leading \nproponents of the Surface Transportation Board that was created under \nthe Department of Transportation.\n  I simply say, from experience and looking into the future, myself and \nothers as original cosponsors have had firsthand experience with the \nsituation that could affect particularly small carriers.\n  The most important work of the Surface Transportation Board is to \nprotect consumers from unfair, unjust, and unreasonable rates or \nactions by the railroads. I mention specifically captive shippers. \nCaptive shippers are those who are captive because they have no other \nway to move their products or their goods or their livestock or their \ngrain.\n  So simply put, what this amendment does is to say that if you are a \nsmall shipper, you cannot be charged as originally suggested in a \npreliminary announcement of fees by the Surface Transportation Board.\n  The Senator from North Dakota touched on this, Mr. President. I \nemphasize it a little bit more. If somebody files a complaint against a \nrailroad, the railroad has a whole stable of attorneys who are willing, \nready, and able to act in their behalf.\n  Actually, unless we adopt an amendment like this, for all practicable \npurposes, if the fees are set too high, that small shipper, that \ncaptive shipper, that grain elevator, that small company out there \ncould not afford to file a complaint even if he had full justification \nfor doing so.\n  So I simply say that railroads need some supervision. There needs to \nbe, especially for small and captive shippers, the right to appeal when \nthey think they are being unfairly treated by the railroads. The \nSurface Transportation Board is the successor in this area to the \nInterstate Commerce Commission.\n\n[[Page S9144]]\n\n  I think the Senate and the House should be very careful that when we \ntalk about increasing fees, we do not allow the Surface Transportation \nBoard arbitrarily to set fees so high that the small businessmen--\ncaptive shipper, grain elevator, farmer, call it what you will--would \nbe discouraged from even making a legitimate complaint.\n  At a time when there is consolidation in the rail sector, rate \noversight by the Surface Transportation Board is the best primary means \nto protect rural shippers, and urban shippers, as well, from a possible \nloss of competition for the captive shippers. It is time to stop the \nannual threat to the consumers of rail transportation.\n  The Surface Transportation Board is all that stands between small \nshippers and captive shippers and the big railroads. I applaud the \nAppropriations Committee for rejecting the user-fee-only proposition to \nfinance the Surface Transportation Board. The Dorgan-Exon, and others, \namendment assures that the rights of rural and urban shippers are not \ncompromised by unfair, high user fees if they file a complaint with the \nSurface Transportation Board.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from North Dakota for offering this \namendment. I urge its adoption. I thank the Chair and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \nby my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon. This amendment \naddresses a very serious concern that was first raised earlier this \nyear when a fee schedule was proposed by the Surface Transportation \nBoard.\n  These fees that were announced earlier this year by that agency \nindicate that sometimes people completely take leave of their senses \nhere in Washington when they have responsibility over an administrative \nfunction. If there was ever an example of an agency going off a cliff \nwith respect to a proposal, these fees by the Surface Transportation \nBoard are a perfect example.\n  Under the proposed fee schedule from earlier this year, the minimum \nfiling fee charged rail users complaining of unlawful railroad actions \nwould have been increased from the current $1,000 to $23,000. Let's \nthink about a small elevator in my home State of North Dakota. They \nhave a grievance. Just to be able to file, they would have been \nexpected to come up with $23,000. Where is the rationale for that? If \nyou are going to ask people to pony up $23,000 just to file a \ncomplaint, there are not going be many complaints filed. That is for \nsure.\n  The unfortunate thing about this is people do not have an \nalternative. If they have not gone through the administrative process, \nthey cannot go to the courts. And to go through the administrative \nprocess, they are told you have to come up with a $23,000 filing fee.\n  Let me just go through some of the other filing fees that the Surface \nTransportation Board proposed earlier this year. The fee for filing a \nformal rate complaint under the so-called stand-alone cost methodology, \nguidelines alleging unlawful rate practices by rail carriers, would \nhave been increased from the current $1,000 to $233,000.\n  Mr. EXON. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. EXON. With that fee schedule that you just outlined right from \nthe Surface Transportation Board paper, how many complaints do you \nthink small businessmen, small elevators, would file out of North \nDakota?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator asks a very good question. I think we could \nbe quite assured that virtually no one would file, probably no one \nwould file. I mean, who is going to pony up $23,000 for an unlawful \nrailroad action case? Who could afford to pay, in the case of a formal \nrate complaint alleging unlawful rates under practices by rail \ncarriers, an increase from $1,000 to--it makes me laugh every time I \nsay it--an increase from $1,000 to $233,000?\n  The cost for seeking a regulatory exemption to construct connecting \nrail lines would have been increased from the current $3,000 to \n$41,700.\n  I am glad this amendment is being offered. Hopefully, it will send a \nmessage.\n  I do commend the Appropriations Committee for providing some funding \nfor the Surface Transportation Board. That is an important provision in \nthis transportation appropriations bill. The Dorgan amendment simply \nensures that there is no possibility the Surface Transportation Board \nwill even consider user fees on the scale of those which were discussed \nearlier this year.\n  Mr. EXON. If I might add a comment. It seems to me that if there is \nthat much money out there to get this job done, we might seize on that \nas a means of balancing the Federal budget in 2 years. I thank my \nfriend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. He makes a very good \npoint. Unfortunately, earlier this year the Surface Transportation \nBoard looked at the budget and the current fee schedule, and somehow \nbelieved the agency could become self-sufficient by just raising fees. \nUnfortunately, this proposed fee schedule did not recognize that \nagricultural shippers, with legitimate complaints that they need to get \nadjudicated, could be completely left out of the process because of the \nsteep fees which were being proposed.\n  Nobody would be coming before the Surface Transportation Board, or \nvirtually no one, because who could afford, just to have a complaint \nadjudicated, to pay $23,000, much less $233,000, or to deal with the \nquestion of construction of connecting rail lines, $41,000? I mean, \nthese are not reasonable.\n  Hopefully, this amendment will pass and there will be no possibility \nof these particular fee increases taking place. I want to thank my \ncolleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, for offering this \namendment with the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon. I am pleased to \njoin them in this effort. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was just asked a series of questions by the manager of \nthe bill and the ranking member. I thought maybe I could address those \nbecause I think there are some misunderstandings about this.\n  It is true that the Surface Transportation Board produced a schedule \nthat said, where as we used to charge $1,000 as a fee in order to make \ncomplaint against a railroad for unfair pricing, if we are required to \nraise all of our funds from fees, we will now charge $23,100 instead of \n$1,000. If you are complaining about the coal rates, we will go from \n$1,000 to $233,000 as a filing fee and so on and so on.\n  The ranking member made the point to me just now, well, we have \nincreased appropriations or actually produced appropriations of some \n$12 million in this bill for the Surface Transportation Board and, \ntherefore, they will not have to raise all of this money from fees. It \nis absolutely correct.\n  That $12 million has been appropriated. They will not have to raise \nthat from fees. They will have to raise several millions of dollars \nfrom fees. The question is, how will they get that several million \ndollars? There are a wide range of fees from which to choose. Will they \ndecide, with respect to those who want to file a complaint against a \nrailroad company for unfair pricing, that that fee should go from \n$1,000 to $2,000, $1,000 to $5,000, $1,000 to $15,000, $1,000 to \n$23,000? I do not have the foggiest idea.\n  My amendment says, it shall go from $1,000 to $1,000. The fee is now \n$1,000 and the fee will be $1,000 if you feel like you need to file a \ncomplaint against a railroad company for unfair pricing.\n\n  Mr. President, we do not have an Interstate Commerce Commission in \nAmerica anymore. I never thought I would mourn its passing, and I am \nnot sure I do now, because I used to think it was one of the few \nagencies in Washington, DC, that had died from the neck up. However, \ndespite the fact the ICC, in my judgment, was relatively worthless as \nan agency, sat around with a giant ink pad and a giant rubber stamp, \nand whatever the railroads wanted, they stamped OK. There was a guy \nnamed ``OK Alan'' that was talked about down in a Southern State, the \nGovernor of a Southern State, because he said OK to everything. It was \nthe ``OK-ICC Commission.''\n  I never thought I would mourn its passage, but when we deregulated \nthe\n\n[[Page S9145]]\n\nrailroad industry and people said get rid of the ICC, there was a \ndiscussion that maybe there should be some referee deciding when and if \nthere are predatory or unfair pricing practices by the railroads, that \nmaybe the folks who are having their pockets picked by that have some \nopportunity to file a complaint.\n  So the Surface Transportation Board was created. As I mentioned, I \nhave a fair amount of confidence in the chair of that board, and I do \nnot believe they would increase rates, as they published, from $1,000 \nto $23,000. But I will make sure with my amendment that they do not \nwith respect to complaints against the rails.\n  I am joined with the Senator from Nebraska and my colleague from \nNorth Dakota and others to say to those who need to file a complaint \nagainst the railroads, they ought to be able to file that complaint \nwith a filing of $1,000, and it ought not to be doubled, tripled, or \nincreased 23 times. This amendment says, ``Freeze it where it is.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the minority leader, \nthe Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] be added as a cosponsor to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The modification was made necessary in order to reach an \nagreement with the authorizing committee. Both the majority and the \nminority have agreed with the amendment as it is modified, and I am \ntold it will be acceptable, then, to the Senator from Oregon and the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I urge adoption.\n  Mr. EXON. It would be the same cosponsors?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, might I say that the modification is \npurely technical. The amendment is identical to the amendment I offered \npreviously, but we rearranged the words because there needed to be a \ntechnical change.\n  The modification is offered with the same cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n       ``Sec.  . (a) Applicable Laws.--Section 24301 of Title 49, \n     United States Code, as amended by Section 504 of this Act, is \n     amended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n       `` `(q) Power Purchases.--The sale of power to Amtrak for \n     its own use, including operating its electric traction \n     system, does not constitute a direct sale of electric energy \n     to an ultimate consumer under section 212(h)(1) of the \n     Federal Power Act.'\n       ``(b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 212(h)(2)(A) of the \n     Federal Power Act is amended by inserting `Amtrak;' after `a \n     State or any political subdivision);'.''\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5135.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment was a consequence of \ndiscussions held in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee among \nthe staff of the majority with regard to the dilemma surrounding Amtrak \nand the high cost of power that Amtrak is subjected to in the Northeast \ncorridor where most of the rail line is electrified. As a consequence \nof the efforts to try and help Amtrak to reduce its costs, this \namendment was suggested by Amtrak.\n  Mr. President, it is an extraordinary set of circumstances here when \nwe consider that the potential cost of power wheeled in for the \navailability of Amtrak could be as low as 3 cents, yet Amtrak is \ncurrently paying in many cases 6 cents and, in extreme cases, up to 12 \ncents from a power-producing facility in New York State that is in \nbankruptcy. These are the result of State public utility commissions \nand the overall regulatory complexity associated with the jurisdiction \nof the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as compared to State public \nutility commissions. These need to be examined.\n  What this amendment does, Mr. President, is to allow the FERC to \norder retail wheeling for Amtrak only, something which is currently \nprohibited under Federal law. It would exempt, therefore, Amtrak from \nthe prohibition which prevents them from taking advantage of cheaper \nsources of power that would be transmitted from potential out-of-State \npower suppliers.\n  The purpose, again, of this amendment is simply to allow Amtrak to \nacquire electric power at a cheaper rate than it is currently paying. \nAs we all know, Amtrak is not a private company but a quasi-\ngovernmental entity created by an act of Congress in 1970. Its stock is \nowned by the Federal Government. Congress mandated its mission and \nlikewise imposes by Federal law a host of obligations and costs on \nAmtrak, costs that no regular private company is burdened with. Yet, \neach year Amtrak's losses are made up through a Federal subsidy.\n  In fiscal year 1996, Amtrak's Federal subsidy was $285 million, thus, \nthis amendment would result in a savings to Amtrak that translates into \nabout $20 million a year. That is a savings to the U.S. taxpayer that \nsubsidizes Amtrak.\n\n  What we have done, Mr. President, in Congress is put Amtrak between \nthe proverbial rock and a hard place. Congress has given Amtrak a \nmandate to decrease its reliance on Federal operating support. The \nHouse and Senate Amtrak authorization bills and the budget resolution \nproposed to end all operating support of Amtrak in the year 2001. What \nare we going to do with that? Are we going to adhere to that? Are we \ngoing to extend it and try and find ways to help Amtrak reduce its \ncost? The point is, we have not relieved Amtrak from its statutory \nobligation and, at the same time, we are taking away its Federal \noperating subsidy.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment not in the expectation that it \nis going to be adopted. I offer this amendment to point out the need to \nmove the\n\n[[Page S9146]]\n\nelectric power industry from its current highly regulated, highly \ninefficient situation into a fully competitive, deregulated marketplace \nso that Amtrak, along with industrial and residential consumers, can \npurchase electricity at the lowest possible price. That is what \nderegulation is all about.\n  How we get there from here is a very difficult and complex problem. \nAs chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I \nrecognize it, and I have had some conversations, as late as this \nevening, with Senator Johnston, who is concerned about the issue as \nwell. And to the question of how we address it, of course, is an issue \nwithin the jurisdiction of our committee.\n  The Energy Committee has held three hearings this year on the issue \nof competitive change in the electric power industry. We intend to hold \nmore. We want to assure everybody that we recognize that the electric \nindustry in this country--a very, very important and significant \nindustry--is not broke by any means. So it is not a question of fixing \nit in the sense of fixing what is not wrong with it. It is more an \neffort to try and recognize that by directing more attention to local \nand State control, with the assurance that we have the availability of \nwheeling coming in to address cost and efficient producers and somehow \ntry and address that narrow area of what we are going to do to protect \nthose that have stranded costs. That is the challenge before us.\n  We have an inequity associated with Amtrak. While there is no \nconsensus as to the means for how to make the electric power industry \ncompetitive, there is a consensus as to the need for making it \ncompetitive.\n  So what we have to do is address the inconsistencies associated with \nthe industry. We want to have competition, which will benefit \nconsumers--residential consumers, commercial consumers, industrial \nconsumers and, yes, Amtrak. This amendment is but a small piece of a \nmuch larger puzzle. The Amtrak issue, along with a host of other \nelectric power issues, such as the privatization of the Federal Power \nMarketing Administration, will be the subject of our legislative \ninterests in the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, while it is my expectation that we will undertake \ncomprehensive electric deregulation legislation next year, it should \nnot be taken to mean that we should not proceed this year with Senator \nD'Amato's PUHCA reform legislation, of which I am a cosponsor. It has \nbeen ordered reported by the Banking Committee, and the Senate should \ntake this legislation up at the earliest possible time.\n  Mr. President, I am going to withdraw the amendment as a consequence \nof the recognition that, clearly, this is not the time or the place to \nresolve the wheeling issue for Amtrak. But I hope there is now \nattention to the inequity associated with Amtrak, and a realization \nthat we are forcing this entity to purchase power far beyond the \ncompetitive marketplace that exists, which puts an unfair and \nunrealistic burden and a responsibility right back with us in the \nrealization that it is the taxpayers that are subsidizing this quasi-\ngovernment entity, or its shortfall, when indeed there are \nopportunities out there for Amtrak to buy power at a competitive rate \nand reduce the Federal subsidy by as much as $20 million a year. And \ncurrent savings can easily be identified as a consequence of prevailing \nrates that are in existence at this time. Unless anybody cares to talk \non the amendment, or ask me questions, I am prepared to withdraw the \namendment at this time. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. There was a Senator who was planning to be here, but he \nis not able to be here. I yield to the Senator to withdraw the \namendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am checking on some other matters \nhere. But I believe that it is now the Democratic side of the aisle \nthat is going to offer an amendment. We are alternating back and forth.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what we are attempting to do is to get \nto that finite list, and that is in the process now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5136\n\n      (Purpose: To provide for loan guarantees under the Railroad \n           Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Pressler and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mr. Pressler, \n     for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Exon, Mr. Harkin, and Mrs. Boxer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5136.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 2, strike ``$4,158,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,000,000''.\n       On page 5, line 17, strike ``$132,499,000'' and insert \n     ``$129,5000,000''.\n       On page 26, line 8, strike ``1997.'' and insert ``1997, \n     except for up to $75,000,000 in loan guarantee commitments \n     during such fiscal year (and $4,158,000 is hereby made \n     available for the cost of such loan guarantee \n     commitments).''.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple and straight \nforward. It would provide funding for the section 511 railroad loan \nguarantee program to enable needed rail infrastructure and safety \nimprovements. I am pleased to be joined in this bipartisan effort by \nSenators Lott, Snowe, Exon, and Wyden.\n  Over the years, Congress has often recognized the importance of \nFederal funding assistance for rail infrastructure projects. Federal \nappropriations through such programs as the section 511 program and the \nLocal Rail Freight Assistance [LRFA] Program have enabled the \ncontinuation of rail service for many communities that have been on the \nbrink of losing service. I strongly support initiatives to promote rail \ninfrastructure rehabilitation.\n  The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which \nI chair, has reported legislation to permanently authorize the LRFA \nProgram. To date, this authorizing legislation, S. 1318, the Amtrak and \nLocal Rail Revitalization Act, has not been considered by the full \nSenate. Because I recognize the concerns of some of my colleagues about \nfunding certain expired programs, my amendment only proposes funding \nfor the permanently authorized section 511 program. However, I will \ncontinue to support LRFA reauthorization and funding in future years.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out the House-passed Department of \nTransportation appropriations bill includes $58.86 million for title \nV--section 505--railroad loans. At first glance, I am pleased the House \nrecognizes the importance of funding assistance for freight rail \ninfrastructure. Yet, I am concerned because the entire amount has been \nearmarked for only one project in California. Many equally important \nprojects would be shut out of the process by the House-passed bill. \nThis clearly ignores the national need for rail rehabilitation on light \ndensity rail projects throughout our country. It also is important to \nnote the House approved funding has been allocated to an expired \nFederal loan program.\n  My amendment would provide $4.158 million for section 511 loan \nguarantees. This would permit a loan level of up to $75 million for \nmany legitimate rail projects across our Nation. Further, my amendment \nincludes offsets for this funding from certain administrative \nfunctions. I believe basic infrastructure investment would be a better \nuse of scarce Federal dollars.\n  Mr. President, Federal involvement, while limited, would advance \ntrack and bridge projects planned in Iowa, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, \nOregon, and South Dakota, just to name a few. In turn, rail safety and \neconomic opportunity for these and hundreds of other communities would \nbe promoted. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this amendment offsets $4.1 million for \nthe\n\n[[Page S9147]]\n\nFederal Rail Administration. There is a loan program where $4.1 million \ncan, in effect, leverage $75 million in guaranteed loans. This is \nbasically geared for some of the rail problems in the smaller areas, or \nthe less populated areas.\n  It has been cleared on both sides. It is budget neutral. As I say, it \nhas been offset for that transfer of moneys.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, will the manager yield for a moment?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. There seems to be a question about clearance on our \nside, if we can review that for a couple of minutes. I would be happy \nto then discuss it.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I ask that we temporarily set aside Senator Pressler's \namendment, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I now call up again the Pressler \namendment and ask unanimous consent that Senators Wyden, Exon, Harkin, \nand Boxer be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle. Therefore, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5136) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5137\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send on behalf of Senator Kempthorne \nan amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mr. Kempthorne, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5137.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 47 line 13 of H.R. 3675, strike ``$5,000,000'' and \n     insert ``$15,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this is an amendment by Senator \nKempthorne that is budget neutral. It moves $5 million up to $15 \nmillion for national trail rehabilitation, which particularly suffered \ngreat damage in the Pacific Northwest during the floods of recent \ntimes. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5137) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5138\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the issuance, implementation, or enforcement of \n        certain regulations relating to fats, oils, and greases)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment on behalf of Senator \nPressler to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mr. Pressler, \n     for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Lott, Mr. Bond, \n     and Mr. Lugar, proposes an amendment numbered 5138.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . LIMITATION ON FUNDS USED TO ENFORCE REGULATIONS \n                   REGARDING ANIMAL FATS AND VEGETABLE OILS.\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by \n     the Coast Guard to issue, implement, or enforce a regulation \n     or to establish an interpretation or guideline under the \n     Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act (Public Law 104-55) or the \n     amendments made by that Act does not recognize and provide \n     for, with respect to fats, oils, and greases (as described in \n     that Act or the amendments made by that Act) differences in--\n       (1) physical, chemical, biological, and other relevant \n     properties; and\n       (2) environmental effects.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, earlier this year Congress passed the \nEdible Oil Regulatory Reform Act. That measure which became Public Law \n104-55 was long overdue.\n  The Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act addresses how Federal agencies \nregulate the shipment of edible oils, as compared with toxic oils. They \nrequire that agencies make a distinction between these two kinds of \noils. This is extremely important to U.S. agricultural exports. Without \nPublic Law 104-55, farmers faced a potential loss in agricultural \nexports and diminished farm income.\n  The law is simple and very straight-forward. Unfortunately, the Coast \nGuard continues to issue regulations that do not comply with Public Law \n104-55. The Coast Guard has issued regulations that do not provide \nrelief to the oilseed industry due to the differentiation between \nshipments of edible oilseeds and shipments of toxic oils, such as \npetroleum.\n  Mr. President, the kind of enforcement found in the Coast Guard \nregulations was never congressional intent. The amendment that I, and \nSenators Harkin, Grassley, Lott, and Bond are offering today would \nprevent the Coast Guard from using funds to issue, implement, or \nenforce regulations or establish an interpretation or guideline that do \nnot differentiate animal fats and vegetable oils from toxic oils. This \namendment does not change the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 as it relates \nto toxic oils.\n  Without action, the Coast Guard regulations could inadvertently \ndiminish U.S. agricultural exports. In addition, existing regulations \ncould have a chilling effect on the development of new crops and new \nuses of crop production.\n  Farm exports are at all time highs. Future exports are expected to \nstay at record levels. The future for oilseeds is equally bright. \nHowever, current Coast Guard regulations could work against this \nprogress. It has become clearly evident that existing regulations would \nseriously impact exports of U.S. agricultural commodities, especially \nvegetable oils and animal fats.\n  Unless we pass this amendment, U.S. animal fat and vegetable oil \nindustries would be faced with lost export sales. Public Law 104-55 put \ncommon sense into Federal regulations regarding the shipment of animal \nfats and vegetable oils. The winners out of all this are our farmers \nand ranchers. Unfortunately, we have to pass this amendment to make \nsure that the Coast Guard abides by Federal law and congressional \nintent on this matter. I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this is an amendment, too, that has been \ncleared on both sides. It is an instruction, in effect, to the Coast \nGuard that as it continues its work on regulations of toxic materials, \nit make a differentiation between shipments of edible oilseeds and \nshipments of toxic oils, such as petroleum.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5138) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5139\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send on behalf of Senators Gorton and \nBaucus an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S9148]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mr. Gorton, for \n     himself and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 5139.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) In cases where an emergency ocean condition \n     causes erosion of a bank protecting a scenic highway or \n     byway, FY 1996 or FY 1997 Federal Highway Administration \n     Emergency Relief funds can be used to halt the erosion and \n     stabilize the bank if such action is necessary to protect the \n     highway from imminent failure and is less expensive than \n     highway relocation;\n       (b) In cases where an emergency condition causes inundation \n     of a roadway or saturation of the subgrade with further \n     erosion due to abnormal freeze/thaw cycles and damage caused \n     by traffic, FY 1996 or FY 1997 Federal Highway Administration \n     Emergency Relief funds can be used to repair such roadway.\n       (c) Not more than $8 million in Federal Highway \n     Administration Emergency Relief funds may be used for each of \n     the conditions referenced in paragraphs (a) and (b).\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, along the southwest coast of Washington \nState, Highway 105 runs adjacent to Willapa Bay from Raymond to \nAberdeen and provides an alternative route to Highway 101. While this \nroute serves as the only direct access for residents of the Tokeland \nPeninsula and the Shoalwater Indian Reservation, it also acts as a dike \nprotecting several cranberry bogs, a vital local industry, from \nsaltwater inundation.\n  Unfortunately, the embankment supporting Highway 105 has eroded away \nunder the pressure of the unstable forces in Willapa Bay. Unless \nsomething is done, preliminary engineering studies indicate that under \nexisting conditions, the road will be washed into Willapa Bay, sometime \nwithin the next 2 years. This timeline would obviously be moved up if \nany type of storm hits the Washington coast later this winter. Water, \ntelecommunications, and power utilities located within the highway \nright-of-way would also be severed if the highway is destroyed.\n  If no action is taken to remedy this problem, the estimated loss of \npublic facilities, cranberry bogs, jobs and economic impacts is $82 \nmillion, not including additional socioeconomic impacts. An additional \n$40 million from the Federal Highway Administration Emergency Relief \nfunds would also be required to relocate a new Highway 105.\n  A more appropriate and financially efficient alternative, in my \nopinion, would be to correct this problem before it becomes a reality. \nWhile diagnosing the problem, preliminary engineering studies also \nindicated that the erosion could be slowed considerably by dredging a \nrelief channel in Willapa Bay, which would alter the flow of water that \nis currently undercutting the highway embankment.\n  Officials from the Washington State Department of Transportation are \ncurrently working with representatives from the affected communities to \nresolve this matter, however, funding continues to be the major \nobstacle. This prevention project, including both engineering and \nactual construction costs, would cost $10 million--$8 million from the \nFederal Highway Administration and $2 million in State and local \nmatching funds.\n  I am aware that Congress no longer earmarks money in the Federal \nHighway Administration (FHWA) account of the Transportation \nappropriations bill, and therefore, I believe that the only appropriate \nfunding available is possibly the FHWA Emergency Relief (ER) fund. \nWhile I recognize that this fund is traditionally dedicated to \nrepairing Federal highways once a disaster has occurred, it seems that \ncommon sense dictates using $8 million to prevent a washout rather than \nspending $40 million to replace the road in less than 2 years.\n  I have been working with officials from the Federal Highway \nAdministration, and they are aware of the pending road failure. While \nthey support participating in this prevention project, they believe \nthat legislative authority must be given to allow ER funds to be used \nin this manner. For that reason, my amendment provides legislative \nlanguage in this bill that authorizes the Federal Highway \nAdministration to use up to $8 million in Emergency Relief funds in \norder to prevent complete loss of the existing Highway 105.\n  By allowing these funds to be used in this manner, I estimate that \nthe Federal Government will save approximately $30 million in future \nhighway relocation funds, while also protecting the fragile environment \nand economy of Pacific County in Washington State.\n  In closing, let me thank Chairman Hatfield for his consideration of \nthis matter. Let me also applaud the efforts of the officials in \nPacific County, as well as other individuals in the Washington State \nwho have worked so carefully to ensure that this potential disaster is \naverted.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this provides for definition of \nemergency funding that can be used to relieve the situation in both \nMontana and Washington State. It has been cleared on both sides. It is \nbudget neutral.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is an amendment that, as the \ndistinguished chairman has said, has been cleared by both sides. It is \nan important amendment to the State of Washington and, indeed, to \nSenator Baucus as well. It is a good amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, essentially following up, I thank the \nmanagers for the amendment. There was a natural catastrophe in the \nState of Montana due to abnormal weather. This amendment helps that \nsituation.\n  I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have to reserve the right to object \nuntil we clear a matter here that, frankly, raises concerns. So I am \nsorry to say it, but we do have to take a couple of minutes to check \nthis. Therefore, unless there is somebody else who we are going to go \nto, I would note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I apologize. I was told that it was cleared on both \nsides, I say to my comanager.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, let me return to the Gorton-Baucus \namendment we were discussing a little bit earlier. We now have the \nclearance on the Democratic side, so I urge the adoption of that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5139) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I have an inquiry of the committee \nchairman, the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair. If the chairman will recall, the \ncommittee, at its meeting of July 16, included language in the \nCommittee Report offered by the Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray]. \nThis language concerned significant costs incurred by the mid-Columbia \nhydroelectric projects associated with fish and wildlife mitigation due \nto water releases from upstream Federal facilities and how the impacts \nof such costs to the mid-Columbia projects could be offset. My question \nis this: Should no all upstream project owners incurring the same \ncosts, from the same water releases, be treated the same as the mid-\nColumbia project owners? For example, the Montana Power Co. incurs the \nsame costs at their Kerr project at Flathead Lake and Thompson Falls \nproject on the Clark Fork River due to the large releases from the \nFederal Hungry Horse project. The Washington Water Power Co. incurs the \nsame costs at their Noxon Rapids and Cabinet Gorge projects on the \nClark Fork River due to these same releases from the federally owned \nHungry Horse project. Does the committee also urge the BPA to enter \ninto the same equitable energy exchange with the Montana Power Co. and \nthe Washington Water Power Co.? Their problems with these Federal water \nreleases are the same as those of the mid-Columbia project owners.\n\n[[Page S9149]]\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator from Montana. My answer is that, \n``yes'', all projects incurring the same impacts from the Federal water \nreleases associated with fish and wildlife mitigation should be treated \nthe same. That provision in the report urges BPA to enter into \nequitable energy exchange agreements. Moreover, such agreements should \nnot increase costs for BPA.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator from Oregon, my constituents will be \nvery pleased. Let us hope that Bonneville will faithfully follow the \ncommittee's urging on this matter.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I think we are in sight of the goal line \non this bill. If Members have amendments yet pending or have registered \nin their respective Cloakrooms an intention to offer an amendment by \nthe terms relevant or whatever else, we would like to have them come \nnow because we are down to the last handful of amendments and then \nfinal passage.\n  I do not anticipate any votes on the remaining amendments. I do not \nthink they are that controversial, but I am just making a judgment. We \nare inquiring as to the leadership's view about putting the final \npassage vote over until tomorrow to relieve other Senators who are not \ninvolved in the amendment process. As soon as we get that information, \nI will relay it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5140\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for the Institute of Railroad Safety)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5140.\n       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.  . THE RAILROAD SAFETY INSTITUTE.\n\n       Of the money available to the Federal Rail Administration \n     up to $500,000 shall be made available to establish and \n     operate the Institute for Railroad Safety as authorized by \n     the Swift Rail Development Act of 1994.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this is something that the Senate approved \nlast year. It is a very important matter with regard to railroad \nsafety. The matter has been cleared on both sides, I believe. I urge \nits adoption.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I urge its adoption.\n  The amendment (No. 5140) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair and I thank the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I think we are down now to the last \nthree or four amendments. I hope the Senators who have those \namendments--I could enumerate the Senators by name, but I do not think \nI want to do that at this point--at least will have the courtesy to \ncall the floor and tell us whether they are going to offer their \namendments or not. Is that asking too much? Please, please, make it a \nlittle easier to complete our business here.\n  To the Senators who put a place hold on amendments to the respective \ncloakrooms, at least let us know whether you plan to do it or not. We \nhave contacted some Senators. They say, ``Oh, I'm not going to offer \nthat after all,'' but we have not been informed. I think everybody's \nmother taught them better manners. So much for my lecture. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9118-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMEMORATING THE 80TH BIRTHDAY OF DAVID BRODY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, just moments ago I left a reception for a \nfriend, David Brody. I am very pleased to just rise briefly and \ncommemorate the 80th birthday of one of the most remarkable men who it \nhas been my privilege to know, Mr. David Brody.\n  He is perhaps best known to all of us in the Senate as the ``101st \nSenator,'' which was a characterization appropriately applied to him in \n1989 in a Senate resolution which passed unanimously.\n  That resolution was passed on the occasion of David Brody's so-called \n``retirement'' from the Anti-Defamation League of the B'Nai B'rith. As \nI have previously noted in other remarks, it was most carefully phrased \nso as to avoid any mention of the word ``retirement.''\n  There is nothing ``retiring'' about David Brody--nothing. He remains \nthe essence and embodiment of energy, spirit, enthusiasm, and good will \nwhich he has always been.\n  It has been my personal pleasure on occasion to pay tribute to David \nBrody on the Senate floor, to participate in a retirement ceremony on \nhis behalf several years ago, and most recently on March 11, 1993, on \nthe occasion of the 50th anniversary of the wedding of Bea and David \nBrody. I have informed David that he and I have one thing in common for \nvery certain above all others, and it is that we both ``severely \novermarried.'' The marriage and partnership of Bea and David enriches \nour lives in so many ways, a monument to their boundless love to each \nother, and to the innumerable good works of each of them individually.\n\n  So on David's 80th birthday, I am certain he will have cause to \nreflect on his good fortune in spending evermore time and more than the \n50 years of life wedded to that fine lady. And all of us will have \ncause to reflect upon our own good fortune in having David with us for \nnow 80 years.\n  And our wish for him is that he may have many more years of life to \nsavor. My wife Ann and I wish him Godspeed and all our love. I thank \nthe Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9149-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO DAVID BRODY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming, just a few \nminutes ago, addressed the celebration of the 80th birthday of a friend \nof the U.S. Senate, a friend of most every U.S. Senator, David Brody. \nThere was a celebration of that on the Hill this evening.\n  It is most appropriate that Senators help David Brody celebrate his \n80th birthday because he is so well known, he has been so active on the \nHill, and he has been, in the truest sense of the word, a public-\nspirited person, a person who has been civic-minded about his \nresponsibilities to Government. He has represented a lot of good \ncauses, as he has interacted with Members of the U.S. Senate throughout \nhis career on the Hill.\n  A few years ago, you could have read a newspaper article that stated \nit better than any of us could have. It was about how David Brody is \nrespected. In that newspaper article he was referred to as the 101st \nSenator.\n  So I wish David Brody a happy birthday. I wish him and his wife well \nin the future. Happy birthday.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have just received a letter from the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. C.C. Kruluk.\n  General Kruluk's letter concerns the Marine Corps' request for 12 \nadditional general officers.\n  His letter responds to a letter which I sent to the House conferees \non the fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill.\n  My letter urged the House conferees to hang tough and block the \nSenate proposal to give the Marine Corps 12 more generals.\n  The Senate approved the Marine Corps's request. But the House remains \nopposed to it.\n  So the request for 12 additional generals is a bone of contention in \nthe conference.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the \nconferees and the Commandant's response to it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley:\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I have been provided a copy of the \n     letter you sent to House Conferees concerning the proposal in \n     the Senate Authorization Bill that would give the Marine \n     Corps twelve additional general officers. While this responds \n     to the issues raised in your letter, it has been my desire to \n     meet with you in person to discuss this issue. I understand \n     our staffs have finally worked out a time to do so, and I \n     look forward to meeting with you on Wednesday.\n       Those familiar with the Corps know that we pride ourselves \n     in squeezing the most out of every dollar that you entrust to \n     your Marine Corps. The also know that we don't ask for \n     something unless it is truly needed.\n       The main thrust of your letter is that the number of \n     general officers should be reduced consistent with force \n     structure reductions. Reduction in end strength does not \n     necessarily have a one-to-one correlation with command billet \n     reduction. Permit me to explain. As you have correctly \n     stated, the Marine Corps in 1988 had a total active duty end \n     strength of approximately 198,000, with a general officer \n     population of 70. Today, we have an end strength of 174,000, \n     and a general officer population of 68. That said, please \n     note that the 82nd Congress mandated in Title X that our \n     Corps of Marines be ``so organized as to include not less \n     than three combat divisions and three air wings,''--as it was \n     in 1987, it is so organized today. This point is key: While \n     the Marine Corps has reduced its end strength by 24,000 \n     personnel, its three division, three wing structure has \n     remained essentially unchanged. Those familiar with the \n     military know that the requirement for general/flag officers \n     is tied directly to the number of combat divisions and air \n     wings--and that number has not been reduced. Of the 70 Marine \n     general officers in 1987, 11 were assigned to joint/external \n     billets. Today, 16 of the 68 Marine general officers are \n     serving in joint/external billets. Today we have 52 general \n     officers manning essentially the same structure that was \n     manned by 59 general officers in 1988.\n       Throughout our history, we Marines have prided ourselves in \n     doing more with less. In the past, we have compensated for \n     our general officer shortfall by ``frocking'' officers \n     selected for the next higher grade to fill that position \n     without the pay. While that practice has its own drawbacks, \n     it did provide us with the requisite number of general \n     officers to fill critical shortfalls. Last year, the Senate \n     set increasingly strict limits on the number of general \n     officers that the Services may frock. And I understand their \n     rationale--the practice of frocking simply makes deficiencies \n     in Service grade/billet structure. These shortages are indeed \n     better addressed with permanent fixes rather than the stop-\n     gap measures such as frocking. This restriction on frocking, \n     however, has placed the Marine Corps in an untenable \n     position. Losing six of our nine frocking authorizations \n     means that we would now have 46 general officers manning \n     essentially the same structure that was manned by 60 general \n     officers in 1987. This makes it critical that we have \n     additional general officer allotments.\n       In response to your remark that we are ``simply trying to \n     keep up with the Joneses'' let me offer this: Other Service \n     ratios of general officer to end strength range from one \n     general/flag officer for 1,945 troops to one general/flag \n     officer to 1,435 troops. Excluding the Marine Corps, the \n     Service-wide nominal ratio of one general per 1,620 troops \n     would give the Marine Corps a minimum of 104 general \n     officers. The twelve additional officers that the SASC has \n     provided would give us a total of only 80--hardly keeping up \n     with the Joneses!\n       Finally, this is a matter of providing quality, experienced \n     leadership for our Marines. We are the nation's force in \n     readiness, standing by to go into harm's way to protect U.S. \n     interests globally. Providing these brave Americans with an \n     adequate number of commanders and representation in the joint \n     arena is not just prudent--it is the right thing to do.\n       Senator Grassley, I am convinced that these additional \n     general officer billets serve the best interest of our \n     Services and our national defense. I am also convinced that \n     the solution is not to bring the other Services down to our \n     untenable position, but rather to grant us the minimal \n     increase we need to properly perform those functions Congress \n     has mandated and our nation expects. Our meeting on Wednesday \n     afternoon should be productive--I am looking forward to an \n     honest and open dialogue. Semper Fidelis!\n           Very respectfully,\n                                                      C.C. Krulak,\n     Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 1996.\n       Dear House Conferee: I am writing to encourage you to hang \n     tough and do everything possible to block the Senate proposal \n     that would give the Marine Corps 12 additional general \n     officers.\n       The Senate argues that these additional Marine generals are \n     needed to two reasons: (1) to fill vacant warfighting \n     positions; and (2) to meet the requirements of the joint \n     warfighting area mandated by the Goldwater-Nichols Act.\n       These arguments are nothing but a smoke screen for getting \n     more generals to fill fat headquarters jobs.\n       In 1990, your Committee took a very straightforward, common \n     sense approach to the question of how many general officers \n     were really needed. Your Committee could see the handwriting \n     on the wall. The military was beginning to downsize in \n     earnest. As the force structure shrinks, your Committee said \n     the number of general and flag officers should be reduced. \n     New general officer active duty strength ceilings were \n     established. The total number authorized had been set at \n     1,073 since October 1, 1980. The FY 1991 legislation reduced \n     that number to 1,030 in 1991, including 68 for the Marine \n     Corps. However, based on the projected 25% reduction in the \n     force structure between 1991 and\n\n[[Page S9151]]\n\n     1995, which in fact occurred, the number of general officers \n     authorized to be on active duty was lowered to 858 by October \n     1, 1995, including 61 for the Marine Corps.\n       This is how your Committee explained the decision to cut \n     the number of generals in 1990 (Report 101-665, page 268):\n       ``The Committee believes that the general and flag officer \n     authorized strengths should be reduced to a level consistent \n     with the active force structure reductions expected by fiscal \n     year 1995.''\n       The Senate Armed Services Committee report contained \n     identical language (Report 101-384, page 159). But the Senate \n     committee linked the need for fewer generals directly to a \n     projected 25% reduction in the force structure. In addition, \n     it provided a more detailed justification for the lower \n     ceilings as follows:\n       ``The committee believes that these ceilings should assist \n     the military services in making critical decisions regarding \n     the reduction, consolidation, and elimination of duplicative \n     headquarters. The ceilings should also assist the military \n     services in eliminating unnecessary layering in the staff \n     patterns of general and flag officer positions.''\n       In reviewing your Committee's justification for lowering \n     the general officer ceilings, there is no mention of the need \n     to fill vacant warfighting positions--even though the Gulf \n     War was looming on the horizon. And there was no mention of \n     the need to fill joint billets mandated by Goldwater-Nichols.\n       Your Committee gave only one reason--the right reason--for \n     reducing the number of general officers in 1990: The number \n     of general officers should be reduced consistent with \n     projected force structure reductions.\n       So what has changed since that legislation was adopted six \n     years ago? Why has the Marine Corps fabricated a new \n     rationale for more generals? Nothing has changed. DOD is \n     continuing to downsize, and according to recent testimony by \n     Secretary Perry, that process is expected to continue into \n     the future (refer to page 254 of his Annual Report to \n     Congress). Your guiding principle still applies: As the force \n     structure shrinks, we need fewer general officers. It was \n     valid then. It's still valid today.\n       So why is the Marine Corps trying to topsize when its \n     downsizing? There is no reasonable explanation for giving the \n     Marine Corps 12 extra generals. The extra 12 generals \n     requested this year comes on top of an extra 7 Marine \n     generals authorized just two years ago in special relief \n     legislation.\n       In my mind, the issue boils down to one indefensible point: \n     the Marine Corps is trying to keep up with the Joneses. This \n     is a war over stars. The Marine Corps wants to have as many \n     generals per capita as the other services. This is not the \n     right way to resolve the problem. There is a better way. You \n     should fix it in exactly the same way your Committee fixed it \n     in 1990. You should fix it by giving each service the right \n     number of generals--a number that matches the force \n     structure.\n       I hope that reason prevails on this issue. At a minimum, I \n     think the decision on the extra 12 Marine generals should be \n     delayed until the Inspector General has conducted an \n     independent review of all Department of Defense headquarters, \n     commands, and general officer billets and determined exactly \n     what is necessary based on real military requirements.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to respond to General \nKrulak's letter.\n  This is the main point in his letter, and I quote General Krulak's \nown words:\n\n       The main thrust of your letter is that the number of \n     general officers should be reduced consistent with force \n     structure reductions.\n\n  This is General Krulak talking:\n\n       The reduction in end strength does not necessarily have a \n     one-to-one correlation with command billet reduction.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       This point is key: While the Marine Corps has reduced its \n     end strength by 24,000 personnel, its three division, three \n     wing structure has remained essentially unchanged. Those \n     familiar with the military know that the requirement for \n     general/flag officers is tied directly to the number of \n     combat divisions and air wings--and that number has not been \n     changed.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to respond to General Krulak.\n  First, the suggestion that the number of generals should be reduced \nconsistent with force structure reductions is not a rule dreamed up by \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  The rule was first put forward by the Senate Armed Services Committee \nyears ago.\n  It has been expressed by the House Armed Services Committee.\n  It was the guiding principle used in formulating current law.\n  It is still in current law--section 526 of title 10, United States \nCode.\n  That law places a ceiling on the number of generals and admirals \nallowed on active duty.\n  This is the rule behind the law:\n  As the force structure shrinks, the number of generals and admirals \nshould come down.\n  If the force structure expands, then the number of generals and \nadmirals should go up.\n  That simple, commonsense logic has guided military planners since \ntime began.\n  Second, General Krulak agrees that end strength has fallen.\n  However, he contends that the Marine Corps' combat force remains \nessentially unchanged.\n  Let's briefly review the facts.\n  In fiscal year 1987, Marine end strength was 199,525, including 70 \ngenerals.\n  Today, the fiscal year 1996, there are 172,434 marines, including 68 \ngenerals.\n  While end strength is down and two generals are gone, the Marine \nCorps still has three divisions and three airwings.\n  General Krulak is right about that. The force structure is intact.\n  Unfortunately, it's not whole. Some troops are missing.\n  The end strength is down by 27,091 Marines.\n  If the structure is still there, but some people are gone, that's a \nhollow force, isn't it?\n  Mr. President, is another hollow force creeping out of the Pentagon \nfog?\n  Mr. President, on July 17, I placed a Marine Corps briefing paper in \nthe Record, page S7986.\n  That paper was entitled ``Making the Corps Fit To Fight.'' It was \ndated April 1996.\n  This is what it says:\n  Marine infantry battalions are at 57 percent of authorized \nrequirements for platoon sergeants.\n  If that's true, then the Marine Corps structure is already getting \nhollow.\n  A Marine platoon can't function without a good sergeant.\n  Mr. President, do we need more generals to lead a hollow force?\n  Clearly, a hollow force doesn't demand more generals. Nor does a \nstatic force demand more generals.\n  Only a bigger force demands more generals, and that isn't in the \ncards right now.\n  Third, General Krulak introduces another argument to justify his \nrequest for more generals.\n  This one is designed to de-couple the issue from the force structure. \nThis is how he tries to undo the logic.\n  He says he needs 12 more generals to fill joint billets mandated by \nthe Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986.\n  It's a distortion to suggest that Goldwater-Nichols mandates more \ngenerals when the force structure is shrinking.\n  Joint billets--just like service billets--should be squeezed as the \nforce structure shrinks.\n  This is the message hammered home by Marine Gen. John Sheehan:\n  ``Headquarters and defense agencies should not be growing as the \nforce shrinks.''\n  That's General Sheehan, commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic \nCommand.\n  All the data points indicate that downsizing is continuing and will \ncontinue for the foreseeable future.\n  So the argument that more generals are needed to fill joint billets \ndoesn't hold much water, either.\n  A few years back, the Marine Corps had another commandant. His name \nwas Al Gray.\n  He was tough as nails. He was known as a mud marine.\n  He didn't look at the Marine Corps' needs like a bureaucrat would. He \nlooked at it like a Marine--from the bottom up, starting with platoons \nand companies.\n  In a December 1987 interview with the Chicago Tribune, General Gray \ntalked about his plans to fill his units with people from the bottom \nup. I quote:\n       `If the Marines fill their need for officers and troops \n     before they get to the big headquarters in Washington,' he \n     said with a grin, `that might be a blessing in disguise.'\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this interview be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Dec. 13, 1987]\n\n                      Marines: Myth Versus Reality\n\n\n         modern corps is big, costly, heavy on supporting cast\n\n                            (By David Evans)\n\n       Washington--The Marines have a new commandant, Gen. Alfred \n     Gray, a veteran of\n\n[[Page S9152]]\n\n     the Korean and Vietnam Wars. He's characterized by marines \n     who know him as a self-taught thinker and a ``warrior's \n     warrior.''\n       He inherits not one, but two Marine Corps. One is the corps \n     of myth: small, cheap, and mostly fighters. A Marine Corps, \n     if you will, designed to kick down the door of a defended \n     coastline and put a lot of grunts on the beach in a hurry and \n     looking for a fight.\n       Then there's the real Marine Corps: big, expensive, and \n     with relatively few fighters but a big supporting cast. This \n     real corps plans to land ashore where the enemy isn't.\n       Al Gray isn't very happy with this real corps.\n       ``We're going to make some changes,'' he growls. ``It's \n     time for a fresh, simple look.''\n       People are not his problem. Today's young marines are the \n     highest quality ever, by any measure. They're enough to make \n     a hard-boiled commander's eyes water with joy.\n       The real problems are deeper, and structural. They have to \n     do with the rising cost of the Marines, a tail-wagging-the-\n     dog support structure that pulls marines out of fighting \n     units, and a new-found addiction to costly, exotic equipment.\n       Gray is already grousing about some of these problems.\n       ``Americans expect their Marine Corps to put fully manned \n     infantry battalions into the field,'' he said in a recent \n     interview, ``not units missing 100 or more troops.''\n       That's an unusual admission from the man in charge of a \n     corps of 20,000 officers and 180,000 enlisted marines. But \n     over the years the corps bought equipment that took more \n     people to maintain and repair, and it created more and larger \n     headquarters units. These competing demands for manpower, in \n     secondary support and headquarters activities, siphoned \n     marines out of the fighting units.\n       The slogans remain--``Every marine is a rifleman''--and \n     ringing speeches are still made about the infantryman as the \n     corps' ultimate weapon. But in the real Marine Corps, the \n     infantryman is steadily becoming an endangered species. Of \n     the 180,000 enlisted marines, about 33,000 are officially \n     designated as infantrymen.\n       Throw in the artillerymen, tank crews and combat engineers, \n     and the total number of enlistees in the ``combat arms'' \n     amounts to barely 51,000. Instead of closing with and \n     destroying the enemy, the traditional role of marine fighting \n     men, nearly three out of four enlisted marines are now doing \n     something else; repairing equipment, hanging bombs on \n     airplanes, driving trucks.\n       In this respect, the Marine Corps looks very much like the \n     U.S. Army, where three out of four active-duty soldiers are \n     in support functions, too.\n       Mark Cancian, a Marine Reserve major, sums up recent trends \n     with this observation: If the corps' structure of 1962 were \n     in place today, a structure that featured larger infantry \n     battalions and less logistics support, ``there would be \n     17,000 more marines in Marine divisions--one entire \n     division's worth.''\n       ``Another insight,'' says Cancian, ``is to look at the \n     number of `trigger pullers' in the division.''\n       These are the marines who personally deliver fire on the \n     enemy: the riflemen, artillery cannoneers, tank crews. \n     Everybody else is helping to coordinate and support that \n     fire, but the number of trigger pullers amounts to barely \n     7,500 in a division of 17,500 enlisted marines.\n       There are barely 22,500 ``trigger pullers'' in all three \n     active divisions. Add a few hundred pilots flying close air \n     support, say 500, and there are perhaps 23,000 marines in a \n     corps of 200,000 whose primary duty is to personally fire on \n     the enemy.\n       Most of these ``trigger pullers'' are found in the 27 \n     infantry battalions that represent the cutting edge of the \n     corps. Those battalions may be short the infantrymen they \n     need, but they have plenty of headquarters over them: 29 \n     regimental and higher level headquarters, in fact.\n       If the Marines have grown top-heavy with headquarters \n     units, they've also become harder to move. Too heavy for easy \n     deployment, despite Gen. Robert Barrow's warning as \n     commandant in 1980 that the corps ``should be light enough to \n     get there, and heavy enough to win.''\n       Artillery is an instructive example. The Marines ``heavied \n     up''' their artillery from 105 mm. to 155 mm. howitzers, in \n     part because the Army was shifting to heavier artillery, and \n     in part because of the long range of Soviet guns. But the new \n     howitzer has to be disconnected from the truck that pulls it \n     before being loaded into the standard medium-size landing \n     craft. And the truck doesn't have enough power to pull the \n     gun through sand, so a forklift has to be waiting on the \n     beach to pull the gun ashore.\n       Air units are more difficult to move, too. The Marines are \n     replacing their aging F-4 fighters with new F-18s. According \n     to the maintenance officer of a fighter group of 60 aircraft, \n     the number of maintenance vans that must accompany the same \n     number of F-18s went up 72 percent, from 150 vans to 260.\n       The Marines have become so heavy that the supplies for a \n     full-up amphibious force of 50,000 marines fill about 6,800 \n     containers, each as big as a small bus. Landed ashore, the \n     containers blanket a huge area.\n       ``About 22 acres of nothing but boxes,'' says a colonel, \n     who asks: ``Can we afford a target that large?''\n       ``Amphibious operations by their very nature require \n     bulldozers and other heavy equipment,'' explains Lt. Col. Ken \n     Estes, a staff officer at Marine headquarters.\n       All those support marines, the heavier equipment and the \n     stacks of supplies cost more money. An E-3 lance corporal in \n     an infantry squad costs $15,600 a year in pay and benefits; \n     and E-6 staff sergeant clerking in a headquarters unit costs \n     $22,800.\n       The new truck carries the same 5-ton load as the vintage \n     model it replaces, but costs $31,000 more (in constant 1986 \n     dollars.)\n       Heavier artillery shells for the new howitzer cost 160 \n     percent more.\n       These are just a few examples of the thousand different \n     ways the corps' appetite for money has ratcheted steadily \n     upward.\n       The Marines are no longer the K mart of national defense; \n     they are smack in the mainstream of an upscale defense \n     establishment where costs are rounded to the nearest tenth of \n     a billion dollars.\n       The corps' annual budget now hovers at $9 billion. Since \n     the Navy buys airplanes for the Marines out of its ``blue \n     dollar'' budget, the real cost of the corps runs closer to \n     $13.7 billion a year, according to Pentagon budget experts.\n       Even the Marines may not realize how expensive they have \n     become. In 1976 the total cost of equipping, paying and \n     training each marine was about $37,000. That's in equivalent \n     1987 dollars. Since then, the per capital cost has rocketed \n     to $68,000 for each marine--a stunning 83 percent increase. \n     Part of that jump is the extra pay for more experienced \n     marines, with the rest driven by the rising price of \n     equipment and operations.\n       The cost is still less than the $104,000 the Army spends \n     for every soldier, but the difference is narrowing, and fast.\n       If the taxpayers cannot afford the money-rich diet to which \n     the Marines have grown accustomed, the Navy can't, either. Or \n     at least it can't afford enough of the kind of highly \n     specialized amphibious ships the Marines want.\n       The biggest new class of amphibious ships, for example, \n     costs more than $1 billion and figures prominently in the \n     planned expansion of the amphibious fleet from 62 to 76 \n     vessels.\n       The Marines have rejected cheaper ships as a solution to \n     the numbers problem. One design concept, known in the \n     pentagon by the codeword LTAX, would have provided the same \n     carrying capacity as the large amphibious ships now under \n     construction, but at one-fourth their billion-dollar cost.\n       ``LTAX didn't have the built-in survivability or creature \n     comforts,'' admits a Pentagon naval expert, ``but it would \n     have provided a way of complementing the limited number of \n     true amphibious ships we can afford.''\n       If the Marines have erred by growing too heavy for easy \n     deployment, they've also strayed from Gen. Barrow's timeless \n     dictum by not being heavy enough in the right areas to win. \n     In antitank combat, for example, the Marines' problem is more \n     than serious--it is critical.\n       With the exception of the TOW missile, the Marines' \n     infantry antitank weapons are not up to the job, according to \n     a recent General Accounting Office report on antitank \n     weapons. The warhead on the shoulder-launch AT-4 antitank \n     rocket is too small for assured frontal kills against \n     attacking Soviet tanks. Critics, including some marines, call \n     the AT-4 ``the paint scratcher.''\n       Worse, the Marines probably are not buying enough TOWs. \n     Their planned consumption rate in combat is one TOW missile \n     per launcher every two days.\n       The Marines have had the Dragon medium-weight antitank \n     missile for a decade, but its accuracy and punch are dismal. \n     In combat, the GAO estimates the Dragon may hit the target \n     only 8 out of 100 shots. Although the corps is upgrading the \n     Dragon with a new warhead and sight, it will be years before \n     the new weapons are in the hands of troops.\n       Moreover, the new warhead adds 2\\1/2\\ pounds to the \n     missile's weight, which skeptics claim will reduce the \n     Dragon's range. The first block of ``improved'' missiles may \n     be less accurate, because the pulse rockets used for guidance \n     corrections will be used up faster to counteract the added \n     weight.\n       Maj. Gen. Ray Franklin, in charge of the Dragon improvement \n     project, claims initial warhead tests are ``very \n     impressive.'' He's hoping to field 15,000 new missiles for \n     $60 million.\n       Other experts aren't so sure.\n       ``They're getting super performance from prototype \n     warheads,'' says an ammunition expert, ``and they're having \n     nothing but problems trying to produce them in quantity.''\n       He believes the Dragon costs ``are going to go out of \n     sight'' even if the production problems are solved, and \n     Franklin won't get nearly what he hopes for the money.\n       If Marines on the ground aren't equipped to kill tanks, \n     they'll need air support to do the job.\n       At enormous expense--$5 billion--the Marines have equipped \n     five squadrons with British-designed AV-8B Harrier close air \n     support jets. The Harrier doesn't have the right weapon for \n     killing tanks, say a number of weapons experts familiar with \n     its performance in live-fire tests.\n       The Harrier's 25 mm. cannon was tested extensively against \n     tanks at Nellis Air Force Base in 1979. In 24 passes, the \n     Harrier fired hundreds of shells, getting plenty of hits but \n     not a single kill. Reportedly all but seven of the shells \n     bounced off the tanks' armor. Test reports reveal the Air \n     Force's 30 mm. cannon did much better, killing tanks in 60 \n     percent of the firing passes.\n       Tom Amlie, a Pentagon weapons expert, says the Harrier's 25 \n     mm. gun ``is too heavy for light work [shooting up trucks], \n     and it's\n\n[[Page S9153]]\n\n     too light for the heavy work of killing tanks.''\n       It may be suicidal for Harrier pilots to press their \n     attacks to gun range, anyway. There isn't an ounce of armor \n     on the Harrier, and its engine is wrapped in fuel tanks. A \n     Naval Air Systems Command briefing reveals the Harrier is 10 \n     times more vulnerable to ground fire, given a hit, than the \n     Marines' F-18 fighter, and 20 times more vulnerable than the \n     Navy's A-7 attack jet.\n       Instead of flying Harriers into the teeth of the thousands \n     of automatic weapons found in a Soviet motorized rifle \n     division, the preferred method is to employ so-called \n     ``standoff'' weapons. These are missiles or bombs that can be \n     guided to their targets from outside the range of enemy \n     weapons.\n       ``That's why they're ga-ga for laser-guided Maverick \n     missiles,'' concludes E.C. Myers, former director of air \n     warfare in the Pentagon.\n       The Maverick is tricky to use against tanks, however. Of \n     100 Harrier test runs against tank targets in 1985, the \n     Center for Naval Analysis found the pilots were successful in \n     finding, locking-on and firing only 6 percent of the time.\n       The Marines could use their F-18 fighters armed with \n     Rockeye cluster bombs against tanks. Because the Rockeye \n     spreads bomblets over a wide area, it cannot be employed \n     close to front-line marines. Even so, it is not a very \n     effective weapon. Defense Department munitions effectiveness \n     manuals indicate that four Rockeyes have less than 50 percent \n     chance of killing one tank.\n       The real Marine Corps, it seems, is ill-equipped, both on \n     the ground and in the air, to defeat massed tank attacks. And \n     this kind of attack is the Sunday punch of the Soviet army \n     and Third World armies equipped with Soviet weapons.\n       ``We're not pleased with what we have for air work against \n     tanks,'' admits Maj. Gen. Charles Pitman, the assistant chief \n     of Marine aviation. He hopes improved Mavericks will solve \n     the problem.\n       Perhaps the biggest problem is whether the country can \n     afford the Marines' ambitious plans for the future.\n       The Marines are touting a new landing concept.\n       ``We have to come from over the horizon,'' says Gen. Gray, \n     to avoid exposing the amphibious fleet to shore-based \n     antiship missiles.\n       But new equipment is needed to carry troops and equipment \n     the greater distance to the beach. One is a hovercraft called \n     LCAC (for Landing Craft Air Cushion,) which can ``fly'' over \n     underwater and beach obstacles.\n       The Marines also say they need a new kind of aircraft \n     called the MV-22 tilt-rotor. The MV-22 will take off like a \n     helicopter and fly like an airplane, tilting its engines to \n     again land like a helicopter. The new tilt-rotor would be \n     used land marines as far as 25 miles inland.\n       Freed of traditional beach landing restrictions, the \n     Marines say they can threaten a much wider coastline. The \n     enemy commander, accordingly, will be forced to choose \n     between spreading his forces or leaving large areas \n     undefended.\n       The Marines plan to exploit either choice by punching \n     through a weak and overextended cordon defense, or by landing \n     at undefended spots to quickly build up forces ashore, before \n     the enemy can move and counterattack.\n       ``If we're going to land where the enemy isn't,'' observes \n     one colonel who's skeptical of the new concept, ``why bother \n     staying way offshore, over the horizon? We have enough \n     trouble landing at the right spot from 4,000 yards \n     offshore.''\n       ``For the actual landing,'' he says, ``we've moved the \n     mother ships from 4,000 yards offshore to 25 miles. We've \n     increased the distance more than 12 times, but the hovercraft \n     is only 5 times faster. We're worse off.''\n       The speed advantage of the tilt rotor over current \n     helicopters may be illusory, too. Three out of four tilt-\n     rotor helicopters making the 50-mile trip from ship to inland \n     landing zones will be toting loads that are too big and heavy \n     to be carried inside. They'll be slung underneath, and some \n     pilots say these ``external'' loads will reduce the tilt-\n     rotor's speed further.\n       The experimental tilt-rotor now flying has never carried an \n     external load.\n       Ultimately, the marines must use beaches accessible by \n     conventional landing boats anyway. The new hovercraft and \n     tilt-rotor aircraft will carry ashore only 12 percent of the \n     troops, 6 percent of the vehicles and two-tenths of 1 percent \n     of the ammunition and supplies. Everything else will have to \n     be moved ashore in conventional landing craft, which will be \n     restricted to the 17 percent of the world's coastlines where \n     the water and beach conditions are suitable.\n       ``The enemy will know the entry points on his own coastline \n     that lead to meaningful objectives,'' says a former Defense \n     Department official who questions the new landing concept. \n     ``That's where he's going to defend, and that's the ground \n     the marines will have to take.''\n       ``We delude ourselves by retaining the `assault' label,'' \n     says Col. Gordon Batchellor, a highly regarded tactician, \n     ``as we quietly build a scenario where movement, but no \n     assault, occurs.''\n       This force structure, he maintains, ``will be useless when \n     a true assault is called for.''\n       The new landing concept is expensive. Each air-cushioned \n     hovercraft costs $20 million and can carry a single 70-ton \n     tank ashore. For the same money, the Navy could buy four \n     heavy ``utility'' size landing craft, called LCUs, each of \n     which carries 175 tons.\n       A study by the House Armed Services Committee concluded the \n     tilt-rotor aircraft will cost more than $35 million apiece; \n     the CH-53E helicopter, which can carry twice the payload, \n     costs $16 million. The extra speed and range being built into \n     the tilt-rotor make up $15 billion of the total $25 billion \n     cost of this program.\n       The Marines are buying into a number of hugely expensive \n     and technically risky programs like the tilt-rotor. With \n     these systems, they can range up and down enemy coastlines, \n     jabbing here and there, but the Marines may well be giving up \n     the capability to deliver the body blows of serious war \n     fighting.\n       Gen. George Patton, no stranger to amphibious operations, \n     once said: ``A sparrow can outmaneuver an eagle, but he is \n     not feared. Speed and mobility not linked with fighting \n     capacity are valueless. Wars are won by killing.''\n       Yet it seems the sparrow is the Marine Corps look for the \n     future.\n       This situation may be perfect for Al Gray. After all, the \n     warrior is the man of bold decision in the face of adversity, \n     and Gray, as ``peacetime warrior,'' is facing monumental \n     problems. His budget is a fiscal Mt. St. Helens, unable to \n     contain the explosive pressures of bills now coming due for \n     costly programs started years ago.\n       ``I don't believe in watering down our requirements,'' he \n     says, but he's also sending out strong signals that some \n     requirements may be revised. ``We're going to look from the \n     bottom up,'' he says, at the entire Marine Corps, ``starting \n     with platoons and companies.''\n       Gray plans to fill the units with people from the bottom \n     up, too. If the Marines fill their need for officers and \n     troops before they get to their big headquarters in \n     Washington, he grins, ``that might be a blessing in \n     disguise.''\n       He wants to move with breath-taking speed, bringing all the \n     infantry battalions up to full strength by next summer, \n     adding a fourth rifle company to each battalion as well. \n     Those two actions will put almost 6,000 infantrymen back into \n     the cutting edge.\n       ``We're going back to everybody being an infantryman, \n     too,'' Gray promises. And he wants extra combat training for \n     all marines, regardless of speciality. ``The way we used to \n     do it,'' he adds.\n       What else can he do? A number of civilian experts and \n     Marine officers concerned about the future of the corps \n     suggest a few basic actions.\n       Eliminating unnecessary staffs is near the top of the list. \n     More than half of them are not needed under the most \n     demanding Pentagon plan for the Marine Corps, which calls for \n     the simultaneous employment of an amphibious force and four \n     brigades. Those commitments require only 13 of the 29 \n     regimental and higher-level staffs the Marines now have, \n     leaving 16 of them unemployed.\n       At one stroke, Gray could cut the headquarters overhead by \n     55 percent, saving millions of dollars in manpower costs that \n     could be applied elsewhere.\n       With a quick trip to Europe, Gray can get the weapons that \n     marine infantrymen need to kill tanks. European antitank \n     weapons are generally heavier than their American \n     equivalents, largely because they have bigger warheads. The \n     West Europeans, who live much closer to those 50,000 Soviet \n     tanks, build weapons to kill them.\n       The Marines don't have to wait years for an improved \n     Dragon, which still exists largely as a ``paper'' design. The \n     West German Panzerfaust III and the French Apilas, two \n     shoulder-launched rockets now in production, are good for \n     short-range work. For longer-range antitank engagements, the \n     Milan missile, combat-proven in Chad, is available.\n       The Marines could buy 30 mm. gun pods to strap onto their \n     close support aircraft.\n       ``The gun is the only way to kill tanks in close,'' says \n     Rep. Denny Smith (R., Ore.), who is prepared to help Gray get \n     the pods. They're cheap at roughly $300,000 each.\n       For the price of half the Maverick missiles the Marines \n     want to buy, they could buy 30 mm. gun pods for every jet \n     aircraft in the corps. And they'd still have three times the \n     800 Mavericks they now possess.\n       Among the corps' friends and critics, there is a nearly \n     universal belief that the Marines have lost focus. Instead of \n     concentrating on the basics, says Smith, ``they're trying to \n     capture hardware programs for a bigger budget share.''\n       A number of Pentagon officials, who prefer to remain \n     anonymous, echo those sentiments, citing the ``over-the-\n     horizon'' landing concept as little more than a technical \n     scenario for justifying expensive new programs like the \n     hovercraft and the tilt-rotor.\n       The concept that epitomizes what may be the most important \n     problem Gray inherits: the pervasive failure to separate \n     tactical needs from technical wants.\n       Tactically, the Marines needed a close air support \n     aircraft. Technically, they lusted for the Harrier, a jet \n     that could take off and land vertically. Now, they've got the \n     most vulnerable close air support airplane in the world.\n       Tactically, the Marines needed lots of landing craft to get \n     to the beach. Technically, they coveted the air-cushion \n     hovercraft, which is quite literally a ``helicopter with the \n     roof off.'' Now they've sacrificed the build-up rate ashore.\n\n[[Page S9154]]\n\n       Gray appears to be sensitive to these problems. While he \n     remains outwardly committed to the Harrier and the tilt-rotor \n     program, he worries about the pervasive fascination at the \n     staff level with ``programmatic forces'' instead of real \n     ``fighting forces.''\n       However, Gray is also sending out mixed signals to the \n     working level marines who have to translate his reformist \n     zeal into detailed plans and budgets. For example, he wants \n     to buy an assault gun, a form of light tank, which resurrects \n     a weapon that failed miserably in World War II.\n       When the Marines start sorting out their must-have tactical \n     needs from nice-to-have technical wants, they're likely to \n     discover a lot they can do without.\n       They just might figure out a way to produce a Marine Corps \n     the country can afford.\n       If Gray is successful in making the real, the heavy and \n     expensive corps more like the lean, tough, deployable Marine \n     Corps of myth, the Marines will be restored to what he calls \n     ``real preparedness.''\n       ``Anybody can have a bag full of numbers to look good,'' he \n     says. ``We're going to make sure we have the right people and \n     organizations for combat.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If General Krulak would look from the bottom up, \ninstead of the top down, he would quickly realize that sergeants and \nlieutenants are needed more than generals.\n  Mr. President, I will be meeting with General Krulak in the near \nfuture to discuss this issue.\n  I hope we both come away from this meeting with a fresh perspective \non what the Marine Corps really needs right now.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9150-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9154-S9155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DECISION BY THE FIRST CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to discuss a decision \nhanded down by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, and I will be \nintroducing a bill to correct what I think was a serious mistake the \ncourt made.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly discuss the court's decision. A few \nmonths ago, the First Circuit Court of Appeals made, in my view, a \nserious mistake--a very big mistake. It said that the term ``serious \nbodily injury,'' a phrase used in one of our Federal statutes, does not \ninclude the crime of rape.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you about this case. One night near \nmidnight, a woman went to her car after work. While she was getting \nsomething out of the back seat of her car, a man came up behind her \nwith a knife and forced her into the back seat of her own car. He drove \nher to a remote beach, ordered her to take off her clothes, made here \nsquat down on her hands and knees, and he raped her. He raped her. \nAfter the rape, he drove off in her car, leaving her alone on the side \nof the road naked.\n  This man was convicted under the Federal carjacking statute. That \nstatute provides for an enhanced sentence of up to 25 years if the \nconvicted person inflicts serious--the term of art--serious bodily \ninjury.\n  If he inflicts serious bodily injury in the course of the carjacking, \nthe statute provides for an enhanced sentence, a longer sentence, of up \nto 25 years.\n  When this case got to the sentencing phase, after the defendant had \nbeen convicted of raping the woman in the manner that I just pointed \nout, the prosecutor asked the court to enhance the sentence, because \nunder the statute if serious bodily injury occurred, then an additional \n25 years was warranted. And the prosecutor reasoned, as I do, that rape \nconstituted serious bodily injury.\n  The trial judge agreed with the prosecutor and gave the defendant the \nstatutory 25-year maximum, finding that rape constituted serious bodily \ninjury. But when the case went up to the First Circuit Court of \nAppeals, that court said no. It said, if you can believe it, that rape \nis not serious bodily injury.\n  Mr. President, I have spent the bulk of my professional career as a \nU.S. Senator and prior to that as a lawyer making the case that we do \nnot take seriously enough in this country the crime of rape, and until \nwe do we are not going to be the society we say we wish to be and we \nare not going to impact upon the injury inflicted on women in this \nsociety.\n  But the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that rape does not constitute \nserious bodily injury under our statute. To support its ruling--and I \nam now quoting the opinion of the First Circuit Court of Appeals--the \ncourt said: ``There is no evidence of any cuts or bruises in her \nvaginal area.''\n  I apologize for being so graphic, but that is literally a quote from \nthe court ruling. That, in my view, is absolutely outrageous.\n  Senator Hatch and I and Congressman Conyers in the House are going to \nbe offering a bill to set matters straight. Under the U.S. Criminal \nCode, serious bodily injury has several definitions. It includes a \nsubstantial risk of death, protracted and obvious disfigurement, \nprotracted loss or impairment of a bodily part or mental faculty, and \nit also includes extreme physical pain. It takes no great leap of logic \nto see that a rape involves extreme physical pain. And I would go so \nfar as to say that only a panel of male judges could fail to make that \nleap and even think, let alone rule, that rape does not involve extreme \npain.\n  Rape is one of the most brutal and serious crimes any woman can \nexperience. It is a violation of the first order, but it has all too \noften been treated like a second-class crime. According to a report I \nissued a few years ago, a robber is 30 percent more likely to be \nconvicted than a rapist. A rape prosecution is more than twice as \nlikely as murder prosecutions to be dismissed. A convicted rapist--and \nI want to get this straight--is 50 percent more likely to receive \nprobation than a convicted robber. And you tell me that we take this \ncrime we say is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed by \none human being on another seriously?\n  Look at those statistics. We treat robbery--robbery--more seriously \nthan we do rape. No crime carries a perfect record of arrest, \nprosecution and incarceration, but the record for rape is especially \nwanting. The first circuit decision helped explain why, in my opinion. \nToo often our criminal justice system, as the phrase goes, just doesn't \nget it when it comes to crimes against women.\n  I acknowledge men can and have been raped as well, and a similar \ninfliction of pain occurs, but the fact is well over 95 percent of the \nrapes are rapes of women.\n\n  If the first circuit decision stands, it would mean that a criminal \nwould spend more time behind bars for breaking a man's arm than for \nraping a woman. If a carjacking occurred, and I was the man whose car \nwas carjacked, and in the process of the carjacking my arm was severely \nbroken, for that fellow who was convicted of raping the woman, had he \nbroken my arm, there is no doubt the prosecution's request for an \nenhanced penalty of 25 years would have been upheld.\n  Think of that. We have a statute on the books that says you can \nenhance a penalty to 25 years for carjacking and inflicting serious \nbodily harm. Had it been a man with a broken arm, that guy would have \nbeen in jail for 25 years. But this was a woman who was raped. The \ncourt said, no, it does not meet the statutory requirement of serious \nbodily injury.\n  For 5 long years, Mr. President, I worked to pass a piece of \nlegislation that I have cared about more than any other thing I have \ndone in my entire Senate career and the thing of which I am most proud. \nThat is the Violence Against Women Act. My staff and I wrote that from \nscratch. It took a long time to convince our colleagues and \nadministrations, Democrat and Republican, that it was necessary. For 5 \nlong years we worked to pass that law.\n  The act does a great many practical things. It funds more police and \nprosecutors specifically trained and devoted to combating rape and \nfamily violence. It trains police, prosecutors and judges in the ways \nof rape and family violence so that they can better understand, as, in \nmy view, the first circuit did not understand, the nature of the \nproblem and how to respond to the problem.\n  The violence against women legislation provides shelter for more than \n60,000 battered women and their children. It provides extra lighting \nand emergency phones in subways, bus stops and parks because of the \nnature in which the work force has changed.\n  The woman sitting behind me who helped author that legislation is \nhere at 9:30 at night. In my mother's generation, there were not many \nwomen who left work at 9:30 or 10:30 at night.\n\n[[Page S9155]]\n\n Today, there are millions and millions, like men, who do, and we \nrecognize the need to protect them better than they have been by \nproviding the most effective--the most effective--crime prevention tool \nthere is: lighting. It provides for more rape crisis centers. It sets \nup a national hotline that battered women can call around the clock to \nget advice and counseling.\n  I am working on the ability for them when they call to also be able \nto get a lawyer who will handle their case pro bono--for free--and help \nguide them through the system. They were getting rape education efforts \ngoing with our young people so we can break the cycle of violence that \nbegets violence.\n\n  I might note parenthetically, one of the reasons I wrote this \nlegislation initially, the Violence Against Women Act, is that I came \nacross an incredible study, a poll done in the State of Rhode Island, \nof, I think, seventh, eighth and ninth graders. I am not certain, to be \nhonest. I think seventh, eighth and ninth graders.\n  It asks, in the poll conducted, the survey, ``If a man spends $10 on \na woman, is he entitled to force sex on her if she refuses?'' An \nastounding 30-some percent of the young men answering the question \nsaid, ``Yes.'' But do you know what astounded me more? Mr. President, \n25 percent of the young girls said ``yes'' as well. We have a cultural \nproblem here that crosses lines of race, religion, ethnicity, and \nincome. We just do not take seriously enough the battering of our \nwomen--our women, is the way our friends like to say it--of women in \nthis country. This is especially true when it comes to victims who know \ntheir assailants. For too long we have been quick to call these private \nmisfortunes rather than public disgraces.\n  The Violence Against Women Act also meant to do something else beyond \nthe concrete measures that I mentioned. It also sent a clarion call \nacross the land that crimes against women will no longer be treated as \nsecond-class crimes. For too long the victims of these crimes have been \nseen, not as innocent targets of brutality, but as participants who \nsomehow bear some shame or even some responsibility for the violence \ninflicted upon them.\n  As I said, this is especially true when it comes to victims who know \ntheir assailants. For too long we have been quick to call theirs a \nprivate misfortune rather than a public disgrace. We viewed the crime \nas less than criminal, the abuser less than culpable, and the victim as \nless than worthy of justice.\n  In my own State of Delaware, until recently, if a man raped a woman \nhe did not know, he was eligible, if he brutally did it, to be \nconvicted of first-degree rape. But do you know what? We had a \nprovision in our law, and many States had similar provisions, that said \nif the woman knew the man, if the woman was the social companion of the \nman, then he could only be tried for second-degree rape, the inference \nbeing that somehow she must have invited something because she knew \nhim, she went out with him.\n  It seems to me we have to remain ever vigilant in our efforts to make \nour streets and our neighborhoods and our homes safer for all people, \nbut in this case particularly for women. We need to make sure right now \nthat no judge ever misreads the carjacking statute again and undermines \nthe overwhelming purpose of my legislation in the first place, which \nwas to change the psyche of this Nation about how we are to deal with \nthe brutal act of rape. It is not a sex crime, it is an act of \nviolence, a violent act.\n  Now, one of the most respected courts in the Nation has come down and \nsaid it does not constitute serious bodily injury. So, Mr. President, \nwe need to make sure right now that no judge ever misreads the \ncarjacking statute again. We need to tell them what we intend, what we \nalways intended, that the words ``serious bodily injury'' mean rape, no \nifs, ands, or buts. The legislation, a bill to be introduced by myself \nand Senator Hatch and others, does just that. It says, and I will read \nfrom one section:\n\n       Section 2119(2) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting ``, including any conduct that, if the conduct \n     occurred in the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction \n     of the United States, would violate section 2241 or 2242 of \n     this title'' after ``(as defined in section 1365 of this \n     title)''.\n\n  Translated into everyday English it means, serious bodily injury \nmeans rape. No judge will be able to, no matter how--I should not \neditorialize. No judge in the future, once we pass this legislation, \nwill be able ever again to say that serious bodily injury does not \ninclude rape.\n  I thank Senator Hatch, and I would like to particularly thank Demetra \nLambros, who is sitting behind me, a woman lawyer on my staff who \nworked with Representative Conyers' staff to write this legislation, \nfor the effort she has made and for calling this to my attention. I \nalso thank Senator Hatch, who has always been supportive and very \ninvolved in this, and his staff, and Congressman Conyers, the ranking \nmember of the House Judiciary Committee.\n  I am confident if every Member--this is presumptuous for me to say, \nMr. President--but as every Member of the Senate becomes aware of what \nthis does, I cannot imagine there is anyone here or anyone in the House \nwho will not support it.\n  I thank the Chair. I realize the hour is late. I thank the Chair for \nindulging me. Tomorrow, hopefully, we will be in a position to bring \nthis legislation up and pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have always been a strong supporter of the \nU.S.-flag merchant marine, and America's maritime industry. That is \nwhy, last year I introduced the Maritime Security Act of 1995. This \nbill is the product of nearly a decade of bipartisan and bicameral \neffort. It will reform, streamline, and reduce Federal support for the \nU.S.-flag merchant marine, while at the same time revitalizing our \nU.S.-flag fleet.\n  The starting point for the Maritime Security Program is the simple \nand valid premise that America's merchant marine is a vital component \nof our military sealift capability.\n  Thus, in order to protect our military presence overseas, we must \nhave a modern, efficient, and reliable sealift. On this point, the \nassessment of our Nation's top military leaders is unequivocal. Our \nmilitary needs a U.S.-flag merchant marine to carry supplies to our \ntroops overseas. We cannot, in fact, we must not, rely on foreign ships \nand foreign crews to deliver supplies into hostile areas.\n  Just recently I receive a letter from Adm. Thomas Moorer, the former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Rear Adm. Robert Spiro, a \nformer Under Secretary of the Army. They both enthusiastically endorsed \nthe legislation. I have added this letter to a stack of letters sitting \non my desk from many other distinguished military leaders who also have \nstrongly backed the Maritime Security Act.\n  Not long ago, I also received endorsements of the Maritime Security \nAct from the Honorable John P. White, the current Deputy Secretary of \nDefense, and the Honorable John W. Douglass, the current Assistant \nSecretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition.\n  I also have received numerous letters from members of the Navy League \nof the United States.\n  Clearly, there is visible support from both the active and retired \nmilitary community for the recognized value of this program.\n  The Maritime Security Act will ensure that our Nation will continue \nto have access to both a fleet of militarily useful U.S.-flag \ncommercial vessels, and a cadre of trained and loyal U.S.-citizen \ncrews. What's more, under this bill our military planners will gain \naccess to the onshore logistical and intermodal capabilities of these \nU.S.-flag vessel operators. Instead of just getting a ship, our \nmilitary gets access to port facilities worldwide, state-of-the-art \ncomputer tracking systems, intermodal loading and transfer equipment,\n\n[[Page S9156]]\n\nand so on. And our Nation get these benefits for less than half the \ncost of the current program.\n  This is both a fiscal and national security bargain.\n  Let me make this point clear. This is not a blanket handout to the \nmaritime industry. To participate in the Maritime Security Program, \neach vessel must be approved by the Secretary of Defense. And \nparticipation is limited to vessels actively engaged in the \ninternational maritime trades.\n  Make no mistake about it--without it the American maritime flag will \ndisappear from the high seas. The U.S.-flag merchant marine that has \nhelped to sustain this country in peace and has served with bravery and \nhonor in wartime will be gone.\n  I don't believe that any American wants that day to come.\n  Provisions of this bill have been considered and discussed in nearly \n50 public hearings in either the House or the Senate. These hearings \nwere full and open. All interested parties, both for and against this \napproach, have had notice and opportunity to make comments, criticisms \nand corrections. In 9 years, this inclusive process has insured the \nincorporation of all valid provisions into a balanced and responsible \npublic policy which advances and revitalizes an integral segment of \nAmerica's economy and culture. This inclusive process is reflected in \nthe deep respect and support for this legislation across a wide \npolitical and social spectrum.\n  The House passed the bill in December on a voice vote, with \noverwhelming and loud bipartisan support. I have been told that the \nPresident intends to sign this bill promptly after its final passage \nhere in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has a responsibility to provide for the \nNation's defense. And this bill represents the most cost-effective way \nto make sure that our military has the sealift capabilities it needs to \nprotect our interests around the world. It marks a dramatic departure \nfrom our previous maritime programs. The entitlements are gone, and \nthey have been replaced by a vigorous fiscal discipline and dynamic \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to stand with me in \nsupport of this legislation when it comes to the floor.\n  Mr. President, this is a bill we must pass before this Congress goes \ninto recess for this fall's elections. It is my hope that the Senate \nwill consider the Maritime Security Act on the floor in September.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9155-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9156-S9157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to offer an \namendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for assistance \nto Ukraine. Ukraine's achievement this year in the areas of ethnic \nstability, human rights and constitutional reform are significant, and \nfully justify the substantial earmark of aid being proposed. My \nproposal will not change the total amount of the appropriation, but it \nwill provide assurance that appropriated funds will be used in the \ninterest of both the United States and Ukraine.\n  I believe that the best forms of foreign aid are those which \nstrengthen the recipient from within and lead toward self sufficiency \nand, ultimately, independence from any assistance from the United \nStates or other foreign sources.\n  In this spirit, I propose this earmark in the amount of $25 million \nfor the purpose of helping to create a complete, modern system of \ncommercial law in Ukraine, including not only substantive laws which \nare compatible with international standards but also training and \nequipping of an independent judiciary and legal profession, which as we \nknow are the cornerstones of law-based economy.\n  Such a fundamental transformation--from a totalitarian command \neconomy to a self-sustaining free market--cannot be achieved without \nsubstantial technical assistance. Until now, assistance for \ncomprehensive commercial law reform has been provided to Ukraine \nlargely through pro bono publico, through a commendable program of \ndonated aid known as the Commercial Law Project for Ukraine. These \nprivate efforts, no matter how praiseworthy, are inadequate to bring \nabout the fundamental reforms which are so urgently needed, the earmark \nwhich I propose would fill that need and bring the goal of economic \nself-sufficiency for Ukraine closer to a reality.\n  The philosopher John Locke wrote, ``Where law ends, tyranny begins.'' \nIt is also true that, where law begins, tyranny ends. In this spirit, I \npropose an earmark for legal and commercial law restructuring in \nUkraine.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record three letters \nin support of this amendment from Yuri Shcherbak, Ambassador of \nUkraine, Orest A. Jejna, President of the Ukrainian American Bar \nAssociation, Askold Lozynskyj, President of the Ukrainian Congress \nCommittee of America.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Embassy of Ukraine,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 1996.\n     Re foreign assistance appropriations for fiscal year 1997--\n         sub-earmark for legal reform-commercial law \n         restructuring.\n\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you very much for your \n     successful sponsorship of a foreign aid earmark for Ukraine \n     in the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. Please call on me or \n     my staff at any time if we can assist you in the coming weeks \n     to win Congressional approval of the earmark.\n       I am writing at this time to indicate my support for the \n     addition of a sub-earmark for legal reform and commercial law \n     restructuring as recently proposed by the Ukrainian American \n     Bar Association. I respectfully request that you support the \n     addition of such a sub-earmark, which will help to assure \n     that U.S. assistance will promote the establishment of the \n     rule of law in Ukraine.\n       This sub-earmark would be especially encouraging for my \n     country in respect to the adoption of the New Constitution of \n     Ukraine and preparation of a great number of legislative acts \n     following the Constitution.\n       Ukraine wants from the U.S. only that assistance which will \n     make her self-sufficient and independent of all foreign aid. \n     Proposals such as that by the Ukrainian American Bar \n     Association help to bring the goal of self-sufficiency closer \n     to realization.\n       Thank you once again for your support for our common cause \n     of revitalization of Ukraine.\n       With warmest regards, I remain,\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   Yuri Shcherbak,\n     Ambassador of Ukraine to the USA.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Ukrainian American\n\n\n                                              Bar Association,\n\n                                        Phoenix, AZ, July 2, 1996.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for your sponsorship of \n     an earmark of aid to Ukraine. Your courageous advocacy has \n     promoted vital U.S. interests while bringing freedom to the \n     people of Ukraine.\n       I want to add my voice to those who are requesting \n     inclusion of an additional subearmark for legal reform and \n     commercial law restructuring as necessary to support a \n     decentralized, market-oriented economy. The funds granted to \n     date by the U.S. government for comprehensive commercial law \n     reform in Ukraine have been woefully inadequate to provide \n     Ukraine with the necessary foundation for a functioning \n     private sector.\n       I believe it is encumbent upon Congress to support \n     assistance projects which will promote Ukraine's self-\n     sufficiency and eventual independence from U.S. foreign aid. \n     Commercial law reform and other fundamental legal reforms are \n     among the most important priorities in achieving self-\n     sufficiency for Ukraine.\n       If it is feasible at this juncture, I urge Congress to \n     adopt an additional subearmark for legal reform in Ukraine as \n     follows:\n       ``$25,000,000.00 for legal restructuring necessary to \n     support a decentralized market-oriented economic system, \n     including the creation of all necessary substantive \n     commercial law, all reforms necessary to establish an \n     independent judiciary and bar, legal education for judges, \n     attorneys and law students, and public education designed to \n     promote understanding of a law-based economy.''\n       If you wish any additional information on the position of \n     the Ukrainian American Bar Association, do not hesitate to \n     contact me at (602) 254-3872. Thank you for your \n     consideration of this subject of vital concern.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   Orest A. Jejna,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Ukrainian Congress,\n\n\n                                         Committee of America,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the Ukrainian Congress \n     Committee of America, Inc. (UCCA), the representative \n     organization of the Ukrainian-American community, please \n     allow me to once again thank you for your leadership in the \n     passage of the $225\n\n[[Page S9157]]\n\n     million earmark for Ukraine in FY 1996. The continuance of \n     foreign aid to Central Europe and Ukraine are vital to the \n     security of the United States and the entire world. More \n     importantly, foreign assistance, which is properly \n     distributed, will help insure the stability and security of \n     Ukraine.\n       Since independence almost five years ago, Ukraine and its \n     people have been striving for political, economic, and social \n     reform. The issue at hand is that Ukraine, like many other \n     developing countries, cannot accomplish these reforms alone. \n     Only by the guidance and assistance of the United States can \n     Ukraine endure this transition period.\n       It has come to the attention of the UCCA that during the \n     upcoming deliberations in the Senate Sub-Committee for \n     Foreign Operations, the opportunity to introduce another $225 \n     million earmark for Ukraine will likely present itself, \n     though issues remain as to how that earmark will be sub-\n     marked. The UCCA strongly endorses the following programs as \n     sub-earmarks for the next fiscal year.\n       A sub-earmark of $50 million for energy-sector \n     restructuring, designed to alleviate Ukraine's critical need \n     for energy resources and to improve efficiency of its large \n     fossil-fuel and nuclear plants, therefore lessening the \n     chances of another catastrophic nuclear accident of global \n     proportions;\n       A sub-earmark of $50 million for the continued reform of \n     the agricultural sector in Ukraine under the Food Systems \n     Restructuring Program (FSRP) to be matched with private \n     sector funding. Presently, the agricultural sector in Ukraine \n     comprises nearly 60% of its GDP. For Ukraine to become \n     economically self-sufficient, it must be provided the \n     opportunity for greater efforts to enhance agricultural \n     reform;\n       A sub-earmark of $45 million for the creation of a business \n     incubator center that provides seed capital, as well as \n     lending and equity investments to promote the growth of \n     small- and medium-sized businesses in Ukraine.\n       A sub-earmark for $25 million for legal system \n     restructuring, designed to reform the Ukrainian judiciary \n     system and provide Ukraine with critically needed course \n     materials for its law schools. Commercial law reform also \n     remains vital in identifying the types of law and legal \n     procedures which are necessary for the operation of a \n     decentralized free market economic system, with special \n     emphasis on contract enforcement mechanisms and the \n     establishment of arbitration courts;\n       A sub-earmark of $20 million for business development \n     programs targeting the privatization of large-scale \n     enterprises, which would further stimulate the growth of the \n     private sector in Ukraine;\n       A sub-earmark of $15 million for democracy-building \n     programs that enable the development and expansion of efforts \n     for further democratization in Ukraine;\n       A sub-earmark of $10 million for medication, hospital \n     supplies, and training of physicians under a program to \n     facilitate the treatment of cancers and other diseases \n     related to the Chornobyl nuclear accident;\n       A sub-earmark of $5 million to promote the formation of \n     independent broadcast and print media centers, essential \n     elements of a democratic, law-based society; and\n       A sub-earmark of $4.5 million for FBI legal attache \n     offices, intended to respond to the increased threats of \n     international terrorism and the troubling rise of corruption \n     and organized crime in the former Soviet region which \n     directly jeopardize U.S. interests at home and abroad.\n       Furthermore, business and university partnerships between \n     Ukraine and U.S. should be developed to enhance a cooperation \n     of business expertise and knowledge. These programs would \n     provide training for sophisticated technology use and advance \n     Ukraine in its commitment for economic reform. I urge that \n     you consider the sub-earmarks proposed, which would guarantee \n     Ukraine its fair share of the foreign aid directed to the \n     NIS.\n       Again, thank you for your dedication to Ukraine's course of \n     economic and political reform. If you have any questions, \n     please feel free to contact Michael Sawkiw, Jr., Director of \n     the Washington, D.C. office of the UCCA at (202) 547-0018 \n     (tel) or (202) 543-5502 (fax).\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Askold S.

A bill to make certain laws applicable to the Executive \nOffice of the President, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n        The Presidential and Executive Office Accountability Act\n\n  Mr. COATS. All Members of this body remember early in this Congress \nwe introduced and passed into law the Congressional Accountability Act \nwhich applied the various civil rights and labor laws that are \ncurrently applicable to employers and employees throughout America's \nworkplaces, and applied this same restrictions to Members of Congress.\n  For too long we had exempted ourselves from the laws and regulations \nthat we had imposed on virtually every other business operation in \nAmerica. There were only a couple of workplaces that were exempted: The \nLabor Standards Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans With \nDisability Act, and the other items that we discussed. Those \ninstitutions were the U.S. Congress and the executive branch, in \nparticular, the White House. We remedied that, partially, for the \nCongress with the adoption of the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  Now, these 11 specific items apply to Members of Congress as well as \nto the private sector. I think what we are learning is that some of \nthese laws are good, some of these laws are applicable to what we do, \nbut some of them are overly burdensome and overly restrictive and \ntherefore need to be examined. Because they apply to us as they apply \nto everyone else, we feel that burden, and perhaps we can be reasonable \nwhen we examine these to determine whether or not reforms are needed.\n  This act would apply these same provisions that now apply to Congress \nand virtually every other workplace in the country, to the White House. \nThis legislation, which I send to the desk for referral, was originally \ncosponsored by Senator Stevens, as well as other Members including \nSenators Nickles, Abraham, DeWine, Coverdell, and Faircloth.\n  Mr. President, today I send to the desk a bill designed to eliminate \na dubious double standard that remains in the application of our civil \nrights and labor protection laws.\n  Last year, this Congress passed the Congressional Accountability Act, \nrequiring Congress to live under the laws it passes--and oftentimes \nimposes--on the rest of the Nation. Now that the Congressional \nAccountability Act is\n\n[[Page S9160]]\n\nthe law of the land, only one workplace in America remains exempt from \nour Nation's laws and regulations. In just one place of employment, \nworkers do not enjoy the rights and protections afforded to all other \nAmericans. That one place is the White House, and it's time for the \nWhite House to join the rest of the United States in living under the \ncivil rights and labor laws governing the rest of the Nation.\n  For decades, Congress callously exempted itself from rules and \nregulations it was passing for the rest of the country. Many of us had \nsupported the Congressional Accountability Act for years, but were \nthwarted in our efforts. Finally, when--for the first time in 40 \nyears--Republicans gained control of Congress, we wasted little time \nand passed the Congressional Accountability Act into law.\n  I remain in strong support of the principle that Congress should not \nbe exempt from the laws that apply to all other Americans, and because \nof the Congressional Accountability Act, Congress now is living under \n11 different labor and civil rights laws from which it had previously \nexempted itself. I continue to believe that this is a simple issue of \nfundamentlal fairness. Congress should live under the laws it passes \nfor everyone else. In doing so, lawmakers will learn first hand which \nlaws work, and perhaps more often than not, which laws are overly \nintrusive and burdensome.\n  These lessons also would be appropriate for the White House, since \nunder President Clinton the Federal Register of Government regulations \nnow totals about 65,000 pages, the largest number in more than 15 \nyears. Despite President Clinton's stated concerns for the working men \nand women of this country, the White House continues to exempt itself \nfrom the laws and regulations covering the rest of the country, \nincluding Congress and all private businesses.\n  For example, because of this privileged loophole, the White House \ndoes not have to abide by the minimum wage or the Family Medical Leave \nAct or the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act or \nseveral of the other civil rights and labor laws that apply to all \nother Americans. I think America's labor leaders will agree with me \nwhen I say that employees of the White House should be protected by the \nsame laws that the President approves for the rest of the country. \nEmployees should have the same rights and protections regardless of \nwhere they work--whether the individual labors in the private sector, \nthe Congress, and yes, even in the White House.\n\n  There are some in the White House who argue that this legislation is \nunnecessary because the White House voluntarily complies with the \nspirit of many of these laws. Mr. President, I argue that voluntary \ncompliance is not good enough. How many private sector companies are \nallowed to voluntarily comply with the laws of the land? The answer is \nzero, and the White House should not be an exception.\n  The Congressional Accountability Act, and the proposed White House \nAccountability Act, give employees of these two branches of Government \nthe same rights as any other citizen to go into a court of law and have \ntheir case heard by a jury of their peers. White House employees should \nnot have to depend on the benevolence or arbitrary good will of a \nsupervisor to ensure that they are not taken advantage of, sexually \nharassed, or otherwise dealt with in an inappropriate and possibly \nillegal manner. They deserve the right to be free from discrimination, \nthe right to work in a safe and healthy work environment, the right not \nto be fired simply because of race, sex, disability, or age. White \nHouse workers deserve the same rights and protections that every other \nAmerican enjoys in the private sector, and now in the U.S. Congress.\n  The White House Accountability Act also would be good policy for \nsenior management and administrators. White House policy makers and \ntheir staffs would gain a first-hand understanding of the laws they \npropose and enact. Perhaps the White House will find, as many in \nCongress have been forced to learn, that some of the laws we pass are \ngood, some do not go far enough and need to be strengthened, or--and \nthis is too often the case--that many of the regulations imposed on the \nNation by the Federal bureaucracy in Washington are onerous and in \nserious need of reform.\n  Writing in the Federalist Papers, James Madison instructed us that no \nbranch of Government is above the law. Madison wrote, ``Congress can \nmake no law which will not have its full operation on themselves and \ntheir friends, as well as on the great mass of society.''\n  Because of the Congressional Accountability Act, Federal laws and \nregulations now apply from our Nation's assembly lines to our Nation's \ngeneral assembly. When President Clinton was inaugurated, he called the \nWhite House, ``the people's house.'' It's time he backed up that \nstatement by letting his workers in the White House enjoy the same \ncivil rights and labor protections enjoyed by the rest of the people in \nwhose house they serve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PELL:\n  S. 2001. A bill to amend the Job Training Partnership Act to improve \nthe definition relating to eligible dislocated workers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                the fishermen as dislocated workers act\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that \namends the Job Training Partnership Act [JTPA] to improve the \ndefinition of eligible dislocated workers. The legislation defines \n``dislocated worker'' as any employee who ``has become unemployed as a \nresult of a Federal action that limits the use of, or restricts access \nto, a marine natural resource.''\n  This language is directed at fishermen. In Rhode Island, as well as \nmany other coastal States, customarily the crew members of fishing \nboats are not paid but are given a share of the day's catch. \nUnfortunately, this means they are neither employees of the boat nor \nself-employed.\n  Fishing has always been a difficult occupation. But now, with a \ndeclining supply, Government efforts to restore the population of \nvarious species of fish by limiting or closing access to fishing \ngrounds, and the need to close large portions of our coastal waters \nafter oil spills and other environmental disasters, fishermen are \nleaving port less and, when they do, catching less.\n  Some months ago, I received a letter from a Rhode Island fisherman \nwho realized that fishing would no longer be able to support the \ndemands of his growing family. He had, therefore, selected a new \noccupation--he wants to be a cabinetmaker--and on his own, he had \nlocated and been accepted into a training program. His only problem? \nFinancial assistance.\n  Because he is technically not unemployed, the present system is of no \nhelp to him. My legislation would correct that unfortunate inequity.\n  I originally offered and had accepted a similar version of this \nlegislation in the Labor and Human Resources Committee as an amendment \nto S. 143, the Workforce Development Act. Regrettably, the House-Senate \nwork force development conference committee has only just finished its \nwork under a cloud of partisanship and disagreement and I very much \ndoubt any further action will take place during this Congress.\n  I do not believe the commercial fishermen in Galilee, RI, should \nsuffer because of the failure of a conference committee in Washington, \nDC. I have, therefore, drafted this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2001\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ntaking a child hostage in order to evade arrest; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S9161]]\n\n                           crime legislation\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, over the past few years, America has \nwitnessed an unfortunate trend involving standoffs between the U.S. \nGovernment and parties who reject its authority to enforce the laws of \nthis land--specifically, the incidents in Waco, TX; Ruby Ridge, ID; and \nGarfield County, MT. Thankfully, the most recent episode involving the \nFreemen did not escalate to violence or bloodshed. Regrettably, this \ndoes not hold true for Waco or Ruby Ridge, where there was a tragic \nloss of life to civilians and Government agents alike.\n\n  Each of these situations jeopardized children's lives--innocent \nchildren who had no choice in the role they played in these standoffs. \nIn Waco, 25 young children under the age of 15 died in the blaze that \nspread throughout the compound. These deaths occurred despite the \nrepeated efforts by Federal agents to encourage Branch Davidians \nleaders to allow children to leave the compound.\n  At Ruby Ridge, a 14-year-old died after being caught in gunfire. And \nduring the Freemen standoff, Americans across the Nation held their \nbreath--praying that violence would not erupt. Once again, the lives of \nchildren were placed in jeopardy. But thankfully, this time, the \nchildren--and adults--emerged unharmed.\n  As we have seen, tragedy can occur in these very tense situations. \nAbove all else, we need to ensure that children are kept out of these \nsituations in the future. People who arm themselves after failing to \ncomply with warrants or because they seek to avoid arrest must realize \nthat, whether or not it is intended, children are implicated in these \nstandoffs. We cannot allow this to continue any longer. We cannot allow \nanother child's life to be endangered in this manner.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill which seeks to protect children from \nharm in these standoff situations. My bill would make it a crime to \ndetain a child when two conditions are met: if a person is trying to \nevade arrest or avoid complying with a warrant, and that person uses \nforce, or threatens to use force, against a Federal agent. Any person \nconvicted of violating this act would be imprisoned for 10-25 years. If \na child is injured, the penalty would be increased to 20-35 years. If a \nchild is killed, the penalty would be life imprisonment.\n  No law can ever assure that children will be kept free from harm. But \nthis legislation will help assure that children do not become \ninadvertent, innocent pawns when violent situations arise. It will \nprovide a deterrent to involving a child in any standoff--and severe \npenalties for those who ignore the law.\n  Tense standoffs between Federal law enforcement officers and hostile \nfugitives are no place for children. This bill will help encourage the \nremoval of innocent children from such dangerous situations. As a \nnation, we should not tolerate the use of children as pawns or human \nshields when people choose to evade the laws of this land. I hope my \ncolleagues support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EXON:\n  S. 2003. A bill to amend the Armored Car Industry Reciprocity Act of \n1993 to clarify certain requirements and to improve the flow of \ninterstate commerce; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n          The armored car industry reciprocity improvement act\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I introduce legislation known as the Armored \nCar Industry Reciprocity Improvement Act. This legislation is a \ncompanion measure to H.R. 3431 which has unanimously passed in the \nHouse of Representatives. It is my hope that this bill which makes a \nslight modification to its companion can be taken up and swiftly passed \nthis year to safely expand the benefits of the Armored Car Reciprocity \nAct of 1993 which I introduced in the U.S. Senate. The 1993 law which \nhad support from law enforcement, public safety and armored car \nindustry advocates replaced a patch work of State laws with a common \nsense, pro-safety, pro-interstate commerce approach to weapons \nregistration, background checks and training for armored car crew \nmembers.\n  The amendments to the 1993 law build on what was learned since 1993 \nand will make the reciprocal benefits of the law available to more \nStates. The net result will be better screened, better qualified and \nbetter trained armored car crews.\n  The armored car is one of the most overlooked instrumentalities of \ninterstate commerce. Without the ability to safely and securely move \ncurrency, securities, food stamps, gold and other valuables, interstate \ncommerce would be impossible.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation which I encourage the U.S. \nSenate to overwhelmingly endorse. It is a tribute to the success of the \n1993 law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9159-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 968\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, the name of the Senator from Utah \n[Mr. Hatch] was added as a cosponsor of S. 968, a bill to require the \nSecretary of the Interior to prohibit the import, export, sale, \npurchase, and possession of bear viscera or products that contain or \nclaim to contain bear viscera, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1035\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1035, a bill to permit an \nindividual to be treated by a health care practitioner with any method \nof medical treatment such individual requests, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1189\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n[Mr. Bryan] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1189, a bill to provide \nprocedures for claims for compassionate payments with regard to \nindividuals with blood-clotting disorders, such as hemophilia, who \ncontracted human immunodeficiency virus due to contaminated blood \nproducts.\n\n\n                                S. 1832\n\n  At the request of Ms. Mikulski, the names of the Senator from \nLouisiana [Mr. Breaux], and the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nHollings] were added as cosponsors of S. 1832, a bill to amend title II \nof the Social Security Act to provide that a monthly insurance benefit \nthereunder shall be paid for the month in which the recipient dies, \nsubject to a reduction of 50 percent if the recipient dies during the \nfirst 15 days of such month, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 52\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nThomas] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 52, a joint \nresolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates to protect the rights of victims of crimes.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 57\n\n  At the request of Mr. Ashcroft, the name of the Senator from Alabama \n[Mr. Shelby] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 57, a \njoint resolution requiring the Congressional Budget Office and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation to use dynamic economic modeling in \naddition to static economic modeling in the preparation of budgetary \nestimates of proposed changes in Federal revenue law.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5119\n\n  At the request of Mr. Mack the names of the Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. Ford], and the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] were added as \ncosponsors of amendment No. 5119 proposed to H.R. 3754, a bill making \nappropriations for the legislative branch for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 1997, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9161-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9161-S9162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       THE ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      DOMENICI AMENDMENT NO. 5121\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI proposed an amendment to amendment No. 5094 proposed by \nMr. McCain to the bill (S. 1959) making appropriations for energy and \nwater development for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and \nfor other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On line three of amendment number 5094, strike ``Act'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following: ``Act.

She also volunteered at Mount \nWashington Pediatric Hospital. Mrs. Cohen is remembered for the \ntremendous joy and fulfillment she derived from working with children \nand the way she cared for them as though they were her own.\n  Despite her long battle with cancer, Mrs. Cohen never lost her \ncheerful outlook, her sense of humor or her great zest for life. In \nfact, two days before her death, she was asking how her favorite team, \nthe Baltimore Orioles, was doing.\n  I know my colleagues join me in paying tribute to Mrs. Cohen's many \nyears of service to our community. Mrs. Cohen was a great mother, a \ngreat wife, a great advocate for seniors and children and a great \nMarylander.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9164-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO OLYMPIAN JENNY THOMPSON\n\n Mr. SMITH.

She was named the U.S. swimmer of the year after winning \nfive national titles, eight NCAA titles, and six Pan-Pacific titles and \nis also a 12-time U.S. national champion. In 1995, she won the 100-\nmeter freestyle and 100-meter butterfly at the world championships \ndespite breaking her arm. At the young age of 23, Jenny now ties skater \nBonnie Blair as the American woman with the highest number of Olympic \ngold medals.\n  The Olympic games are the crowning achievement of an athlete's \ncareer--the best meet the best from around the world. Years of training \nculminate in just a few weeks of competition in which dreams are \nfulfilled, records are broken, and champions are made. Jenny is one \nsuch champion with her three gold medals and two Olympic records. Dover \nwill welcome their hometown girl as she returns on August 10 with a \ncelebration and, appropriately, the dedication of a swimming pool in \nher name.\n  Jenny has proven herself an athlete and a winner. She has the \nadmiration and pride of the New Hampshire seacoast and we are indeed \nproud of her. It is with pride that I congratulate the women's relay \nteams and our shining New Hampshire star, Jenny Thompson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9165-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING MAC VAN HORN\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, on August 27, 1996, the Industrial \nDevelopers of Arkansas will honor Mac Van Horn as their Developer of \nthe Year.\n  Mac Van Horn has been the backbone of industrial development for the \npast 25 years in Russellville, AR. Owner of a local construction firm \ninvolved in residential and commercial development, Mac began work as a \ncheerleader for development in the early 1970's. He began to attend \nseminars, visited Arkansas Industrial Development Commission project \nmanagers, and others and learned all the things that were important to \nindustrial recruitment.\n  He was such a good student of industrial recruitment techniques that \ntwo Arkansas Governors placed him on the Arkansas Industrial \nDevelopment Commission where he served faithfully for 15 years.\n  In the past 5 years, Mac and others on the Russellville Industrial \nContact Team have recruited five new companies to the Arkansas River \nValley. Fasco Industries, Inc., Alumax Foils, Inc., Bardcor Corp., \nCarMar Freezers, and Amarillo Gear Company have all chosen to locate in \nRussellville.\n  Mac combines his knowledge of industrial development recruitment and \nhome cooking since he invites prospective company officials into his \nhome when they visit to lure industry to Pope County.\n  Mac plans to retire soon from these endeavors. His leadership, years \nof experience and expertise, and his skills as a negotiator will be \nmissed on the Russellville Industrial Contact Team.\n  This award is most deserved and I want to join in congratulating Mac \nVan Horn for his tireless service to the community he loves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/30/senate-section/article/S9165-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO ROBERT SILVA FOR RECEIVING NEW HAMPSHIRE'S OUTSTANDING \n                       SERVICE AWARD IN EDUCATION\n\n Mr. SMITH.

DECLARATION OF POLICY TO RENEW AMERICAN \n                   NEIGHBORHOODS.\n\n       The Congress hereby declares that--\n       (1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote \n     the general welfare of the Nation--\n       (A) by using Federal resources to aid families and \n     individuals seeking affordable homes that are safe, clean, \n     and healthy and, in particular, assisting responsible, \n     deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves \n     because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their \n     control;\n       (B) by working to ensure a thriving national economy and a \n     strong private housing market; and\n       (C) by developing effective partnerships among the Federal \n     Government, State and local governments, and private entities \n     that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering \n     the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families \n     to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day \n     activities;\n       (2) the Federal Government cannot through its direct action \n     alone provide for the housing of every American citizen, or \n     even a majority of its citizens, but it is the responsibility \n     of the Government to promote and protect the independent and \n     collective actions of private citizens to develop housing and \n     strengthen their own neighborhoods;\n       (3) the Federal Government should act where there is a \n     serious need that private citizens or groups cannot or are \n     not addressing responsibly;\n       (4) housing is a fundamental and necessary component of \n     bringing true opportunity to people and communities in need, \n     but providing physical structures to house low-income \n     families will not by itself pull generations up from poverty;\n       (5) it is a goal of our Nation that all citizens have \n     decent and affordable housing; and\n       (6) our Nation should promote the goal of providing decent \n     and affordable housing for all citizens through the efforts \n     and encouragement of Federal, State, and local governments, \n     and by promoting and protecting the independent and \n     collective actions of private citizens, organizations, and \n     the private sector to develop housing and strengthen their \n     own neighborhoods.\n                      TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to promote safe, clean, and \n     healthy housing that is affordable to low-income families, \n     and thereby contribute to the supply of affordable housing, \n     by--\n       (1) deregulating and decontrolling public housing agencies, \n     which in this Act are referred to as ``local housing and \n     management authorities'', and thereby enable them to perform \n     as property and asset managers;\n       (2) providing for more flexible use of Federal assistance \n     to local housing and management authorities, allowing the \n     authorities to leverage and combine assistance amounts with \n     amounts obtained from other sources;\n       (3) facilitating mixed income communities;\n       (4) increasing accountability and rewarding effective \n     management of local housing and management authorities;\n       (5) creating incentives and economic opportunities for \n     residents of dwelling units assisted by local housing and \n     management authorities to work, become self-sufficient, and \n     transition out of public housing and federally assisted \n     dwelling units;\n       (6) recreating the existing rental assistance voucher \n     program so that the use of vouchers and relationships between \n     landlords and tenants under the program operate in a manner \n     that more closely resembles the private housing market; and\n       (7) remedying troubled local housing and management \n     authorities and replacing or revitalizing severely distressed \n     public housing developments.\n\n     SEC. 102.

DETERMINATION OF GRANT ALLOCATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--For each fiscal year, after reserving \n     amounts under section 112 from the aggregate amount made \n     available for the fiscal year for carrying out this title, \n     the Secretary shall allocate any remaining amounts among \n     eligible local housing and management authorities in \n     accordance with this section, so that the sum of all of the \n     allocations for all eligible authorities is equal to such \n     remaining amount.\n       (b) Allocation Amount.--The Secretary shall determine the \n     amount of the allocation for each eligible local housing and \n     management authority, which shall be--\n       (1) for any fiscal year beginning after the enactment of a \n     law containing the formulas described in paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) of subsection (c), the amount determined under such \n     formulas; or\n       (2) for any fiscal year beginning before the expiration of \n     such period, the sum of--\n       (A) the operating allocation determined under subsection \n     (d)(1) for the authority; and\n       (B) the capital improvement allocation determined under \n     subsection (d)(2) for the authority.\n       (c) Permanent Allocation Formulas for Capital and Operating \n     Funds.--\n       (1) Establishment of Capital Fund Formula.--The formula \n     under this paragraph shall provide for allocating assistance \n     under the capital fund for a fiscal year. The formula may \n     take into account such factors as--\n       (A) the number of public housing dwelling units owned or \n     operated by the local housing and management authority, the \n     characteristics and locations of the developments, and the \n     characteristics of the families served and to be served \n     (including the incomes of the families);\n       (B) the need of the local housing and management authority \n     to carry out rehabilitation and modernization activities, and \n     reconstruction, production, and demolition activities related \n     to public housing dwelling units owned or operated by the \n     local housing and management authority, including backlog and \n     projected future needs of the authority;\n       (C) the cost of constructing and rehabilitating property in \n     the area; and\n       (D) the need of the local housing and management authority \n     to carry out activities that provide a safe and secure \n     environment in public housing units owned or operated by the \n     local housing and management authority.\n       (2) Establishment of Operating Fund Formula.--The formula \n     under this paragraph shall provide for allocating assistance \n     under the operating fund for a fiscal year. The formula may \n     take into account such factors as--\n       (A) standards for the costs of operating and reasonable \n     projections of income, taking into account the \n     characteristics and locations of the\n\n[[Page S9174]]\n\n     public housing developments and characteristics of the \n     families served and to be served (including the incomes of \n     the families), or the costs of providing comparable services \n     as determined in accordance with criteria or a formula \n     representing the operations of a prototype well-managed \n     public housing development;\n       (B) the number of public housing dwelling units owned or \n     operated by the local housing and management authority; and\n       (C) the need of the local housing and management authority \n     to carry out anti-crime and anti-drug activities, including \n     providing adequate security for public housing residents.\n       (3) Development under negotiated rulemaking procedure.--The \n     formulas under this subsection shall be developed according \n     to procedures for issuance of regulations under the \n     negotiated rulemaking procedure under subchapter III of \n     chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, except that the \n     formulas shall not be contained in a regulation.\n       (4) Report.--Not later than the expiration of the 18-month \n     period beginning upon the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress containing \n     the proposed formulas established pursuant to paragraph (3) \n     that meets the requirements of this subsection.\n       (d) Interim Allocation Requirements.--\n       (1) Operating allocation.--\n       (A) Applicability to 50 percent of appropriated amounts.--\n     Of any amounts available for allocation under this subsection \n     for a fiscal year, 50 percent shall be used only to provide \n     amounts for operating allocations under this paragraph for \n     eligible local housing and management authorities.\n       (B) Determination.--The operating allocation under this \n     subsection for a local housing and management authority for a \n     fiscal year shall be an amount determined by applying, to the \n     amount to be allocated under this paragraph, the formula used \n     for determining the distribution of operating subsidies for \n     fiscal year 1995 to public housing agencies (as modified \n     under subparagraph (C)) under section 9 of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937, as in effect before the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (C) Treatment of chronically vacant units.--The Secretary \n     shall revise the formula referred to in subparagraph (B) so \n     that the formula does not provide any amounts, other than \n     utility costs and other necessary costs (such as costs \n     necessary for the protection of persons and property), \n     attributable to any dwelling unit of a local housing and \n     management authority that has been vacant continuously for 6 \n     or more months. A unit shall not be considered vacant for \n     purposes of this paragraph if the unit is unoccupied because \n     of rehabilitation or renovation that is on-schedule.\n       (D) Increases in income.--The Secretary may revise the \n     formula referred to in subparagraph (B) to provide an \n     incentive to encourage local housing and management \n     authorities to increase nonrental income and to increase \n     rental income attributable to their units by encouraging \n     occupancy by families with a broad range of incomes, \n     including families whose incomes have increased while in \n     occupancy and newly admitted families. Any such incentive \n     shall provide that the local housing and management authority \n     shall derive the full benefit of an increase in nonrental \n     income, and such increase shall not directly result in a \n     decrease in amounts provided to the authority under this \n     title.\n       (2) Capital improvement allocation.--\n       (A) Applicability to 50 percent of appropriated amounts.--\n     Of any amounts available for allocation under this subsection \n     for a fiscal year, 50 percent shall be used only to provide \n     amounts for capital improvement allocations under this \n     paragraph for eligible local housing and management \n     authorities.\n       (B) Determination.--The capital improvement allocation \n     under this subsection for an eligible local housing and \n     management authority for a fiscal year shall be determined by \n     applying, to the amount to be allocated under this paragraph, \n     the formula used for determining the distribution of \n     modernization assistance for fiscal year 1995 to public \n     housing agencies under section 14 of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937, as in effect before the enactment of \n     this Act, except that Secretary shall establish a method for \n     taking into consideration allocation of amounts under the \n     comprehensive improvement assistance program.\n       (e) Eligibility of Units Acquired from Proceeds of Sales \n     Under Demolition or Disposition Plan.--If a local housing and \n     management authority uses proceeds from the sale of units \n     under a homeownership program in accordance with section 251 \n     to acquire additional units to be sold to low-income \n     families, the additional units shall be counted as public \n     housing for purposes of determining the amount of the \n     allocation to the authority under this section until sale by \n     the authority, but in any case no longer than 5 years.\n\n     SEC. 205. SANCTIONS FOR IMPROPER USE OF AMOUNTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In addition to any other actions \n     authorized under this title, if the Secretary finds pursuant \n     to an annual financial and performance audit under section \n     432 that a local housing and management authority receiving \n     grant amounts under this title has failed to comply \n     substantially with any provision of this title, the Secretary \n     may--\n       (1) terminate payments under this title to the authority;\n       (2) withhold from the authority amounts from the total \n     allocation for the authority pursuant to section 204;\n       (3) reduce the amount of future grant payments under this \n     title to the authority by an amount equal to the amount of \n     such payments that were not expended in accordance with this \n     title;\n       (4) limit the availability of grant amounts provided to the \n     authority under this title to programs, projects, or \n     activities not affected by such failure to comply;\n       (5) withhold from the authority amounts allocated for the \n     authority under title III; or\n       (6) order other corrective action with respect to the \n     authority.\n       (b) Termination of Compliance Action.--If the Secretary \n     takes action under subsection (a) with respect to a local \n     housing and management authority, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) in the case of action under subsection (a)(1), resume \n     payments of grant amounts under this title to the authority \n     in the full amount of the total allocation under section 204 \n     for the authority at the time that the Secretary first \n     determines that the authority will comply with the provisions \n     of this title;\n       (2) in the case of action under paragraph (2), (5), or (6) \n     of subsection (a), make withheld amounts available as the \n     Secretary considers appropriate to ensure that the authority \n     complies with the provisions of this title; or\n       (3) in the case of action under subsection (a)(4), release \n     such restrictions at the time that the Secretary first \n     determines that the authority will comply with the provisions \n     of this title.\n           Subtitle B--Admissions and Occupancy Requirements\n\n     SEC. 221.

Any public \n     housing development, or portion thereof, that received the \n     benefit of a grant pursuant to section 14 of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937 shall be maintained and used as \n     public housing for the 20-year period beginning upon receipt \n     of such amounts.\n       (2) Mixed income developments.--Amounts may be used for \n     mixed-income developments, which shall be a housing \n     development that--\n       (A) contains dwelling units that are available for \n     occupancy by families other than low-income families;\n       (B) contains a number of dwelling units--\n       (i) which units are made available (by master contract or \n     individual lease) for occupancy only by low- and very low-\n     income families identified by the local housing and \n     management authority;\n       (ii) which number is not less than a reasonable number of \n     units, including related amenities, taking into account the \n     amount of the assistance provided by the authority compared \n     to the total investment (including costs of operation) in the \n     development;\n       (iii) which units are subject to the statutory and \n     regulatory requirements of the public housing program, except \n     that the Secretary may grant appropriate waivers to such \n     statutory and regulatory requirements if reductions in \n     funding or other changes to the program make continued \n     application of such requirements impracticable;\n       (iv) which units are specially designated as dwelling units \n     under this subparagraph, except the equivalent units in the \n     development may be substituted for designated units during \n     the period the units are subject to the requirements of the \n     public housing program; and\n       (v) which units shall be eligible for assistance under this \n     title; and\n       (C) is owned by the local housing and management authority, \n     an affiliate controlled by it, or another appropriate entity.\n\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, to \n     facilitate the establishment of socioeconomically mixed \n     communities, a local housing and management authority that \n     uses grant amounts under this title for a mixed income \n     development under this paragraph may, to the extent that \n     income from such a development reduces the amount of grant \n     amounts used for operating or other costs relating to public \n     housing, use such resulting savings to rent privately \n     developed dwelling units in the neighborhood of the mixed \n     income development. Such units shall be made available for \n     occupancy only by low-income families eligible for residency \n     in public housing.\n\n     SEC. 222. FAMILY ELIGIBILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Dwelling units in public housing may be \n     rented only to families who are low-income families at the \n     time of their initial occupancy of such units.\n       (b) Income Mix Within Developments.--A local housing and \n     management authority may establish and utilize income-mix \n     criteria for the selection of residents for dwelling units in \n     public housing developments that limit admission to a\n\n[[Page S9175]]\n\n     development by selecting applicants having incomes \n     appropriate so that the mix of incomes of families occupying \n     the development is proportional to the income mix in the \n     eligible population of the jurisdiction of the authority, as \n     adjusted to take into consideration the severity of housing \n     need. Any criteria established under this subsection shall be \n     subject to the provisions of subsection (c).\n       (c) Income Mix.--\n       (1) LHMA income mix.--Of the public housing dwelling units \n     of a local housing and management authority made available \n     for occupancy after the date of the enactment of this Act not \n     less than 35 percent shall be occupied by low-income families \n     whose incomes do not exceed 30 percent of the area median \n     income, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for \n     smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary, may \n     for purposes of this subsection, establish income ceilings \n     higher or lower than 30 percent of the median for the area on \n     the basis of the Secretary's findings that such variations \n     are necessary because of unusually high or low family \n     incomes.\n       (2) Prohibition of concentration of low-income families.--A \n     local housing and management authority may not comply with \n     the requirements under paragraph (1) by concentrating very \n     low-income families (or other families with relatively low \n     incomes) in public housing dwelling units in certain public \n     housing developments or certain buildings within \n     developments.

In determining the amount of the \n     rent charged under this paragraph for a dwelling unit, a \n     local housing and management authority shall take into \n     consideration the characteristics of the population served by \n     the authority, the goals of the local housing management plan \n     for the authority, and the goals under the comprehensive \n     housing affordability strategy under section 105 of the \n     Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (or any \n     consolidated plan incorporating such strategy) for the \n     applicable jurisdiction.\n       (2) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this section, the amount paid for monthly rent for a dwelling \n     unit in public housing may not exceed 30 percent of the \n     family's adjusted monthly income for any family who--\n       (A) upon the date of the enactment of this Act, is residing \n     in any dwelling unit in public housing and--\n       (i) is an elderly family; or\n       (ii) is a disabled family; or\n       (B) has an income that does not exceed 30 percent of the \n     median income for the area (as determined by the Secretary \n     with adjustments for smaller and larger families).\n       (b) Allowable Rents.--\n       (1) Minimum rental.--Each local housing and management \n     authority shall establish, for each dwelling unit in public \n     housing owned or administered by the authority, a minimum \n     monthly rental contribution toward the rent (which rent shall \n     include any amount allowed for utilities), which--\n       (A) may not be less than $25, nor more than $50; and\n       (B) may be increased annually by the authority, except that \n     no such annual increase may exceed 10 percent of the amount \n     of the minimum monthly rental contribution in effect for the \n     preceding year.\n\n     Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a local housing and \n     management authority may, in its sole discretion, grant an \n     exemption in whole or in part from payment of the minimum \n     monthly rental contribution established under this paragraph \n     to any family unable to pay such amount because of severe \n     financial hardships. Severe financial hardships may include \n     situations where the family is awaiting an eligibility \n     determination for a Federal, State, or local assistance \n     program, where the family would be evicted as a result of \n     imposition of the minimum rent, and other situations as may \n     be determined by the authority.\n       (2) Maximum rental.--Each local housing and management \n     authority may establish, for each dwelling unit in public \n     housing owned or administered by the authority, a maximum \n     monthly rental amount, which shall be an amount determined by \n     the authority which is based on, but does not exceed--\n       (A) the average, for dwelling units of similar size in \n     public housing developments owned and operated by such \n     authority, of operating expenses attributable to such units;\n       (B) the reasonable rental value of the unit; or\n       (C) the local market rent for comparable units of similar \n     size.\n\n[[Page S9176]]\n\n       (c) Income Reviews.--If a local housing and management \n     authority establishes the amount of rent paid by a family for \n     a public housing dwelling unit based on the adjusted income \n     of the family, the authority shall review the incomes of such \n     family occupying dwelling units in public housing owned or \n     administered by the authority not less than annually.\n       (d) Review of Maximum and Minimum Rents.--\n       (1) Rental charges.--If the Secretary determines, at any \n     time, that a significant percentage of the public housing \n     dwelling units owned or operated by a large local housing and \n     management authority are occupied by households paying more \n     than 30 percent of their adjusted incomes for rent, the \n     Secretary shall review the maximum and minimum monthly rental \n     amounts established by the authority.\n       (2) Population served.--If the Secretary determines, at any \n     time, that less than 40 percent of the public housing \n     dwelling units owned or operated by a large local housing and \n     management authority are occupied by households whose incomes \n     do not exceed 30 percent of the area median income, the \n     Secretary shall review the maximum and minimum monthly rental \n     amounts established by the authority.\n       (3) Modification of maximum and minimum rental amounts.--\n     If, pursuant to review under this subsection, the Secretary \n     determines that the maximum and minimum rental amounts for a \n     large local housing and management authority are not \n     appropriate to serve the needs of the low-income population \n     of the jurisdiction served by the authority (taking into \n     consideration the financial resources and costs of the \n     authority), as identified in the approved local housing \n     management plan of the authority, the Secretary may require \n     the authority to modify the maximum and minimum monthly \n     rental amounts.\n       (4) Large lhma.--For purposes of this subsection, the term \n     ``large local housing and management authority'' means a \n     local housing and management authority that owns or operates \n     1250 or more public housing dwelling units.\n       (e) Phase-In of Rent Contribution Increases.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), for \n     any family residing in a dwelling unit in public housing upon \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, if the monthly \n     contribution for rental of an assisted dwelling unit to be \n     paid by the family upon initial applicability of this title \n     is greater than the amount paid by the family under the \n     provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n     immediately before such applicability, any such resulting \n     increase in rent contribution shall be--\n       (A) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 \n     years, if such increase is 30 percent or more of such \n     contribution before initial applicability; and\n       (B) limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such \n     increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent of \n     such contribution before initial applicability.\n       (2) Exception.--The minimum rent contribution requirement \n     under subsection (b)(1)(A) shall apply to each family \n     described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, \n     notwithstanding such paragraph.\n\n     SEC. 226.

Notwithstanding section 108, the \n     Secretary may approve a local housing management plan \n     without approving the portion of the plan covering \n     demolition or disposition pursuant to this section.\n       (c) Purpose of Demolition or Disposition.--A local housing \n     and management authority may demolish or dispose of a public \n     housing development (or portion of a development) only if the \n     authority provides sufficient evidence to the Secretary \n     that--\n       (1) the development (or portion thereof) is severely \n     distressed or obsolete;\n       (2) the development (or portion thereof) is in a location \n     making it unsuitable for housing purposes;\n       (3) the development (or portion thereof) has design or \n     construction deficiencies that make cost-effective \n     rehabilitation infeasible;\n       (4) assuming that reasonable rehabilitation and management \n     intervention for the development has been completed and paid \n     for, the anticipated revenue that would be derived from \n     charging market-based rents for units in the development (or \n     portion thereof) would not cover the anticipated operating \n     costs and replacement reserves of the development (or \n     portion) at full occupancy and the development (or portion) \n     would constitute a substantial burden on the resources of the \n     local housing and management authority;\n       (5) retention of the development (or portion thereof) is \n     not in the best interests of the residents of the local \n     housing and management authority because--\n       (A) developmental changes in the area surrounding the \n     development adversely affect the health or safety of the \n     residents or the feasible operation of the development by the \n     local housing and management authority;\n       (B) demolition or disposition will allow the acquisition, \n     development, or rehabilitation of other properties which will \n     be more efficiently or effectively operated as low-income \n     housing;

and\n       (6) that the authority has offered the property for \n     acquisition by resident organizations and resident management \n     corporations in accordance with subsection (g).\n       (i) Site and Neighborhood Standards Exemption.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a local housing \n     and management authority may provide for development of \n     public housing dwelling units on the same site or in the same \n     neighborhood as any dwelling units demolished, pursuant to a \n     plan under this section, but only if such development \n     provides for significantly fewer dwelling units.\n       (j) Treatment of Replacement Units.--In connection with any \n     demolition or disposition of public housing under this \n     section, a local housing and management authority may provide \n     for other housing assistance for low-income families that is \n     consistent with the low-income housing needs of the \n     community, including--\n       (1) the provision of choice-based assistance under title \n     III;

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress hereby finds that--\n       (1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote \n     the general welfare of the Nation--\n       (A) by using Federal resources to aid families and \n     individuals seeking affordable homes that are safe, clean, \n     and healthy and, in particular, assisting responsible, \n     deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves \n     because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their \n     control;\n       (B) by working to ensure a thriving national economy and a \n     strong private housing market; and\n       (C) by developing effective partnerships among the Federal \n     Government, State and local governments, and private entities \n     that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering \n     the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families \n     to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day \n     activities;\n       (2) there exists a unique relationship between the \n     Government of the United States and the governments of Indian \n     tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people;\n       (3) the Constitution of the United States invests the \n     Congress with plenary power over the field of Indian affairs, \n     and through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with \n     Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a trust \n     responsibility to protect Indian tribes;\n       (4) the Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the \n     general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed the \n     responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian \n     tribes and for working with tribes and their members to \n     improve their socio-economic status so that they are able to \n     take greater responsibility for their own economic condition;\n       (5) providing affordable and healthy homes is an essential \n     element in the special role of the United States in helping \n     tribes and their members to achieve a socio-economic status \n     comparable to their non-Indian neighbors;\n       (6) the need for affordable and healthy homes on Indian \n     reservations, in Indian communities, and in Native Alaskan \n     villages is acute and the\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\n     Federal Government should work not only to provide housing \n     assistance, but also, to the extent practicable, to assist in \n     the development of private housing finance mechanisms on \n     Indian lands to achieve the goals of economic self-\n     sufficiency and self-determination for tribes and their \n     members; and\n       (7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities \n     should be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of \n     tribal self-governance by making such assistance available \n     directly to the tribes or tribally designated entities.\n\n     SEC. 703.
