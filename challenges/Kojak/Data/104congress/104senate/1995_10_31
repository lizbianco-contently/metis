Mr. President, almost 2 years ago, Senator Bryan and I \ntraveled with a mother to Arlington Cemetery. We traveled there because \nher son, just a month before we went to Arlington, had been gunned down \non an interstate near Lovelock, NV. He thought a car was stalled, and \nas he approached the car to offer his assistance, the driver of the car \ncame from the car and brutally murdered this Nevada highway patrolman. \nWhat the police officer, officer Carlos Borland, did not know was that \nthe man driving the car was an escaped convict from North Carolina.\n  It was one of the saddest occasions in which I have ever \nparticipated. It was a cold winter day. The entire attendance at the \nfuneral was Senator Bryan, Senator Reid, and the mother of this young \nman, her only child. She was very proud of him. He was an exemplary \nstudent in high school. He had had a great record in the military and \nchose as his life's profession that of a police officer. She was \ndevastated.\n  Mr. President, the story does not end there, however, at least for \nhis mother. A week ago, in a Reno newspaper, the Reno Gazette-Journal, \nwrote an article on the status of various death row cases. Officer \nBorland's mother is quoted in this news article as saying, ``My son \ngave his life for his State and his country. Give (Sonner)''--the man \nwho killed her son--``the death penalty and he lives for 40 or 50 \nyears. That's not a death penalty. They lie to us.''\n  ``We have a death penalty and it's being thwarted by murderers,'' the \narticle goes on to say.\n  Mr. President, the reason I mention this is because Nevada has the \nhighest per capita death row population in the entire Nation, more than \ndouble that of Texas. The State of Texas has recently executed its \n100th inmate since 1977.\n  It does not matter whether you are for or against the death penalty. \nThe fact is we are a country of laws and the laws should be carried \nout, and it is wrong what is happening throughout this Nation and in \nNevada. People get the death penalty, and as the mother of this \nexecuted highway patrolman says, ``My son gave his life for his State \nand his country. Give (Sonner)''--this is the murderer--``the death \npenalty and he lives for 40 or 50 years. That's not a death penalty. \nThey lie to us.'' She goes on to say he will probably live longer than \nshe will. Why is this going on?\n  Let me give you the death sentence appeal process in Nevada, and it \nis similar in a lot of different places. First, automatic first appeal \nbefore the Nevada Supreme Court. If it is denied, you have a petition \nfor a rehearing before the Nevada Supreme Court. If that is denied, you \nhave a petition before the U.S. Supreme Court. If that is denied, you \nhave a postconviction relief petition in the trial court, and if that \nis denied you appeal again before the Nevada Supreme Court. If that is \ndenied, you petition for rehearing before the Nevada Supreme Court. If \nthat is denied, you go to the Supreme Court. \n\n[[Page S16346]]\n\n This is the second time. If that is denied, you petition before a \nFederal court. If that is denied, then you petition for a rehearing in \nthe same court. And if that is denied, you go to the ninth circuit, or \nwhatever other circuit if it is not in Nevada. If that is denied, you \nhave a petition for a rehearing. If that is denied, you go to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. If that is denied, then you go back to the Federal Court \nand take each step over and over again.\n  This is simply not right. As everyone is aware, this body passed \ncomprehensive habeas reform earlier this year as part of the \nAntiterrorism Act. We must see to this legislation being signed into \nlaw.\n  It is time to put an end to the endless appeals. Why do I say that? \nTake the small State of Nevada. In Nevada, a man by the name of \nMcKegue, in August 1979, killed William and Irene Henry during a \nrobbery. He entered prison in August 1971. He was sentenced to die. He \nis still there. Edward T. Wilson stabbed to death a Reno police \nofficer, Jimmy Hoff. On June 25, 1979, he was committed to be executed. \nHe is still alive. Robert Ybarra, in 1979, murdered a girl outside Ely, \nNV. He is still alive even though he has been sentenced to death. \nRonnie Milligan, he murdered a 77-year-old woman on July 4, 1980. He is \nstill alive even though he has been sentenced to death. Mark Rogers \nmurdered two women and a man outside of a mining camp near Lovelock, \nNV. He is still alive even though he has been sentenced to death.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this entire article be \nmade a part of the Record so that we can spread on the Record of this \nCongress what is taking place in Nevada and is taking place in almost \nevery State in the Union where there is a death penalty, which is far \nthe majority, and as this newspaper article indicates that people are \nlaughing at the law because it is farcical.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Reno-Gazette-Journal, Oct. 21, 1995]\n\n                       Trimming Time on Death Row\n\n                          (By Bill O'Driscoll)\n\n       It's been a year since the parents of slain Nevada Highway \n     Patrol Trooper Carlos Borland heard a Lovelock jury give his \n     killer, Michael Sonner, the death sentence.\n       Sonner, who once said he wanted to die, is now appealing. \n     And Maria Borland says she may die of old age before the \n     North Carolina escapee is executed by lethal injection for \n     shooting her son along Interstate 80 in late 1993.\n       ``My son gave his life for his state and his country,'' she \n     said. ``Give (Sonner) the death penalty and he lives for 40, \n     50 years. That's not a death penalty. They lie to us.''\n       Her husband says Sonner's execution won't bring back their \n     son, but until it happens, justice won't be complete.\n       ``(Sonner) is in confinement with three meals a day, free \n     dental and medical--somethings that people on the street can \n     only fantasize having,'' Jimmy Borland said.\n       The Borlands are not alone. The number of inmates on \n     Nevada's Death Row stands at 76, including Duc Cong Huynh and \n     Alvaro Calamboro, both convicted for the January 1994 \n     killings of Peggy Crawford and Keith Christopher at a Reno U-\n     Haul rental.\n       But just five inmates have been executed since the death \n     penalty was reinstated in 1977, none against his wishes.\n       A state lawmaker is creating a committee to draft \n     recommendations for Congress and the 1997 Nevada Legislature \n     on how to shorten the distance from conviction to execution.\n       ``We have a death penalty and it's being thwarted by \n     murderers.'' said Sen. Mark James, R-Las Vegas, who hopes to \n     gather 25 to 30 lawmakers, judges and law enforcement \n     officers on the panel.\n       ``I see no reason why we can't get a finality within two \n     years, even with safeguards,'' said Washoe District Attorney \n     Dick Gammick, who will be on the panel. ``There has to be a \n     time when we say, `That's enough.'''\n       Keith Munro of the attorney general's office said the \n     biggest problem is the turnover in attorneys along the way. \n     Each usually tries to return the appeals process to the \n     beginning so as not to inherit the previous lawyer's work.\n       ``Death sentence cases are very complex. Attorneys get \n     tired of them and want to get off. But you can't address that \n     in legislation,'' he said.\n       The dizzying appeals process is one that always allows an \n     inmate to try again, Munro said, but with each repeated step, \n     the excuse to get there cannot be used anew.\n       Still, ``You can litigate these cases until they wheel the \n     inmate out of the death chamber,'' he said.\n       But there are some time-saving measures already in place. \n     James and others applaud the Nevada Supreme Court for its \n     rule several years ago requiring daily transcripts in capital \n     murder trials to keep lawyers abreast of the cases.\n       James said two bills that are bogged down in Congress would \n     expedite appeals where they clog the most: the federal \n     courts.\n       On the other end of the table, State Public Defender James \n     J. Jackson admits the process is a long one, but often \n     necessarily so.\n       ``A lot of the reason why cases get hung up in the federal \n     courts are concerned about a lack of effective counsel,'' \n     Jackson said. ``Yeah it could be more expedited, but when \n     you're talking about the ultimate penalty, yeah, it'll take \n     more time.\n       Nevada has the highest per-capita Death Row population in \n     the nation, more than double that of Texas, which recently \n     executed its 100th inmate since 1977.\n       But Texas is the exception, due largely to the lack of \n     attorneys for inmates even up to the time of execution, said \n     Michael Pesceta of the Nevada Appellate and Post-Conviction \n     Project, a Las Vegas-based non-profit agency for the defense \n     of Death Row cases.\n       ``In a `giddyap' state like Texas, it's not uncommon for a \n     lawyer to see a case for the first time three weeks or a \n     month before the scheduled execution,'' Pescetta said. \n     ``Justice is geared to denying cases and getting on with it, \n     It's not pretty. In Nevada, at least there's an attempt to \n     take more care.''\n       In fact, he said, Nevada is typical of most of the 38 other \n     states where the death penalty is allowed.\n       But Pescetta senses changing winds in Nevada, saying, ``The \n     political landscape has gotten considerably meaner.''\n       James denies any political motivation in forming an ad hoc \n     committee to study reforms.\n       ``The people have said they want the death penalty. We have \n     to do something,'' he said.\n       Jimmy Borland agrees.\n       ``They're technically entitled to two appeals. But we're \n     not playing a baseball game here,'' he said. ``If you're \n     going to have a death penalty, then do it.''\n\n\n                     death sentence appeal process\n\n       The many steps on the road to execution in Nevada:\n       Automatic first appeal before Nevada Supreme Court. If \n     denied:\n       Petition for rehearing before Nevada Supreme Court. If \n     denied:\n       Petition before U.S. Supreme Court. If denied:\n       Petition for post-conviction relief in trial court. If \n     denied:\n       Appeal before Nevada Supreme Court. If denied:\n       Petition for rehearing before Nevada Supreme Court. If \n     denied:\n       Petition before U.S. Supreme Court. If denied, either:\n       Petition before federal court; if denied, then petition for \n     rehearing in same court; if denied, appeal to 9th Circuit \n     Court of Appeals; if denied, petition for rehearing; if \n     denied, appeal before Supreme Court, if denied, then back to \n     federal court and each step thereafter may be repeated, but \n     at each step inmate must explain why he didn't use excuse \n     before. Or:\n       Petition for post-conviction relief in trial court; if \n     denied, then appeal to Nevada Supreme Court; if denied, then \n     appeal to U.S. Supreme Court. If denied, back to trial court \n     and each step thereafter may be repeated, but at each step \n     inmate must explain why he didn't use excuse before.\n\n\n                     nevada's longest on death row\n\n       Kenneth McKegue, 42, of Watsonville, Calif.

What we \nneed \n\n[[Page S16347]]\n\nis to make sure that these never-ending appeals are terminated. We need \nto have a process so the people have their day in court or maybe 2 days \nin court and that they have the appeal process once and maybe twice but \nnot dozens of times.\n  The time has come to speak out against this. It is too bad that we \nhave to have the death penalty. I personally support it. If we are to \nhave these laws on the books they ought to be enforced.\n  Whether or not you agree with the death penalty, you should agree \nthat the law, whatever it is, should be carried out, and in this area \nit simply is not. If we are going to have a death penalty, we must \nensure finality of justice after appeals have been exhausted. I think \nwe should set very strict limits on what appeals should be allowed.\n  So, Mr. President, I call upon Members of this body, especially the \nJudiciary Committee, to use whatever authority they have to move \nlegislation along that has been before this body before so that these \nwrits of habeas corpus and other interminable delays be put to rest. We \nmust move forward to end this endless appeal process that simply meets \nno standard of justice.\n  I appreciate the gravity of the capital offense, but at some point we \nhave to ask, why, why do we even have these laws if we never carry out \nthe sentence of the court. The current imbalance robs the victims and \ntheir families of the justice they deserve. It undermines the public's \nconfidence in the system. I believe it also undercuts the deterrent \neffect of the death penalty.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nresolution that was passed, the sense of the Senate, last Friday \nunanimously by this body, speaking in the strongest terms to President \nMilosevic, who is, even as we speak, on his way to the United States to \nbegin peace talks. I wanted to talk about it this morning because we \ndid not really have a chance to debate it fully last Friday.\n  I wanted to pass it last Friday because I wanted the message to be on \nthe record over the weekend about the continuing reports of atrocities, \nmurders, and robberies taking place right now in the former Yugoslavia \nin the northwest area around Banja Luka. I want to highlight this, Mr. \nPresident, because we are hosting three Presidents Wednesday for peace \ntalks, and there are still atrocities being reported in this area. I \nask, how can we sit down at a peace table with three warring factions \nwhen the war is still going on?\n  So today I am going to talk about the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nthat was passed, and I am going to ask President Milosevic when he sets \nfoot in the United States to announce that these atrocities will stop, \nthat neutral people will be able to go in and get an accounting for as \nmany as 2,000 men that have not yet been heard from.\n  A U.N. report released 2 weeks ago charges that Bosnian Serbs are \nstill conducting a brutal campaign of ethnic expulsion. Despite the \ncease-fire, Bosnian Serbs have been subjecting non-Serbs to untold \nhorror, murder, rape, robbery, forcing people from their homes, and \nother atrocities.\n  According to the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, John \nShattuck, since mid-September and intensifying between October 6 and \n12, many thousands of civilians in northwest Bosnia were systematically \nforced from their homes by paramilitary units, sometimes abetted by \nlocal police who were either too scared or unwilling to intervene, and \nin some instances by Bosnian Serb Army officials and soldiers.\n  These unfortunate events implore us to move with extreme caution \nregarding American involvement in this conflict. The intentions of the \nparties involved, now more than ever, call for prudent, not \nprecipitous, judgment. Examples of ethnic cleansing persist in \nnorthwest Bosnia according to the U.N. reports based on interviews with \nrefugees before and after the October 12 cease-fire.\n  Assistant Secretary John Shattuck has now gained access into that \narea. As many as 2,000 men have been separated from the main group of \nrefugees. U.N. officials are trying to determine their fate amid fears \nthat they may have been executed or sent to the front lines as forced \nslave laborers. The United Nations also reports that during the latest \nwave of expulsions, Moslems from Bosanski Novi near Banja Luka, were \nrounded up at the bus station. Draft-age men were separated from the \nrest and were held for 5 days without food or water. The U.N. spokesman \nin Zagreb reported that many refugees have been given just a few \nminutes to flee their homes and that girls as young as 17 have \nreportedly been taken to the woods and raped. Elderly, sick, and very \nyoung refugees have been driven to remote areas and forced to walk long \ndistances on unsafe roads and cross rivers without bridges.\n  The United Nations has condemned this barbaric treatment of civilians \nin the strongest possible terms. According to the U.N. High \nCommissioner for Refugees, more than 2,000 Moslems and Croats have been \nforced from their homes since mid-September in Bosnian-Serb-controlled \nareas. Only about 10,000 are believed to remain, which before the war \nwas home to a half million Moslems and Croats. And what is most \ndistressing is the evidence we have seen of recent atrocities committed \nby the Serbs after the cease-fire was signed on October 12. It appears \nthat, as a result of recent Bosnian and Croatian advances, the Serbs \nhave lost ground. In an attempt to consolidate their control, they are \nengaged in a campaign of systematic and widespread abuse aimed at \ncleansing the territory they still hold of remaining Croats and \nMoslems.\n  With peace talks scheduled to begin in the United States tomorrow and \nwith the President having clearly indicated his intention to send as \nmany as 20,000 American troops into the heart of this conflict, these \nnew reports of Serbian atrocities are of grave concern and should give \nus pause.\n  For the Bosnians, this latest outrage by the Serbs must seem to be a \ndreadful repeat of what happened last summer during the Serb conquest \nof Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. In that episode, thousands of men were \ntaken out and executed by firing squad, according to survivors, and, in \nfact, the reports just this weekend in the Washington Post confirmed \nnew sightings of mass graves where thousands of people are buried. \nThese sightings were made from satellite photos taken by our \nintelligence sources. So we know the horrible stories of what happened \nat Srebrenica, as reported by refugees, is, in fact, unfortunately and \nsadly true.\n  But what is even more unfortunate, Mr. President, is that things like \nthis may continue as we speak, and we must do something about it. We \nmust learn from what happened in Srebrenica and recognize that they \ncould be doing it right now, and we must protest.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the Senate did protest. We passed a \nresolution that says the following:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate condemns the \n     systematic human rights abuses against the people of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina. With peace talks scheduled to begin in the \n     United States on November 1, 1995, these new reports of \n     Serbian atrocities are of grave concern to all Americans.\n       The Bosnian Serb leadership should immediately halt these \n     atrocities, fully account for the missing, and allow those \n     who have been separated to return to their families. The \n     International Red Cross, the United Nations agencies, and \n     human rights organizations should be granted full and \n     complete access to all locations throughout Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n\n  This resolution was passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate last \nFriday. We must act now to make sure that these atrocities are stopped \nand that neutral sources are able to verify that they have stopped and \naccount for the 2,000 missing men.\n  President Milosevic is going to set foot in Wright-Patterson Air \nForce Base very shortly today. He should immediately announce--and we \ncall on him to immediately announce--that these forces of terror have \nbeen stopped, that these atrocities have been stopped. And to show his \ngood will in these peace talks, he should immediately allow for an \naccounting of the missing people in Bosnia right now. That would be the \nvery first and best step he could make to show that he is, indeed, \nsincere about wanting to bring peace to this area.\n\n[[Page S16348]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate spoke forcefully. I hope we are being \nheard. If we can stop even one murder from happening, it will be worth \nit.\n  I wanted to draw attention to the very strong statement that the \nSenate made last week. I hope that we can use this opportunity, as \nPresident Milosevic comes into our country, to ask him to show his good \nfaith by saying that people will be accounted for and the atrocities \nwill stop.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Transportation appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1996 which the Senate will consider and pass today is \nof vital importance to the State of New Jersey. As the most populated \nState in the Nation, efficient and effective transportation is critical \nto the economic well-being of my State.\n  This year's Transportation appropriations bill provides more than \n$650 million in transportation investment to my State. This investment \nprovides good paying jobs in the short term and in the long term will \ncreate and maintain the infrastructure that New Jersey needs to attract \nand keep a strong work force.\n  Mr. President, I would like to highlight some of the important \nprovisions in this year's bill which I was able to secure for the \nGarden State.\n  Transit is an intricate part of northern New Jersey's transportation \nplan. The single largest component of New Jersey's transit initiatives \nis the urban core. I appreciate the cooperation that I received from \nChairman Hatfield on funding the Secaucus transfer portion of New \nJersey's urban core at $80.25 million. Once completed the Secaucus \ntransfer will link the Bergen and Mainlines to the northeast corridor, \nproviding access to Newark and midtown Manhattan for Bergen County \nresidents. To date I have secured a total of $436 million for urban \ncore projects.\n  In addition to the urban core and transit formula assistance, New \nJersey will be receiving $12.5 million to begin construction of the \nHamilton Intermodal Facility, $1.15 million to develop a park-n-ride \nfacility on the Garden State Parkway at interchange 165 and $3 million \nto support the National Transit Institute at Rutgers.\n  While this bill will provide New Jersey drivers with transit \nalternatives, it also recognizes that cars will continue to play a \nmajor role in travel within the State. Total highway program spending \nin the bill amounts to $19.9 billion, an increase of $454 million over \nlast year, and nearly 96 percent of the ISTEA authorization. New Jersey \nshould expect to receive some $500 million in formula highway \nassistance as a result of this funding level.\n  To make roads in New Jersey as productive as possible this year's \nbill includes $1.5 million for TRANSCOM. TRANSCOM is a consortium of 15 \ntransportation and public safety agencies in New Jersey, New York, and \nConnecticut. Over half of the congestion on my region's roadways is due \nto traffic incidents and it is TRANSCOM's mission to improve \ninteragency response to such incidents. The funding will be used by \nTRANSCOM to build upon existing programs to provide the region's \ntransportation agencies with the tools necessary to strengthen their \ntransportation management activities and their delivery of services to \nthe traveling public.\n  Mr. President, on March 23, 1994, shortly before midnight, a 36-inch-\ndiameter pipeline ruptured catastrophically in Edison Township, NJ. The \nexplosion and fire eventually destroyed eight buildings in the Durham \nWoods apartment complex. An estimated 2,000 residents were displaced \ndue to the explosion. It was only through the diligent and heroic \nefforts on the part of numerous local and State agencies that the \npipeline explosion did not cause numerous fatalities. This year's bill \nincludes $28.75 million to allow the office of pipeline safety to \naggressively prevent another Edison from ever happening again.\n  In addition to the funding this bill provides to New Jersey, it also \nincludes other bill and report language of interest to my constituents.\n  The legislation before us today honors one of the great statesmen of \nNew Jersey, former Congressman Bill Hughes. Renaming the FAA Tech \nCenter the William J. Hughes Technical Center is a deserved tribute to \nBill. It is a fitting show of appreciation for his hard work on behalf \nof the people of the Second District and the State of New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, included in this year's committee report is language \nwhich continues to direct the FAA to withhold Federal funding from \nrunaway expansion at Princeton Airport until an environmental \nassessment is completed, and community involvement is certified by \nSecretary of Transportation Pena. This is not just an air noise issue. \nIt is a quality of life issue. I am hopeful that we can continue to \noperate the Princeton Airport in a manner that is compatible with \ncommunity needs.\n  The coast of New Jersey is the State's recreational and economic \njewel. A provision in this year's bill prohibits the Coast Guard from \nclosing any multimission small boat units. The Coast Guard had \nrecommended closing a number of its rescue stations, including four in \nNew Jersey-Shark River, Townsend Inlet, Salem, and Great Egg.\n  Mr. President, having better, more efficient transit systems and \nroads will improve the quality of life for thousands of commuter on a \ndaily basis. I am glad that as ranking minority member of this \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee I was able to secure this \nfunding, as well as the bill and report language for New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16348-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16348-S16349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMEMORATION OF HUNGARIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, last week, the people of Hungary \ncommemorated the 39th anniversary of the Hungarian people's massive \nuprising against Soviet Communist dominated rule. October 23, Hungarian \nIndependence Day, marked a time when thousands of armed citizens \nbattled the Red Army's military might and held the country for some 2 \nweeks. President Arpad Goncz, whom I met with last week, was one of \nthose who risked his life for his country's freedom--long delayed, but \nfinally achieved. The bravery of those freedom loving Hungarians, \n10,000 of whom risked and lost their lives, will be remembered forever.\n  As Hungary's Foreign Minister Lazlo Kovacs told a gathering at a \nBudapest ceremony last week, ``the heirs of 23 October 1956 are all \nthose who * * * today contribute with their sacrifices to the creation \nof a flourishing, democratic, and independent Hungary.'' The Hungary of \n1995 is well on the road to full democracy. In my meeting last week \nwith President Goncz, we discussed Hungary's economic progress, its \nsuccessful participation in the Partnership for Peace, as well as NATO \nexpansion. No doubt about it, Hungary will be among the first of the \nnew democracies in Eastern Europe to join NATO and I look forward to \nthat day--which I hope will be in the near future. In addition, we \ndiscussed Hungary's concerns about the treatment of Hungarian \nminorities in the region, and developments in the Balkans. President \nGoncz and I both agreed that a fair peace settlement in the former \nYugoslavia, fully recognizing the rights of all nationalities, was \ncrucial for any kind of permanent regional stability. I assured \nPresident \n\n[[Page S16349]]\n\nGoncz that Hungary enjoys the friendship and support of the Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16348-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, last Friday night, or early Saturday \nmorning, this Senate passed a historic budget reconciliation bill that \nsaid to our country: We heard you. We heard you. We believe you. And we \nare, with every effort, attempting to reduce an ever-growing Federal \nGovernment that has consumed an increasingly larger part of the gross \ndomestic product of this country, progressively enslaving the taxpayer \nto a higher and higher portion of the gross work of that taxpayer.\n  Now, it is interesting that today is Halloween, and guess what is \nhappening out there? The Democrats are, once again, yelling ``Trick or \ntreat, America.'' They are saying, ``Boo,'' to Americans. Once again, \nthey are trying to frighten, or use the tactic of fear in driving the \nAmerican public in a direction that they have said so clearly for so \nlong that they do not want to go.\n  What did we hear in the debates of last week and over the weekend, as \nmembers of the other side were speaking in opposition to the action \nthat the Congress spoke to? They are saying that Republicans are \nghouls, goblins, monsters, vampires, demons, and werewolves, as it \nrelates to the care and concern of the people of this country. They are \nsaying that we want to take seniors' health care away, that we want to \nattack low-income and working people, that we want to kick students out \nof college and kick poor people out on the streets, that we want to \ndirty the water and cause the air to be unbreathable and, of course, to \nlet people die in industrial accidents.\n  How could the average American really believe that anybody who seeks \npublic service in this country to formulate public policy would want to \ndo any of those things? Well, I suspect you might slip a little of that \nby during Halloween and talk about the scariness, talk about the pranks \nand the tricks that are being played out there.\n  Let me tell you, it is not Halloween. It never will be Halloween. It \nshould never be Halloween. What is it? It is the harvest season of the \nlast election; that is what it is. The Republican Party heard so loudly \nand so clearly what the American people were saying, and we are \nresponding. The budget resolution of last Friday evening spoke about \nharvesting the economic security for seniors by providing for a \nMedicare program that has long-term stability, so they cannot be \nfrightened or scared into thinking that their security is in jeopardy. \nIt is about the harvest of more jobs by creating a productive economy, \nby controlling debt and deficit structure in this country that, by \nevery economist's projection, is costing us anywhere from 2 to 2.5 \npercent growth in the domestic product of this country, which spells \nlack of opportunity or less opportunity for our young people. That is \nthe harvest season of what the Republican Party is attempting to do, \nwhat this budget resolution is all about, and the work that will go on \nin the next several weeks before we put that on the desk of the \nPresident for his consideration.\n  What does it say in the end? It does not say, ``Boo''; it does not \nsay, ``Trick or treat''; it says to the American people that there will \nbe a higher standard of living for all, that the expectation, in a \ngenerational sense, will continue to be there for a better, more \nproductive lifestyle in our country, because we had a Government that \ndid not get in our way, that did not strangle the great ingenuity, \nhumanity, and the energy of this country. That is what we are saying on \nthis Halloween day--no trick or treat and no boos.\n  I am always so saddened when the other side attempts to use a \ncultural battle or attempts to frighten people in their effort to \nconvince them that their policy is better than the ones we put forth. \nLet us debate it on its merits. Let the American people objectively \ndecide what is best for them and then send that to us in the message \nthat they did so clearly last November.\n  At this time, let me yield to my colleague from Wyoming to speak to \nthis issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16349-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A DISTORTED APPROACH TO PUBLIC POLICY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I rise to join my friend from Idaho to talk a little bit \nabout what is happening. It is an appropriate day. I was in Wyoming \nthis weekend and saw some of the ads that were clothed in masks and \ncostumes, seeking to portray something that I think is not inherent in \nwhat we are doing here. It concerns me a great deal, not only because \nit represents a different point of view, but, more importantly, it \nrepresents a distorted approach to developing public policy.\n  If, indeed, in this country we believe that public policy should be \ndeveloped by all of us participating, then those of us who \nparticipate--and that is all of us in this country--should have some \nfacts upon which to base that public policy. So I want to talk a little \nbit about what I think the White House has been doing for some time and \nwhat our friends on the other side of the aisle have been doing, which \nhas increased over this weekend, and that is to really distort what it \nis we are seeking to do.\n  Those who oppose a balanced budget have been using this mask-and-\ncostume approach to characterize this reconciliation bill that passed \nlast week. Instead of having leadership to deal with what the issues \nare, there has been this use of words and, I believe, distortion, to \nscare people into what the impacts of this will be. This has been a \nmarketing scheme that has been going on for some time, that has been \ndevised, I guess, by various kinds of groups in the country, to find \nthose words that have impact and to cause people to be frightened into \nthinking that a balanced budget will throw this country into turmoil, \nthat saving and strengthening Medicare will result in turning out the \nelderly without health care, that reforming welfare will throw the poor \ninto the street without support, and that allowing middle-class \nAmericans to retain some of their own money will be a disaster.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about how we govern ourselves, and that \nis what this country is all about. That is what democracy is about. \nThat is why people in Greybull, WY, can participate, as well as people \nin New York City, in governance. In order to do that, there has to be a \nbasis of facts. There are differences and different views, and that is \nperfectly legitimate. That is what it is all about. There were young \npeople in my office last week who said: I do not understand why there \nis this controversy going on, or why this debate is going on. Why do we \nnot just do what is good for America?\n  If we all agreed on what is good for America, there would be no \ndebate. I suggested to them that if they went back to their senior \nclass in Cheyenne and raised these questions, there would not be \nunanimity there. There are different views, and they come into play \nhere. There are those who have quite a liberal, populist philosophy \nthat more government is better and more taxes is better. I respect \nthat. I do not agree with it, nor do I think the voters agreed with it \nin the last election. That is what it is all about.\n  Rather than having a campaign of fear, mistrust, and \nmisunderstanding, we need to have a campaign of facts and then decide \non it. What is the purpose of what we did? It is certainly to respond \nto voters--that is what government is about--to balance the budget, \nwhich is the responsible thing to do; to reform welfare, and that is \nthe responsible thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we do begin to talk about the facts and \nthat we do, from both the White House and from our friends on the other \nside of the aisle, have a clear debate of which way to go, but do it \nbased on the facts and based on different views, based on leadership, \ndirection, and based on what I think the voters have told us in the \npast.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I now would like to recognize Mr. Grams of \nMinnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16349-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S16350]]\n\n\n                         ANY WAY THE WIND BLOWS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I, too, would like to talk a little bit \nabout the budget passed last week and the threatened veto.\n  President Clinton reminds me lately of the weather vane we used to \nhave atop the barn of my family's dairy farm. Ours happened to be \nshaped like a rooster, and we always knew which way the wind was \nblowing because that old rooster would spin around and around with the \nbreeze. Like that old weather vane, the President is spending a lot of \ntime on the roof these days, and he must get awful dizzy up there, \ntesting the wind, shifting his position each time it changes.\n  Last week, this chamber delivered on last November's mandate by the \nvoters and passed a far-reaching, historic piece of legislation that \nturns this Government around by balancing the budget and cutting taxes.\n  With the vote behind us, the budget reconciliation conference \ncommittee is now moving ahead with our plan, shaping a bill to send to \nthe President. The newspaper columnists and the TV political panels \nhave been busy reporting on just what President Clinton thinks about \nwhat we are doing.\n  Or rather, on what the polls and his many political advisers tell the \nPresident he should be thinking. This is a President, after all, for \nwhom ``taking a tough moral stand'' means finally admitting he raised \ntaxes too much in 1993, and then recanting his story the very next day, \nblaming his confession on ``sleepiness.''\n  What the President is apparently hearing when it comes to the budget \nis that he ought to veto the reconciliation bill.\n  Let me quote from the Washington Times of October 20:\n\n       The White House is already preparing the post-veto \n     campaign, mapping out travel schedules for Cabinet \n     secretaries and culling poll results to determine the key \n     issues the President will push.\n\n  A top White House aide has even been promoted--a battlefield \npromotion, I guess--as ``assistant to the President.'' His new duties? \nTo ``calculate the political impact of a veto.''\n  Mr. President, this Congress is tackling the serious issues that come \nwith fundamental reform of the Government, issues like how to preserve \nthe troubled Medicare program, how to save our kids and grandkids from \nhaving to carry the load of our debts and deficits, how to stop the \nwelfare system's cycle of dependency, how to give working-class folks \nthe tax relief they desperately need. While we are doing all of that, \nthe White House huddles in its War Room calculating how many political \npoints the President would score by trying to squash our efforts.\n  It seems President Clinton's advisers have told him that he needs to \nveto the reconciliation bill to, ``draw policy differences with the \nRepublicans.''\n  ``Without a veto,'' says a White House spokesman, ``you cannot draw \nthe bright lines. And we are in a period where drawing that bright line \nis everything to the election.''\n  That election is still more than an entire year away.\n  Yet at a time when this Nation is desperate for strong leadership \nfrom its Chief Executive, a distant election has become the guiding \nforce of this Presidency.\n  Mr. Clinton's advisers say he is going to veto our budget \nreconciliation bill. Well, it surely cannot be because his agenda is so \nfundamentally different from ours.\n  We are calling for tax cuts, and the President says he wants tax \ncuts, as well. He supports the child tax credit and has hinted lately \nthat he is agreeable to cutting the capital gains tax.\n  Our budget plan preserves Medicare by slowing its growth and offering \nseniors choices--proposals strikingly similar to the Medicare plan \ntouted by the President in his health care reform bill just 2 years \nago.\n  We are also easing back the growth of Government spending, and that \nis something for which President Clinton has been an advocate. After \nall, is not that what reinventing Government is all about?\n  Now, after months of adamantly denying it could ever be accomplished, \nthe President has admitted that balancing the budget in 7 years--not \n10, or 9, or even 8, as he originally proposed--was a reasonable goal.\n  Clearly, the President is moving closer toward us as this budget \nprocess continues. But still, he is going to wave his veto pen and just \nsay ``no''--not because he believes in his heart that he must, but \nbecause the political winds suggest that he ought to.\n  That is not leadership.\n  I suggest to President Clinton that he resist playing politics and \ninvolve himself seriously in negotiations that will move this budget \nforward, on behalf of all Americans--and not stop it in its tracks to \nplacate his political base.\n  Mr. President, leadership does not mean having a finger sensitive \nenough to tell you which way the wind is blowing. And as any farmer \nknows, a flimsy weather vane that sits too long out in the elements is \neventually going to wear out and need to be replaced.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed 1 \nminute to close the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleagues for joining me on this Halloween \nday. I hope the message that we send to the American people is that the \nefforts we are involved in here in Congress are not a trick but a \ntreat--a treat rewarding them for the profound statement they made last \nyear in the dramatic realignment of the political structure of this \ncountry, toward a time when Government's budgets will be balanced, when \nits programs will be responsive, as concerned about the taxpayers as it \nis about those who should be the recipients of responsible and caring \nGovernment programs.\n  So the day of Halloween ought not to be scary, but a profound \nstatement to the American people that their Government in this \nrepresentative form of government heard them and heard them well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16350-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16350-S16358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

This conference report will allow the Department to operate \nfor fiscal year 1996 without the restrictions of the continuing \nresolution; but more importantly, it will fund vital programs such as \nair traffic control, Coast Guard search and rescue, and other critical \nsafety functions.\n  I am pleased that, in conference with the House, the Senate was able \nto increase funding for a number of important programs, since the \nconference allocation for the bill was $100 million higher in budget \nauthority and $193 million higher in outlays than the Senate-passed \nbill. This year, the problems facing the conferees were the same as \nthose faced in the past--that is, how to strike the best possible \nbalance between the operational needs of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and the Coast Guard with sufficient funding for the \nNation's infrastructure and transportation safety needs. I believe that \nthis agreement provides a balanced and fair solution for the challenges \nwe faced.\n\n[[Page S16351]]\n\n  The conference report before you today contains a total of $12.5 \nbillion in discretionary budget authority and $36.754 billion in \noutlays. I will quickly review some of the highlights of the bill.\n  Total Coast Guard funding is $3.375 billion, which is supplemented by \nan additional $300 million to be transferred to the Coast Guard by the \nDepartment of Defense. The conferees are very appreciative of the fine \nwork and cooperation of Senate Defense Subcommittee Chairman Stevens \nand House Chairman Young. With these funds, the Coast Guard conference \ntotal will be approximately $110 million more than the fiscal year 1995 \nenacted level.\n  For the Federal Aviation Administration, a total of $8.2 billion has \nbeen provided, which includes $4.6 billion for FAA's operations; over \n$1.9 billion for associated facilities and equipment purchases; and \n$1.45 billion for grants in aid for airport construction. In addition, \nthe conference agreement directs FAA to institute personnel and \nprocurement reforms which are desperately needed. The conferees believe \nthat these reforms will allow the FAA to operate more efficiently. I \nshould point out that these reforms are fully supported by the \nadministration. The reform provisions contained in this bill will not \nbecome effective until April 1, 1996, which will allow for sufficient \nand adequate review by not only the appropriate authorizing committees, \nbut also by all affected FAA employees and systems users.\n  For the Federal Highway Administration, the bill includes a total of \nalmost $20 billion--$17.55 billion for the Federal-aid highway formula \nprogram, and $2.3 billion for those highway programs which are exempt \nfrom the obligation ceiling. Highway spending in fiscal year 1996 will \nbe nearly $500 million higher than the comparable fiscal year 1995 \nlevels.\n  In the transit area, the bill provides a total of slightly more than \n$4 billion, which includes $400 million for transit operating \nassistance; $666 million for transit new starts construction; and $333 \nmillion for discretionary grants in the bus and bus-related facilities \narea.\n  In the rail area, it should be pointed out that Amtrak has been \nprovided a total of $635 million: $305 million will be for operating \nexpenses; $230 million will be for Amtrak's capital purchases; and $100 \nmillion is set aside for Amtrak's transition costs.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to point out to the Members \nthat there were several provisions included by the Senate which were \ndropped in conference. The provision which designates the National \nHighway System was not included because the conferees were assured by \nboth the chairman of the House authorizing committee, Mr. Shuster, and \nthe chairman of the Senate authorizing committee, Mr. Chafee, that the \nconference on the National Highway System bill is making progress, \nthough perhaps not as quickly as we had hoped, and that with passage of \nthe NHS bill, States will soon be in receipt of the $5.4 billion in \napportionments that are being held in abeyance pending enactment of the \nNHS.\n  The conferees also agreed to drop a provision which allowed the \nStates flexibility in dealing with an across-the-board cut contained in \nISTEA known as section 1003. The National Highway System authorizing \nconferees have assured us that this issue, too, will be addressed in \nthe NHS conference agreement.\n  The Senate proposal regarding State-regional infrastructure banks has \nbeen deleted from the appropriations bill. However, I have it on good \nassurance from the chairmen of the House Transportation Infrastructure \nCommittee, that the State infrastructure banks proposal, in a somewhat \nscaled-down form, will be included in the NHS conference agreement, and \nwill allow both transit and highway projects to participate in the \ninfrastructure bank program.\n  I also want to inform the Members that the Senate proposal regarding \nair traffic controllers' revitalization pay, which would have phased \nout this 5-percent bonus over a 3-year period, has been deleted. The \nconferees heard from the administration and from many individual \ncontrollers that this would have a demoralizing effect on FAA \npersonnel, and that the cut suggested by the Senate, $45 million, would \nhave been especially detrimental as FAA institutes personnel reforms.\n  Finally, I should point out that the House-initiated proposal which \nwould have moved DOT employees on worker's compensation rolls to \nretirement rolls, upon eligibility, has been deleted, so that nothing \nin this bill affects employees' existing rights under worker's \ncompensation and retirement rules.\n  I want to thank all the Members of the conference for their support \non reaching this agreement. I especially want to thank my ranking \nMember, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, for all his valuable \ntime and insights in fashioning this conference agreement. I also want \nto acknowledge Mr. Frank Wolf of Virginia, who chaired the conference \non behalf of the House and Mr. Coleman, the House ranking Member. I \nbelieve it was a spirited conference which was entered into in good \nfaith. I believe all the conferees were interested in producing a bill \nwhich meets this year's difficult funding challenges in a fair and \nbalanced way.\n  Not at all incidentally, Mr. President, that, I believe, will be \nsigned by the President of the United States and will not be a part of \nthe disputes in which we are continually engaged.\n  We have been told by the administration that the President will sign \nthis bill upon receipt. As a result, I urge adoption of the conference \nreport for H.R. 2002, Fiscal Year 1996 Transportation and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport on H.R. 2002, the transportation appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 1996.\n  First, I thank my colleague from the State of Washington for his able \nwork on the subcommittee and for managing the bill this morning. We \nworked together on many issues and it is a pleasure to be able to stand \nhere with him this morning.\n  I support this bill, but with considerable reluctance. When it comes \nto addressing the transportation needs of this country, this bill falls \nshort. Yet, in many areas, fortunately, this bill does not accept some \nof the more draconian and counterproductive measures called for in the \nbudget resolution or in the House bill. For that I am grateful.\n  This conference agreement cuts $800 million in outlays from the \nfiscal year 1995 funding levels for the Department of Transportation. \nAnd, while it is over a half a billion dollars higher than the severe \nreductions called for under the Senate-passed budget resolution, it \nstill signals a sizable disinvestment in our Federal transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  This is not the direction our country ought to be heading. Consider \nthe fact that, between 1972 and 1990, the United States' public \ninvestment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP ranked dead last of \nthe six other G-7 nations. Among those nations that have the largest \neconomies and the most power, we are last when it comes to investment \nin infrastructure. During the same period, the 1972 to 1990 period, the \naverage productivity growth in the United States also ranked dead last.\n  In recent years, Japan's investment in infrastructure as a percentage \nof its GDP was roughly three times that of the United States. To catch \nup even for 1 year, we would need to increase spending on \ninfrastructure by more than a quarter of a trillion dollars. This \nwidening investment gap is bad news for America's ability to compete in \nthe 21st century, and it undermines our ability to provide essential \njobs that will raise living standards.\n  Recognizing that reality, over 400 of our Nation's leading economists \nhave urged our Government to increase public investment. With the \nextraordinary congestion that we face on our Nation's highways and \nrunways across our country, we must do no less, even within the current \nbudget environment.\n  My remarks are in no way intended to reflect on the distinguished \nchairman of this subcommittee, Senator Hatfield. Those of us on the \nTransportation Subcommittee were extraordinarily fortunate earlier this \nyear when our full committee chairman, \n\n[[Page S16352]]\n\nSenator Hatfield, accepted the chairmanship of this subcommittee. I was \ndelighted to hear that he made that decision. Throughout the year, he \nhas skillfully guided the subcommittee through extensive hearings as \nwell as an amicable markup and conference. Senator Hatfield \ndemonstrated his characteristic fairmindedness, openness and good \njudgment throughout the process, and I am grateful for the \nconsiderations he gave to my concerns throughout the year.\n  Separate from the funding levels contained in the bill, I am pleased \nto report that Senator Hatfield and I were successful in retaining in \nthe conference agreement several of the important policy positions \narticulated in the Senate bill.\n  As it relates to the Coast Guard, for instance, the conference \nagreement retains the provision allowing the commandant to realign his \nexisting search and rescue stations, as well as reallocate billets \nthroughout the Coast Guard to achieve his rebalancing goals.\n  Under the provision, however, dozens of local communities will be \nspared the upheaval and the worry of losing their Coast Guard search \nand rescue presence entirely, and that includes several communities in \nNew Jersey, in Oregon, and in several other States.\n  The bill before us also includes the provisions for FAA personnel and \nprocurement reform that was included in the Senate bill. Under this \nprovision, absent the enactment of other legislation, the FAA \nAdministrator will be authorized to reform his agency's personnel and \nprocurement processes by April 1, 1996.\n  Both the Commerce Committee and the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee are currently working on a comprehensive \nreform legislation for the FAA. In fact, I recently testified before \nthe Commerce Committee on this legislation. It is my sincere hope that \nthis legislation will be enacted and supersede the provisions in the \nappropriations bill.\n  The issue of personnel and procurement reform is a very complex one \nthat requires the input of all affected parties, including the air \ncarriers, general aviation, the unions representing the FAA's \nemployees, and others. I expect the language in the appropriations bill \nwill continue to serve as a strong incentive--if I may characterize it \nas the pebble in the shoe--to bring all parties to the table to agree \non necessary reforms, because I frankly think, as many do, that they \nare overdue.\n  I should mention that, during conference committee deliberations on \nFAA personnel reform, both Congressman Coleman and myself sought to \nensure that bill language would be included in the conference report \nensuring that no new personnel scheme would be put into place that \nwould bar the rights of FAA employees to be a member of the union.\n  While we were only successful in including the relevant language in \nthe statement of managers, I have obtained an assurance from Secretary \nPena that absolutely no measures will be included in the FAA's \npersonnel reform plan that will undermine the ability of FAA employees \nto be members of a union, just like other people who work for the \ncompanies in the country.\n  Perhaps the most critical decision reached by the conferees as it \nrelates to aviation is the final funding level for the FAA's operations \naccount. The final funding level will be $4.646 billion--almost $50 \nmillion more than the House-passed level and almost $100 million more \nthan the level passed by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, we have a wonderfully safe aviation system in this \ncountry. While we have all been disturbed by aviation accidents in \nrecent months, a dispassionate review of the relevant statistics \nreveals that this past year was not one of the worst years for aviation \nsafety. The fact is that usage of the air traffic control system \ncontinually grows but without the kinds of investment I believe is \nnecessary to bring it up to the current and future needs.\n  The funding level for this account was, perhaps, the greatest \ndeficiency in the Senate-passed bill. As the transportation \nappropriations bill moved to conference, the administration made clear \nthe priority it attached to adequate funding for FAA operations.\n  It was a program that gave all the conferees, frankly, a great deal \nof worry.\n  I am very pleased that the conferees found a way to fund this account \nat a level more closely resembling the President's request. \nImportantly, as part of this effort, we were able to eliminate the \nprovision in the Senate bill imposing a 5-percent pay cut on air \ntraffic controllers.\n  Frankly, these people are under great stress, and great strain. The \nlast thing that we need to do is worry them further by threatening \ntheir ability to attend to their personal and family needs.\n  I am very pleased, especially during this period of heightened \nanxiety over the adequacy of our air traffic control system, that we \nare not imposing a pay cut on our already overworked air traffic \ncontrollers.\n  There are several conference decisions with which I strongly \ndisagree. I find it outrageous, quite frankly, that the Senate \nconferees receded to the House provision prohibiting the DOT from \nincreasing the corporate average fuel economy standard in 1996.\n  Simply put so everybody understands it, this provision will prohibit \nthe DOT from requiring the manufacturers of light trucks--a very \npopular vehicle in America--from trying to do even slightly better in \nterms of fuel efficiency. Everyone sees the quantity of imported oil we \nbring into this country increasing. I think it is an outrageous \ncondition for America--to be hostage to foreign suppliers. It is not \nthe way we ought to be going, if we can avoid it. One way we can avoid \nit is by conserving more here.\n  This provision is being forced through the process on an \nappropriations bill because it could not be adopted through \nfreestanding legislation. While I was very disappointed in the outcome, \nI want to commend Senator Gorton for his leadership in sticking up for \nthe Senate position on this item.\n  Other areas of deep disappointment for me are the deep cuts included \nin the bill for transit formula assistance and pipeline safety \nactivities. Transit operating assistance is being slashed by 44 \npercent. To make matters worse, the conference agreement changes the \nformula in a way that poses an additional hardship on our major urban \nareas.\n  Members need to be aware that a cut of this magnitude will \nnecessitate service reductions and fare increases across the country. \nEvery Senator will have constituents that will pay more money for less \ntransit service. We are talking about longer waits for the bus to get \nhome from work and more cars on our already congested highways.\n  The Senate budget resolution called for transit operating subsidies \nto be phased out entirely. I hope that after the experience of a 44-\npercent cut this year, my colleagues will join with me in saying that \nenough is enough. I hope that next year we can hold the line and stem \nthe hemorrhage in this program.\n  Last year's tragic pipeline explosion in Edison, NJ, served as a \nwake-up call for the entire Nation as to the need to beef up our \nefforts to ensure pipeline safety. Our Nation's pipeline infrastructure \nis aging rapidly. President Clinton's budget recognized this reality \nand requested a 13-percent increase for pipeline safety.\n  The conferees, however, turned around and cut these activities 16 \npercent below last year's level--a cut of 26 percent below the \nPresident's request. I only hope that it will not require another \npipeline explosion with either massive pollution or loss of life to get \nmy colleagues to recognize our extraordinary needs in this area.\n  So once again, Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Hatfield for \nhis consideration throughout the development of this conference \nagreement. My unhappiness with the bill does not reflect at all on his \nleadership. What it does say is that this country is not investing \nenough in its transportation infrastructure. By some accounts, the U.S. \nranks 50th or worse in comparison to other industrialized nations, in \nterms of per capita investment in infrastructure. It is outrageous.\n  Everybody knows that efficient transportation helps us move goods, \nhelps us move people, helps us become more efficient, more competitive, \nand provide for a quality of life far better than that which is saddled \nwith air pollution, delays caused by congestion, time away from family, \nand time away from business appointments.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that we talked about and all of us \nfeel so \n\n[[Page S16353]]\n\ndeeply here about is the diminution of the quality of life in our \ncountry, about how difficult it is for families to make a living where \nboth mother and dad go out to work because it requires two workers to \nearn what one used to earn. Do you know who pays the heaviest price for \nthat? It is the children. It is those who miss parental contact during \nthe evening hours and the daytime hours.\n  If this transportation system of ours continues to break down, \ncontinues to lack the ability to service our needs, it will impose an \neven heavier burden on the family. It is pretty simple.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to support this bill. It is the best \nthat we could get done in the current budgetary environment. The \nadministration has signaled definitively that President Clinton will \nsign this conference report.\n  There are only 2 other appropriations bills that have been signed out \nof the 13 thus far. That is military construction and agriculture. We \nwill look forward to having this bill signed. We also ask our \ncolleagues who are in committees of jurisdiction--the Commerce \nCommittee and the Environment and Public Works Committee on which I \nsit, to expedite their action on the transportation authorization \nbills. Those bills, like this bill, will be critical to the functioning \nof our country.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand that the distinguished senior \nSenators from West Virginia and Arizona wish to be heard on this issue, \nand I understand that each wishes that we have a recorded vote.\n  Accordingly, I ask for the yeas and nays on the conference committee \nreport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from West Virginia \n[Mr. Byrd] is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I did not sign the conference report on the \nTransportation appropriations bill. Why did I not sign the conference \nreport? I did not sign it because I thought that it was patently unfair \nin its treatment of rural States like my own State of West Virginia. \nWhy did I think that it was patently unfair to rural States like my own \nState of West Virginia? Because it does not allow one single dollar for \nthe earmark of highway projects--not one--while it proceeds to earmark \n$687 million for 31 rail transit projects in many areas of the country, \nand it also earmarks $333 million in 81 instances for buses and bus-\nrelated facilities throughout the country. In other words, the \nconference report contains 112 earmarks amounting to over $1 billion \nfor mass transit projects in urban areas and areas more densely \npopulated, while it refuses to earmark one thin dime for areas that are \nnot served by mass transit but which have to depend upon highways for \nthe transportation of people and goods.\n  Mr. President and Senators, lend me your ears! I come not to bury \nmass transit projects but to praise them. I compliment Senators and \nMembers of the other body who have successfully made the case for \nearmarking mass transit and bus moneys for cities and towns in their \nStates and congressional districts. They are doing exactly what they \nshould be doing. I do not find fault with that. I come not to bury \njustified earmarks but to praise them. I have always believed that the \nelected representatives of the people in Congress, both Houses, are in \na better position to know the needs of their constituents in the States \nand congressional districts they serve than is some unelected \nbureaucrat downtown who otherwise would make the arbitrary decisions as \nto how much and where transportation dollars will be spent.\n  I have been in the Senate 37 years, and I have been a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee throughout all of those 37 years. I was \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, \nthe subcommittee which has jurisdiction over this bill. I was chairman \nof that Subcommittee on Transportation from March 31, 1971, to July 18, \n1975--in other words, over 4 years. I served as chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee for 6 years during the 101st, 102d and the \n103d Congresses, and I never--never--opposed the earmarking of \nappropriate moneys for rail and other mass transit projects. At the \nsame time, I have also supported the earmarking of moneys for \nmeritorious highway projects, not just in West Virginia but throughout \nthe United States. Yet, in this conference report on appropriations for \ntransportation, highway projects are blatantly--blatantly--\ndiscriminated against. There is not one copper penny--not one--not one \ncopper penny for highway projects.\n  Is that wise? Is that good national transportation policy? Are \nhighways not an important part of the national transportation system?\n  When the Transportation appropriations bill was passed by the Senate, \nit contained $39.5 million for nine highway demonstration projects \nthroughout the country. One of these projects, costing $9 million, was \nin West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, $39.5 million for highway transportation projects is \nmere chicken feed--chicken feed--as compared with $1 billion for mass \ntransit and bus transportation; yet, it was at least chicken feed. The \nHouse conferees on the Transportation appropriations bill took the \nposition that no moneys--none--no moneys could be earmarked for \nhighways. No matter how needed, highway projects were to get zero \ndollars--zero dollars! A policy had been laid down by the House \nAppropriations Subcommittee chairman that there would be no highway \nfunds earmarked at all--none! It is my understanding that several \nMembers of the House of Representatives sought to have funding for \nhighway projects included in the bill, but they were confronted with \nthe policy that was to be the rule of thumb, the line in the sand--no \nhighway projects; none!\n  There have been news reports that earmarkings were being done away \nwith in the Transportation bill; there would be no more such \nearmarkings. The so-called ``pork-busters'' breathed a sigh of relief--\nhallelujah! No earmarks! Henceforth, highway moneys should be \ndistributed strictly by formula. Thus, a level playing field, it was \nclaimed, was being created for the distribution of highway dollars. A \nnew breed of legislator was in the saddle. Move over, John Wayne, a new \nbreed of legislator was in the saddle. ``Down with earmarks'' was the \nbattle cry!\n  Yet, Mr. President, earmarking is not dead. It is very much alive and \nis more robust than ever. And the Transportation appropriations \nconference report is proof of it with $1,020,000,000--that is $1 for \nevery minute since Jesus Christ was born--$1,020,000,000 for rail and \nother mass transit projects, all earmarked in this conference report, \nall earmarked.\n\n  Mr. President, I come not to bury earmarks, but to praise them. In \nthis particular bill I support every earmark. But as one who, while \nserving on the Appropriations Committee for 37 years, has never \nobjected to the practice of earmarking, I ask, what justice--what \njustice--is there in a transportation policy that blatantly \ndiscriminates against highways? What wisdom, what reasonableness, what \nsweet reasonableness, what logic can there be in a transportation \npolicy which says, ``Come one, come all'' to earmarks for mass transit, \nbut which completely closes the door--closes the door--to highways. How \nsanctimonious can we get? On the one hand we say we have done away with \nearmarks in the bill; on the other hand, the bill is full of earmarks. \nThis is sheer hypocrisy, sheer hypocrisy.\n  There is also a $200 million appropriation in this conference report \nfor the Washington metro system. Now, I do not regret that. I do not \noppose that funding. I have supported the funding for this Metro mass \ntransit system in the past. Last year there was $200 million; the year \nbefore that, there was $200 million, and I believe the year before \nthat, there was $170 million for the Washington metropolitan transit \nsystem. Fine. I have no problem with that. Thus, ``I am constant as the \nnorthern star, of whose true fix'd and resting quality there is no \nfellow in the firmament.'' Hence, Mr. President, I come \n\n[[Page S16354]]\n\nnot to bury the Washington metropolitan transit system, but to praise \nit.\n  I have been much criticized in past years for getting earmarks for \nhighway projects in West Virginia. The cynics call these highway \nprojects ``pork.'' Are mass transit projects pork? I ask you, Mr. \nPresident, are mass transit projects pork? Whether we talk about mass \ntransit or whether we talk about highways, these all constitute \ninfrastructure. And infrastructure is important to the country and the \ncountry's economy. Both mass transit and highways are important and \nvital components of the national transportation system. Mass transit \ncan be adapted to certain areas of the country, but not all areas. Some \nareas simply must depend for the most part upon highways.\n  Why should areas that can only be served by highways be deprived? Why \nshould they be denied Federal highway dollars? Are rural areas not a \npart of America? Are the taxpayers who live in rural areas not \nAmericans, too? Are not their tax dollars just as good as the tax \ndollars of those who live in urban areas, mass transit areas? A \ntransportation policy that proclaims to the skies that earmarks are \nevil is a sanctimonious and hypocritical transportation policy when it \npronounces the sentence of death on one particular kind of \ntransportation earmarks, while loading the bill down with earmarks for \nother transportation modes. Such a transportation policy, Mr. \nPresident, is not only unfair, it is also unwise. It is penny-wise and \npound-foolish. Monies spent on highways provide not only short-term \njobs but also result in long-term financial returns for the whole \nnational economy, many times over.\n  Now, the ancient Persians knew this. Darius Hystaspes--the Great--\npaid great heed to roads, which he greatly extended and improved.\n  The Egyptians, the Carthaginians, and the Etruscans all built roads. \nThey did not have mass transit. They did not have buses. They built \nroads.\n  The truly great road builders were the Romans. We have all heard that \nall roads lead to Rome. The Romans knew how to lay down a solid base \nand how to give the road a pavement of flat stones. They knew that the \nroad must have a crown, that it must be higher in the middle so as to \ndrain water away, and that ditches should be dug alongside to carry \naway the water. Some Roman roads are still in use even today. And every \nSenator, I am sure, who has visited Rome and traveled out to Tivoli, \nfor example, has traveled on old Roman roads, built 2,000 years ago.\n\n     Great roads the Romans built that men might meet,\n     And walls to keep strong men apart, secure;\n     Now centuries are gone, and in defeat,\n     The walls are fallen, but the roads endure.\n\n  Now, by contrast, early roads in America were very poor. The trip \nfrom New York to Boston in colonial days was truly an adventure. You \ncan say that about some of the roads in West Virginia as well--even \ntoday. When I was in the State legislature 50 years ago, almost 50 \nyears ago, 48 years ago, West Virginia had less than 10 miles of \ndivided highways.\n  In the early 1800's, settlers were moving in great numbers to the \nWest. In 1811, work was begun on a road that led away from Cumberland, \nMD, toward the West. It was to reach as far west as Vandalia, IL. This \nwas the National Road, the old Cumberland Road. And I am sure that the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Campbell, who presides over the Senate today \nwith a degree of skill and dignity that ``is so rare as a day in \nJune,'' has traveled with his motorcycle over that old Cumberland Road. \nThe Chair is not supposed to respond, but I see him smiling.\n  Well, this was the National Road, the old Cumberland Road. For many \nyears it was the chief line of travel for thousands of settlers on \ntheir way to the West. Before 1838, Congress had spent nearly $3 \nmillion--think of it; Congress had spent nearly $3 million--of Federal \nfunds on that road. Henry Clay was a strong proponent of getting \nCongress to advance money for building the road. O that Henry Clay were \na Member of this Senate today! Or a Member of the other body today--he \nserved in both bodies; he was once Speaker of the House. O that he were \nhere today to plead the cause of highways! He who advocated his \nnational system of public improvements that made sense, and they still \nmake sense today. Henry Clay was a strong proponent of getting Congress \nto advance money for building that road.\n  I find it ironic, Mr. President, that the ancients--the Persians, the \nEtruscans, the Egyptians, the Carthaginians--knew the importance of \nhaving good roads and sought to expand their network of roads, yet, we \nin the Congress, the present-day beneficiaries of the lessons of \nhistory, look upon highways with disdain, as evidenced by this \ntransportation appropriations conference report.\n  There were other voices, Mr. President, not so ancient which also may \nbe summoned in support of building transportation infrastructure. \nThomas Babington Macaulay said: ``Of all inventions, the alphabet and \nthe printing press alone excepted, those inventions which abridge \ndistance have done most for the civilization of our species. Every \nimprovement of the means of locomotion benefits mankind morally and \nintellectually, as well as materially, and not only facilitates the \ninterchange of the various productions of nature and art, but tends to \nremove national and provincial antipathies, and to bring together all \nof the branches of the great human family.'' That was Thomas Macaulay.\n  Francis Bacon, a great English Chancellor, a farsighted and learned \nman, said: ``There be three things which make a nation great and \nprosperous: a fertile soil; busy workshops; easy conveyance for men and \ngoods from place to place.''\n  Mr. President, I was in the House of Representatives when President \nEisenhower advocated the Interstate Highway System, and I supported it. \nI was a Member of the U.S. Senate and supported the creation of the \nAppalachian Regional Commission and the establishment of the network of \nAppalachian Regional Corridors. I have also consistently supported \nFederal funding in sharing the costs of building those corridors \nbecause of the particular and unique needs of the 13 States in \nAppalachia.\n  When the Democrats were in control of the Senate during the years \n1989 through 1994, I provided allocations, as chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, that would result in the funding of \ntransportation projects across the board--mass transit, bus and bus-\nrelated facilities, as well as highways--and throughout the entire \ncountry. I never took the position that allocations of funds should be \nfor highways only, I never took the position that allocations of funds \nshould be only for West Virginia, and that earmarks for other \ntransportation modes should be eliminated or done away with. I \nrecognized that a national transportation policy--that is what we are \ntalking about, a national transportation policy--should include several \ndifferent systems--not just one or two, but several, meaning more than \ntwo--highways, mass transit, and otherwise. But that is not the way \nthings are to be done now that the tables have turned. For some \nunfathomable reason--and ``unfathomable'' goes deeper than the deepest \npart of the broad Pacific Ocean--highways have been left out! Out! Out! \nOut with highways!\n  Mr. President, during a 12-year period, 1973 to 1985, the United \nStates invested three-tenths of 1 percent of its gross domestic product \nin infrastructure annually; during a 12-year period, the United States \ninvested three-tenths of 1 percent of its gross domestic product in \ninfrastructure annually. Canada, meanwhile, invested 1.5 percent; the \nUnited Kingdom 1.3 percent; France invested 2 percent; the then Federal \nRepublic of Germany invested 2.5 percent; Italy invested 2.7 percent; \nJapan invested 5.1 percent of its gross domestic product in \ninfrastructure annually during that 12-year period. How did that \ncorrespond with those same countries' productivity? While the United \nStates was investing only three-tenths of 1 percent of its gross \ndomestic product annually in infrastructure, its productivity grew only \nsix-tenths of 1 percent annually, on the average. In other words, less \nthan 1 percent.\n  Canada invested 1.5 percent and experienced productivity growth of \n1.3 percent. The United Kingdom invested 1.8 percent and had 1.8 \npercent productivity growth. France invested 2 percent and grew 2.3 \npercent. The Federal Republic of Germany invested 2.5 percent and \nenjoyed 2.4 percent productivity \n\n[[Page S16355]]\n\ngrowth annually. Italy invested 2.7 percent, which yielded productivity \ngrowth of 1.8 percent. In Japan, productivity growth was 3 percent, \nwhile it invested 5.1 percent of its gross domestic product in \ninfrastructure.\n  So we can see that nondefense public investment translates into \nincreased productivity. Increased productivity means increased economic \ngrowth. Increased economic growth means more jobs and, thus, more \nincome for the U.S. Treasury. Increased economic growth also means \nincreased national security. It also means an enhanced competitive \nposition for the Nation. It means a higher standard of living. And \nincreased public investment also encourages increased private \ninvestment. And why not? Why would it not?\n  Mr. President, if you had a company, let us say, and you would like \nto buy a brand-spanking-new fleet of trucks, all outfitted in bright \nred paint and chrome, how would you like to put that fleet of new \ntrucks out on roads that are filled with potholes and on bridges in \nneed of repair? How would you like to have your trucks detoured 15, 18, \n20 miles around a bridge that was closed because it was unsafe? How \nmuch would that cost? How much would it cost you? How much would that \nlower your productivity? How much would that cut into your profits? You \nprobably would be reluctant to invest in the new trucks at all.\n  Hence, public investment encourages private investment and is \nconducive to the profitability of the private sector. Dollars spent on \nhighways not only improve the efficiency, and hence the productivity \nand economic growth of a region, but they also improve safety on the \nhighways. The decision to eliminate highway funding earmarks in this \nlegislation just does not make sense in terms of our economic growth, \nour productivity growth, our Nation's transportation needs, our \npeople's safety, or an overall viable transportation policy for this \nNation.\n\n  Why, then, was such a decision made? What is really going on in this \nbill with regard to highway projects? What could possibly justify such \nan arbitrary and shortsighted view of our Nation's transportation needs \nso as to prompt a total--total--blackballing of highway projects?\n  In my view, such a tunnel-vision approach could not be engendered by \nany reasonable contemplation of what makes for sound national \ntransportation policy.\n  What is going on here is simple knee-jerk politics. It is a large \nfandango aimed at appearing to be ``pure'' on the subject of \ntransportation pork, a large fandango aimed at appearing to be pure on \nthe subject of transportation pork. Highway demos have, over the years, \ngotten a reputation which, in my view, is largely undeserved. Now that \nbad reputation is being exploited for political gain--for political \nreasons.\n  In news story after news story, highway earmarks have been portrayed \nas a useless waste of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. They exist \nonly to promote the reputation and electability of the politician who \ndoes the earmarking, so the story goes. Thus, to appear to be virtuous \non the subject of pork, one needs to be tough on that Satan of \nspending, that Beelzebub of budgeting, the demon of deficits--highway \ndemos.\n  If one is sufficiently vociferous in stomping the serpent of highway \ndemos, then one can earmark bus and mass transit projects with random \nabandon. We have banished evil from the kingdom! Now vice can flourish! \nHallelujah, how sweet it is! Evil has been banished from the kingdom.\n  Make no mistake about it, targeting moneys to a specific locality is \nearmarking. That is what has been done in the case of mass transit and \nbus moneys in this bill. That is earmarking. If it moos, gives milk, \nand has an udder, it is undoubtedly a cow--even if one insists on \nsaddling it like a horse. It is still a cow. If it barks, wags its \ntail, and lifts its leg, it is a dog, no matter how loudly one claims \nthat it thrives only on cat food.\n  An earmark is an earmark is an earmark is an earmark and no amount of \nobfuscation can change that.\n  The conference agreement before us will provide $1.665 billion in \ndiscretionary grants for mass transit. Not one penny--not one penny--of \nthat amount will go to West Virginia. Not one. Mr. President, $1.665 \nbillion in discretionary grants for mass transit. Within this amount, \nroughly $665 million will go out by formula to the major rail transit \nsystems in our major urban cities. West Virginia will not see any of \nthat funding.\n  West Virginia is not alone. There are other States, as well.\n  The remaining $1 billion provided for transit discretionary grants in \nthis conference agreement have been completely earmarked--completely \nearmarked--by the conferees. This includes $333 million in grants for \nbus and bus-related facilities. Yet, there are only two bus grants that \nare expressly authorized to receive appropriated funds in the bus \ncategory--a grant for the State of Michigan and a grant for Altoona, \nPA. However, the conferees saw fit to earmark every penny of the funds \navailable for bus and bus-related facilities, for a total of 81 \nprojects.\n  It has not always been the custom to earmark the entire pot of bus \nfunds. Under section 3 of the Transit Act, these funds are to be \ndistributed based on a merit-based competition conducted by the Federal \nTransit Administration. Indeed, there are currently applications \nsitting at the Federal Transit Administration for more than half a \nbillion dollars in bus grants. The applications are there. However, not \none--not one--of these applications will be entertained in the coming \nyear.\n  Why? Because every penny has already been earmarked by the conferees. \nJust 2 years ago, roughly 30 percent of the funds available for bus and \nbus facilities were distributed by competition. Four years ago, roughly \nhalf the funds were distributed based on competition. In the years \nbefore that, the Congress earmarked anywhere between 9 percent and 28 \npercent of the total amount of funding available for bus grants. The \nconference report before us provides $687 million for so-called transit \nnew starts--$687 million for so-called transit new starts. These are \nmajor construction projects for new, expanded transit systems in our \nmajor urban centers.\n  The conference report agreement earmarks every penny made available \nunder this account for 31 cities across the country. This is true \ndespite the fact that the administration saw fit to request funding for \nonly 12 cities.\n  Now, I know that it will be claimed that the Nation's highway needs \ncan be completely provided for by formula funding. Just do it all by \nformula. Just mathematically dribble out highway dollars under an \nagreed-upon formula. No deviations, please. We have all the highway \nneeds of every State completely scoped out, packaged and arithmetically \ncalculated, all by formula.\n  How utterly preposterous! How convenient for some States and how \ndetrimental for others.\n  It should not come as a revelation to anybody that different States \nhave different topographies. Some are flat. Some are hilly. Some are \nmountainous. Some are both flat and hilly. Some are both flat and \nmountainous. It should also not come as an intuitive flash of genius to \nanyone that the economies of the States are different. Some are rural. \nSome are agricultural. Others are urban centers. Some are dependent \nupon industry. Many State economies have a combination of both or all \nof these.\n\n  If one understands these quite obvious and undeniable geographic and \neconomic differences that exist among the States, it then follows that \nsome States will need more mass transit money, or more bus money, or \nmore highway money than others. It also then becomes apparent that an \nexclusively formula-driven approach to highway funding is not going to \naddress the highway needs of each and every State. It costs from $10 to \n$18 million a mile to build four-lane highways in the State of West \nVirginia. We have mountains, more than a million hills and mountains in \nWest Virginia. It also, then, becomes apparent that an exclusively \nformula-driven approach to highway funding is not going to address the \nhighway needs of each and every State.\n  Thus, the reason for earmarking of highway dollars--in order to \naddress the deficiencies of the Federal highway formula in certain \nStates--can easily be understood, can easily be understood by those who \nwant to understand.\n\n[[Page S16356]]\n\n  Take a State like West Virginia. We are mostly rural, heavily \nforested, very mountainous, have very little flat land and few cities \nof any size. We have few airports, sparse airline service, and heavy \nfog which frequently impairs landings and takeoffs.\n  West Virginia receives almost no funding from the $1.5 billion \nairport improvement program. The most formula funding that my State of \nWest Virginia has ever received from that program was $4.3 million in 1 \nyear. West Virginia ranks 49th in the Nation in the number of air \npassengers.\n  I do not like to ride airplanes. When I was a little boy I would \nwrite to all of the companies that were advertising in publications \nthat had anything to do with aviation. I thought someday I would like \nto be an aviator, and sail through the clouds with the greatest of \nease. It did not work out like that. I am not so wild about flying \nanymore.\n  So we are 49th among the States with reference to air passengers. \nCompare that to the Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport that has received more \nthan $100 million in a single year for the expansion of that airport \nfrom the Airport Improvement Program. Is that pork?\n  The airport in Charleston, West Virginia--probably the State's \nbusiest airport--was built by hacking off the top of several mountain \npeaks, shoving that dirt into the valleys and then smoothing and \nleveling that newly-created surface to make a runway. On a foggy \nmorning, taking off or landing at Charleston can be an exciting \nexperience. And it can also be a fatal one, as we have seen. So, there \nare not large airports, and therefore, some businesses are reluctant to \ncome to my State because of that drawback. Likewise, blasting through \nmountains, building tunnels through mountains--John Henry has been dead \na long, long time--blasting tunnels through mountains, under valleys \nand riverbeds in order to build tunnels for mass transit is not \nextremely practical, to say the least. We have almost no mass transit \nactivity in West Virginia. Can you imagine speed rail transit in West \nVirginia?\n  We have almost no mass transit. Of the $2.5 billion that was \ndistributed by formula to the States for mass transit assistance in \nfiscal year 1995, guess how much West Virginia received? Of the $2.5 \nbillion, West Virginia received less than $650,000. It received \n$642,000, less than $1 million out of $2.5 billion. That is why we need \nhighways. I know they are looked upon with scorn in some quarters. But \nWest Virginia is part of the Union, the only State that was torn from \nanother State in the throes of a great Civil War. It became a Union \nState in 1863.\n  For this coming fiscal year, the conference agreement will lower that \nlevel of assistance to West Virginia to $515,000. Out of the $2.5 \nbillion, West Virginia will get a half-million. Think of it. I am not \ncomplaining about that. God, in his masterful design, in all of that \nprocess of creation, made West Virginia mountainous, so we do not have \nmass transit. We have to depend upon highways. West Virginia, \ntherefore, receives very little mass transit money, no new airport \nfunds, and is, therefore, left almost completely dependent upon highway \nfunds to satisfy its transportation needs.\n  Come on, pork busters! Go with me to West Virginia! For commerce, for \ntourist travel, travel by people within the State and by people passing \nthrough on their way to somewhere else, means, for the most part, \nhighway travel, and we need highways. Highways are West Virginia's only \nticket--only ticket to economic development.\n  My State is a poor State. Thank God for West Virginia. It is a land \nof mountains by God's great will, and it produces mountain men and \nwomen. Yes, it is a poor State, always has been, trampled by outside \ninterests. One day I will talk about the great coal barons who lived \noutside the State but who took the State's resources with the blood and \nthe sweat and the tears of mountaineers who helped to build those \nfortunes for the absentee owners. So, my State is a poor State, and \nwithout adequate highways we will always remain so.\n  Then, there is the issue of safety. That affects everybody. I was in \none head-on collision in West Virginia, on West Virginia State Route 2, \nin which the driver of the other car was killed.\n  Safety is important. Again, let us look at my State of West Virginia. \nAs I have said, there is very little flat land. We have roads in some \nareas that have more hairpin curves than they do straight stretches. \nThey are narrow winding, twisting roads, snaking around and over \nmountains and up and down steep valleys. In the rain, in the snow, in \nthe dark, in the fog, it is quite a harrowing ride in many parts of \nWest Virginia. Lives have been lost again and again because of these \nnarrow, two-lane, twisting ribbons that criss-cross my State. I know. I \nhave traversed almost all of them at some time or other.\n  It would be an education for some Members to travel with me on some \nrainy night in the fog when the headlights barely penetrate a car \nlength. Perhaps I should invite some of the opponents of highway money \nto ride along with me, so that they might enjoy the full flavor of \nunimproved, two-lane mountain highways. I daresay their antiperspirant \nwould fail them. Maybe then--just maybe--a little sympathy might be \nforthcoming with regard to those evil highway projects.\n  This is what my people endure daily in West Virginia. This is what \ntravelers passing through my State contend with. This is what truck \ndrivers--whose time is money--have to deal with when they take a load \nthrough West Virginia.\n  But, what is West Virginia in the grand scheme of things? We are \nsmall. We are poor. Who cares about our safety or our economic plight? \nMaybe we should just crawl back into our hollows and mountain caves and \nstop bothering everybody.\n  A patchwork quilt of a nation, where some States thrive and others \nwither, is not a prescription for a strong national economy. An \nunbalanced transportation policy, like the one promulgated in this \nconference report, is a major contributor to that checkered economic \npicture, and it will not serve this Nation well.\n  So we can beat our breasts. We can beat our breasts and proclaim to \nthe highest heavens that we have eliminated the earmarks in this bill. \nBut that claim is false. The earmarks are there. They are a little \ndisguised perhaps, but they are there.\n  We can wave our swords and rejoice that we have slain the dragon of \nhighway demos in this bill. That claim is true. But, that dragon is not \na dragon at all, and slaying it will only result in the killing of the \neconomic hopes of rural states dependent on highways for prosperity.\n  Mr. President, Daniel Webster made my case in 1830 in his second \nreply to Hayne. On Tuesday, January 26, 1830, he said,\n\n       . . . I look upon a road over the Alleghanies--\n\n  He was talking about West Virginia except West Virginia was not a \nState at that time.\n\n       . . . I look upon a road over the Alleghanies--\n\n  This is not Robert C. Byrd talking; this is Daniel Webster, the god-\nlike Daniel.\n\n       . . . I look upon a road over the Alleghanies, a canal \n     round the falls of the Ohio, or a canal or railway from the \n     Atlantic to the Western waters.\n\n  He did not limit it to just one mode of transportation. He was \ntalking about them all. He said,\n\n       . . . I look upon a road over the Alleghanies, a canal \n     round the falls of the Ohio, or a canal or railway from the \n     Atlantic to the Western waters, as being an object large and \n     extensive enough to be fairly said to be for the common \n     benefit. . . . We [New Englanders] look upon the states, not \n     as separated, but as united . . . We do not impose \n     geographical limits to our patriotic feeling or regard; we do \n     not follow rivers and mountains, and lines of latitude, to \n     find boundaries, beyond which public improvements do not \n     benefit us . . . if I were to stand up here and ask, what \n     interest has Massachusetts in a railroad in South Carolina? I \n     should not be willing to face my constituents. These same \n     narrow-minded men would tell me, that they had sent me to act \n     for the whole country, and that one who possessed too little \n     comprehension, either of intellect or feeling, one who was \n     not large enough, both in mind and in heart, to embrace the \n     whole, was not fit to be entrusted with the interest of any \n     part.\n\n  That was Daniel Webster. O that we had Webster, or Clay, or both of \nthem in the Senate today. Or in the other body, because they saw beyond \nthe horizon. They saw beyond the geographical limitations, beyond the \nlines of latitude and the rivers and the ridges of the mountains. They \nsaw a great \n\n[[Page S16357]]\n\ncountry benefiting by that which benefited one part.\n  Mr. President, I do not ask others to vote against this conference \nreport. As I say, I support every mass transit earmark in the \nconference report. I support every bus and bus facility earmark in the \nconference report. I do not come to bury earmarks, Mr. President. I \ncome to praise them. But I will vote against this conference report.\n  We are one country, Mr. President, and we ought to have a \ntransportation policy that adequately addresses the needs of the whole \ncountry. The bill before us falls far short of that laudable goal.\n  I shall vote against this conference report in protest of the unwise \ntransportation policy that is embraced in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing earmarks \nprovided for bus and bus-related facilities, and one showing earmarks \nfor mass transit systems, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                     Bus and bus-related facilities\n\n       The conference agreement provides $333,000,000 for the \n     replacement, rehabilitation, and purchase of buses and \n     related equipment and the construction of bus-related \n     facilities.

The conferees \n     support the inclusion of the South-North corridor in the \n     Portland area program of interrelated projects and note that \n     a project financing plan, based on a discretionary (section \n     3) share of fifty percent of the total \n\n[[Page S16358]]\n\n     project costs, will be considered should the Portland region \n     seek funding for this project.\n\n\n                       orange county, california\n\n       The conferees are concerned with the delay of the Federal \n     Transit Administration in obligating the funds previously \n     provided in fiscal years 1994 and 1995 for the Orange County \n     Transitway project. The conferees are concerned that the FTA \n     may fail to recognize that the Anaheim Intermodal \n     Transportation Center is not an element of the Transitway \n     project. The conferees, therefore, direct the FTA to work \n     expeditiously to obligate these funds once all pending \n     planning and financial issues are addressed adequately.\n\n\n                              kansas city\n\n       Although no funds have been provided for the Kansas City, \n     Missouri light rail project, the conferees believe that based \n     on the results of the recently completed major investment \n     study, the project may have merit and therefore encourage \n     project sponsors to continue to seek federal support in the \n     future.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

The two blue \nvolumes, 1,839 pages, represent the House reconciliation bill.\n  These 1,839 pages that represent the House reconciliation bill were \ngiven 6 hours--all of 6 hours--of debate in the other body. Think of \nit, 6 hours! And the 1,862 pages in the Senate amendment were given 20 \nhours, plus 1 additional hour, I believe, on the Roth amendment, and a \nminute equally divided on each of various and sundry other amendments. \nSo there you have it, 1,862 pages, a little over 20 hours, parts of 4 \ndays in the Senate!\n  Now, who under God's vast Heaven knows what is in this bill? Not one \nSenator, not one Senator out of the 100 Senators, knew when he cast his \nvote for or against that monstrosity, not one knew what he was voting \non! No single committee held hearings on all of this. Different \ncommittees held different hearings on parts of it. But no committee \nperson, no committee chairman, no Member of the Senate, no staff person \nknew everything that Senators were voting on, and most Senators knew \nvery little about it. We simply rubberstamped the package that was sent \nto the Senate by the Senate Budget Committee, and not all of the \nmembers of that committee knew what they were sending to the Senate. Is \nthat legislating? Is that trick or treating?\n  Mr. President, those who wish to proclaim to the high heavens that \nthis is a great masterpiece will come to find that ``Confusion now hath \nmade his masterpiece,'' and the worm will turn! The American people are \ngoing to find out in due time about the Senate's handiwork and the \nhandiwork of the other body--what we passed for a law.\n  We might as well have been blindfolded. We might as well have had our \nears plugged. When a pile of paper like that is acted upon in the \ncourse of 42 hours--including time consumed by roll calls--under the \nrestrictions that govern the actions of the Senate on a reconciliation \nbill, how can one say that the Senate has not perpetrated a gigantic \nfraud upon the American people? The people send us here to know what we \nare doing, to know what we are voting on, and we did not. We did not. \nAnd God knows that in the heart of every Senator, that Senator has to \nadmit that he did not know what was in that bill. He knew a little here \nand a little there, but he did not know most of what is in that bill.\n  So there you have it. That is the colossal trick or treat of the \ncentury! Right there it is. Halloween came last Friday. It is over! The \nkids may go around tonight and pick up a little candy and chewing gum, \nhere and there, but the American people got theirs last Friday night!\n  Now the two bodies, the conferees of the two bodies have to meet and \ngo over all of this mass of wood pulp and try to make sense out of it \nand then bring back what will result from the conference, the \nresolution of the differences between the two bodies. And who knows \nwhat differences there are? We will have that conference report up \nbefore the Senate one day.\n  There is no legal requirement, there is no constitutional requirement \nthat I know of that says the Senate has to pass a reconciliation bill. \nShow me! I do not know of any. There is no doubt that there would be \nsome serious budgetary consequences that would flow from not having a \nreconciliation bill but we do not have to have one. All we have to do \nis pass the appropriations bills, raise the debt limit and go home.\n  Think of it! If we continue to go down that road, all we will need to \ndo is show up for a week, 10 days perhaps, during a whole year. Except \nfor the Byrd rule, if the Senate so instructs the committees, all the \ncommittees could just send to the Budget Committee--it is not the \nBudget Committee's fault--all the other committees could just send to \nthe Budget Committee whatever their pleasures might be, and the Budget \nCommittee would be forced to put all those into one massive bill, and \nwe could just pass that one bill and pass one omnibus appropriations \nbill and go home. Hot ziggedy dog, go home!\n  Just spend just a few days here, we have a few votes, go home! Just \npass one bill! Just rubber stamp whatever the Budget Committee is \nforced to send to the Senate floor. Rubber stamp it! That would be \nanother trick or treat for the American people.\n  Well, Mr. President, it seems to me it is preposterous to even claim \nthat we are legislating with any knowledge or wisdom of what we are \ndoing when we last week passed a bill like that. It was a joke we \nplayed on the American people--and a bad one.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank all Senators, and I \nyield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16358-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16358-S16359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKING SENATE STAFF\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the conference report has been the subject \nof praise and criticism and blame. Let me take this opportunity to \nexpress my appreciation and, I am sure, the Senate's appreciation to \nthe floor staff under the direction of the Secretary of the Senate, \nKelly Johnston, for the outstanding service that the floor staff \nprovided to the Senate during the lengthy debate on the reconciliation \nbill that was passed in the early hours of the morning on Saturday, \nOctober 28.\n  I commend the hard work and long hours of the legislative clerk, \nScott Bates, and his able assistant, David Tinsley, as well as the bill \nclerk, Kathie Alvarez. But most particularly, Mr. President, I applaud \nthe outstanding efforts of the office of the Parliamentarian of the \nSenate, the staff of very hard-working and dedicated professionals. \nThat office is under the supervision of the Senate Parliamentarian, Bob \nDove. And he is very ably assisted by Alan Frumin, Kevin Kayes, and \nBeth Smerko, as well as Sally Goffinet.\n  The reconciliation bill that the Senate adopted last week was a \nmassive and complicated omnibus bill. Many difficult rulings were \nrequired of the Parliamentarian, particularly in the context of the \noften maligned Byrd rule and the need to interpret the consistency or \nlack thereof of particular amendments with respect to the Byrd rule.\n  In many of these instances, proponents of amendments argued adamantly \nand with passion before the Parliamentarians that their amendments were \nrelevant under the Byrd \n\n[[Page S16359]]\n\nrule and, therefore, qualified for inclusion in the reconciliation \nbill. The opponents of such amendments argued just as strongly that a \nnumber of these amendments were extraneous or had no budgetary impact \nand, therefore, did not qualify for inclusion in the reconciliation \nbill.\n  The Parliamentarians had the very difficult task of reaching a final \ndetermination in questions such as these on the basis of their \ninterpretations of the requirements of the Budget Act in relation to \nthe Byrd rule as well as the precedents of the Senate in this regard. \nThis is a very difficult and thankless responsibility, which, to my \nknowledge, was carried out without exception on an objective and fair \nand equitable basis in every instance.\n  So I congratulate the Parliamentarians on their performance in \nconnection with the record-setting stream of amendments and the \ninterpretations that had to be determined in relation to many of them \nduring the debate on the reconciliation bill. The Senate and the \nAmerican people owe these hard-working professional staff members our \ndeep gratitude.\n  I would be recreant if I did not also compliment the majority leader, \nMr. Dole, and the minority leader, Mr. Daschle, and the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici and Mr. \nExon. The two managers of the bill demonstrated great skill, \nequanimity, and patience in their work.\n  The majority leader carried a heavy burden. I think he was fair. He \nwas hard driving, but he succeeded in overcoming the difficulties and \nproblems and was successful in getting Senate action on the bill.\n  Mr. Exon on this side did us all proud. He likewise was fair, \npatient, and is to be greatly commended.\n  Mr. Domenici is one of the brightest minds in this Senate. That was \nevidenced in the way he conducted himself during the markup and \nmanagement of the bill in the committee and on the floor.\n  And our own minority leader demonstrated great understanding and \nreached out to all of the members of the minority, as he always does, \nand, in my judgment, did a masterful job in his work on behalf of the \nminority and on behalf of the people that we represent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16358-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16359-S16364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to praise the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee. The conference report they have brought to Senate \ndemonstrates their hard work.\n  Although I would have dealt with some specific issues differently \nthan the conferees did, they deserve our praise.\n  However, Mr. President, I do want to comment specifically on a few \nmatters contained in the bill.\n  First, the House bill as passed contained numerous provisions making \nappropriations for certain projects contingent upon authorization. I am \ndisappointed that this language was dropped in conference.\n  If we are going to continue to appropriate funds for unauthorized \nprojects--I would hope that if such an appropriation is made subject to \nauthorization that such language will be preserved.\n  Second, I am also concerned that in certain accounts the funding \nlevels reported out of the conference are higher than the levels \napproved by either the Senate or the House. Reprioritization of funds \nin the conference in this manner does raise many legitimate concerns.\n  Third, the report to accompany the conferenced bill does contain \nnumerous earmarks not contained in the reports that accompanied either \nthe House or Senate bills. I raise this issue not to criticize, but \ninstead to emphasize for the record that such language does not have \nthe force of law, is not binding, and should only be considered as a \nrecommendation to the administration. I would hope the President and \nthe Secretary of Transportation would use their own judgment and spend \nthese funds in a fair, rational manner based on national priorities.\n  In past years the Transportation appropriations bill has been riddled \nwith earmarks and pork. I am pleased that this year's bill contains \nsubstantially fewer earmarks. To be certain, it does contain earmarks \nand some pork that I would like to have seen been dropped. But on the \nwhole, the bill deserves our praise and support.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport to the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.\n  I commend both the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Chairman Hatfield, and the chairman of the House \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Congressman Wolf, for \nbringing us a balanced bill considering current budget constraints.\n  The conference report provides $12.7 billion in budget authority and \n$11.9 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department of \nTransportation, including Federal-aid highway, mass transit, aviation, \nand maritime activities.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $13.1 billion in budget \nauthority [BA] and $37.3 billion in new outlays.\n  The subcommittee is $18 million in BA below its 602(b) allocation, \nand it is essentially at its outlay allocation.\n  I urge adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the final bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     TRANSPORTATION SUBCOMMITTEE--SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT    \n               [Fiscal year 1996, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Budget             \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.....................................         382     25,376\n  H.R. 2002, conference report...................      12,100     11,378\n  Scorekeeping adjustment........................  ..........  .........\n                                                  ----------------------\n    Subtotal nondefense discretionary............      12,482     36,754\n                                                  ======================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.....................................  ..........         60\n  H.R. 2002, conference report...................         582        521\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget Resolution assumptions.................           2         -0\n                                                  ----------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory.........................         584        581\n                                                  ======================\n      Adjusted bill total........................      13,066     37,335\n                                                  ======================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary..........................  ..........  .........\n  Nondefense discretionary.......................      12,500     36,754\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund.............  ..........  .........\n  Mandatory......................................         584        581\n                                                  ----------------------\n    Total allocation.............................      13,084     37,335\n                                                  ======================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n    Defense discretionary........................  ..........  .........\n    Nondefense discretionary.....................         -18         -0\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund...........  ..........  .........\n    Mandatory....................................  ..........  .........\n                                                  ----------------------\n      Total allocation...........................         -18         -0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I would like to ask the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee if he would \nengage in a brief colloquy with myself and my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, regarding a critical San Francisco Bay \narea transportation project.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would be pleased to address this issue with the \nSenators from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Tasman corridor light rail \nproject is an integral piece of the local rail agreement fashioned by \nour regional metropolitan planning organization, the Metropolitan \nTransportation Commission [MTC]. All of the bay area jurisdictions are \na party to this agreement which represents the best in local planning \nand decisionmaking. When \n\n[[Page S16360]]\n\nthe California Supreme Court on September 28, invalidated our so-called \nMeasure A, a half-cent sales tax dedicated to many important highway, \ncommuter rail and transit construction projects, the planned-for local \nmatch for the Tasman project appeared to be lost. Due to the \nperseverance of all involved, in the few short weeks since that ruling \nthe Tasman corridor plan has been revised to reflect the new fiscal \nrealities. It has been proposed that only the west extension to \nMountain View be built at this time. The 7.5-mile line will cost $125 \nmillion less than the original project, and only 50 percent of its \nfunding will be derived from Federal section 3 new start funds. Of the \n$122 million in proposed new starts funding, some $33 million has \nalready been appropriated and dedicated to the Tasman project by the \nMTC. The remainder of the funding will come from identified State, \nlocal and flexible Federal funding sources authorized under the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. This \nrevised plan has the unanimous support of Santa Clara County's Transit \nAgency Board, and I expect shortly will be approved by the MTC and \nlater included in the California Transportation Commission's revised \nState Transportation Improvement Program.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished chairman whether in view of \nthese positive developments, and in deference to the local and regional \nplanning process which has served us so well, he would agree to the \nfollowing: that if the revised Tasman project secures all requisite \nFederal, State, and regional approvals in a timely fashion, the $33 \nmillion in unobligated balances referenced in the conference report may \nbe provided by the MTC for the commencement of construction on the \nTasman west extension.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes, that is my understanding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chairman for his understanding and thoughtful \nresponse. At this time I would yield to my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, for additional comments.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I applaud the efforts of many in the bay area who \nmoved quickly after the court's ruling to make the necessary \nmodifications to the proposed Tasman corridor extension. This project \nis even more cost effective and compelling today and reflects creative \nland use planning and promising joint development opportunities. The \nbay area congressional delegation has rallied around this important \nproject. A similar colloquy occurred in the House with Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee Chairman Frank Wolf. Our efforts here today \nrepresent an important reaffirmation of the value of local and regional \nplanning and decision making, a focus consistent with the goals of \nISTEA and more likely to ensure timely and cost-effective project \ncompletion. I look forward to working with you, Chairman Hatfield, in \nmaking certain that the plan for the Tasman west extension is \nfinancially sound and continues to enjoy the broad-based support it has \nin the past.\n\n\n                       FERRY BOATS AND FISHERIES\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \naddress a section of the Transportation appropriations bill that speaks \nto Federal aid to highways. Specifically, I wish to point out that the \nSenate included $17 million for ferry boats and facilities.\n  My State of Alaska has critical needs for a functioning \ntransportation infrastructure. In the southeastern part of the State \nthis is accomplished with ferrys and aviation. As many Members know, \nthis part of Alaska has numerous isolated islands, and road systems \nthat are only local in nature. The extremely mountainous coastline \nprohibits the Alaskan southeastern towns, including the State Capitol \nof Juneau, from connecting to any other road system in North America. \nWhen the weather is bad, which is quite often in this part of the \nworld, aviation is of limited assistance.\n  Scheduled ferry service is of immeasurable assistance to the remote \nsoutheast towns. If available, a share of the $17 million would be \ndirected to enhancing the ferry system between the towns of Craig, \nWhale Pass, Blind Slough, and Wrangell.\n  I ask the Appropriations Committee chairman, Senator Hatfield, if it \nis his understanding that Alaska is a State that can avail itself of a \nshare of these ferry boats and facilities funds?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator from Alaska is correct. Alaska may apply \nfor a share of the $17 million dedicated to ferry boats and \nfacilities.\n\n\n                         essential air service\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the conference report we are \nconsidering today makes dramatic cuts in the essential air service \nprogram. In fact, the program will see an almost 30 percent cut in \nfunding this year--from over $30 million last year to $22.6 million \nthis year. The statutory language of the conference report maintains \nthe eligibility of EAS communities nationwide--the same number of \ncommunities that are eligible today will remain eligible next year.\n  Therefore, we have a situation where the same number of communities \nare eligible for EAS funding, yet far fewer dollars are available for \nthe program.\n  Mr. President, while I remain very concerned with the funding \nreduction for the EAS program, I am more concerned with language \nincluded in the statement of manager's report.\n  Language included in the statement of manager's report makes it clear \nthat all communities eligible for EAS funding in fiscal year 1995 \nremain eligible in fiscal year 1996. However, the language continues on \nto say that the Department ``may be required to make prorata reductions \nin the subsidy or daily/weekly service levels'' in order to meet the \nreduced funding level. In other words, the only discretion the \nDepartment has in meeting these funding reductions is an across-the-\nboard reduction in the level of air service of EAS communities.\n  This language ties the hands of the Department of Transportation. The \nstatement of managers language is being interpreted to be the only \nsolution available in meeting the reduction in funding.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the essential air service program is to \nprovide air service to rural, isolated communities. In my home State of \nMontana, our seven EAS communities are isolated. They are over 600 \nmiles from a medium or large hub airport. A reduction in air service to \nthese communities would be a real economic blow and would further \nisolate these folks.\n  I would ask my friend, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nif the intent of the conferees was to give the Secretary the discretion \nto determine the type of program that should exist with $22.6 million \nin funding--and the intent was not to place one option above another? \nThere may be other ways to reach this funding level without an across-\nthe-board reduction in the level of service and the Secretary should \nhave the ability to make decisions that would maintain the integrity of \nthe EAS program in the future.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would say to my friend, that the \nintent of the conferees was to continue to maintain the current \neligibility criteria for the essential air service program. However, \nthe decision on how the program should be structured with a reduced \nfunding level should be left to the discretion of the Secretary.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend. The Senator from Oregon \nunderstands the important rule that reliable air service plays in \nStates like Montana and I appreciate his efforts to preserve this \nprogram.\n  At a time when life in rural America is becoming increasingly \ndifficult, reliable air service is a vital link in our transportation \nnetwork. The essential air service program is just that--it is \nessential and its integrity should be maintained.\n  I thank my friend again.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the conference \nreport for the Department of Transportation appropriations bill \nincludes an appropriation of $20 million for capital improvements \nassociated with safety-related emergency repairs to Pennsylvania \nStation in New York City and its associated service building.\n  Pennsylvania Station is the busiest intermodal station in the Nation, \nwith almost 40 percent of Amtrak's passengers nationwide passing \nthrough every day. Unfortunately, it is also the most decrepit of the \nNortheast corridor stations, others of which, such as Washington, DC's \nown Union Station, have been renovated with Federal grants. Today, \nPennsylvania Station \n\n[[Page S16361]]\n\nhandles almost 500,000 riders a day in a subterranean complex that \ndemands improvement. According to the New York City Fire Commissioner, \nthere have been nine major fires at the station since 1987. Luckily, \nthese fires have occurred at off-hours; as it stands, the station could \nnot cope with an emergency when it is crowded with the 42,000 souls who \npass through every workday between 8 and 9 a.m. In addition, structural \nsteel in the station has shown its age and needs immediate repair. And \nthese are just the most pressing needs.\n  There is a redevelopment plan to change things for the better, a $315 \nmillion project to renovate the existing Pennsylvania Station and \nextend it partially into the neighboring historic James A. Farley Post \nOffice, almost doubling the emergency access to the station's platforms \nwhich lie far below street level beneath both buildings. Moreover, \nthere is a financing plan in place that could do this with $100 million \nfrom the Federal Government--with this bill, $51.5 million has already \nbeen appropriated--$100 million from the State and city, and $115 \nmillion from a combination of historic tax credits, bonds supported by \nrevenue from the project's retail component, and building shell \nimprovements by the Postal Service, owner of the James A. Farley \nBuilding. On August 31, 1995, Governor Pataki of New York chartered the \nPennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corp. to oversee the project, \nfollowing the signing of a memorandum of agreement by himself, Mayor \nGiuliani of New York City, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, and \nAmtrak President Thomas M. Downs.\n  Thanks to our colleagues on the Committee on Appropriations, $20 \nmillion can now be used immediately for pressing safety repairs at the \nexisting station and its associated service building, in the first step \nof the overall redevelopment effort. These Federal funds go toward \nconstruction, and they will count toward the Federal share of the $315 \nmillion project to transform the station into a complex capable of \nsafely handling the crowds that have made Pennsylvania Station the \nNation's busiest intermodal facility.\n  For myself and the 75 million other people a year who use the \nstation, I would like to thank all those who have labored hard to make \nthe station safer, in particular our colleagues Senator Hatfield, \nSenator Byrd, and Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I want to register my opposition to the \nprovisions of the Transportation appropriations conference report that \nexempt the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] from Government-wide \nprocurement and personnel rules. These provisions were included by the \nAppropriations Committee in the Senate passed bill at the \nrecommendation of the FAA and will take effect on April 1, 1996, unless \nthe Congress enacts preemptive FAA reform legislation before then.\n  The FAA asserts that these exemptions are necessary because personnel \nand procurement laws have stood in the way of modernizing the FAA's Air \nTraffic Control System. The FAA's failure to modernize the system, \nhowever, is not rooted in the Federal procurement and personnel \nsystems. Instead, it is a symptom of a widespread and serious \nmanagement deficiency which permeates the FAA. Numerous GAO reports and \nDOT Inspector General reports over the last 5 years have outlined the \nproblems the FAA has had in modernizing its air traffic control system. \nThese reports have consistently cited poor management, not the \nprocurement or personnel systems, as the primary cause of FAA's \nfailures.\n  I understand and share the frustration with the lack of progress at \nthe FAA. The air traffic control system designed to keep our skies safe \nis crumbling, and each failure of the system leads to a chorus of calls \nfor action. Regrettably, however, out of frustration at the FAA's \ninability to succeed in modernizing our air traffic control system, \nCongress is about to grant a special dispensation to an agency that has \nnot earned it and is ill-prepared to accept the responsibilities that \nsuch an exemption will require. If the FAA was better at managing than \ndenying there is a problem, defending its poor performance, and \ndeflecting criticism away from the agency, we would have replaced our \nair traffic control system years ago and would not have 1950's and \n1960's technology guiding our Nation's air traffic.\n  I have been working over the past 3 years to enable Federal agencies \nsuch as the FAA to more effectively incorporate advanced computer \ntechnology into its operations. Last year, I issued a report that \ndocumented how the Federal procurement process contributes to the \nGovernment buying outdated technology but also how poor FAA management \nled to the disaster of the present air traffic control system. \nSpecifically, FAA has failed in its modernization efforts, wasted \nbillions of taxpayer dollars and still has not been able to update its \ncomputer systems since the mid-1960's due to consistently poor \nmanagement. Meanwhile, the Nation's air traffic control system is \nwearing out. To keep the system running, the FAA must search Radio \nShack for spare parts and buy vacuum tubes from Third World \nmanufacturers because no one in the United States makes them anymore.\n  While it takes the Federal Government an average of 4 years compared \nto 1 year in the private sector to buy new technology, 30-year-old FAA \ncomputers are failing with increasing frequency in Chicago, Dallas, New \nYork and elsewhere across the country. While the Government's \nantiquated procurement rules definitely slow down the process and may \nadd years to computer buys, the rules do not explain why the FAA has \nnot modernized its systems in decades or explain how scores of other \nagencies have been able to work within the rules to replace antiquated \nvacuum tube computers and radars.\n  I am working to accomplish reforms to the Federal procurement system. \nThis year I introduced The Information Technology Management Reform Act \nof 1995 which was approved as an amendment to the fiscal year 1996 \nDefense authorization bill. The amendment includes significant changes \nto existing procurement regulations and procedures which would help \nagencies such as the FAA buy technology by providing relief from \ncumbersome requirements while ensuring a reasonable and responsible \napproach.\n  Among other provisions, the amendment repeals the Brooks Act, \nauthorizes commercial-like buying procedures, and emphasizes the \nresults of the procurement process rather than the process itself while \nholding agencies like the FAA accountable for their results. The Senate \nis now conferencing this amendment with the House proposed procurement \nreform bill put forward by Representatives Clinger and Spence. The \nHouse has proposed serious reform in the area of streamlining the \nprocurement process, conducting efficient competitions and making it \neasier to buy commercial products. I believe we will be successful in \ngetting these proposals enacted into law and these reforms will give \nFAA the flexibility to effectively buy the technology it needs.\n  These reforms, however, will not guarantee success. We can legislate \nthe framework for effective management to take place, but we cannot \nlegislate good management. While we need to reform the way the \nGovernment buys computers, the FAA's failure to modernize the air \ntraffic control system is not derived from legislated procurement and \npersonnel requirements. It is the lack of adequate planning and a \nconstantly changing road map of where the FAA is going that has impeded \ncompletion of the modernization effort. This is caused by managers not \nknowing what they want and continually changing program requirements \nwhich drives up the cost to the taxpayer.\n  The problem is that no one, including Congress, has ever held FAA's \nmanagers accountable for their failures. Management problems at FAA \nwill not be solved by the exemptions contained in the appropriations \nbill. To the contrary, I believe the exemptions will result in more \ncost and less results. The exemptions do nothing to deal with the \nfundamental problem of poor management at the FAA.\n  The proposed exemptions, in addition to lacking merit, also set a \ndangerous precedent. Having seen the FAA's success in avoiding \naccountability and obtaining special treatment, other agencies may seek \nsimilar legislative exemptions. If Congress acquiesces to these \npiecemeal approaches, the Federal Government will be plagued by \nconflicting and contradictory procurement laws and personnel systems \n\n[[Page S16362]]\n\n which will make it harder--not easier--to do business with the \nGovernment. Industry will have to learn literally hundreds of \nprocurement systems. The rational approach is to have one procurement \nsystem in the Government that addresses the problems which may be \nperceived to be unique to FAA, but are common in every agency.\n  This conference report undermines ongoing efforts to enact \nGovernment-wide procurement reform, as well as rewards inept management \nat the FAA with exemptions from oversight rules when they are most \nneeded. If the conference report is adopted, as I expect it will be, I \nurge the administration and FAA to use the new discretion authorized by \nthe bill wisely and I urge my colleagues to hold FAA accountable for \nits progress in modernizing the Nation's air traffic control system. By \nabsolving the FAA of its responsibility for past failures, Congress \nmust now provide greater oversight of what FAA does with its new \npowers.\n  The new authority under this bill will not go into effect if Congress \nenacts FAA reform legislation by April 1 of next year. When the \nCommerce Committee marks up its own bill to meet this deadline, I urge \nthe committee members to look at what the Congress and the \nadministration are doing to streamline the procurement process. They \nwill then see that we are fixing the procurement system on a Gov- \nernment-wide basis, and they can then focus on the real issue of \nmanagerial reform at FAA. For it is only through more effective \nmanagement that the FAA will be able to efficiently and effectively \nmodernize the air traffic control system and confront the other \nchallenges to aviation safety in the 21st century.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to draw attention to something \nthat is mysteriously missing from the conference report on the \nTransportation appropriations bill. The provision I am concerned about \ndoes not involve spending more or less money. Rather, I am concerned \nabout a provision that called for an important study to be done by the \nDepartment of Transportation on the question of air fares and whether \nor not rural areas are paying more and getting less service.\n  When the Senate considered this bill, an amendment I offered was \nadopted without any objections. That amendment, which was cosponsored \nby Senators Dole, Snowe, and Conrad would have required the Department \nof Transportation to conduct a study on air fares. There was no \nopposition expressed in the Senate and the Department itself supported \nthe study.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received from \nTransportation Secretary Fredrico Pena supporting this provision be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Secretary of Transportation,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: I am writing this letter in order to \n     endorse the study of air fares and service at small \n     communities that you recently proposed. Since many changes \n     have taken place within the airline industry since \n     deregulation and some of these have affected small \n     communities, I fully agree that a study of fares and service \n     at small communities would be beneficial. I am aware that the \n     General Accounting Office is currently conducting a similar \n     study of small community issues. However, I believe the \n     studies are somewhat different in their focus and I, \n     therefore, endorse your study.\n       Your recommended approach to the study would compare and \n     evaluate actual air fares and fares adjusted for distance for \n     service between nonhub airports and large hub airports with \n     fares for service between large hub airports. The study also \n     would analyze service at nonhub airports with respect to the \n     operations of regional and major airlines, the types of \n     equipment used, and the levels of competition among \n     commercial carriers.\n       In order to get a statistically valid comparison, it may be \n     necessary to conduct a survey of regional carriers to get a \n     more valid data set, which may require additional time to \n     conduct a thorough study. We will also endeavor to study the \n     overall fares paid at small communities compared to fares \n     paid at hub airports.\n       I look forward to working with you and your staff on this \n     project. If we may be of further assistance, please contact \n     me or Steven Palmer, Assistant Secretary for Governmental \n     Affairs, at (202) 366-4573.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Federico Pena.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. It seems to me that we need to make some changes in \naviation policy in this country and stop ignoring the fact that rural \nregions are suffering a serious decline in air service. The airline \nindustry has undergone many changes since deregulation in the early \n1980's. The invisible hand of competition replaced the assuring hand of \ngovernment in the aviation market-place. As a result, some areas of the \ncountry have seen lower prices and more choices in service. In other \nparts of the country, namely in rural areas, we have seen dramatic \nlosses in air service and higher prices.\n  I realize that the General Accounting Office has studied the impact \nthat deregulation has had on air fares in previous years. However, my \nsense is that air service is changing rapidly and it seems to me that \nmore examination of air fares, especially for small rural communities, \nis needed.\n  A November 1990 report on ``Deregulation and Trends in Airfares at \nSmall and Medium-Sized Communities,'' found that overall, average fares \nper passenger mile were more than 9 percent lower in 1988 than in 1979 \nat small and medium-sized airports and about 5 percent lower at \nairports serving large communities.\n  It seems to me that the Department of Transportation should be paying \nsome more attention to the problems of rural America when it comes to \nair service. Most experts in town and at the Department of \nTransportation have pledged allegiance to the god of deregulation. They \nespouse the great virtues of deregulation and the tremendous benefits \nthat the free market has brought in the form of more choices and lower \nair fares. They are right--but only half right. The fact is that the \nbenefits of deregulation are only the rosy part of the picture. The \nstory not being told enough is the negative effects deregulation has \nhad on smaller, rural communities.\n  I offered this amendment because it seems that it is very important \nthat the Department of Transportation begin focusing on the impact that \nderegulation has had on air service in rural areas. I am fully aware \nthat the General Accounting Office [GAO] is currently conducting a \nsimilar study. I support that but I also believe that we cannot be \nsatisfied with just having the GAO examining this issue.\n  The amendment I offered and the Senate adopted would have laid out \nspecific areas for the Department to study, including comparison of air \nfares in hub markets where there is a concentration of service with \nfares at competitive hub markets. In addition, this study would have \nconducted, for the first time I believe, an analysis on the level of \nservice that rural areas are receiving and document which rural markets \nhave had jet service replaced with turbo prop service.\n  Now this provision was mysteriously dropped, despite the fact that \nthe Department supported it and that it was cosponsored by a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators--including the majority leader. It makes no sense \nthat this provision was dropped.\n  This is one of the primary reasons why I am voting against this bill. \nI strongly believe that this amendment should have been included in the \nconference report and no reasonable explanation has been provided as to \nwhy it was dropped.\n  I also oppose this conference report because of the significant cuts \nto critical rural programs.\n\n\n                 essential air service [eas] reductions\n\n  The report cuts EAS by about $11 million from last year's level of \n$33 million. I think that these cuts are going to hurt and that a \npermanent funding mechanism needs to be found for the EAS program. \nHowever, before a permanent solution can be developed, it makes no \nsense to cut this program to this degree. The EAS program is making the \ndifference between air service and no air service in many rural \ncommunities. Cuts of this magnitude will certainly be felt.\n  I do not believe that cutting the EAS program is justifiable in light \nof the essential role this program plays in providing air service to \nrural America. Deregulation has benefited some highly traveled areas of \nthe country and rural areas have suffered. The EAS program was designed \nto protect rural areas and this bill strikes a critical blow at this \nimportant program.\n\n[[Page S16363]]\n\n\n\n             local rail freight assistance program restored\n\n  The Senate defeated an amendment offered by Senator Pressler to \nrestore funding for the Local Rail Freight Assistance program [LRFA]. \nThis program provides support to restore rail links that are likely to \nbe abandoned. It has been a very important program in my home state of \nNorth Dakota.\n  The LRFA program received $17 million last year, of which $6 million \nwas rescinded. Neither the House nor the Senate bill provided funding \nfor LRFA and the conference report does not provide any funding. \nAlthough I am pleased that the conference report included an amendment \nthat would authorize the State of North Dakota to spend $2.3 million to \nrestore a rail line in Wahpeton, ND, I do not support the elimination \nof this important program.\n\n\n                interstate commerce commission phase-out\n\n  The conference report provides for $13.4 million for one quarter for \nthe ICC for salaries and expenses and assumes that the ICC will be \neliminated and that legislation providing for the continuation of \nstatutory obligations under the jurisdiction of the ICC will be enacted \nthis year. The question as to what happens if the Congress fails to \npass such legislation has not been answered. The statutory obligations \nwill remain but the agency that has the sole jurisdiction to enforce \nthem will have no funding to enforce them.\n  It makes no sense to me that funding for the ICC should be eliminated \nbefore the Congress has provided for an efficient way to address the \nstatutory obligations that will continue to exist if the Commission is \neliminated.\n\n\n                   airport improvement program grants\n\n  The Report provides $1.45 billion in the grants-in-aid for airports \nprogram [AIP] instead of the $1.6 billion provided under the House bill \nand the $1.25 billion under the Senate bill. I am very concerned that \nthis level of funding will not be adequate to maintain safe airports \nand our Nation's transportation infrastructure is in danger of \ncrumbling at these funding levels.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Programs like EAS and LRFA are vitally important to rural areas--in \nfact, they are exclusively rural transportation programs. Both these \nprograms have been seriously cut and in the case of LRFA, eliminated.\n  At the same time, there is substantial support for transportation \nprograms designed to help urban areas, such as high speed rail and mass \ntransit. Examples include:\n  $115 million for the northeast corridor improvement program (instead \nof the $100 million provided by the Senate and $130 million provided by \nthe House).\n  $19.2 million for high speed rail studies, corridor planning, \ndevelopment, and demonstration (instead of the $10 million provided by \nthe House and $20 million provided by the Senate). These funds will be \nallocated to Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, and New York.\n  The report provides for $42 million for the Federal Transit \nAdministration (FTA does have some rural programs but urban areas \nprimarily benefit from mass transit). In addition, the report provides \n$85 million for transit planning and research.\n  Mr. President, this legislation reflects the wrong priorities for \nthis country's transportation needs and that is why I am voting against \nthis legislation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am voting ``aye'' today on the \nconference report on transportation appropriations for fiscal year \n1996. But I must say that it is not without disappointment that we have \nnot fulfilled our responsibility to maintain and enhance the \ntransportation infrastructure in the United States.\n  It is a status quo budget for the most part of my State of \nCalifornia, and that means we are continuing to fall behind our needs \nto repair our highways, transit systems and airports. That failure also \nmeans that we cannot fulfill our potential economic productivity. That \nis a loss for our Nation as well as my State.\n  Nevertheless, in this extremely tight budget year the conference \nagreement does provide some needed assistance for California.\n  I am pleased to see that the conferees were able to increase funding \nfor the Federal Aviation Administration, particularly in the areas of \nfacilities and equipment. The operations budget in the conference \nagreement is higher than the amount funded in either the Senate or \nHouse bills. California is the site of several major air traffic \ncontrol installations and we must continue to upgrade this critical \nequipment. I appreciate the conferees support for the FAA's operating \nbudget for air traffic control operations and maintenance activities \nwhich enhance aviation safety and security.\n  Highway funding has increased overall, but unfortunately it is still \nstagnant for California, the State that has contributed the most to the \nHighway Trust Fund for nearly 40 years.\n  The agreement includes significant funding for new buses and \nintermodal transportation centers in California.\n  These include $500,000 for the Sunline Transit System, which has a \nremarkable program promoting a total fleet of natural gas buses; $1.5 \nmillion for needed bus replacement and parts for Long Beach Transit; $8 \nmillion to complete the Gateway intermodal center in Los Angeles; $5 \nmillion for the San Ysidro Intermodal Center in San Diego to help \nrelieve worsening congestion at our international border; $6.7 million \nfor new buses throughout the bay area, plus $2.3 million for bay area \nparatransit buses and other improvements to help the disabled; $9.75 \nmillion for Foothills Transit in the San Gabriel Valley; $5.3 million \nfor clean fuel buses, paratransit buses, and other improvements for the \ngrowing San Joaquin Rapid Transit District; $1.5 million to replace a \nbus facility destroyed by the Loma Prieta earthquake and provide \nconsolidated services in Santa Cruz; $1.2 million for park and ride \nfacilities on congested U.S. 101 in Sonoma County; $600,000 for a bus \nfacility in Ventura County; and $1.5 million to purchase buses for Yolo \nCounty.\n\n  The conference agreement also provides $5 million for the advanced \ntechnology transit bus, under development by Northrop and the Los \nAngeles MTA. Although the amount is less than the President's request, \nI appreciate the continuing support for this project by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I am very concerned over a loss of approximately $100 million in \ntransit system funding. A great part of this loss is attributable to \nthe cuts in operating assistance in both Houses and to a dramatic cut \nin funding for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority's \nRed Line extension.\n  I share the Appropriations Committee's concern over the management of \nthis project. However, I believe the MTA has grasped the gravity of \nthese problems and has taken demonstrable steps to correct them. I am \npleased the Senate committee members agreed to our requests to increase \nthe funding from $45 million for the project in the Senate bill to $85 \nmillion in the final conference report.\n  I am, however, disappointed at the cut in funding for the bay area \nrail extension program. The final agreement of $10 million for the bay \narea rapid transit district is well below the Senate level of $22.6 \nmillion. This cut was not justified considering the major local match \nprovided for rail extension in the region and the willingness of the \ndistrict to reduce its airport extension project by $200 million this \nsummer.\n  Finally, I regret that the conference committee was unable to provide \nassistance for the Alameda Transportation Corridor project to \nconsolidate rail and highway access to the ports of Los Angeles and \nLong Beach, eliminating more than 200 grade crossings. We have asked \nfor appropriations seed money to enable the project to take advantage \nof the Federal infrastructure bank already authorized under section \n1105 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act \n[ISTEA]. The Senate committee adopted a State infrastructure bank \nalternative instead and then dropped the idea in conference with the \nHouse.\n  California has 15,000 miles of State highways, 675 miles of rail \ntransit, and 10,000 buses. California's State Transportation \nImprovement Program faces a $5 billion shortfall, and an annual highway \nand road maintenance deficit of $800 millilon. We are in danger of \nlosing what we have. There is a lot of talk about how huge budget \ndeficits leave a horrible inheritance for our children, and I agree. \nHowever, a decayed and crumbling infrastructure is no less horrible for \nour children to inherit.\n\n[[Page S16364]]\n\n  The bill is still due. The infrastructure deficit is increasing. But \ntoday we only provide a partial payment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on behalf of Mr. Dole, the majority leader, \nI ask unanimous consent that the vote on the adoption of the \ntransportation conference report occur at 2:15 p.m. today and that \nparagraph 4 of rule 12 be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16359-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16364-S16366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE CONSERVATION TITLE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, it is my pleasure today to introduce a \nbill with the distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, the chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar, and the chairman of \nthe Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Senator Craig. This bill \namends the conservation title of the farm bill that will be considered \nlater in this Congress.\n  Madam President, my experience with this legislation that has been on \nthe books for the last 10 years has generally been very favorable. I \nsay that as a farmer, and I say that as a person who visits, as I have \noccasion to do now, at harvest time with my neighbors at the local New \nHartford cooperative grain elevator in my State of Iowa; I say that \nwith 10 years of experience of having hundreds of town meetings around \nmy State, whereas, I do not find much opposition to what we passed 10 \nyears ago.\n  So my legislation that we are introducing is not finding fault in any \nway with the basic premise of the legislation 10 years ago, but to make \nsure that that legislation fits, with the premise that existed 10 years \nago, the intent of Congress at that particular time; and also at a time \nwhen we are in the process of cutting back Government support for \nagriculture, as we intend to balance the budget.\n  Last week, as you remember, the Senate approved the reconciliation \nbill, and that will bring the Federal budget into balance by the year \n2002. And we do not wait until 2002 to start that. We started that last \nfiscal year when, earlier this calendar year, we passed the rescissions \nbill.\n  Now, in order to achieve the savings necessary to balance the budget, \nmany difficult decisions had to be made, many difficult votes had to be \ncast, and all Federal programs were examined to save money. The farm \nprograms, then, were no exception. Throughout the entire budget \nprocess, I have argued that farmers are willing to share in the effort \nto balance the budget because they have a lot to gain if the budget is \nbalanced. However, I do feel that it is vital to rural America and \nfamily farmers that any cut in farm programs be coupled with, on the \nfirst hand, tax reform, and on the second, a reduction in the \nregulatory burden placed on farmers.\n  I want to emphasize, with regard to the legislation of 1985, the soil \nconservancy provisions and the antiswampbusting, antisodbusting \nprovisions. When I talk about regulatory reform, I do not mean changing \nthe original intent of that legislation. I simply mean in keeping the \nenforcement of that legislation to its original intent.\n\n  Put simply, then, Madam President, this bill will dramatically cut \nthe red-tape and the regulations that farmers have to deal with while \ncontinuing, then, to maintain the conservation gains that we have made \nsince the passage of the 1985 legislation.\n  I want to emphasize, regardless of the rhetoric you may hear, this \nbill does not jeopardize in any way the environment or the conservation \ngains that farmers have made since 1985. These conservation gains have \nbeen tremendous.\n  They have been made basically because of a timeframe that farmers \ncould adjust economically to the requirements of the law and an \nopportunity to educate people about the process so that it could be \nself-enforcing.\n  What this bill does, then, is give farmers and the Department of \nAgriculture additional tools and flexibility to meet these conservation \nobjectives.\n  Madam President, the bill addresses four major areas within the \nconservation title. What is called a CRP program, the conservation \nreserve program, the wetlands reserve provision, the conservation \ncompliance provisions and swampbuster.\n  I want to briefly discuss those areas as it relates to the reforms \nthat the four of us--Senator Dole, myself, Senator Lugar, and Senator \nCraig--propose.\n  Madam President, since the 1985 farm bill, farmers participating in \nthe farm program have been required to comply with two regulatory \nmandates regarding conservation. The program referred to as the \nswampbuster program prohibits farmers from converting wetlands for crop \nproduction. No argument with that.\n  The program referred to as the sodbuster prohibits farmers from \nproducing a crop on highly erodible land unless they comply with an \napproved conservation plan. It does not mean you cannot operate your \nfarm the way you want to, but it does mean that if you do it you will \ndo it in a way that shows good stewardship of the soil. Also, good \nstewardship of the soil means better economic return; most importantly, \na good resource for future generations is preserved.\n  In general, the sodbuster program has been received favorably by \nfarmers, and the compliance rate has been very high. Again, I want to \nemphasize that. That is what I hear on Saturdays when I take grain to \nthe local New Hartford cooperative grain elevator where I visit with my \nneighbors, but it is also something I hear in 99 counties around Iowa \nthat I hold town meetings in each year.\n  That is because in Iowa there has been a willingness to cooperate. \nThere has also been some lever--if you want to participate in a farm \nprogram, you have to have good soil conservation practices or you will \nnot get the safety net of agriculture. Compliance has been very, very \ngood because it is estimated in my State that 95 percent or better of \nfarmers have compliance with soil conservation plans.\n  These are plans that they have determined will cut down on erosion on \ntheir own farm, and all they have to do is get that plan approved and \nthen farm according to what they felt was a plan that would best fit \ntheir farming operation.\n  This is not one-size-fits-all approach. If you got 98,000 different \nfarming units in the State of Iowa, you would have 98,000 different \nindividual plans. Quite frankly, there is probably more than that. \nThere must be, I guess. Anyway, there are that many individual farming \noperations. But you could have more than that number of plans.\n  Now, after 10 years of working with the program, it is obvious that \nimprovements can be made to streamline the regulations and give more \nflexibility to both the farmer and the Department of Agriculture.\n  Even more significantly, Madam President, this bill attempts to put \nNatural Resource Conservation Service, which used to be known as Soil \nConservation Service from the 1920's, until 2 years ago, it will put \nthis segment of the Department of Agriculture back into the position of \nworking with farmers instead of working against them.\n  Let me digress for a minute to explain that this situation now is \nkind of contentious between the farmers and Soil Conservation Service. \nIt used to be you go into the Office of the Soil Conservation Service. \nYou would sit down across from the desk of these State and Federal \nemployees, and you go in and say to them, ``Joe, I have a problem here \non my farm. I have this tremendous amount of erosion here. What can I \ndo about it?'' Joe, being an expert trained in soil conservation would \nsay to Chuck Grassley, ``Well, I think this is what you need to do. You \ncan do it this way, that is less expensive and might be able to \naccomplish the goal, or you can put in terraces, much more \n\n[[Page S16365]]\n\nexpensive, but you will be able to accomplish this. Or there are \ncertain tillage practices you can do that might accomplish the same \ngoal.''\n  Probably Joe would come out to your farm another day and would put \nflags out in the field saying this is where you have to put contour \nstrips, or this is where you have to put terraces.\n  It was seen very much as a cooperative, working relationship as you \nwould sit across the desk from Joe at the county seat Soil Conservation \nService.\n  Today, farmers do not want to go in to the Soil Conservation Service \nand sit down across from Joe because they might bring up something that \ntriggers to Joe, who is now a regulator rather than a consultant and a \nfriend, that maybe Chuck Grassley did something that violated the law \nand he can be punished for it.\n  So we want to get this relationship reestablished as a cooperative \nrelationship, a friendly relationship where this person is going to be \na consoler and a help to the farmer rather than somebody who is seen as \nan enemy.\n  I just described to you how farmers in my State and most States work \nvery closely with the Soil Conservation Service for six decades--60 \nyears. Much of the progress made in conservation on farmland is due to \nthat good working relationship between the farmer and the Department of \nAgriculture. It was a relationship based on trust and cooperation.\n  Unfortunately, as I indicated, in the last few years, the farmers \nhave begun to look at people that are now named the National Resource \nConservation Service--not the Soil Conservation Service--as a potential \nadversary.\n  Some farmers are reluctant to call on the NRCS for assistance due to \nthe fear of being penalized for a possible violation.\n  On the other hand, the NRCS has had its hands tied to some extent, \nboth by Congress and its own regulations. So we have contributed some \nto this problem that exists of this relationship of where neighbor \ncould be helping neighbor.\n  So, Madam President, this situation cannot continue to exist. It is \nnot good for the farmer. It is not good for the NRCS. Most importantly, \nit is not good for the environment.\n  There must be a renewal of a partnership between the farmer and the \nNRCS if we expect the gains in conservation on private property to \ncontinue.\n  The NRCS must work with farmers to assist them, to educate them, \ninstead of just regulating farmers. I sincerely believe, Madam \nPresident, that the NRCS wants to play this role as a farmer's helper \nand this legislation shows that we want to help them do that.\n  Madam President, now I want to turn to the swampbuster provisions--\nthe issues of wetland protection.\n  It has become a very emotional issue in my State. Not because the \noriginal legislation in 1985 was wrong, it is what bureaucrats have \ntried to do with it, probably in just the last 3 or 4 years.\n  While farmers share the goal of protecting valuable wetlands, the \nscope of swampbuster has been extended far beyond its original intent \nthrough the rulemaking process to the detriment of what farmers have \nwanted to do, sharing this goal. A study of the legislative history \nshows that Congress never intended to regulate land that had been \ncropped regularly in the past.\n  Just think, on a century farm--which means it has been in the same \nfamily for over 100 years--until a couple of years ago you could have \nnot had any problems, if that land had been regularly producing, or \nattempting to produce for a farmer. But now you can have problems. \nThere is another problem. That land that had been converted prior to \nthe passage of the 1985 act was never intended to be regulated. Both of \nthese principles have been eroded through regulation and agency action, \nnot through the basic legislation. This bill restores the original \nintent of Congress. The bill removes from swampbuster regulation land \nthat has been cropped at least 6 out of the last 10 years.\n  The bill also eliminates the concept of abandonment--a regulatory \nconcept, not a statutory one--that has been used by the Department to \nbring prior converted lands back under swampbuster regulation. In other \nwords, we pass the bill, it takes effect on December 28, 1985, and \neverything that happened before then was history. But not to \nregulators. They will use some devious means to get back to affect \nsomething that took place prior to that magic date.\n  So, this bill sets a 1-acre minimum for wetland regulation. And most \nof the conflict here, that has happened between the farmers and the \nNRCS, has occurred because the Government has literally attempted to \nregulate every acre of farmland under the farm program. This 1-acre \nminimum also corresponds with the Army Corps of Engineers' general \npermit for nonagricultural property.\n  Just explain to me how we, as a Congress, making law so that the law \napplies equally across the country to different segments of the economy \nin the same way, can have the Army Corps of Engineers in \nnonagricultural land, with something less than 1 acre not being \nregulated and probably not producing any food for the city slickers of \nthis country, and go over here to agricultural land administered by a \ndifferent agency and say 1 square foot of wetland can be regulated.\n  We, again, go back to the intent of Congress not to be nitpicking in \n1985. This 1-acre minimum, in conformance with the way it is for the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, ought to solve our problem. It will be \nperfectly consistent.\n  Madam President, even though the bill is intended to restore the \noriginal intent of Congress on swampbusters, some in the environmental \ncommunity may criticize these provisions because they want this \nexpansion through regulation and administrative edict beyond what the \noriginal 1985 law intended. So I want to say to those who criticize our \nmotives that we agree that the protection of wetlands should be a \npriority and it should be encouraged. But reasonable people can differ \non the means of accomplishing this goal. When the Government is \nattempting to regulate private property it is vital that the landowner \nhave the proper incentives in order to voluntarily satisfy the policy \ngoals. So this bill provides for several tools that can be used by \nfarmers to voluntarily protect wetlands.\n  If you do not think that this works, voluntarily protecting wetlands, \nthere has been a massive amount of agricultural land at the incentive \nof the farmer to put it into wetlands, that have come in under this \nvoluntary program. Tens of thousands of acres have gone into wetlands \nbecause the farmers have wanted to put it there.\n  So this bill, first, expands the existing mitigation provisions and \nencourages farmers to restore, enhance and create new wetlands. Second, \nthe bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to pursue mitigation \nbanking, so that farmers will finally be on the same playing field as \nother landowners. Both of these mitigation provisions ensure that new \nwetlands will continue to be created.\n  Last, the bill permits up to 1.5 million acres of cropped wetlands \ninto the Conservation Reserve Program, that is the CRP. So this a \nstrong incentive for farmers to continue to protect valuable wetlands. \nThis provision, along with the reauthorization of the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram, is indicative of this bill's commitment and its sponsors'--\nDole, Craig, Grassley, Lugar--to protecting wetlands on private \nproperty.\n  This bill also focuses on a renewed commitment to water quality \nprotection. The conservation reserve provisions of the bill establish \nwater quality as a coequal criterion with soil erosion for determining \neligible lands. Furthermore, at least 1.5 million acres of filter \nstrips, grass waterways and other riparian areas will be enrolled in \nthe program.\n  These modifications to the CRP will allow farmers to play an active \nrole in protecting water quality in the rural areas.\n  So, before closing, I want to just add that all of us share the goal \nof conserving soil, improving water quality, enhancing wildlife, and \nprotecting wetlands. In fact, the farmers themselves have the highest \nstake in conserving the land because there is better economic return, \nthere is a responsibility to be a steward for the next generation, and \nbesides, it is a very pretty picture, to have good farmland with good \nconservation practices. It is just beautiful, from an aesthetic \nstandpoint.\n\n[[Page S16366]]\n\n  But the land is our livelihood and most of us farmers know that we \nwant to pass the land on to our children and our grandchildren.\n  Sometimes public servants here in Washington who are elected, and \nbureaucrats who were unelected, forget that the farmers want to do the \nright thing and that right thing is to protect the environment. The \nunelected bureaucrats also forget that we are dealing with private \nproperty and that private property rights are truly the foundation on \nwhich freedoms are built--political freedoms, primarily.\n  So there must be a balance between the regulatory limits placed on \nfarmers and their private property rights. I believe this bill strikes \nthis delicate balance in a way that will continue to preserve this \nNation's most valuable natural resources, our farmlands.\n  Before yielding the floor, I thank Senator Dole, Senator Craig, and \nSenator Lugar for working on this bill with me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me first of all associate myself with \nthe remarks of the Senator from Iowa in the introduction of the \nlegislation that he has just, in a very thoughtful and important way, \ngone through for the Record and for the American people.\n  I think the Senator from Iowa said something very important a few \nmoments ago that is oftentimes missed. He is a farmer. I am a former \nfarmer and rancher.\n  And he, I, Senator Dole, and Senator Lugar, who also have farm \nheritage and background owning farmland, recognize the phenomenal \nvaluable asset this land is to the American people. Farmers have been \nforemost, along with ranchers, environmentalists and conservationists.\n  The legislation we have introduced today speaks to those interests in \nrecognizing the important balance between conserving the land, \nprotecting water quality, ensuring the environment, and allowing a \nproductive environment also for the purposes of being able to farm in a \nprofitable manner.\n  I think this legislation does it, and it allows the farmer once again \nto take the initiative with USDA and its affiliate agencies as those \nwho cooperate instead of regulators, as the Senator so clearly spoke \nof.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Craig pertaining to the introduction of S. 1368 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise this morning to comment on \ndevelopments in the former Yugoslavia.\n  I particularly want to comment on a resolution, House Resolution 247, \nwhich was adopted last night in the other body.\n  Madam President, I say respectfully that there are two parts to this \nresolution. The first I disagree with. The second I think is \nunnecessary.\n  I rise to make the point that as the representatives, the Presidents \nof the three major parties to the war in Bosnia, Bosnians, Croatians, \nSerbians--gather in Dayton, OH, to begin the effort that many thought \nwas impossible--to negotiate a peace treaty in the Balkans--that it is \nappropriate for us to step back. It is a time not to pass resolutions, \nin my opinion. It is a time to ask questions that are appropriate about \nthe course of the negotiations. But it is primarily a time to give the \nnegotiators some room to see if they can achieve an agreement that will \nbring peace to the former Yugoslavia.\n  Madam President, I rise to explain why I am troubled by this \nresolution, and what I hope will be the course of congressional action \nhere. Let me begin with recent events.\n  The people of the former Yugoslavia have suffered almost unimaginable \nhorrors for the last several years. Every day seems to bring new \nreports of genocidal acts in Bosnia.\n  In the past week alone we have seen disclosures which are chilling, \nthat confirm our worst suspicions about the fate of so many people who \nlived in the alleged safe haven of Srebrenica, who were driven from \ntheir homes and now, according to eyewitness testimony, were \nslaughtered by Serb forces; according to some accounts, in the presence \nof, perhaps at the direction of, General Mladic, the commander of the \nBosnian Serb forces already indicted by the international war crimes \ntribunal.\n  New reports highlight ethnic cleansing and genocide by the Serbs in \nthe area of Banja Luka which continues even now although these reports \nare sketchy because the international media has been denied access to \nthese locations.\n  Madam President, last week Assistant Secretary of State for Human \nRights John Shattuck was in Bosnia and Croatia to investigate the \nreports that have come out of the region. He found that prison camps \nsuch as Keraterm--the site several years ago of outrageous human rights \nviolations--have been reopened. A cease-fire is declared but a prison \ncamp is reopened, the site of torture has been reopened. He found that \npeople had been forced from their homes in Banja Luka, some sent to \nprison camps, some sent into forced labor, and apparently too many \nothers murdered, slaughtered, especially in the Sanski Most and \nBosanski Novi areas around Banja Luka.\n  Assistant Secretary Shattuck met in Belgrade with President Milosevic \nand demanded immediate and unconditional access to all missing persons \nand to areas where crimes have or may have been committed.\n  He also discussed the situation of refugees from the Krajina. Several \nthousand Croatian citizens of Serb background want to return to their \nhomes there. Shattuck found indicators of a human rights situation \nwhich is nearly out of control with people of all ethnic backgrounds \nbeing dislocated, persecuted and murdered, not for what they have done \nbut simply for who they are.\n  We cannot let the frequency, the regularity of these reports of \nsystematic campaigns of rape and terror numb us to these atrocities. We \nmust express our outrage as we did when we first heard these reports \nyears ago. We must recommit ourselves to bringing the genocide, the \ntorture, the rape, the slaughter to an end and to bring those \nresponsible for this barbarity to justice.\n  Last week, I was privileged to join with the distinguished occupant \nof the chair, Senator Hutchison, of Texas, and our colleagues Senators \nMcCain, Levin, Thurmond, and others, in offering a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate on this human rights, this life and \ndeath crisis. The resolution was unanimously adopted as an amendment to \nthe budget reconciliation bill last Friday.\n  Let me go to the words of that resolution because we spoke clearly \nand unanimously to ``condemn the systematic human rights abuses against \nthe people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.''\n  We spoke unanimously to demand that the Bosnian Serb leadership \n``should immediately halt these atrocities, fully account for the \nmissing, and allow those who have been separated to return to their \nfamilies.''\n  These are words that describe a situation that we can only imagine. \nIt is hard for us to put ourselves into. But men and boys separated \nfrom mothers and daughters. Where are they going? What will become of \nthem? We now find, certainly in Srebrenica, that what became of them \nwas that they were slaughtered and buried in mass graves.\n  Again last week in the resolution promulgated by the occupant of the \nchair, Senator Hutchison, we spoke unanimously to assert that ```ethnic \ncleansing' by any faction, group, leader or government is unjustified, \nimmoral and illegal and all perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against \nhumanity, genocide and other human rights violations in former \nYugoslavia must be held accountable.''\n  Every side in the Bosnian conflict bears some guilt, some \nresponsibility \n\n[[Page S16367]]\n\nfor ethnic violence. The Serbs of Bosnia and of Serbia-Montenegro, the \nCroats of Bosnia and of Croatia, rebel Moslems in northwest Bosnia, \neven Bosnian Government forces have inflicted war on civilian \npopulations and driven people from their homes. But there can be no \ndoubt that now, as throughout the years of war and strife suffered by \nthe Bosnian people, the Serbs are primarily responsible and have \ncommitted the most heinous and brutal crimes.\n  America must do all that it can to end these atrocities and to ensure \nthat the guilty are punished without supporting retribution and \nallowing the cycle of violence to continue. The international community \nhas put in place a mechanism to do this--the War Crimes Tribunal for \nformer Yugoslavia.\n  Earlier this month in Storrs, CT, at a dedication ceremony for the \nThomas J. Dodd Library and Research Center to preserve the memories of \nthe Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal 50 years ago, President Clinton said: \n``Those accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide \nmust be brought to justice. They must be tried and, if found guilty, \nthey must be held accountable.'' I agree wholeheartedly with the \nPresident as I know my colleagues do.\n   Madam President, in some substantial degree the latest horrific \nstories of mass slaughter from Srebrenica, reflected in the resolution \nadopted unanimously on Friday evening, remind us of why so many of us \nin this Chamber have been concerned about the course of events in the \nformer Yugoslavia. As I saw these events, and others agreed--some did \nnot--from the beginning this has been a case of aggression by Serbia, \nstimulated in fact from Belgrade. Perhaps it went beyond what Belgrade \nsought, what Belgrade expected. Perhaps Belgrade was forced to suffer \nmore than they expected because of the economic sanctions. But this has \nbeen a course of aggression to build a greater Serbia using genocidal \ntactics as a means of that aggression.\n  What did that mean? Again, one nation in Europe invading another, \ncommitting genocidal acts based on the religion of a people, in this \ncase Moslem; instability in Europe, at a post-cold war time when that \ninstability could spread, if not checked, throughout the Balkans, \ninvolving other countries--Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Albania--and \nsending a terrible message to those who had lived within the former \nSoviet Union about the lack of concern or unwillingness to act by the \nworld, by the powers in Europe, by NATO.\n  So, many of us called for a policy of ``lift and strike.'' Lift the \narms embargo. At least give the people of Bosnia the weapons with which \nto defend themselves and then use NATO air power to strike at the Serbs \nto make them pay for the aggression and for the genocide. For too long \nno one listened. Excuses were given. But ultimately, a resolution \npassed this Chamber and the House, overwhelmingly, with bipartisan \nsupport, calling for our Government to lift the arms embargo \nunilaterally if the world community was not prepared to do so \nmultilaterally.\n  Then came the Croatian invasion and capture of the Krajina. The \noutrageous, the unspeakable murders at Srebrenica--an army attacking an \nunarmed safe haven, U.N. peacekeepers from the Netherlands left in a \nhorrible middle position--ultimately aroused the conscience of the \nworld and particularly the NATO powers leading to the extremely \nsuccessful NATO airstrikes against Serbian targets, poignantly forcing \nus to raise the question of whether those airstrikes, if they had \nhappened at an earlier time, could have prevented some of the slaughter \nthat occurred. Because once leadership was exercised and power was \nbrought to bear, and those who were the aggressors were forced to \nsuffer some pain and humiliation, the road to peace was opened. \nAssistant Secretary Holbrooke has moved skillfully, aggressively in \ndifficult circumstances to find some common ground among the parties to \nbring about a cease-fire that now leads us to the discussions occurring \nin Dayton, OH, that begin tomorrow.\n  Some rightly have questioned the idea of negotiating with Serb \nleaders who may themselves be guilty of war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity. If we hope to reach a settlement which will bring the Bosnian \nconflict to an end, it may be that we have no choice but to negotiate \nwith Serb leaders. No one should misconstrue these negotiations as \nexcusing, forgiving or forgetting war crimes which have been committed. \nWe are doing none of that. Those who have committed war crimes with \ntheir acts or their orders will be brought to justice.\n  Moreover, before real negotiations can begin, the Serbs must be \nrequired to stop ethnic cleansing and other atrocities which are still \ntaking place. This is not an unrealistic or unwarranted precondition, \nbut a test of whether these negotiations can achieve peace. If one \nparty or another chooses to continue to propagate the war or undertakes \nor tolerates ethnic cleansing, then we are not dealing with leaders who \nwant peace.\n  If these leaders do not control their own forces and cannot restore \nan order which prevents further atrocities and turns the guilty over \nfor punishment, then how can these leaders implement a negotiated \nsettlement in which territory will change hands but the rights of all \npeople will be respected?\n  But if those leaders gathering in Dayton do stop the fighting and the \natrocities, we must give them every opportunity to achieve a negotiated \nsettlement. We owe this to those who have already died, but more \nimportantly to those who still live and who want to live in peace.\n  The settlement which eventually comes from these negotiations may not \nbe what some of us would like, but we should not second-guess the \ndecisions of those who will make them and who are willing to live with \nthe results. However, a few elements will be key to any viable \nsettlement:\n  To give reconciliation a chance, there must be real protection for \nhuman rights.\n  To provide hope for full reintegration of a multiethnic Bosnian \nstate, there must be significant unity through a meaningful Bosnian \ncentral government.\n  To ensure long-term stability, a regional military balance must be \nensured--not just within Bosnia, but among Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia. \nThis will probably require both arms control and reductions as well as \narming and training the Bosnians.\n  Finally, to ensure justice without retribution, the settlement must \nrequire all states of the former Yugoslavia--Serbia-Montenegro and \nCroatia as well as all parties in Bosnia--to fully cooperate with the \nWar Crimes Tribunal and to comply with its indictments and decisions. \nThere can be no amnesty, no refuge for any guilty party. As President \nClinton said in Storrs, CT, ``There must be peace for justice to \nprevail, but there must be justice when peace prevails.''\n  Madam President, the question of whether there will be a peace treaty \ndepends on the three nations that are gathered there under American \nauspices in Dayton, OH. If they achieve a peace agreement and open the \ndoor to the end of this slaughter, and present an opportunity to \npreserve the stability in Europe--remember again, why are we \ninterested? Twice in this century aggression and genocide unchecked in \nEurope led to wider war. But if a peace treaty is agreed on, it is \nclear that NATO forces will be needed to implement that peace treaty to \nmonitor, to keep the parties apart.\n  Let us be clear that we are on the eve of proximity talks and the \nprospect of peace because the United States exercised leadership and \npower and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercised power \nthrough discriminate and carefully planned air strikes. United States \nleadership and NATO bombing against the Bosnian Serb aggressors were \nabsolutely essential to bringing all sides to the peace process. But \nour involvement cannot end there.\n  U.S. leadership and involvement by the United States and NATO will be \nessential to the successful implementation of a settlement. The United \nStates cannot bring the parties this close to peace and then just wash \nour hands of them. We will need to lead this effort and to be involved \nas befits the leader of the free world. We owe this to our NATO allies \nand to the alliance which has served peace and stability for nearly 50 \nyears. We owe this to the ravaged people of Bosnia. And we owe this to \nthe memories of all who have been the victims of genocide. It is only \nright--no, it is necessary--for the United States to stand up to \ngenocide. We did \n\n[[Page S16368]]\n\nnot stand up in time 50 years ago and too many innocents perished as a \nresult. We must not repeat this mistake.\n  The United States is the leader of NATO. NATO functioned as an \nextraordinarily successful defensive military alliance against the \nSoviet Union throughout the cold war. There are those post-cold war who \nhave asked, what is NATO's purpose? But remember, NATO is the strongest \nfunctioning military alliance among nations in the world. The NATO \npowers gathered at our urging to fight alongside us in the gulf war to \nbring about that magnificent post-cold-war victory. Clearly, NATO will \nnot be willing to play the role of peacekeeper or keeping the peace \nthat may be achieved in Dayton, OH, unless the United States is part of \nthat peacekeeping force. I think we have to be honest about that. If we \nare not part of that force, NATO will not go in, there will not be \npeace in the Balkans, and we have only more aggression, more \ninstability, and perhaps more genocide to look forward to.\n  Beyond that, Madam President, I would say this. The relationship in \nNATO works both ways. Our allies in Europe are asking us to be part of \nthis. Our friends in Bosnia are saying they will not trust the peace \nunless we are part of policing it.\n  But what is the next crisis going to be in which we will not want to \ncarry the burden alone, in which we are turning to our allies in NATO \nand saying, ``Help us''? What will they say if we say to them in this \ncase, ``Sorry, folks, you take care of it''?\n  So I say to my colleagues in the Senate, there is a lot on the line \nhere. That is why I say that the resolution passed in the House last \nnight was untimely and unhelpful. I support the policy of American \nforces being part of a NATO force to police a peace treaty that is \nagreed upon in NATO. Are there questions to ask? Yes, there are. Should \nthe administration consult with Congress? Of course it should. And it \nhas been. But this is a time for questions, not resolutions.\n  Let me also say I support the second part of the House resolution, \nwhich says troops should not be dispatched without congressional \nauthorization. But let us remember this: So does President Clinton. He \nsaid to Senator Byrd in his letter he would welcome, encourage, and at \nthe appropriate time request an expression of support by Congress. That \nis what I anticipate.\n  President Clinton has already begun the important process of \nconsultations with Congress. Key senior officials--Secretary of State \nChristopher, Secretary of Defense Perry, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili--have all come to Congress to \nexplain the why and how of this proposed undertaking. Everyone \nunderstands that there are many important questions which remain \nunanswered. Some of these answers will depend on the outcome of the \nnegotiations in Dayton. Some will depend on ongoing NATO military \nplanning. Some will depend on decisions to be made by the North \nAtlantic Council. But the President and other administration officials \nhave made clear that the United States will participate in implementing \na peace settlement only if several nonnegotiable conditions are met.\n  The operation must be a NATO operation, with full NATO command and \ncontrol and no U.N. dual key arrangements.\n  The mandate for U.S. forces and their missions must be clear.\n  The forces must be large enough and the rules of engagement \nsufficiently robust for the NATO force to carry out its mission and to \ndefend itself from any attack.\n  President Clinton and his Cabinet officials have promised to continue \ntheir close consultations with the Congress and to explain their \nproposals to the American people in order to assure that the President \nhas their support.\n  This process of consultation should continue in a meaningful, \nbipartisan way. The President needs the support of Congress and the \nAmerican people if this mission is to be successful. Just as President \nBush recognized the need for congressional support before combat began \nin the Persian Gulf war, President Clinton realizes the importance of \ncongressional support. Thus, he has said, in words nearly identical to \nthose used by President Bush in January 1991, he ``would welcome, \nencourage and, at the appropriate time, request an expression of \nsupport by Congress promptly after a peace agreement is reached.''\n  So I hope that my colleagues in both Chambers will give the \nnegotiators some room, ask questions, but hold the resolution until a \nmuch more appropriate and constructive time.\n  I welcome the coming debate. The stakes are too high for the people \nof Bosnia, for our men and women in uniform, for the position of \nAmerica in the world of the next century and for all Americans for us \nnot to engage in this debate.\n  Just as in those early days of 1991 when I joined a majority of the \nSenate in supporting George Bush's use of force in the gulf war, we are \nat a turning point in our history. When His Holiness Pope John Paul II \nwas recently in the United States, he spent a short period of time with \nPresident Clinton. The President reports that the Pope said to him at \nthe end of that conversation, ``Mr. President, I am not a young man. I \nhave a long memory. This century began with a war in Sarajevo. We must \nnot let this century end with a war in Sarajevo.''\n  If we believe in the hope expressed by the Pope and in the important \nrole which America must play in the world, we must be involved in \nimplementing peace in Bosnia. Without us there will be no involvement \nby NATO. Without NATO there will be no peace to implement. Without \npeace in the Balkans, there will be no peace and no stability in \nEurope, and there will be a continuation of murder and genocide. I am \nnot prepared to accept this outcome for America or the world.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16366-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  What is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He is \ncorrect that certainly the resolution passed by the Senate with respect \nto the arms embargo sent a message.

People \nshould reflect on that. The resolution that was passed so dramatically \nby the Senate said, ``Let's abandon the place and basically just arm \nthem and let them fight.'' Many of us argued that that would have been \na disastrous event for the world, for the United Nations, for NATO, and \nthat everybody would have been left asking who was responsible for this \nextraordinary mess if that had, indeed, been the policy of this \ncountry.\n  Courageously, the President pursued a different policy. The different \npolicy that he pursued was to finally elicit from our friends and \nallies in Europe a willingness to do what the President had been asking \nthem to do for some period of time, which was to be willing to take \ncertain risks, use the power of NATO, and try to force the process to \npeace talks.\n  There is less killing in Bosnia today than there would have been if \nthe policy of the United States Senate had been pursued. There is less \nkilling today because the President and NATO and the European leaders \nundertook a policy, which I will agree was one that \n\n[[Page S16369]]\n\nmany of us would have liked to have seen put into place some time \npreviously, but nevertheless, a policy different from that espoused by \nthe Senate. It is a policy which now, hopefully, could conceivably \nresult in a peace, though I think Secretary Holbrooke is accurate to \nsay this is a gamble. There are huge variables, and I do not think \nexpectations ought to be high, though obviously hopes ought to be high.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16368-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16369-S16370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                 1996.\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport on the Transportation appropriations bill. I would just like to \ntake a moment to acknowledge the exceptional work of Senator Lautenberg \nand Senator Hatfield in developing this compromise approach that is now \non the floor.\n  This is a critical time for our public infrastructure investments. \nThere are many of us here in the Senate who are deeply disturbed by the \nlevel of reduction on the investment side of the ledger, not just in \npublic infrastructure, but in human beings. I am convinced we will pay \na price for that. But measured against the overall choices that we are \nmaking in the Senate right now, this transportation bill, I think, has \ndone its best, and Senators Hatfield and Lautenberg have done their \nbest, to strike a balance between transit and passenger rail and \nhighway construction programs.\n  I would have liked to have seen that balance be a little bit \ndifferent, but I still am heartened by the fact that they held onto \nimportant initiatives and, I might add from a parochial point of view, \nsome important initiatives for New England and for Massachusetts. I \ncommend them for doing that.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference report recognizes the \nsignificance of multimodal and fixed guideway transportation projects \nas well as the need to maintain Federal support for Amtrak and the \nNortheast Corridor Improvement Program. I am concerned that operating \nsubsidies for mass transit are significantly reduced and in some \nplaces, particularly in rural or outlying areas, we are going to see \nreductions that have a dramatic impact on low-income, disabled, and \nsenior citizens' ability to be able to get to work, to get to shopping \nplaces, to move around the community. And while it may look OK on the \nshort-term ledger of a budget, those things build community as much as \na lot of other things that we care about. When people cannot get \nsomewhere, storeowners lose, community centers lose, and the people \nlose.\n  So not having a vibrant transit system is not somehow going to be \nmade up, we know, by the private sector because the bottom line has \nalways been that the private sector cannot make money at it. That is \nwhy we have the public transit in the first place.\n  I must express my serious disappointment in the severe reductions in \ntransit operating assistance that will likely mean a reduction of some \n$3 million for Massachusetts.\n  The conference report reflects the crossroads at which Congress finds \nitself with Amtrak. Despite the many benefits of passenger rail, some \nMembers do not consider investment in passenger rail an appropriate use \nof taxpayer dollars. Others--and I count myself among this group--know \nfrom previous experience both here and abroad that the capital-\nintensive nature of passenger rail makes it unlikely to survive as a \nviable transportation mode without some form of Government support. \nIndeed, the U.S. ranks 35th among the nations of the world in per \ncapita spending on passenger rail--behind such countries as Belarus, \nBotswana, and Guinea. In appropriating $635 million for Amtrak, which \nis about $160 million less than the fiscal year 1995 funding level, the \nconferees anticipate enactment of legislation to reform Amtrak. As a \nmember of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has reported legislation \nto restructure Amtrak so as to place it on a path toward greater fiscal \nstability and accountability, I pledge to help move this bill forward \nas soon as possible.\n  My concern for passenger rail is particularly keen when it comes to \nthe Northeast corridor and the need to move ahead with track work, \nupgrading maintenance facilities and completion of the electrification \nof the northern section as soon as possible. This project is vital to \nreducing congestion in the corridor, which in turn will result in \nimportant environmental, energy and employment benefits. The $115 \nmillion the conference report provides for NECIP, some $85 million less \nthan in fiscal year 1995, will enable work to move forward, albeit more \nslowly.\n  Another area of special importance to Massachusetts is mass transit. \nI am frankly disappointed and disturbed by the significant reduction in \nfunding agreed to by the conferees for mass transit operating \nassistance. From $710 million in fiscal year 1995 down to the $400 \nmillion contained in the conference report, this severe cut in funding \nwill have a devastating effect on mass transit systems, particularly in \nthe Pioneer Valley, Worcester, Attleboro, and the Lawrence-Haverhill \nareas. For Pioneer Valley alone, this means a $1 million reduction, or \na cut of more than 47 percent in Federal funds. A reduction of this \nmagnitude will most certainly force the transit authorities to curtail \nservice and raise fares, creating significant hardship for those who \ndepend on mass transit--such as the elderly, disabled, and low-income \nriders--for basic shopping needs, and to commute to work and to school. \nIt is my hope that this sharp downward trend in critical mass transit \nfunding will be reversed next year.\n  I am grateful to the conferees for including in their report more \nthan $20 million for the south Boston Piers Transitway. The transitway \nis a critical component of the State implementation plan, and is \nanticipated to serve 22,000 daily riders. This construction project has \nstayed on schedule and on budget, and has an impressive cost-\neffectiveness index of $9 to $16 per new passenger trip.\n  Another important project that will receive $2 million through the \nFederal Transit Administration's bus and bus facilities account in \nfiscal year 1996 is the Worcester Intermodal Center. The center, in a \nrenovated Union Station in Worcester, MA, will provide convenient \naccess to commuter rail, buses, and taxis to Worcester County's 710,000 \nresidents.\n  I have heard some concerns expressed about the provisions of the \nconference report relating to reform of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, FAA, and particularly to those sections dealing with \nthe rights of workers to organize and bargain collectively. As a member \nof the authorizing committee that oversees the FAA, I intend to monitor \nclosely the FAA's personnel reform plan to assure that the labor rights \nof FAA workers are fully protected and will keep the statement of the \nconference managers to this effect in mind as the Commerce Committee \nconsiders legislation to restructure the FAA.\n\n  Another area about which I am concerned is funding for the U.S. Coast \nGuard. The Coast Guard is vital to my State of Massachusetts, with its \nhundreds of miles of coastline, harsh weather conditions, bustling \nmaritime industry, hearty fishing industry, and thriving recreational \nboating population.\n  Indeed, the Coast Guard is vital to the safety and well-being of \ncitizens in every coastal State, and in every State with navigable \nwaters. Today, over 50 percent of the U.S. population lives within the \ncoastal zone, and directly benefits from the services the Coast Guard \nprovides. But, indirectly, the Coast Guard, in the performance of its \nmission, protects every American. In fact, more than two-thirds of the \ntotal budget for the Coast Guard goes to operating expenses to protect \npublic safety and the marine environment, enforce laws and treaties, \nmaintain aids to navigation, prevent illegal drug trafficking and \nillegal immigration, and preserve defense readiness.\n  With this high demand for services I am amazed that the Coast Guard \nwould consider reducing its operations but in response to our budget \ndilemma that is exactly what it is doing. The Coast Guard is in the \nprocess of an internal downsizing and streamlining program which in 4 \nyears will reduce its size by 12 percent or 4,000 people, and cut $400 \nmillion. However, despite these cost cutting efforts, the funding for \nthe \n\n[[Page S16370]]\n\nCoast Guard provided by the conference--$2.579 billion for operations \nand $362 million for acquisition, construction and improvements--is \nwell below the President's requests of $2.618 billion for operations \nand $428 million for acquisition, construction, and improvements.\n  The Coast Guard has always been able to do more with less, but I am \nconcerned that this level of funding will be inadequate for the Coast \nGuard to continue successfully to perform important missions and \noperations. In addition, the conference report contains contradictory \nprovisions concerning funding--the first provision, which I fully \nendorse, assumes that additional funding of $300 million will be \nprovided in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Coast \nGuard operations. The second provision, which I oppose, makes available \nat the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation the transfer of up \nto $60 million to the FAA budget. I do not think setting up agencies \nwithin a Department to battle one another for funding is a wise course.\n  I am pleased to see that the conference agreement disallowed the \nclosure of any Coast Guard multimission small boat stations for fiscal \nyear 1996. While I recognize the necessity of the Coast Guard's \nstreamlining efforts, I am worried that efforts to downsize field \noperations may unreasonably increase the threat to life, property, and \nthe environment. I concur with the views expressed in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee report that cited the very real though \nintangible deterrence benefits of these stations. Combined with their \ndirect benefits, I believe these outweigh the value of the management \nefficiencies and small budgetary savings that may result from their \nclosure. I also agree with the conference report which stated that the \nCoast Guard's station closure methodology failed to fairly consider \ndistinctions among small boat stations, such as water temperature and \nsurvival time. I have proposed provisions in the Coast Guard \nauthorization bill that establish a more formal process for station \nclosures and require the Coast Guard to take the appropriators' \nconcerns into consideration while allowing the Coast Guard the \nflexibility to modify the levels of its resources as it sees fit.\n  Once again, I compliment and thank the Senators from Oregon and New \nJersey for their leadership in developing this important legislation. \nWhile I would have liked for it to do more in some areas, it is a \ncommendable attempt to meet our Nation's transportation needs within \nthe budget limits allotted to them.\n  I would just like to finally publicly say I am deeply concerned, \nalso, about the reductions in the Coast Guard. I know that the Coast \nGuard has accepted the Presidential directive and other directives to \nstreamline and to reduce. Those reductions and that streamlining are \ngood, and it is important. But I am convinced that measured against the \nextraordinary increase in Coast Guard duties and responsibilities, we \nare asking them to do more than may be possible.\n  More than two-thirds of the total budget for the Coast Guard goes to \noperating expenses for public safety--the marine environment, to \nenforce laws and treaties, to maintain aids to navigation, to prevent \nillegal drug trafficking and illegal navigation, immigration, and also \nto preserve defense readiness. If you look at the increase in \nresponsibility measured against the last 10 years of reduction in \nresources, once again I think we have to be very careful that we are \nnot shortchanging ourselves.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16369-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16370-S16371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE RECONCILIATION BILL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I will try to \nmake this relatively brief. I know the presiding officer has a \nconference luncheon to go to.\n  Madam President, when I go back to teaching in 7 years, one of the \nclasses that I am going to teach is going to focus on what happened on \nFriday night on the floor of the U.S. Senate. And I say this with a \nslight smile because you have to have a twinkle in your eye, but at the \nsame time I say it with a tremendous amount of indignation.\n  In the dark of night my State of Minnesota was cut $524 million in \nmedical assistance for people in our State. I will come back to that in \na moment.\n  Late afternoon and early evening I kept asking, ``Where is the \nFinance Committee amendment on the formula?'' After all, we are not \njust talking about formula, we are talking about people's lives. At 6 \np.m., one version, 9 p.m., the final version. All of a sudden, back \nroom decisions. No chance for review, no chance to talk to \nconstituents. Some States come out doing very well. Texas gains $5.2 \nbillion; that is good for Texas. California loses $4.2 billion; that is \nnot so good for California. Then, in a departure from any rational \nallocation formula, the legislative language of the amendment contains \n``additional amounts,'' additional money. We are talking about people \nleveraging their votes for the following States:\n\n  We have $63 million more for Arizona; $250 million more for Florida; \n$34 million more for Georgia; $76 million more for Kentucky; $181 \nmillion more for South Carolina; $250 million more for the State of \nWashington. And then, at 9 p.m., new legislative language is released \nadding Vermont to the list, with an additional $50 million.\n  Madam President, in the dark of night, a decision was made by \nsomebody, and I came out on the floor at 9 o'clock and said, ``Who made \nthis decision? Who were the people that made this decision accountable \nto? What happened to my State of Minnesota? On top of $2.4 billion of \ncuts in medical assistance, you now have cut my State by $524 million \nmore.''\n  Madam President, the majority leader came out and said, ``But \nMinnesota is doing better than in the House formula.'' That is true. \nThere we were being cut $3.5 billion. But we thought we had an \nunderstanding. We thought there was an agreement and the reductions had \nbeen reduced by $1 billion and the Senate by $2.4 billion. Then the \nmajority leader said something to the effect, ``Well, the Governor \nsupports this.''\n  Madam President, I am really pleased that the Governor of Minnesota \ndoes not support this. Governor Carlson is meeting with the majority \nleader. He is coming to Washington, DC, to try and find out what \nhappened, and to advocate for our State, which is exactly what he \nshould do. Whether we are Democrats or Republicans, we should be \nadvocating for our States.\n  The most serious part of this decisionmaking process is--actually, \nthere is an ``A'' and a ``B'' to the serious part. A, it is in the dark \nof the night, behind closed doors--decisionmaking, cutting deals, \naccountable to nobody, no review, no opportunity to talk to \nconstituents. That is problem No. 1, regardless of what happened to \ndifferent States.\n  Problem No. 2: My State was cut by $524 million.\n  Problem No. 3: Let us translate the statistics in human terms. We \nhave 425,000 recipients on what we call ``medical assistance'' in \nMinnesota; 300,000 of them are children. Sixty percent of our payments \ngo to elderly and nursing homes. Many people with disabilities rely on \nthis support so they can stay at home and not be institutionalized. We \nare projected to grow from 425,000 to 535,000 medical assistance \nrecipients in the year 2002.\n  Madam President, I intend to fight this all the way. Minnesota was \nshafted in the dark of the night decisionmaking, and a lot of people in \nmy State are going to be hurt. I am going to make sure this formula is \nreversed.\n  Madam President, I think the more people in the country get a chance \nto see what is in these budget bills, the more they are not going to \nlike it. If the President is strong and he vetoes these bills--which he \nshould--there is no Minnesota standard of fairness in these budget \ncuts--and the people have a chance to be engaged in this process, I am \nabsolutely convinced that we can inject some fairness, some elementary \nbasic Minnesota fairness, back into this process. But, for right now, I \nam not letting up. I heard the Senator from Florida give a brilliant \nspeech Friday night. I say to my colleague from Florida, I am not \nletting up on this. I am fighting this all the way, \n\n[[Page S16371]]\n\nuntil Minnesota gets some fairness in this formula. I am not going to \nlet folks, in a back room deal, shaft my State and a lot of the \ncitizens in my State.\n  I am delighted that the Governor of Minnesota is going to join in \nthis effort to make sure we get a fair formula.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16370-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tonight at midnight, the Middle East Peace \nFacilitation Act [MEPFA] will expire. Last night at 8:20, a written \nrequest for a short-term extension was faxed to my office by the State \nDepartment. This morning, I spoke to Secretary of State Christopher \nabout the issue. Until the letter and phone call, my office had \nreceived no communication about the need for the latest extension. I \nknow the Secretary is concerned that a delay in extending the act could \nbe read as lack of support for the Middle East peace process. I share \nthat concern, but I am also concerned that we have an administration \nthat refuses to deal responsibly with Congress.\n  I want to be very clear: the U.S. Senate has gone on the record on \nrepeated occasions supporting the Middle East peace process. We have \nextended MEPFA three times this year: on June 23, on August 11, and on \nSeptember 29. Each time the Congress acted promptly. I hope we are able \nto act today as well.\n  We support the peace process. We understand the risks being taken by \nboth sides. We understand that peacemaking is not easy, and that the \nprocess is subject to disruption. As I speak today, Israel's withdrawal \nfrom the West Bank town of Jenin has started. Our lead negotiator in \nthe Middle East, Dennis Ross, called my office this morning from Israel \nto express his concern over the consequences of not extending MEPFA.\n  Extending MEPFA allows the President to waive certain provisions of \nlaw concerning the Palestine Liberation Organization. It allows the \nprovision of United States assistance to the Palestine authority, and \nit allows a Palestinian office to operate in the United States. The \nForeign Operations Appropriations Conference Report provides for a \npermanent extension of MEPFA but it is not likely to be enacted soon.\n  If Congress does not act today to provide another short-term \nextension, the President's waiver authority will lapse. Under these \ntime constraints, unanimous consent is required to proceed.\n  Today, I am informed the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Helms, will object to any unanimous-consent request extending \nMEPFA unless the terms of a previous agreement entered into by the full \nSenate have been met. The last time the Senate extended MEPFA, Senator \nHelms and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts worked out an agreement \nproviding for consideration of S. 908, the Foreign Relations \nReorganization Act.\n  For the benefit of all Senators, I would like to briefly review what \nhas happened over the last month. On September 29, the Senate passed an \nextension of MEPFA and entered into an agreement providing for \nconsideration of S. 908 after the managers agreed on an amendment. On \nOctober 10, Senator Helms wrote to Senator Kerry and urged him to make \nsome kind of offer. The next day, Senator Kerry responded that \n``progress was being made'' in developing an offer.\n  On October 19, Senator Kerry met with Senator Helms and provided an \noutline--not legislation--of a proposed managers' amendment. Later that \nday, Senator Helms made a counter offer to Senator Kerry, changing the \namount of savings from reorganization from $1.2 billion over 4 years to \n$2.5 billion over 5 years. Senator Kerry's response was to propose 25 \nadditional changes in the bill and to request unprecedented guarantees \nabout the outcome of a House-Senate conference.\n  Until this morning, Senator Helms had heard very little from Senator \nKerry or his staff. While staff negotiations have begun, there is no \nagreement on the central issue of cost savings. Once again, the \nadministration has refused to provide information to Congress about \ncost information. I hope the Democrat manager, Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts, is able to make a legislative agreement today, whether \nthe administration is willing or not.\n  The State Department wants Senator Helms to lift his objection to \nproceeding with MEPFA despite the almost total lack of effort over the \nlast 32 days. Senator Helms is completely within his rights to object \nto any unanimous-consent request. I hope that as the day proceeds, \nSenator Kerry and the administration decide it is finally time to deal \nseriously with the Senate majority.\n  Contrary to some of the statements made by the administration, \nSenator Helms is not insisting on ``getting his way.'' What he is \ninsisting on is that the will of the majority be heard, and that the \nSenate simply have a chance to vote on whether to save money by \nreorganizing our international affairs agencies.\n  I believe in the importance of bipartisan cooperation. Let me point \nout that if the administration had not orchestrated a filibuster of S. \n908 earlier this year, the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act would \nhave been permanently extended by now--in that same legislation. \nUnfortunately, due to the administration's intransigence and refusal to \nnegotiate, MEPFA is once again a last-minute demand on a busy Senate \nschedule.\n  I hope we are able to work together on MEPFA, and I hope it happens \ntoday. I hope a managers' amendment is filed today. However, it is \ngoing to be very difficult, if not impossible, to work together on one \nissue today if there is no cooperation from the other side on moving to \nconference on the budget reconciliation bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16371-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S16372]]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, you would think after we broke the record on \nvotes on the reconciliation bill--we had 39 votes here on Friday, and \nwe were here after midnight on Thursday and midnight on Friday--that we \ncould proceed to appoint conferees on the reconciliation bill. But I am \nnow advised that the Democrats will want to use at least part of the 10 \nhours they are permitted under the Budget Act and maybe have as many as \nfour additional rollcall votes.\n  I must say, had I known that, we would certainly have been here \nyesterday, and I was trying to accommodate Members on both sides of the \naisle. I will not do that again without checking very carefully.\n  My view was that we had had an unprecedented number of amendments \noffered by the other side. We had on this, as I said, 39 votes in 1 \nday, never having had that many votes in the history of the Senate. And \nit seemed to me that we would move on to the appointment of conferees \nand complete action without all this additional 10 hours or 5 hours or \n4 hours, whatever it is. So I will have to decide when to bring up the \nbill--maybe sometime late tomorrow afternoon.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, let me say that last week we began with \nabout 130 amendments which Senators on our side had hoped to offer. I \nindicated to the majority leader that it would be my hope we could \nbring that list down to under 30, and we checked the record again and \nthat list was reduced to 25 amendments, as I had hoped we could reduce \nthem to. And so I think to the degree it was possible we accommodated \nboth in time as well as in number the desire on the part of the \nleadership on both sides to successfully complete the deliberations on \nthe budget resolution Friday night.\n  With regard to the conference report, again, we faced a number of \nmotions to instruct; that it was my hope we could reduce in number from \nperhaps as many as 20 to less than a handful. I think we have agreed as \na result of the discussion in conference that it will not be 20; it \nwill not be 12; it will not be anything more than 4--4 very specific \ntargeted motions that we would be willing to agree, timewise, to not \ntake the 10 hours.\n  I wish to accommodate the schedule of the distinguished majority \nleader, and I hope we could work through this in a way that would \naccommodate both of our needs. Let me emphasize, our colleagues feel \nvery strongly about a number of the issues that we raised through \namendments last week. We feel very strongly this week. We will be \nwatching with the great interest of everybody in the conference what \ndevelops in that conference, and we think it is very important to \narticulate in as strong a way as we can what our concerns are. We have \na number of concerns that will not be addressed in these motions to \ninstruct. There were a number of Senators who said they wanted the \nopportunity to move an amendment or a motion, and we will do that in \nother ways--in the form of letters, in the form of conversations with \nour colleagues--but we will limit our motions to instruct to four.\n  So it is an effort to balance, Mr. President, our degree of concern \nwith our interest in working through this effort procedurally in an \neffort to accommodate all Senators.\n  That is what we will do whenever the distinguished leader decides to \nbring up the conferees motion, and we will be prepared to work with him \nin that regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator we are now in \nmorning business.

Mr. President, without any fanfare, late this past \nFriday afternoon, the Clinton administration quietly gave the \nGovernment of Mexico an extension on their loan payments owed to the \nUnited States taxpayers. This delay contrasts sharply with the much \npublicized partial prepayment Mexico made on the same loan just a few \nweeks ago.\n  Yesterday, the Mexican Government was supposed to pay the remaining \n$1.3 billion of their $2 billion payment to the United States. This \nmoney is only a part of the $12.5 billion in loans given to Mexico by \nthe Clinton administration this year.\n  On October 6, as part of the public relations campaign for Mexican \nPresident Zedillo's visit, Mexico paid back $700 million. At that time \nthe Clinton administration hailed this partial prepayment saying, ``The \nAmerican taxpayer is being repaid ahead of schedule.''\n  But what that amounted to, Mr. President, was nothing more than a \npublicity stunt. This so-called prepayment turned out to be a sham.\n  What about the $1.3 billion still owed to the American taxpayers that \nwas due yesterday? On Friday, the real story came out. Without the \nfanfare, the photo opportunities, and the state dinner at the White \nHouse, the Clinton administration quietly announced that it was their \nplan all along to allow Mexico to postpone paying back its loan.\n  Mr. President, I am outraged. It appears to this Senator that the \nloans to Mexico may never be repaid, and the Clinton administration \nknows it. I have serious doubts that the American taxpayer will ever be \nrepaid all of the $12.5 billion that this administration sent to \nMexico.\n  It is time to stop playing politics and tell the truth to the \nAmerican public. Make no mistake about what and who is bankrolling the \nClinton administration loans to the Mexican Government. It is the U.S. \ntaxpayer, the American citizen. And the reality stands in sharp \ncontrast to what the administration said just weeks ago. The American \ntaxpayers are not being paid back on time.\n  The Clinton administration's claims that the Mexican bailout is a \nsuccess rings hollow. The Mexican bailout is a failure for the American \ntaxpayers and the Mexican economy. The history of the Clinton \nadministration's bailout is a failed one.\n  On December 9, 1994, President Clinton lauded Mexico as an economic \nsuccess story. And just 10 days later the Mexican Government ineptly \ndevalued their peso by 20 percent. The peso's value subsequently went \ninto a free fall and capital fled Mexico.\n  Ironically, we have recently learned that Mexican investors have been \npulling their money out of Mexico before the peso's crash. They were \ntipped off, Mr. President. They got their money out long before the \nrest of the world found out what was happening. The question again \nemerges, why are American taxpayers forced by the Clinton \nadministration to bail out a foreign economy that was first abandoned \nby its own wealthy citizens?\n  I have said all along that American tax dollars are being sent to \nMexico to bail out wealthy global speculators. That is wrong. So where \nare we now? The Mexican Government, with the approval and consent of \nthe Clinton administration, has used American taxpayer dollars to pay \noff investors, but the Mexican economy remains in shambles. Global \nspeculators have reaped huge profits while U.S. taxpayers are left \nholding the bag.\n  Last Thursday, the Mexican peso dropped to a 7-month low, trading at \n\n[[Page S16373]]\n\n7.23 pesos to the dollar, almost matching its low point of 7.5 pesos to \nthe dollar in early March. The Mexican Central Bank frantically \nintervened to support the peso but despite these efforts, the peso \nclosed at 6.925 to the dollar yesterday. Banks in Mexico may have to \nraise short-term interest rates even higher to help the peso recover \nits value.\n  These high interest rates are already crippling Mexican families and \nsmall businesses. And, Mr. President, do you know who they hold \nresponsible for this? The United States of America. The Clinton and \nZedillo administrations' assertions that the Mexican economy is \nrecovering simply does not hold water. It is not true. The American \npeople and the United States Congress deserve all the facts on the \nMexican economic situation.\n  This summer, I released a report on the Mexican economic crisis that \ndetailed a disturbing pattern of deception and misrepresentation of the \ntrue state of the Mexican economy. News reports indicate an internal \nstudy commissioned by the International Monetary Fund [IMF], sheds new \nlight on the subject and confirms this disturbing pattern. Now the \nClinton administration has classified the report--the Whittome report--\nand is resisting efforts to make it available to the public. The public \nhas a right to know the whole truth. Why is the Treasury Department \nhiding this information from the American public?\n  I have written to the Director of the IMF and copied the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to request that this report be made public. We have sent \n$12.5 billion worth of taxpayer money directly from the United States \nand $9.8 billion from the IMF. Another $1.6 billion will be sent from \nthe IMF to Mexico next month. And do you know who is the single largest \ncontributor to the IMF--the United States. According to news reports, \nthe Whittome report provides valuable insight into the handling of the \nMexican economic crisis by the administration and the IMF. Yet neither \nof them wants to share this report with the American public.\n  On October 18, I wrote to the Director of the IMF asking him to make \nit available. The public has a right to know the whole truth but so far \nthe Treasury Department and the IMF have not responded to my request.\n  We were told several weeks ago that Mexico was recovering \nwonderfully, that it was repaying its debt of $700 million earlier than \nrequired, but the administration knew 2 weeks ago that Mexico would be \nunable to pay the full debt, which was $2 billion. So they put up $700 \nmillion, when they still owe us $1.3 billion and call it a success. It \nis disingenuous to say the least.\n  Mr. President, let me make a prediction before I close. I predict \nthat there will be a time in the not-too-distant future when we will \nsee Mexico come quietly to the Treasury, the United States Treasury, \nand make a deal for more money, and this administration will once again \ngo along with it. The American people will be the losers. We should be \nprepared the next time they come to say no.\n  There is an old saying, ``You don't put good money after bad.'' But I \nguess we have an administration that figures if it is not their money, \nthat it only belongs to the American taxpayers, that wise old saying is \nnot valid.\n  I believe this Congress has a responsibility to demand that report, \nand I intend to submit a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate \nthat report be made available so that the American people can see that \nwe have a Government that operates in accordance with the rules and \nthey can judge the situation for themselves. They can decide whether or \nnot they are ever going to get that $12.5 billion back. The American \npublic can decide whether or not the administration has dealt with them \nfairly and candidly.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your courtesies and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized for 5 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity and many \nother opportunities between now and the next few weeks, to strongly \nurge the President to come to Congress for authorization before he \nmakes a decision to send American troops into Bosnia. We have discussed \nthis in our committee meetings, our Senate Armed Services Committee, \nand I am very much concerned about the fact that if you look at the \nhistory of Bosnia, all the way back to the Ottoman empire, you see that \nyou have these three warring factions that have always warred with each \nother.\n  We know that the Archduke who was assassinated was what precipitated \nWorld War I right there in Sarajevo. We know that in World War II, \nMarshal Tito, when he was putting together his alliance to go against \nthe Germans, he had most of them except for Croatia. At that time \nCroatia was on the other side. We were on the side of the Bosnian \nMoslems and the Serbs. So it has been a moving target throughout the \nyears.\n  The only thing that is consistent is that they have been murdering \neach other. And we have evidence in the last 6 months, all three \nfactions have fired on their own troops and tried to blame the other \nside. So we have a long and agonizing history of what has been \nhappening over there. There is no more hostile area any place in the \nworld to send our troops on the ground than there.\n  Back in World War II, any of us who have studied history at all \nremember how the former Yugoslavians were able to hold off the best \nthat Hitler had on the ratio of 1 to 8. This, in other words, is not \nthe Persian Gulf. These are mountains with caves, Mr. President. This \nis an area where historically a small number of people have been able \nto murder a much larger force and take many, many casualties. This is \nthe environment into which we are talking about sending our troops.\n  I draw an analogy between that and Lebanon in 1983. In 1983, we sent \nour troops over to Lebanon. We had a very modest mission at that time, \nand it was not until the months rolled by when the bomb went off and \n241 of our troops were killed, and, of course, then there was a public \ncry, and we brought our troops home.\n  Or Somalia. I cannot hang that on the Democrats because George Bush, \nin December, after he lost the election, before the new President, \nPresident Clinton, was sworn in, he sent troops to Somalia really just \nfor 7 weeks. And then he went out of office and Clinton came in. At \nthat time I was serving in the other body. Almost every month we sent a \nresolution to the President, ``Bring our troops home. There is no \nmission that is relative to our Nation's security in Somalia.'' And it \nwas not until 18 of our Rangers were murdered in cold blood and they \ndragged their corpses through the streets of Mogadishu that there was \nenough public outcry to bring the troops back home, and we did with our \ntail between our legs. Nothing was accomplished. You see, we have \nadopted a foreign policy in this country where we are sending our \ntroops out on humanitarian missions, as opposed to missions where we \nhave our Nation's security at risk.\n\n  Well, now, this came to a head when we had our Senate Armed Services \nCommittee meeting--it was a public meeting--just the other day. We had \nSecretary Christopher, Secretary Perry, and General Shalikashvili. When \nwe came to the part where we were talking about the mission, the \nstrongest mission they could state that we have in Bosnia is twofold: \nFirst to contain a civil war, which has been going on for hundreds of \nyears; second, to protect the integrity of NATO, the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization.\n  So I asked a question--and this was after there was a quote from \nGeneral Rose, who was the U.N. commander in Bosnia. He said, ``If \nAmerica sends troops over there, they would lose more American lives \nthan they lost in the Persian Gulf.'' There we lost 390 lives. So I \nsaid, ``So we can reasonably assume we are going to lose hundreds of \nAmerican lives if we send troops over on the ground in Bosnia? That \nbeing the case, Secretary Perry, is our mission, as you have described \nit, to contain a civil war and to protect the integrity of NATO worth \nthe cost of many hundreds of American lives?'' He said, ``Yes,'' \nwithout flinching. I said, ``Secretary Christopher?'' He said, ``Yes.'' \nAnd General Shalikashvili said, ``Yes.''\n\n[[Page S16374]]\n\n  So here we have the people who are in the top ranks, the President's \nthree top men, reflecting the wishes of the President--that is, to send \ntroops into Bosnia on the ground.\n  There is something else that is very curious about this, which came \nup in this meeting. They stated in the meeting that no matter what the \ncondition was 12 months from now, those troops would be back in the \nUnited States.\n  I ask you, Mr. President, in all of your well-read days on military \nscience, if you have ever found a time when a country sent its troops \ninto a warring area with a time certain to come back, regardless of the \ncircumstances, whether we were in the middle of a very hostile \nsituation or whether it was a peace accord, we are going to bring them \nhome in 12 months?\n  They all said, ``Yes.'' They had it written down that, ``The troops \nwill return in 12 months.'' As much as I hate to see it, the only thing \nI could think of with any degree of certainty that is going to happen \nin 12 months is that it will be election time, November 1996. I hope \nthat does not have anything to do with this decision.\n  So I plan, in a couple of days, to go over to Bosnia. I am going to \ngo, and I am going to stand in the same places where all of our troops \nare going to be standing if the President is successful in not coming \nto Congress for authorization to send troops. I am going to look at the \nhostility around me, and I am going to listen to the gunfire, and I am \ngoing to bring that message back to the American people.\n  This is something that has to rise above politics. We went through \nthis same thing when President Bush wanted to send troops to the \nPersian Gulf. Yes, we had a real mission there relative to our Nation's \nsecurity. That mission was whether or not we could have the energy \nnecessary to be viable in fighting a war--a real mission relative to \nour Nation's security. At that time, he said we are going to send the \ntroops there, and we said: Mr. President, we do not think it is wise to \nsend the troops over, those soldiers, not knowing they have the support \nof the American people as well as the support of Congress behind them. \nHe did not have to. Just like President Clinton does not have to come \nfor authority to the Congress, President Bush did not have to, but he \ndid it. It was a very wise move for the sake of those individuals who \nwere going over there to lay their lives on the line, where 390 \nAmericans died valiantly. The President, at that time, came to the \nCongress, asked for authority, and we had a united America in fighting \nthe Persian Gulf war.\n  This war over there is not our war, Mr. President. This is a civil \nwar. Sure, it is a problem for people in Western Europe, and I hope \nthat Western Europe gets busy. Let them do what is necessary to protect \ntheir security interests. Perhaps they have security interests in \nBosnia. We do not.\n  I do not want to wake up and find out that the American public did \nnot know about this, did not care about this enough that they did not \nknow whether they have an outcry to bring our troops back until our \nAmerican corpses are dragged through the streets of Sarajevo. We can \nstop it right now, Mr. President. I plan to go to Bosnia and spend \nseveral days there at the end of this week and bring a story back for \nthe American people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the need for an \nextension to the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, which expires \ntonight, and the majority leader's announcement a short time ago that \nthere will be an objection to passing that bill today.\n  This is very surprising to me. I was sitting in the Judiciary \nCommittee hearings on Waco when I was told about it. I speak today as \nthe ranking member on the pertinent subcommittee of the Foreign \nRelations Committee and one who was very concerned about what the \nrepercussions would be in the peace process from the resolution we \npassed last week on Jerusalem. And now we are confronted this week with \na situation that I think, again, has a ripple effect throughout the \nMiddle East if we do not take action.\n  Mr. President, I think we ought to ask, what will one say, what will \nthe Israelis say, what will Prime Minister Rabin say, when they are \nasked the question about why the Congress has refused to continue \nfunding Palestinian economic development in support of the peace \nprocess? Prime Minister Rabin has explicitly asked for this legislation \non each of his visits to the United States. Not passing the extension \ntoday, it is my understanding, stops not only the funding but the \noperation of the necessary offices to carry out that funding, including \none here in Washington.\n  What is disturbing is that no one here is even arguing for letting \nthe Middle East Peace Facilitation Act lapse. This dispute before us, \nin fact, has nothing to do with the Middle East. It has to do with \nconflicting views about whether or not or to what extent to consolidate \nthe foreign affairs agencies of the United States Government.\n  This is a legitimate issue. There are strong opinions on both sides.\n  It seemed to me we had a process for negotiating this issue to reach \nsome agreement. Senator Kerry on our side, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and the chairman of our committee, Senator Helms, had \nbeen negotiating. While agreement has not yet been reached, I believe \nit can with continued good faith at the negotiating table.\n  Wherever one stands on the question of consolidation one thing should \nbe clear: The Middle East peace process is too important to be held \nhostage to disagreements over unconnected issues or to partisan \ndisputes.\n  I wonder if anyone in this body differs with that view? Do any of my \ncolleagues on either side of the aisle believe that the Middle East \npeace process just does not matter that much? Or that it is expendable \nenough to be turned into a political football?\n  One of the truly wonderful things about American foreign policy in \nthe Middle East is that it has always been bipartisan. Strong support \nfor Israel and active pursuit of Middle East peace have never been the \nprovince of just one party.\n  Indeed, this peace process is the outgrowth of the tireless efforts \nof President George Bush and Secretary of State James Baker. It has \nbeen carried forward with skill and dedication by the current \nadministration.\n  The bipartisan nature of United States support for the Middle East \npeace process was never more evident than on July 21 when I joined a \ngroup of my colleagues in cosponsoring Senate bill 1064, a long-term \nextension of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act.\n  I was proud to stand with Senators Helms, Pell, Dole, Daschle, Mack, \nLieberman, McConnell, Leahy, and Lautenberg in expressing strong \nsupport for continuing America's leading role in the peace process.\n  I know, too, that the chairman of the subcommittee on which I serve \nas ranking member, Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, Senator Brown, \nalso supported the sentiments in S. 1064.\n  I ask my colleagues who joined me that day, what has changed? If the \nMiddle East peace process was deserving of strong bipartisan support on \nJuly 21, why is it being held hostage to unrelated legislative disputes \non October 31?\n  I simply do not understand how we can fail to extend this \nlegislation. It is so important to ensuring Israel's ability to live in \npeace and security with its neighbors in the future. It is so important \nto protecting a Israel as a Jewish State, to seeing that the legitimate \nrights of the Palestinian people are \n\n[[Page S16375]]\n\nrecognized and eventually aiming for peace and security in that entire \nregion.\n  I think we owe it to all those who have supported us in that area not \nto abandon our commitments. American Jews know what the stakes are in \nkeeping the Middle Eastern Peace Facilitation Act in force.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an advertisement from the \nSeptember 17, 1995, New York Times be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The ad begins ``Prime Minister Rabin, we know that \npursuing peace is risky. Not pursuing it is unthinkable.'' The ad goes \non to endorse this legislation explicitly. It reads:\n\n       . . . We support the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, \n     the United States legislation which enhanced Israel's \n     security by ensuring compliance by the Palestinians with \n     their agreements and advancing economic development in the \n     West Bank and Gaza, to show Palestinians that peace can \n     improve their lives.\n\n  This ad reflects nothing less than the consensus of the organized \nJewish community in America. It is signed by 29 Jewish organizations. \nSuch a broad consensus of American Jews, Israel's strongest supporters, \nshould not, in fact, be construed as wrong. I hope we will listen to \nthem.\n  I did not think we would be in this position where one person would \nprevent this act from being extended and effectively cut off all aid to \nthe peace process, all economic development assistance that in good \nfaith America has pledged.\n  On top of what happened last week, when these resolutions and these \nactions and these nonactions by this body are extrapolated universally \nand particularly in the Middle East, they very often come to have \ndifferent meanings.\n  This body went on record in July supporting this process. How can we \ntoday turn it off? How can we say what we supported in July, we do not \nsupport enough in October to pass a simple amendment to extend the act? \nInstead, along with ambassadors, along with other treaties, we will \nhold it hostage?\n  I think it is wrong. I think it is overkill. I think it is a \nredoubtable action at best. I hope that the majority leader would be \nable to prevail on those who want to hold this hostage to achieving \ngoals that are unrelated to the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, and \nthat those parties would reconsider. I think it is very important that \nthey do.\n  I thank the Chair for the time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 17, 1995]\n\n    Prime Minister Rabin, We Know That Pursuing Peace Is Risky. Not \n                       Pursuing It Is Unthinkable\n\n       Mr. Prime Minister, as you continue the arduous journey to \n     peace, know that American Jewry stands with the Government of \n     Israel.\n       Overwhelmingly, American Jews say ``yes'' to Israel's \n     current pursuit of peace with security. Every poll reflects \n     this.\n       We know there is no alternative to the peace process except \n     continued violence and continued despair. We support your \n     government and its vision of two peoples living side by side, \n     in peace, so that the children of Israel can look forward to \n     the future without fear.\n       To bring us closer to this goal, we support MEPFA-the \n     Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, U.S. legislation which \n     enhances Israel's security by ensuring compliance by the \n     Palestinians with their agreements and advancing economic \n     development in the West Bank and Gaza to show Palestinians \n     that peace can improve their lives.\n       To road ahead will be filled with obstacles. But to turn \n     back would be far more dangerous. It would reward terrorists \n     by giving them precisely what they want: the death not only \n     of peace, but of hope.\n       Mr. Rabin, we say bracha v'hlatzlacha--may you be blessed \n     with good fortune. On the eve of the Jewish New Year 5756, we \n     offer you and the people of Israel our steadfast support and \n     heartfelt prayers in the days ahead.\n       American Jewish Committee, Robert S.

Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist and Orthodox--\n     from 47 states and the District of Columbia--they call upon \n     Congress to demonstrate ``leadership so that peace and \n     security for Israel can become a reality.''\n       The rabbis urge the renewal of the Middle East Peace \n     Facilitation Act (MEPFA), terming it an ``important and \n     effective diplomatic tool for moving the peace process \n     forward.''\n       MEPFA enables the United States to play a constructive role \n     in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and to provide leadership \n     in the international effort to assist the Palestinian \n     Authority. ``Furthermore, it is a key element in the fight \n     against terror,'' according to the rabbis.\n       As the new Jewish year 5756 approaches, and Israel \n     continues its courageous journey to a peace that will endure, \n     let us pray, with the rabbis, for the peacemakers to succeed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Rabbinic Support for\n\n\n                                            the Peace Process,\n\n                                               September 12, 1995.\n     See peace and pursue it--Psalms 34:15\n\n       To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the \n     Senate: We are writing to express our strong support for \n     Israel's efforts to achieve peace with her neighbors and for \n     the active involvement of the United States in the Middle \n     East peace process.\n       Right now, the Congress of the United States has the \n     opportunity to help maintain the momentum towards peace in \n     the Middle East and to fight terrorism against Israel. We \n     call upon you to demonstrate your leadership so that peace \n     and security for Israel can become a reality.\n       The Middle East Peace Facilitation Act (MEPFA) will expire \n     soon. The act permits the United States to play a \n     constructive role in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and \n     to provide leadership in the international effort to assist \n     the Palestinian Authority. As such, MEPFA has been an \n     important and effective diplomatic tool for moving the peace \n     process forward. Furthermore, it is a key element in the \n     fight against terror. As Prime Minister Rabin recently said, \n     ``The solution between the Palestinians and Israel will \n     create conditions that will reduce the influence of the \n     extreme Islamic terrorist groups.''\n       In its June 1 report, the State Department points out that \n     ``the United States needs to be in a position to support, \n     encourage, and facilitate the Israeli-Palestinian dimension \n     of the [peace] process.'' MEPFA's renewal ensures that the \n     U.S. will play a key role in advancing peace and in fighting \n     terror. Like the leaders of Israel, we believe this role to \n     be essential. We therefore urge you to renew MEPFA in a \n     manner that both the American and Israeli administrations \n     believe will help further the talks and strengthen the fight \n     against terrorism.\n       We care deeply about Israel. We know that this may be \n     Israel's one true chance for \n\n[[Page S16376]]\n\n     peace, and that this opportunity is fragile. We are deeply \n     concerned about the level of P.L.O. compliance; nevertheless, \n     we are heartened by the progress that, thanks in part to \n     MEPFA, has been attained. At the same time, we understand \n     that reducing our country's involvement or cutting aid to the \n     Palestinian Authority, which has committed itself to making \n     peace with Israel, is not now the proper vehicle for \n     expressing our concern. This is why we call upon you to \n     support peace and let the negotiations continue unhindered.\n       In the voice of our tradition we say, ``One does not have \n     the responsibility to complete the task, but neither is one \n     free to take leave of it.'' We urge you to play your part in \n     helping peace grow strong. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     (Signed by over 1,000 American rabbis.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16374-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Mr. President, last Friday in the wee hours of the \nnight there was a total abandonment of any kind of truth in budgeting. \nThere is no better way to express it.\n  Under this entire charade, once again, we have lied to the American \npeople. There is no question that in those wee hours, Mr. President, \nthat they were trying their dead-level best and finally succeeded in \nbuying off the votes of certain of the Senators with respect to \nMedicaid.\n  In order to purchase it, what they did was use Social Security funds. \nThat was a use and violation--not only of the rule but of the law. The \nrule was called by the distinguished Senator from Florida and the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin. If you ever want to \nsee distortion, obfuscation, and abandonment of responsibility by the \nParliamentarian in the U.S. Senate, I wish you would read that Record.\n  Be that as it may, the Chair would say, I do not know. We will refer \nto the chairman of the committee, Senator Domenici, and say, well, I \nlike what the Chair has ruled. Ruled and on and on and back and forth \nbut no idea of a parliamentary ruling or recognition of the law. That \nis why I take the floor today.\n  What really happens is that they constantly are talking about a \nbalanced budget when everybody--both at the White House, the Democratic \nWhite House, and the Republican Congress--know that it cannot be done. \nIt cannot be done without increasing taxes.\n  Here in the extreme, they are talking about decreasing taxes--about \ntax cuts.\n  Let me go right to the point here, so I can make a coherent record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this little two-page \nsummary of budget tables be printed in the Record at this particular \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n            ``Here We Go Again'': Senator Ernest F.

And a debt of $4.927 trillion.\n  If you start with a deficit and a debt of almost $5 trillion and you \nlook at the increased spending over revenues during each of the fiscal \nyears, using Congressional Budget Office figures, you will find that \ncumulatively, from 1996--and each year is listed in this particular \ndocument to 2002--there is an increase of spending of $12.06 trillion \nover revenues received over each of those years--cumulatively, now, of \n$11.008 trillion.\n  So you are spending $1 trillion more than you are taking in over this \nGOP budget plan. Specifically, you can look at last month. September \nended the fiscal year 1995. If you look at the outlays for that year \nand for this year, 1996, and you see the increase from the $1.530 \ntrillion to $1.583--or a $53 billion increase in spending.\n  Now we are going to cut spending, balance the budget, cut spending--\nyet the very first year here we have increased spending $53 billion.\n\n[[Page S16377]]\n\n  Then you go down to the debt and it is listed there of $1.801 \ntrillion in the debt. And you found out over the 7-year period, you are \nnot only increasing the National debt by $1.8 trillion to a level of \n$6.728 trillion, but you have increased interest costs on the national \ndebt to $100 billion.\n  I have listed there what is owed to the trust funds, what is owed to \nthe Government accounts, and what is owed to additional borrowing \nbecause, in my limited time, I am trying to talk about the public debt, \nwhich is No. 3, ``owed to additional borrowing.'' But we borrow from \nthe trust funds. We owe them, at this particular point, $1.361 \ntrillion. And if we look at the owed to the Government accounts, such \nas the bank insurance funds, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance \nCorporation, the credit union share insurance fund, and these other \naccounts, as of next year, we will owe some $81.9 billion there.\n  So we are moving deficits from one pocket to the other. We are not \neliminating them. And, yes, we are borrowing at the public till, for a \ntotal, of course, of, as we have indicated there, a debt of $6.728 \ntrillion.\n  So the question is, starting in 1995 with a deficit of $283 billion \nand a debt of $4.9 trillion, and increasing mandatory spending for \ninterest costs by $100 billion, how do you balance the budget that way? \nOf course, you do not.\n  Go right to the next list of figures. My authorities are none other \nthan the chairman of the Budget Committee on the House side, Mr. \nKasich, because he was the chairman of our budget conference that got \nup this GOP budget and so-called reconciliation. On page 3 of the \nconference report by Mr. Kasich, you will find the word ``deficit'' for \nthe year 2002: a $108 billion deficit.\n  Then you go to the letter last week from the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, Miss June O'Neill, and find on October 20, \nshe determined a deficit of $105 billion; whether it is $105 or $108--\nas the old expression goes, continuing deficits as far as the eye can \nsee--it is over $100 billion.\n  So, if you cannot do it, what do you do? You fabricate a paper \nbalance, by smoke and mirrors and borrowing more. You fabricate a \nbalance. This Senator knows as a member of the Commerce Committee, by \nsimply borrowing again moneys that have already been represented in \nlegislation as having been consumed. In our telecommunications bill, we \ncame up with a budget point of order. We needed to raise some $8 \nbillion so we put in there the auctions of $8 billion.\n  Now we come again to the Commerce Committee for their reconciliation \nresponsibility of raising $15 billion and we list again the $8 billion \nthat has already been included in the telecommunications bill. Or, go \nto the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee, struggling and \nstraining under Medicare, trying to find the money, put in what they \ncall a BELT. The BELT says--for example, on the House side they were \n$35 billion shy. So it is just rhetoric or language to the effect that, \nwith $35 billion, that the next Congress will have to make it up. That \nis no way to balance the budget, but that is part of the smoke and \nmirrors.\n  You can pick up $19 billion as they have with the Consumer Price \nIndex being reduced by .2 percent, thereby reducing, of course, the \nSocial Security benefits and increasing taxes because what you do is \nhit bracket creep, as they call it. Then you go with the impossible \nspending cuts of $270 billion in Medicare, $182 billion in Medicaid, \nand $83 billion in welfare.\n  Just take the one--welfare. Suppose you are a Governor and you are \nassigned the welfare responsibility with a traumatic cut. Now you have \nadded responsibilities. What you have to do is start a training \nprogram. Two-thirds, of course, of those on welfare are children but \nthe other one-third are those who are unskilled or untrained, generally \nfemale adults who have not had the advantage of schooling. So you have \nto set up schooling and a training program. Thereupon, you institute a \nhiring or a Government job program of last resort. Then, to get to \nwork, you have to institute, if you please, a child care center because \nthey have to leave the children at home to take the job. And on down \nthe list. You are not going to save that amount, of course, on welfare.\n  Another way, of course, in subsection C shows backloading the plan, \nwhereby all the real cuts are made in the last 2 years. The last year \nalone, for example, in the year 2002, they have to cut $347 billion. \nHere now, we are struggling and are not going to obtain $45 billion \nthis year with the best of intent and the contract and the headlines \nand everything else and cannot even reach the $45 billion cut. But in \nthe last year under this GOP budget, balanced budget plan, you have to \ncut $347 billion.\n  Then of course, you increase your revenues by decreasing revenues. \nThat sounds like double talk but that is the tax cut. You get into this \ngrowth argument that we have heard, now, for the last 2 weeks. All we \nneed is a tax cut. It is going to give us growth, growth, just like \nReaganomics said back in 1981 that put us into these horrendous \ndeficits, debt and interest costs on automatic pilot. It is going up, \nup and away, the spending is. That tax cut is $245 billion. Then you \nlook of course at the--and by borrowing from the public and from the \ntrust funds, another $1.8 trillion. And that borrowing includes $636 \nbillion embezzlement from Social Security.\n  At the present time, we have a $481 billion balance in Social \nSecurity. That is not the problem. Under Social Security, it is paid \nfor, for a good 25 to 30 years, easily. Yes, you have $481 billion \nthere and you are going to borrow another $636. At the end of the \nparticular budget plan, 2002, you are going to owe Social Security over \n$1 trillion.\n  So, Social Security is not the problem, 25 or 30 years out; Medicare \nis not the problem here, 7 years out, The problem is now. We have \nspending on automatic pilot. Interest costs on the national debt--like \ndeath, like taxes--cannot be avoided. In fact, treat it as a tax \nincrease, as I do in a sense. What we have is taxes being increased \nautomatically each day $1 billion a day. That is the real problem.\n  What happens here is both the Republican Congress and the Democratic \nWhite House, as well as the media--and I hope they will read this--are \nafraid to tell the American people the truth: That is, you cannot do it \nwithout a tax increase. So, what we need to do is cut spending, freeze \nspending, tax loopholes closing, withholding on new programs. I had to \nvote against AmeriCorps. Everybody is for voluntarism. In fact, I was \nparty to the institution of the Peace Corps. We can make that record \nsometime. But you cannot go into these new programs when you are trying \nto get rid of the deficit and the debt and decrease spending on \nautomatic pilot. So you need all of that plus, I suggest, a 5-percent \nvalue-added tax.\n  Mr. President, that is the point. We have seen this exercise. In the \nearly 1980's, I went with the Republican leadership and with Senator \nHoward Baker for a freeze. We could not get it. Then we realized by \n1985 that we had--in order to get this deficit and debt down for it was \ngrowing by leaps and bounds--to have automatic cuts across the board. \nWe had Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, and we looked at it. We said we still \nneed to close the loopholes. In 1986, we got tax reform.\n  Then, listen to this, in 1990, a bipartisan group of eight Senators, \nwho hate taxes as much as anybody else, got together in the Budget \nCommittee and voted for a value-added tax. Why? Because you cannot \nbalance the budget without all of the above--namely, spending cuts, \nspending freezes, loophole closings, denying new programs, and a tax \nincrease.\n  We have heard this thing about balanced budgets. I really regret it \nbecause I hear it on the floor. I see it on the screen on my TV about a \nbalanced budget. Those working the discipline know there is no idea of \nbalance the budget. I heard it just 15 years ago. President Reagan \npresented a budget--the document shows it, and I have it here--that the \nbudget would be balanced by 1984.\n  Again, under President Reagan, in late 1985 under Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings we pledged that balance--and we got awards for this one--that \nthe budget would be balanced by 1991. In 1990--at that time they had \ngone out to Andrews Air Force Base and vetoed, abolished, Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings cuts across the board and put in spending caps. Under that \nbudget--I will show you the document--they said that by 1995, just last \nmonth, you would have a $20.5 billion surplus.\n\n[[Page S16378]]\n\n  Has anyone ever heard the word ``surplus'' in Washington? Balanced \nbudgets by 1984, balanced budgets by 1991, and then, finally, in 1995--\nwe could look at the documents--a surplus of $20.5 billion. Here, \ninstead of a surplus of $20.5 billion, we have a $283.3 billion \ndeficit.\n  So there it is. ``Here we go again,'' as our fearless leader, \nPresident Ronald Reagan, said. ``Here we go again.''\n  I thank the distinguished Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16376-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16378-S16379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT AND A SENSE OF HISTORY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to draw my colleagues' \nattention to a column in today's Washington Post that is a good \nremembrance of the early 1960's when black students integrated Southern \ncolleges. In touching remarks, South Carolina native Charlayne Hunter-\nGault, public television's national news correspondent, weaves an \nexcellent reflection of the history of the times as she remembers the \nlife of Hamilton Earl Holmes. Together in 1961, Ms. Hunter-Gault and \nMr. Holmes became the first two African-American students to attend the \nUniversity of Georgia.\n  Back in the early 1960's as the University of Georgia integrated, the \nState of South Carolina was employing every means to keep Clemson \nUniversity segregated. We ran out of courts.\n  But fortunately, we had people like Mr. Holmes and Ms. Hunter-Gault \nwho were willing to show us the way in South Carolina. Their courage \nand ability to stand up led to Clemson's peaceful admission of Harvey \nGantt, the former mayor of Charlotte and a former candidate for U.S. \nSenate.\n  With the death of Hamilton Earl Holmes, it is important for us to \nremember the struggles of the past and to find the courage to move \nforward--and not fall further into the bitterness of racism and make \nmistakes of the past.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of Ms. Hunter-\nGault's column to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 31, 1995]\n\n                            One in a Million\n\n                      (By Charlayne Hunter-Gault)\n\n       One of the black men who was not ``one in a million'' at \n     the Million Man March was Hamilton Earl Holmes. But in a real \n     sense, if the purpose was to have black men ``stand up''--and \n     surely no one could have thought that this was the first time \n     that has happened--Hamilton had long since pioneered in \n     standing up. And while there might have been millions \n     cheering him on, for the most part he stood up alone.\n       It was in the early winter of 1961, when Hamilton Holmes, \n     armed with a court order, walked onto the campus of the \n     University of Georgia and into history as the first black man \n     ever to be admitted and attend classes there in its 170-year \n     history. If he never did anything else in his life, that \n     single act of manly courage in the face of jeers, spitting \n     and rioting would have been enough to qualify him as a \n     ``standup guy.'' but Hamp did that and a lot more. For a \n     major part of his purpose in life was to demonstrate to the \n     world that black men were as good as any men. Not better, but \n     as good as, although there were times in his classes in \n     biology and physics and calculus and all the other courses \n     that an aspiring doctor has to take that he earned a second \n     layer of enmity from his classmates by consistently pushing \n     the curve up to 98 or 99 and often a hundred, leaving the \n     next best grade some 10 points behind.\n       It was such a performance that led him to be elected to Phi \n     Beta Kappa, a notation that appeared beside his name when he \n     graduated in 1963 as one of two black students in a class of \n     2,000. Had he not been recovering from surgery on a heart \n     that was as big as the world, but in the end was vulnerable \n     to its pressures, he might have been at the Million Man March \n     with his son, Hamilton Jr. (Chip), at his side. And while his \n     was never the gift of oratory, he could have offered his own \n     quiet but soul-elevating testimony to the strength of black \n     men and to black families. He could surely have given the \n     lie, as he always had, to notions of inferiority and rampant \n     irresponsibility. He could have also provided as well a \n     window into a world that existed not so long ago, one that \n     raised obstacles and inflicted pain on black men that only \n     the most ignorant or callous among us would forget.\n       Hamp had come from a distinguished black family of doctors \n     and educators and activists who challenged the laws that kept \n     blacks ``in their place,'' starting when Hamp was still in \n     junior high school with the all-white Atlanta golf course. \n     His grandfather, a doctor who lived to be 82, once explained \n     the family philosophy to the writer Calvin Trillin: ``I \n     trained my children from infancy to fear nothing, and I told \n     my grandson the same thing. I told him to be meek. Be meek, \n     but don't look too humble. Because if you look too humble \n     they might think you're afraid, and there's nothing to be \n     afraid about, because the Lord will send his angel to watch \n     over you and you have nothing to fear.''\n       And Hamp produced a distinguished family. During his 30-\n     year marriage to Marilyn, he had a son who followed in his \n     footsteps, albeit less ceremoniously, to the University of \n     Georgia, graduated and now works in communications, and a \n     daughter. Allison, also a college graduate, who is in \n     banking. Also during those 30 years, he overcame whatever \n     bitterness he had toward the university and became one of its \n     biggest boosters and supporters. This was fairly amazing to \n     me, especially since the two things Hamp wanted most in \n     college were good labs (he had always said he could get the \n     education he needed at Morehouse, the all-black men's college \n     where he had a four-year, all-expenses-paid scholarship, but \n     the university had better facilities) and the opportunity to \n     play football for the Georgia Bulldogs. The officials at \n     Georgia refused to let him play ``for his own safety.'' But \n     when I returned on a visit to Atlanta in the early '80s, one \n     of the biggest ``dawgs'' around was Hamp, who by then had \n     accepted an appointment as a trustee to the Georgia \n     Foundation, the body that oversees university funding. The \n     other day, Charles Knapp, the current president of the \n     university, called Hamilton ``one of our most distinguished \n     graduates.''\n       In the years since Hamp and I were joined at the hip of \n     history, I have often had occasion to think back to the time \n     when we were fighting in federal court to win the right to \n     attend the university. President Knapp's words sent me back \n     to those days, when the top officials of the university tried \n     to keep Hamp out by testifying in court that he was \n     unqualified, not because he was black. The latter would have \n     been illegal under the 1954 Brown decision, and officials of \n     the state had sworn to resist integration, but only ``by all \n     legal means.'' Hamp might have been able to overlook being \n     called ``nigger,'' but ``unqualified''? The valedictorian of \n     our Turner High School class of 1956? The smartest student in \n     all Atlanta, according to his proud father, Tup. If there was \n     a fighting word to Hamp, it was that ``unqualified.''\n       And while he was slow to anger and preferred classroom \n     combat to the real thing, he was capable of standing up that \n     way too. Once, when had parked in front of the house of one \n     of the most racist fraternities on campus, and the fraternity \n     guys saw whose car it was, they began to taunt him and make \n     moves that suggested they were prepared to go further. \n     Knowing he had only himself to rely on and understanding the \n     white southern mentality perhaps better than they themselves, \n     Hamp made a quick but deliberate move to open the car door, \n     reached across to the glove compartment and took out \n     something that he immediately placed in his pocket. It was a \n     flashlight, but who knew? Hamp was relying on the prevailing \n     predisposition to embrace every known stereotype of black \n     men, and his instinct proved correct. They backed off in a \n     heartbeat. The irony of the encounter was that the next day, \n     Hamp was summoned to the dean's office and admonished for \n     carrying a gun. The rest of the time, the frat brothers did \n     their dirty deeds in stealth. Like letting the air out of \n     Hamp's tires while he was in class. Early and often.\n       But Hamp persevered, often finding release in a game of \n     pickup basketball with the brothers from town, who at that \n     point could come to football games but still had to sit in \n     the section reserved for blacks, called the ``crow's nest.'' \n     They were proud of Hamp; and who knows how many of them he \n     inspired--if not to apply to the university then to be all \n     they could be.\n       If he had been well enough and so inclined, that might have \n     been his message at the Million Man March. He might have \n     dusted off an old speech he made in our senior year, just \n     before he graduated, went on to become the first black \n     student at Emory Medical School and then to a distinguished \n     career as an orthopedic surgeon and teacher.\n       Back then, in the spring of 1963, he liked to talk about \n     ``The New Negro.'' ``Ours is a competitive society,'' he'd \n     say. ``This is true even more so for the Negro. He must \n     compete not only with other Negroes, but with the white man. \n     In most instances, in competition for jobs and status with \n     whites, the Negro must have more training and be more \n     qualified than his white counterpart if he is to beat him out \n     of a job. If the training and qualifications are equal, nine \n     out of 10 times the job will go to the white man. This is a \n     challenge to us as a race. We must not be content to be \n     equal, education- and training-wise, but we must strive to be \n     superior in order to be given an equal chance. This is \n     something that I have experienced in my short tenure at the \n     University of Georgia. I cannot feel satisfied with just \n     equaling the average grades there. I am striving to be \n     superior in order to be accepted as an equal. If the average \n     is B, then I want an A. The importance of superior training \n     cannot be overemphasized. This is a peculiar situation, I \n     know, but it is reality, and reality is something that we \n     Negroes must learn to live with.''\n       How much would he have edited that speech for the march? \n     Hamilton Earl Holmes was not there that day to be one in a \n     million, and today we will bury him, one in a million, to be \n     sure, but also one of many millions of black men who have \n     given more than should \n\n[[Page S16379]]\n\n     have been required of any human beings, and whose death at 54 \n     should give us pause to contemplate the meaning of his life, \n     of theirs and of the millions of black men who live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16378-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      INNOVATIVE LEADERSHIP BY THE INS AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to call \nthe attention of my colleagues in Congress to a compelling example of \nthe kind of innovation we are seeing today by the Clinton \nadministration in addressing the problem of illegal immigration.\n  Stronger border enforcement is part of the answer. But is obviously \nnot the only answer. The Immigration and Naturalization Service \nestimates that 40 to 50 percent of the illegal aliens currently in the \nUnited States entered the country legally on visitors visas and other \ntemporary visas, then remained illegally in the country after their \nvisas expired.\n  The overriding challenge we face is to remove the magnet of jobs \nwhich encourage so many people to come to the United States illegally \nor to remain here illegally.\n  A key element in this strategy must be to assist employers to abide \nby the law and to hire only those persons entitled to work in the \nUnited States.\n  Clearly, the INS is making progress. Last week, the Ford Foundation \nand the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard announced that \nan INS program in Dallas has won one of this year's Innovations in \nAmerican Government Awards for its success in encouraging employers to \nremove illegal aliens from their rolls and hiring U.S. workers in their \nplace.\n  This kind of innovation combats illegal immigration, helps employers, \nand provides good jobs for American workers. I am hopeful that as \nCongress considers immigration reform legislation in the coming weeks, \nwe can encourage more new approaches like this to combating illegal \nimmigration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nWashington Post describing the Dallas INS initiative be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 26, 1995]\n\n        Foundation Awards Honor 15 Creative Government Programs\n\n                           (By Stephen Barr)\n\n       When the Immigration and Naturalization Service discovered \n     220 illegal immigrants were working at a Dallas plant that \n     makes aluminum windows and doors, INS agents could have \n     raided the plant and deported the workers. But a raid might \n     have put the company out of business.\n       So INS assistant district director Neil Jacobs offered the \n     company a ``common-sense approach'' to the problem. Rather \n     than treat the company as the enemy, he gave it 60 days to \n     recruit replacement workers from Dallas-area community and \n     welfare programs. When the deadline arrived, the INS made its \n     arrests and the company averted a shutdown.\n       Today, the Innovations in American Government awards \n     program sponsored by the Ford Foundation and Harvard \n     University will announce that Jacob's strategy for enforcing \n     immigration laws is one of 15 local, state and federal \n     programs receiving a $100,000 cash prize.\n       Thus is the first time that awards have gone to federal \n     programs since the Ford Foundation and Harvard's John F. \n     Kennedy School of Government began their initiative in 1986. \n     The awards will go to six federal and nine state and local \n     programs at a time when a Republican-controlled Congress is \n     cutting federal spending and turning more responsibility over \n     to the states.\n       Three of the federal programs honored this year, such as \n     Jacobs's ``Operation Jobs,'' reflect the government's search \n     for less punitive and more effective ways to regulate \n     business. A number of the local and state award winners \n     created solutions to their problems by forgoing partnerships \n     with unions, nonprofit organizations and private-sector \n     companies to deliver services cheaper or more efficiently.\n       In the current cost-cutting environment, Michael Lipsky, \n     the Ford Foundation official responsible for the innovations \n     program, said, ``It is the deeply felt position of the \n     foundation that the government deserves more recognition for \n     creativity and ought to be encouraged to be better.''\n       As Debbie Blair, the personnel manager at General \n     Aluminum--a plant in Dallas that tried Jacobs's approach--\n     said, ``Clearly, the old tactics used by INS were not \n     successful. They are thinking smarter in trying to figure out \n     a new way to solve an old problem.''\n       In Texas, a major INS problem has been how to handle \n     illegal immigrants, mostly from Mexico, who obtain jobs with \n     fraudulent papers. Although job applicants must show \n     employers documents that indicate they are U.S. citizens or \n     legal residents, federal law allows candidates to choose \n     which papers from a prescribed list to present employers.\n       In some cases when the INS found widespread violations, it \n     would secure a warrant, raid a company without informing the \n     employer and endanger its own agents as they conducted \n     arrests. Jacobs found, however, that the illegal workers \n     quickly returned to the Dallas area and got new jobs or their \n     old jobs back. ``That was frustrating us,'' he said.\n       So Jacobs, keeping in step with INS policy to work toward \n     increasing voluntary compliance with the law, threw out his \n     idea for ``Operation Jobs'' at a staff meeting one day and, \n     after a few false starts, his Dallas office created a system \n     linking the INS to police and community groups. The INS \n     ``treats the employer as the client rather than the enemy,'' \n     he said.\n       Moving beyond its traditional enforcement functions, the \n     Dallas INS office began putting employers in touch with city \n     social service programs, refugee assistance groups and other \n     community agencies that try to find jobs for laid-off \n     workers, legal immigrants or school dropouts. To avert \n     financial losses, companies are given time to recruit and \n     train the new hires, writhe the understanding that at a pre-\n     arranged time the INS will show up to make arrests.\n       ``Everybody wins on all sides,'' said Tina Jenkins, a \n     Tarrant County official who helps out-of-work residents get \n     emergency assistance for rent and utilities. ``We get people \n     employed, the employer is happy, and it's good p.r. for INS--\n     they aren't looked at as the bad guys.''\n       Jacobs estimates that about 50 companies have participated \n     in Operations Jobs over the last two years, providing \n     residents of North Texas about 3,000 jobs that previously \n     were held by undocumented workers.\n       Many companies, of course, gamble that INS will never learn \n     about their hiring practices, and not every INS attempt at \n     cooperation with companies under investigation works out. \n     ``We've had situations where we get back in 30 days and no \n     one is left,'' Jacobs acknowledged. ``But most employers feel \n     that if `I don't show I'm a team player now . . . .' we won't \n     be as cooperative the next time we do an inspection.''\n       Under pressure from the Republican Congress, the Clinton \n     administration has been moving toward more aggressive \n     enforcement of the prohibition on hiring illegal immigrants. \n     Still, in Jacobs's office, fewer than a dozen of the 50 \n     agents he supervises handle employer sanctions.\n       The notion that regulatory and enforcement agencies like \n     INS and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \n     also an award winner this year, should create partnerships \n     with the private sector ``doubtless reflects the mood of the \n     time,'' said Alan Altshuler, the director of the innovations \n     program at Harvard.\n       ``Good government has to be creative, innovative government \n     today,'' Altshuler said. ``It is not enough to simply get rid \n     of waste, fraud and abuse.''\n       The 15 award winners, who were selected from a field of \n     about 1,600, will be honored tonight at a dinner that Vice \n     President Gore is scheduled to attend. The finalists were \n     selected by a committee headed by former Michigan governor \n     William G. Milliken (R) that included industry leaders, \n     journalists and former elected officials.\n       The program encountered some of Washington's legendary red \n     tape when it was informed that some of the federal agencies \n     being honored could not legally accept the gifts. As a \n     result, the $100,000 prizes will be administered by the \n     nonprofit Council for Excellence in Government. The council \n     will help the agencies sponsor conferences or events to \n     explain their programs to other groups.\n       The awards represent a small fraction of the $268 million \n     in grant money that the Ford Foundation gave away last year, \n     Lipsky said, but provide the foundation with a forum to \n     ``stand for the proposition that there is a great deal of \n     good in government that goes unrecognized. While no one says \n     government is perfect, the balance between positive news and \n     negative news goes heavily toward the negative.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16379-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16379-S16380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on that evening in 1972 when I first was \nelected to the Senate, I made a commitment to myself that I would never \nfail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who wanted to \nsee me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned that the total Federal debt which is \n$27 billion shy of $5 trillion--which we will pass this year. Of \ncourse, Congress is responsible for creating this monstrosity for which \nthe coming generations will have to pay.\n  The young people and I almost always discuss the fact that under the \nU.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that \nhas not first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and \nSenate of the United States.\n\n[[Page S16380]]\n\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record of the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, Monday, October \n30, stood at $4,975,234,385,762.72 or $18,886.08 for every man, woman, \nand child in America on a per capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt since my most recent report this \npast Friday--which identified the total Federal debt as of the close of \nbusiness on Thursday, October 26, 1995--shows an increase of \n$1,559,581,857.19 during that 4-day period. That 4-day increase is \nequivalent to the amount of money needed by 231,255 students to pay \ntheir college tuitions for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16379-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION AND DEREGULATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to update \nmy colleagues on the progress we are making on telecommunications \nreform in the 104th Congress. Last Wednesday morning I had the honor of \nchairing the organizational meeting of the Senate-House conference on \nS. 652, the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n1995.\n  It was truly a historic day. We began the final stage of enacting \ncomprehensive telecommunications deregulation legislation--the most \nsignificant and profound change in our Nation's telecommunications \npolicy and law in over 60 years.\n  As conference chairman, I will continue--as I have throughout this \nlong process--to work in an open, inclusive, and bipartisan fashion \nwith all of my Senate and House colleagues. In particular, I want to \nthank the Senate Commerce Committee's ranking Democratic member, \nSenator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, for his leadership and \nwillingness to work cooperatively with me at each stage of this \nprocess.\n  I also heartily applaud the tremendous work of our House colleagues \nin helping get us to this stage of the process. I very much look \nforward to working closely with them under the able leadership of \nCommerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, and ranking Democrat John \nDingell, Telecommunications Subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields, and \nranking Democrat Ed Markey, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry \nHyde, and ranking Democrat John Conyers.\n  Let me also add that I look forward to working with President \nClinton, Vice President Gore, and others in the executive branch. I \nhave welcomed the administration's input from the beginning of the \nprocess.\n  I am firmly committed to moving this conference forward as rapidly as \npossible. In order to move quickly, however, we must remain within the \nconfines of the two bills before us. To do otherwise would be like \nopening the proverbial Pandora's box. It would result in unacceptable \ndelay as we rehash issues resolved through hours, days, weeks and \nmonths of negotiation and committee and floor votes at earlier points \nin this long process.\n  I am convinced we can rapidly move this conference forward due to the \nstriking degree of similarity between the two bills. Moreover, we have \nthe strong support and commitment from the leadership in both Chambers \nto act this year.\n  The time has long passed since Congress needed to reassert its \nrightful place in establishing national telecommunications policy. \nDozens of lines of business restrictions carve up telecommunications \nand forbid competition. Meanwhile, once separate and distinct industry \nsegments have become indistinguishable due to digital technology. Yet \nthe regulatory apartheid regime remains.\n  The conference on telecommunications reform will produce a report to \nchange all that. We will open all telecommunications markets to \ncompetition. The result will be a procompetitive, deregulatory and \nbalanced regime. Competition and deregulation, after all, are the only \nsure-fire ways to ensure: an explosion of new technologies and choices \nfor consumers, massive new market investment, captialization, and job \ncreation, lower prices for telecommunications products and services, \nand an end to monopolies and media concentration.\n\n  The legislation we are crafting is, simply put, the most \ncomprehensive deregulation of the telecommunications industry in \nAmerican history. It will promote advanced telecommunications, \ninformation networks and other resources in such a manner as to ensure \nAmerica remains the envy of the world. In order to maintain our world \nleadership position in communications, however, we need this \nlegislation and we need it now.\n  Mr. President, I was pleased to receive a letter from the majority \nleader, Senator Bob Dole, reiterating his desire to complete action on \nthe telecommunications reform bill prior to adjourning for the year. \nThis is entirely consistent with my stated intention from the very \nbeginning of this process--to enact a new telecommunications \nderegulation law in 1995.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from \nSenator Dole printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             October 25, 1995.\n\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Senate Russell \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Larry, Thank you for all your hard work on \n     telecommunications reform. The year has been long, but we \n     have moved faster and farther than anyone expected us to. It \n     remains my desire to pass a final bill before we adjourn this \n     session.\n       The next few weeks are critical and no doubt will be \n     intense. I would appreciate your keeping me and David Wilson \n     informed on the progress of the telecommunications conference \n     committee. You know better than most that we must keep this \n     legislation grounded in strong, straightforward Republican \n     principles of competition and deregulation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Dole,\n     United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16380-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16380-S16381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EVERGREEN MARINE GROUP: CELEBRATING 20 YEARS OF SERVICE IN CHARLESTON\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the role \nEvergreen Marine Group has played in the economic development of my \nhome city, State, and region over the past 20 years.\n  The M/V Ever Spring sailed into Charleston harbor on October 21, \n1975. This first vessel began what was to become a long and prosperous \nrelationship. In its first year of operations in Charleston, Evergreen \ncarried 45,000 tons of cargo on 19 ships through the port. Last year, \nEvergreen carried over 1.5 million tons on more than 100 ships through \nCharleston.\n  Cargo ships reflect incredible investments by the ocean carrier and \nprovide many opportunities for economic development in the regions they \nserve. They represent the equivalent of floating factories, adding \nvalue to products by delivering them where they are needed, when \nneeded. Few Americans realize that 95 percent of our international \ntrade moves by ship.\n  Evergreen's services in Charleston have allowed business and personal \nrelationships to grow and prosper. The trading relationships forged \nbetween companies in geographically distanced nations work to bind our \nworld. More than just raw materials, parts and finished goods flow \nacross the oceans--ideas, culture and shared personal experiences make \nus more aware and considerate of the world in which we live.\n  Evergreen began its first scheduled container service in 1975, \nlinking Asia with Charleston and the U.S. east coast. Ten years later, \nEvergreen began the industry's first two-way, round-the-world service. \nToday, the company operates in almost every trading market on our \nglobe. Evergreen has also diversified into other areas, such as real \nestate and aviation, becoming the first private, international air \ncarrier in Taiwan.\n  Yung-fa Chang, Evergreen's founder, has used hard work, tireless \ndedication to the customer and support of those who are working toward \nthe common goal as the cornerstones of Evergreen's success. This past \nspring my home State's University of South Carolina, site of the \nNation's highest ranking international business program, awarded him an \nhonorary doctor of business administration, a testament to his \nachievements.\n  Charleston is one of the most dynamic and fastest growing regions in \n\n[[Page S16381]]\n\nthe country, attracting capital investment and interest from around the \nglobe and we are proud to have Evergreen be a part of our community. We \nare appreciative of the commitment Evergreen has made to our area and \nlook forward to continued success together.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16380-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MIDDLE EAST PEACE FACILITATION ACT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am informed that there will be a \nRepublican objection to the unanimous-consent request regarding the \nshort-term extension of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, also \nknown as MEPFA.\n  MEPFA was enacted by the Congress in 1994, to give the President \nmuch-needed flexibility to help Israel and the Palestinians implement \ntheir historic peace treaty. Under the terms of MEPFA, the President \ncan waive certain restrictions against the PLO. In essence, this means \nthe President can provide assistance to the Palestinians, and the PLO \ncan operate an office in the United States.\n  MEPFA is a vital component of American support for the peace \nprocess--both practically and symbolically. On a practical level, U.S. \nassistance for the Palestinians has helped the fledgling Palestinian \nAuthority to get off the dime and provide desperately needed services \nto the people of the West Bank and Gaza. Both Israeli and Palestinian \nofficials agree that if their peace agreement is to succeed, there must \nbe a dramatic improvement in the everyday lives of the Palestinian \npeople. They must be aware of the fruits of peace.\n  U.S. assistance, much of which is channeled through the World Bank's \nfund for the Palestinians, has helped the donor community secure \nadditional funding from other sources. With the United States leading \nby example, other nations have come forth with significant donations to \nhelp the Palestinians.\n  The United States has also used MEPFA to influence the Palestinian \nleadership to move in certain directions. MEPFA guarantees that our aid \nbe transferred only if the Palestinians are complying with the letter \nand spirit of their peace agreements with Israel. Using our assistance \nas leverage, the United States has been able to ensure that the \nPalestinians stand by their word on critical issues such as preventing \nterrorism against Israel.\n  Israel's leaders have said that the Palestinians are doing much \nbetter when it comes to preventing terrorism, a fact which United \nStates officials confirm. And that, in my view, is the bottom line for \nthe success of the Israel-PLO peace treaty. If the PLO prevents acts of \nterrorism, then Israelis will feel more secure, more comfortable with \nthe peace agreement. Only then will Israelis and Palestinians establish \na truly lasting peace.\n  On a symbolic level, MEPFA is a very powerful instrument. MEPFA \nsymbolizes the U.S. commitment to be the honest broker of the peace \nprocess. MEPFA is a signal to the Palestinians--and indeed to the rest \nof the world--that the United States is willing to suspend its laws \nagainst the PLO to give peace a real chance. In a certain sense, it \nresembles the dictum put forth during the Reagan administration \nregarding the former Soviet Union--``trust, but verify.'' In effect, we \nhave said to the Palestinians we will trust them to fulfill their \nagreements, and that they will receive our blessing as long as they \nremain faithful.\n  The objection lodged earlier today puts all of that at risk. Our \nRepublican colleagues are endangering the Middle East peace process by \nrefusing to allow a brief, short-term extension of current laws. At a \ntime when our traditional ally, Israel, is taking enormous risks for \npeace, the objection sends just the wrong signal. The objection says \nthat some of us are unwilling to support our best friend in the Middle \nEast, at the very time it needs us the most.\n  It is even more perplexing to realize that the Senate has already \ndebated, and for all intents and purposes, resolved the substance of \nthis issue. The Senate passed a long-term extension of MEPFA as part of \nthe foreign operations bill, and this short-term extension is only \nnecessary to get us to the point where the foreign ops bill becomes \nlaw.\n  Under these circumstances, its hard to imagine that the objection \nraised goes directly to the merits of the bill. I would hope that the \npoints I have made would help to convince my colleagues of the \nimportance of acting on this measure today, and if possible, \nimmediately.\n  It troubles me that there is a willingness among some of my \ncolleagues to jeopardize the Middle East peace process. I would hope on \nan issue of such critical importance to our Nation's security, we could \nput aside differences and deal directly with the matter at hand.\n  I am very concerned that we are running out of time--MEPFA expires at \nmidnight tonight, and the House could go into recess early this \nevening. I hope very much that we can resolve this issue quickly, but \nif we cannot, there should be no doubt about the consequences and about \nwhere the responsibility lies. I am ready to pass this short-term \nextension here and now, and in all sincerety, I would ask anyone with \nan objection to come to the floor so that we might reach an agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16381-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16381-S16382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today I wish to address an issue which holds \ngreat significance for the international world order. The subject is \nthe International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a body \nwhich can contribute greatly to the reconciliation of the parties to \nthis brutal conflict. As a guarantor of respect for the rule of law and \nfor the protection of human rights, this tribunal supports the \nprinciples upon which any lasting peace must be founded. As the peace \nnegotiations among the Bosnian Serbs, Croats, and Moslems begin \ntomorrow in Dayton, OH, today is an opportune time to reaffirm that the \nwork of the tribunal is a separate but equally important step in the \neffort to rebuild civil society in the region. No matter the outcome of \nthis round of negotiations, the work of the War Crimes Tribunal must go \nforward with strong U.S. support.\n  Mr. President, over the last few days, we have been horrified by a \nseries of front page stories and photos of the terrible atrocities that \nhave occurred in Bosnia. These press reports indicate that United \nStates intelligence has been instrumental in locating mass graves in \nBosnia. Those revelations, when paired with refugee accounts of the \nterrifying trek from Srebrenica to Central Bosnia, suggest that \nhundreds, perhaps thousands, of Moslem men and boys were murdered by \nthe Bosnian Serbs. The United States should place a high priority on \ncollecting information related to these atrocities and on making all \nevidence available to the War Crimes Tribunal. Just as the tribunals at \nNuremberg punished the aggressors and facilitated the reconciliation \nefforts after World War II, so too must this War Crimes Tribunal \nredress the horrors that have occurred in Bosnia. I am proud to say \nthat my father, the late Herbert C. Pell, a former Congressman from New \nYork City, was President Franklin Roosevelt's representative on the \nU.N. War Crimes Commission that laid the groundwork for the \nestablishment of the Nuremberg tribunal. Today, we must support this \nnew tribunal to ensure that the injustices of the war in Bosnia are \ncorrected.\n  The objectives of the tribunal are threefold: To deter further crimes \nby the war parties, to punish those responsible for war crimes, and to \nensure justice during and after the process of reconciliation and \nreconstruction of Bosnia. Through the public identification, trial, and \nconviction of war criminals, the international community hopes to \ncontribute to the peace process by demonstrating the strength and \neffectiveness of international human rights law. The U.N. Security \nCouncil created the tribunal in May of 1993, and the court convened for \nthe first time in November of that year. Yet the progress of the \ntribunal has been slow. \n\n[[Page S16382]]\n\nWhile 42 Serbs and one Croat have been indicated by the tribunal, only \none person is actually in custody. The difficulties of taking \ndefendants into custody are manifold, but this is not the only reason \nfor the lack of progress.\n  The biggest obstacle facing the tribunal is funding. Recently, \nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali placed restrictions on the work \nof many U.N. agencies--including the tribunal--to avoid a financial \ncrisis in the United Nations. These fiscal restraints have seriously \naffected the tribunal by freezing the revenues needed to fund its work. \nUnfortunately, much of the responsibility for the U.N.'s debt can be \nlaid at our own door. Throughout my tenure as chairman of the Committee \non Foreign Relations, I consistently argued against the mounting \nAmerican debt to the United Nations that today has reached $1.2 \nbillion. Today, despite significant efforts on the part of the U.N. \nSecretariat to meet American demands for reforming its bureaucracy, \nCongress is again voting for cuts in funding for the United Nations and \nits agencies.\n  A serious consequence for the tribunal of this loss of funding is the \npostponement announced last week of the only trial actually scheduled \non the court's docket. Lawyers for Dusan Tadic, who is current the sole \ndefendant in custody at The Hague, have requested and received a \npostponement of the trial until next year because of a lack of \nresources needed to prepare an adequate defense. Justice Richard \nGoldston, the chief prosecutor for the tribunal, has warned that the \ncourt will be unable to guarantee the accused's right to a fair and \nspeedy trial without the appropriate resources. In addition, the \ntribunal has already been unable to send investigators into the field \nor to recruit lawyers and other personnel. Clearly, under the current \nfinancial crisis, the principles of the tribunal could be compromised.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I believe that the United States should \ncontinue to offer financial and political support for the War Crimes \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Last year, I supported Senator \nLeahy's amendment to the 1995 foreign operations appropriations bill \nthat offered $25 million in goods and commodities to the United Nations \nfor its efforts to investigate war crimes. Our contributions have been \ndeeply appreciated and well used by the tribunal in its work. I would \nurge my colleagues to continue this type of support and demonstrate our \nfirm commitment to international human rights law. As the world waits \nfor the results of the negotiations in Ohio this week, let us remember \nthat the work of the International War Crimes Tribunal is of equal \nsignificance in the reconstruction of the State of Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16381-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16382-S16384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE 1872 MINING LAW\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have just come from the second \nconference committee meeting on Interior appropriations. As you recall, \nin the first conference committee report there was a provision to take \nthe existing moratorium on mining patents away so that the Bureau of \nLand Management would start issuing patents again.\n  Just for background information, the provision last year prevented \nthe Interior Department from accepting new patent applications and \nprohibited Interior from processing existing applications except those \n393 applications which had gotten relatively far in the process.\n  Today, the conference committee effectively rejected the patent \nmoratorium even though when the original conference committee submitted \nits report to the House of Representatives, the House voted almost two \nto one not to accept it and to send it back to the conference committee \nbetween the House and the Senate to rework the mining patent provision. \nWell, they reworked it. They reworked it with Saran Wrap. It is so \ntransparent that it does not even pass the giggle test.\n  What is so transparent about it? The new conference report says, we \nwill continue the moratorium that we had last year until either: No. 1, \nthe President signs a reconciliation bill that relates --think of it--\nto patenting and royalties; or No. 2, both the House and the Senate \npass another piece of legislation relating to royalties, patenting and \nreclamation, even if the President vetoes that bill.\n  Mr. President, royalties, reclamation, and patenting are all in the \nreconciliation bill. They are scams, but they are in there. And so if \nthe reconciliation bill is signed into law or if Congress includes the \nsame sham provisions on another bill, the moratorium is off. The 233 \npatent applications that we have told BLM they cannot go forward with \nwill be processed, will ultimately be granted, and the mining companies \nwill receive thousands of acres of land containing billions of dollars \nworth of gold, silver, platinum and palladium, for which the U.S. \nGovernment will not receive one red cent. Let me strike that. They will \nreceive a red cent. The reconciliation bill has a royalty provision. It \nwill provide $18 million to the Treasury over the next 7 years.\n  I will let you be the judges, Mr. President and colleagues, is this a \nscam on the American people or not? Under the reconciliation bill, if \nthese provisions stay, the Government will receive $18 million in \nroyalties on Federal lands that are mined over the next 7 years. How \nmuch do you think the mining companies are going to take off the land \nin the next 7 years--Federal lands, patented and unpatented? I will \ntell you what it is: tens of billions of dollars of gold, silver, \nplatinum, and palladium. And in exchange the taxpayers of this country \nwill receive less than $5 million per year.\n  In the 123-year period, since the mining law of 1872 was signed by \nUlysses Grant, the mining companies have extracted in today's dollars, \naccording to the Mineral Policy Center, $241 billion--not million, \nbillion--worth of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and other hard \nrock minerals. What has poor old Uncle Sugar, Uncle Sucker gotten for \nthat $240 billion worth of hard rock minerals? Zip, zero, nothing.\n  The argument is made that the mining companies create jobs, and they \ndo. So does General Motors; so does RCA; so does General Electric. But \nwe do not build billion-dollar buildings for those people to \nmanufacture in, conditioned on them hiring somebody.\n  It is the most incredible thing. This is the seventh year I have \nfought this battle. In 1991, I came close. I came within one vote of \nstopping this. What do you think happened after that? The number of \napplicants for patents on lands skyrocketed. It scared the life out of \nthe mining companies. I remember the Stillwater Mining Co., which was \nowned by a couple of paupers called Manville and Chevron. They applied \nfor their patents on 2,000 acres of land in Montana 4 days after I came \nwithin one vote of winning this battle. What do you think there is \nunder the 2,000 acres? There is $38 billion worth of platinum and \npalladium. That is their figure, not mine. They are the ones that say \nit is worth $38 billion. Two or three years ago representatives of \nStillwater came to my office and said their situation was very dicy. \n``We are just not sure we can open this up. It may not be profitable.''\n  So what happened? Last year Manville bought Chevron's interest in the \nmine and just recently Manville sold its interest to a group of public \ninvestors for $110 million plus a 5-percent royalty. They can deal with \neach other and retain overrides of 5 percent. But if you suggest they \npay Uncle Sucker 1 percent, the hue and cry goes up in this body as \nthough you have just defamed the Holy Bible.\n  When I said a moment ago that the provisions in the reconciliation \nbill were a scam, so transparent they would not even pass the giggle \ntest, there is a provision in the reconciliation bill that is even \nworse, which says that the mining companies will pay ``fair market \nvalue.''\n  Now, does that not sound reasonable? You can go home and tell the \nChamber of Commerce where they know nothing about this mining \nlegislation, and somebody raises the issue: ``But, Senator, how can you \nvote to give billions \n\n[[Page S16383]]\n\nof dollars worth of gold and silver away that belong to the taxpayers \nand not get a dime in return? The mining companies are happy to pay up \nto 24 percent to private owners, but not one thin dime to the Federal \nGovernment. How can you justify that?''\n  Mr. Politician says: ``I tell you how I justify it. I am going to \nmake them pay and I have voted to make them pay fair market value.''\n  Mr. Chamber of Commerce questioner says: ``That sounds like a fair \ndeal to me.''\n  That is the end of the story, except for one little thing. Fair \nmarket value is defined as the surface, not the minerals.\n  So Stillwater Mining Co. which has 38 billion dollars' worth of \nplatinum and palladium under their 2,000 acres will pay $10,000 under \ncurrent law, and once the fair market value goes into effect they pay \n$200,000, or $100 per acre. Is that not something? Mr. President, $100 \nan acre for 2,000 acres of land, and the taxpayers of this country get \nthe shaft again.\n  When you say ``fair market value,'' I have a proposition for the \nmining companies: I would like to offer an amendment here for my \ncolleagues to vote on, reversing fair market value. Define fair market \nvalue as the minerals, and we will give you the surface. They would \nknock that door down over there getting out of here.\n  Do you think they do not know what they are doing? Do you think the \nSenators who come in here and offer these outrageous proposals do not \nknow what they are doing? I invite anybody to ask any Senator to \nexplain one simple question: Why is it, Senator, that the mining \ncompanies are willing to pay the States royalties to mine hard rock \nminerals on State lands, why is it they are willing to pay up to 24 \npercent royalties on private lands, but if you suggest a 1 percent \nroyalty on Federal lands, they are all going to go broke, shut down, \nand throw all those poor innocent people out of a job? I invite any \nSenator to come to the floor and answer that question.\n  Mr. President, 135 years is long enough. I thought maybe we could \ndevelop a little shame, so I raised the issue. How can you vote to cut \n$270 billion in Medicare for the elderly for their health care? Do not \ngive me that wordsmith junk about how we are not cutting, we are just \nslowing the growth.\n  Mr. President, 75 percent of the people on this country over 75 on \nSocial Security live on less than $25,000 a year. They are scared to \ndeath they will have a toothache and have to have a root canal. They \nare terrified of a cancer diagnosis, which they know will break them \neven if they are covered by Medicare. Mr. President, 50 percent go to \nbed terrified at night even thinking about the possibility.\n  So we routinely cut $270 billion from Medicare for the elderly. We \ncut Medicaid for the poorest of the poor. There were even proposals to \ncut out Medicare-Medicaid benefits for 13-year-old pregnant girls. Yes, \nI talked to a doctor Saturday afternoon who told me about witnessing \nthe delivery of a baby of an 11-year-old.\n  Go to any indigent hospitals and find out what is going on in the \nworld. We will take care of that. We will teach them reliance, \nindependence. We will make good citizens out of them. We are going to \ncut their school lunches. We are going to cut Medicaid.\n  If you happen to want a college education, we are cutting education \nby 30 percent--the most massive cut in the history of the world in \neducation. We are going to cut Head Start. We are going to cut school \nbreakfasts when teachers tell me oftentimes that is the only decent \nmeal the child gets during the day.\n  What are we going to do for the mining companies? We are going to \ngive them carte blanche to mine all the hard rock minerals they want to \nmine off of Federal lands that belong to the taxpayers. Is that called \ncorporate welfare? How can you call it anything else?\n  How can anybody with a straight face say we will balance the budget, \nand we are going to do it off the backs of the people who can least \nafford it, and we are going to give a $250 billion tax cut which is \nreally a tax break for the wealthiest people in America.\n  Many people who make less than $25,000 a year and have children will \nnever get a dime. If you have a wife and two children and you are \nmaking $100,000 a year and paying $10,000 in taxes, you get the whole \nsmear. If you have a wife and four children making $20,000 or $25,000 a \nyear and you pay no income tax, you do not get a dime.\n  What kind of tax equity, tax fairness is that? There is something \nseriously wrong in this Congress and there is something seriously wrong \nin this country when we routinely and almost cavalierly allow these \ngiant mining companies all these hard rock minerals--billions of \ndollars worth every year--for nothing in exchange and penalize the most \nvulnerable people in America.\n  I do not often agree with the senior Senator from Texas, Senator \nGramm. However, when he says he wants everybody to start getting out of \nthe wagon and help pull, I could not agree more. I say to these big \ncorporate mining companies, many of which are foreign owned, get out of \nthe back of the wagon and help the rest of us pull.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I was stunned to see that the \nUnited States will consider paying $1 billion to the United Nations.\n  I was stunned because Mexico owes the United States $1.3 billion--it \nwas due yesterday, and this administration told Mexico they did not \nhave to make the payment on time--maybe later.\n  When I ran for the Senate in 1992, I said that I wanted to bring more \ncommon sense to Washington. This is a perfect example of our misplaced \npriorities, and our sense of fiscal responsibility.\n  Mexico owes us over $1 billion--due yesterday and they do not have to \npay.\n  Even though the United Nations is den of waste and abuse with no \nreforms in sight, this waste and abuse has been going on for a long \ntime.\n  On October 19, I introduced a sense-of-the-Senate, Resolution 185, \nthat Mexico should repay its debts to the United States on time and in \nfull.\n  None of these debts should be reduced or rescheduled. The sense-of-\nthe-Senate also says that no further loans should be made to Mexico \nwithout specific congressional approval.\n  Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, in a big public relations move, Mexico \nmade a $700 million repayment on the $12.5 billion in loans that it \nowes to the United States. However, Mexico owed the United States $2 \nbillion on October 30, 1995.\n  By paying the $700 million early, they planned--and it worked--to \navoid making the full payment, the remaining $1.3 billion, on October \n30. Mexico bet correctly. This administration told them they did not \nhave to pay. They could roll over the payment.\n  Mr. President, if Mexico does not make these payments on time in the \nbeginning, these so called loans will quickly become foreign aid--they \nwill not be paid off.\n  The Congress did not vote for foreign aid. The American taxpayer \ncannot afford more foreign aid. And the loans to Mexico should not \nbecome foreign aid.\n  The bulk of the United States loans to Mexico do not come due until \n1997. They will not be fully repaid until the year 2000. But if Mexico \ncannot repay its short term loans on time--then I do not have any hope \nthat the loans coming due in 1997 through 2000 will ever be repaid. \nThey will roll it over into foreign aid.\n  This particular $2 billion loan has been extended now three times. \nThis is an outrage. And what makes it worse is that the administration \nwants to throw away another $1 billion of taxpayers money, this time on \nthe United Nations.\n  The United Nations has a huge bureaucracy. In 1993, the Bush \nadministration found that the United Nations has no means by which to \nstop waste, fraud, and abuse by its employees. Mr. President, salaries \nfor the 53,000 U.N. bureaucrats are 24 percent higher than for our \ncivil servants. We are the ones paying the bills. They have a $12 \nbillion retirement fund at the United Nations. The Secretary General \nmakes more \n\n[[Page S16384]]\n\nthan our President. And we are sending money to support that type of \nextravagance.\n  These U.N. conferences are a waste of money and are boondoggles. \nThere is no better description of them than a boondoggle. In 1996, one \nis planned in Istanbul called a City Summit held to address urban \nproblems. One was held last March in Copenhagen called a Social Summit. \nFrom what we hear it was quite the social occasion. And we all know \nabout the cost of the Woman's Conference held in Communist China in \nSeptember.\n  The highlight of the 50th anniversary celebration was their \ninvitation to Fidel Castro--a Communist dictator--who got applause when \nhe asked the United States to end the embargo against Cuba. I am sure \nthis celebration cost the United States a huge sum of money. And that \nis what we will be paying for with the $1 billion they plan to send.\n  Further, Mr. President, there are now 16 U.N. peacekeeping operations \naround the world that are costing us over $1 billion a year.\n  The fact is that over the last 50 years we have paid the United \nNations $96 billion. Current estimates are that we still pay 40 percent \nof the United Nations budget. We still pay 40 percent of U.N. budget. \nYet, when a Communist dictator stands up to criticize this country, he \ngets a standing ovation.\n\n  Mr. President, the point of all this is the United States should be \nconcentrating on collecting the money that is owed us and not finding \nways to send more out. Instead, the Clinton administration spends its \ntime and effort trying to appease the United Nations--and finds ways to \nspend tax dollars.\n  I want to put this administration on notice that I will do everything \nI can to stop the United Nations from getting this money until Mexico \npays us back in full and on time.\n  Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16382-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16384-S16400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee \nconference on H.R. 1905 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1905) making appropriations for energy and water development \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 26, 1995.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there will \nbe a request for a rollcall vote on the adoption of this conference \nreport. Therefore, I am advised in behalf of the leader that there will \nbe another vote today expected on this conference report. We will work \nit as expeditiously as we can. But I understand one Senator wants to \nspeak and will not be here until around 5 o'clock. So we will not \nfinish any sooner than that.\n  Does the Senator from Arkansas wish to speak?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I \nthink he just answered my question. I was just going to ask the Senator \nfrom New Mexico if he could give us approximately the time for a vote. \nI guess it would be sometime after 5.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, I have a brief statement, and I believe Senator \nJohnston will have a statement. And then we will proceed with questions \nand some colloquies.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to present the conference report on the \nfiscal year 1995 energy and water development appropriations bill. This \nconference report on the bill, H.R. 1905, passed the House of \nRepresentatives earlier today, October 31, 1995, by a vote of 402 yeas \nto 24 nays.\n  The conference on this bill was held on October 24 and 25, 1995, and \nthe conference report was printed in the Congressional Record of \nOctober 26, 1995. Since that time, the printed conference report has \nbeen available. Therefore, I will not elaborate on the disposition of \nall the items agreed to in conference.\n  The conference agreement provides a total of $19,336,311,000 in new \nbudget obligational authority. This amount is $1,225,733,000 less than \nthe President's budget request and $706,688,000 less than the enacted, \nfiscal year 1995 level. It is $653,854,000 over the House passed bill, \nand $832,841,000 below the Senate passed bill.\n  As you know, there are two principle functions within the Energy and \nWater Development appropriations bill. These functions are separated \ninto defense and domestic discretionary accounts. The bill provides \n$10,656,458,000 in defense discretionary budget authority for the \nDepartment of Energy's atomic energy defense activities. This amount is \n$459,325,000 below the budget request but $552,678,000 above the \ncurrent level. For domestic discretionary accounts, which include the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineer's Civil Works Program, the Bureau of \nReclamation, several independent agencies, and the nondefense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, the conference bill provides \n$8,679,853,000. This amount is $766,408,000 below the budget request \nand $1,259,366,000 below the current level.\n  Due to this dramatic reduction in nondefense spending, our ability to \nfund new initiatives is extremely limited, and most existing programs \nare cut significantly below both the current year and the President's \nrequest. The conference bill makes significant reductions in the Army \nCorps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, solar and renewable \nenergy, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority.\n  We have made some very difficult decisions in the nondefense \nactivities of the Department of Energy. However, we have done our best \nto protect the basic science research capabilities of the Department of \nEnergy. While we have made significant reductions in the areas \nmentioned above, we have held the line on biological and environmental \nresearch, basic energy sciences, high energy physics, and nuclear \nenergy.\n  These are the fundamental basic science missions of the Department of \nEnergy that we must maintain to ensure the best possible future for the \nNation. These are missions relating to such areas as the human genome \nprogram and other medical research activities, global environmental \nresearch, materials and chemical sciences, and the physical sciences.\n  Title I of the conference bill provides appropriations for the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers' Civil Works Program. The conference agreement \nprovides $3,201,272,000, which is $106,178,000 less than the budget \nrequest and $137,647,000 less than the current enacted level.\n  For title II, the Department of the Interior, the conference \nagreement includes a total of $844,342,000. This is $11,325,000 above \nthe budget request and $27,057,000 below the current level. Within this \ntotal, the bill provides $800,203,000 for the Bureau of Reclamation, \nwhich is $11,325,000 more than the budget request and $31,033,000 less \nthan the current level.\n  A total of $15,389,490,000 is provided in title III for the \nDepartment of Energy programs, projects, and activities. Of this \namount, $10,639,458,000 is provided for atomic energy defense \nactivities, which is $457,825,000 below the President's budget request \nand $553,611,000 above the current appropriated level.\n  Included in the total provided for atomic energy defense activities \nis $5,557,532,000 for defense environmental restoration and waste \nmanagement. This amount is $429,204,000 below the budget request but \n$664,841,000 above the current level. The increase over the 1995 \nappropriation results primarily from the transfer of facilities from \nthe \n\n[[Page S16385]]\n\nold materials production account to the Defense Environmental \nRestoration and Waste Management program.\n  The conference action on DOE's Defense Environmental Management \nProgram seeks, to the extent possible, to protect funding necessary to \nmeet existing cleanup milestones established in compliance agreements. \nThe conference agreement also seeks to reduce Environmental Management \nProgram personnel at headquarters, where practicable, in an effort to \napply available dollars to the cleanup effort.\n  Title IV, which includes appropriations for the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, and other independent agencies, provides $311,550,000 in \nbudget authority. This amount is $57,513,000 below the President's \nrequest and $143,859,000 below the current year's level.\n  I recommend to the Senate that this conference report be approved \npromptly in order to complete action on this appropriations bill and \nclear it for the President's consideration and approval. It is our \nunderstanding that the President will sign this bill.\n  Mr. President, the House and Senate have worked hard for several \nweeks and have agreed upon a conference proposal which not only \nrepresents significant reductions from the current year's enacted \nappropriated levels, but is the leanest energy and water development \nappropriations bill since fiscal year 1990. We have heard the call of \nthe new Republican majority to change the way Government does business \nand are proud to Present a bill that cuts budgets, cuts bureaucracy, \nand streamlines operations.\n  I wish to express my appreciation and thanks to our House colleagues \nled by the chairman of the House subcommittee, Congressman John Myers, \nand the ranking minority member, Congressman Tom Bevill. I would like \nto express my continued admiration and respect for the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana and our former chairman, Senator Johnston and \nthank him for his hard work and support. Of course, I want to also \nthank my friend, the Chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Hatfield and the ranking member of the full Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd. It is always a pleasure to work with them \nboth. Also, I want to express my appreciation to all the Senate \nconferees and staff members of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, obviously, on the domestic side of this budget, we are \nproviding substantially less than last year and less than the President \nasked--that is what is happening in every domestic bill--and we think \nwe have done it in such a way that should receive maximum support from \nthe Senate. There was no objection to any of this in the conference by \neither our side or the Democratic side.\n  When it comes to defense, it is obvious that we are in a great \ntransition period with reference to our nuclear deterrent capabilities \nand we are in a transition period as to what we are going to do for the \nnext 40 years as we build down our nuclear arsenal and attempt to \nsafeguard it and maintain it and make sure that our nuclear deterrent \ncapability remains inviolate for the next 20 to 40 years.\n  A new approach to this is being taken in this bill. The roots are \nbeing laid for a concept called a science-based stockpile stewardship \nprogram wherein the three defense nuclear laboratories--Livermore, Los \nAlamos, and Sandia--will lead the defense activities in the \npreservation and safekeeping of the nuclear deterrent stockpile. This \nrequires some new scientific capabilities because of one additional \nfact. That is, currently the United States has agreed that we will have \nno more underground testing of nuclear weapons. That used to be done in \norder to calibrate, in order to determine safety, wellbeing, longevity, \nand all kinds of things with reference to the system; that is, the \nnuclear deterrent system. We have decided as a nation not to do that, \nand so the science-based stockpile stewardship program requires that we \nengage the best of our science in producing new equipment and new \ninstrumentation along with new computers to perform modeling of this \ncapability so we can keep this arsenal safe, and the stewardship of it \nwill be adequacy and deliverability at all times.\n  This costs a little more money than we had thought. Some new \nequipment is going to be built, a new facility at Livermore, and we \nhave started that here in this bill. Los Alamos and Sandia will have a \nmission each with reference to it. In other words, we are going to be \nable to simulate one way or another what we used to find out in an \nunderground nuclear explosion. And when we do that and do it right, we \nwill be able to maintain the system by replacing parts and the like as \nwe move toward building it down and maintaining it for a long period of \ntime.\n  So for some who wonder what the Department of Energy does in the \ndefense work, this is the hub of it. There are a lot of other things. \nBut they are going to be charged--and the Defense Department has agreed \nwith this new approach--with essentially doing what I have just \ndescribed, and that is be the frontrunning institutions in the United \nStates and hopefully in the world in seeing to it that our nuclear \ndeterrent is always safe and deliverable and exactly what we expect as \nwe move it down dramatically to a smaller number.\n  Now I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Johnston.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, one of the most able Senators I have \never served with is the distinguished Senator from New Mexico. He also \nhappens to be one of my best friends in this body. So it is with real \nenthusiasm that I have undertaken to work on this appropriations bill \nwith him. By and large, he has produced, considering the challenges, an \nexcellent bill, for which I congratulate him. I congratulate his staff \nas well. Our staffs have worked together as a team. I have worked \ntogether as a team with him to produce this bill. So I have great \npraise for him and great admiration for him, and I might say great \naffection for him all at the same time.\n  Now, as sometimes is customary in this body, pride goeth before a \nfall and praise goeth before criticism, and while I mean every word of \nthe praise, Mr. President, I am here to say that I cannot vote for the \nbill because of one particular area of this bill, which is called \nnuclear waste.\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement on the fiscal year 1996 \nenergy and water development appropriation bill, H.R. 1905, provides \n$19,336,311,000 in new budget obligational authority, including \nscorekeeping adjustments. This amount is $707 million less than fiscal \nyear 1995 appropriations, and is $1.225 billion less than the \nPresident's budget request for this bill. The agreement is $654 million \nmore than the bill as passed by the House, but $833 million less than \nthe bill as passed by the Senate.\n  I concur in the explanation and summary given by the senior Senator \nfrom New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], chairman of the subcommittee. I \ncongratulate Senator Domenici on bringing his maiden voyage to this \nconclusion. This is his first appropriation bill as chairman, and he \nwas the chairman of our conference committee also. I commend him for \nhis hard work. I also want to express my appreciation to our House \ncolleagues, led by our good friends Representative John Myers, of \nIndian, and Representative Tom Bevill of Alabama. They have worked \ntogether as a team for many years and I am proud of our association. We \nhave had a long tradition of bipartisan cooperation and compromise in \nthis subcommittee, and I hope that spirit will continue. I would like \nto thank all of the House and Senate conferees.\n  Mr. President, I would like to mention several Louisiana items \ncontained within the conference agreement. I am pleased that we have \nincluded authority for the Corps of Engineers to design and construct \nflood control improvements to rainfall drainage systems, in Jefferson, \nOrleans, and St. Tammany parishes in Louisiana. These areas have \nsuffered disastrous floods due to torrential rainfall that occurred in \nsoutheast Louisiana in May 1995, which resulted in the loss of seven \nlives, inundation of 35,000 homes and estimated property and \ninfrastructure losses exceed $3 billion. The chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Livingston, is to be commended for \nproceeding and I strongly supported the inclusion of this beginning in \nthe conference report.\n\n[[Page S16386]]\n\n  Also, included in the report is language directing the Secretary of \nthe Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to design and \nconstruct a regional visitor's center in the vicinity of Shreveport, \nLA, as a part of the Red River Waterway project. The successful \nprosecution of this project which provides navigation from the \nMississippi River to Shreveport, is a source of great pride to me. It \nis a project I have worked on during my entire career in the Senate, \nand navigation has now been completed.\n  The conference agreement also approves an amount of $7 million for \nthe Biomedical Research Foundation of Northwest Louisiana to create the \nCenter for Biomedical Technology Innovation. The center will serve as a \nfocal point for the ongoing biomedical research and development that is \ncarried out at many of the national laboratories, and for the clinical \ntesting of products that result from that research. It will focus \nspecifically on the development of instrumentation for minimally \ninvasive procedures--including advanced imaging technologies--\ntechnologies for individual self care, telemedicine, and medical \nrobotics. Priority will be given to those technologies which are most \nlikely to reduce the cost of care. The center will be housed within the \nFoundation's Biomedical Research Institute, and managed by a consortium \norganized and led by the Biomedical Research Foundation.\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement, in nearly all cases, \nrepresents a fair and reasonable disposition of the differences between \nthe House and Senate, and I hope the conference report will be \napproved. I regret that I cannot support the conference report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield before he continues?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say that it has not been my privilege heretofore in \nall the years that we have served for me to chair an appropriations \nsubcommittee and have my friend from Louisiana as ranking member. For \nthe most part it has been reversed; if I was in the Chamber, he was \nchairman and I was ranking member. But that has not even occurred on \nthis bill heretofore, and I cannot give sufficient accolades in this \nRecord about this Senator. Frankly, I am going to miss him tremendously \nin the Senate, and I think the Senate is going to miss him because of \nthe kinds of things he is going to say right now. It is true that there \nis a very, very serious deficiency in this bill, but I will answer it \nwhen he is finished and I thank him and his wonderful staff for all the \nhelp here and in the past as we put these things together. We have \nmaintained a significant nuclear deterrent capability regardless of the \ncriticism for the Department of Energy.\n  We have maintained that because of the stalwart service of Senators \nlike Bennett Johnston on this appropriations bill. For those who are \nnot aware of it, this is where the defense work takes place and is \nappropriated to maintain a nuclear stockpile. And over the years he has \nworked diligently in that regard.\n  There is a waste problem that comes from nuclear energy, and he is \nright, it is a serious problem. I do not believe we could have fixed it \nin this bill in that regard and disagreed. But I did want to make that \nstatement before he proceeds. I say thank you very much to the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his generous \nremarks. Everything he says about what this bill accomplishes is \nexactly true. Mr. President, there is no more difficult nor unpleasant \ntask in all of the Senate than dealing with the question of nuclear \nwaste.\n  First of all, you have to disagree with your friends from Nevada, two \nof the most competent, most able, and two of my best friends in this \nSenate. But, Mr. President, it has been my job over a decade to have \nthe principal responsibility for nuclear waste. Both as chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee--this subcommittee--and as chairman of the \nauthorizing committee, it has been my duty to keep it going.\n  Now, sometimes you try to do what is right and be with your \ncolleagues. But, Mr. President, this program of nuclear waste is too \nbig, it is too important, to deal with it on personalities. We have \ncollected $10 billion for nuclear waste. We have spent $5 billion on \nnuclear waste and have almost nothing to show for it.\n  Mr. President, of all the programs in the Federal Government, there \nis probably more waste, there is probably more mismanagement through \nthe years in this program than in any other program that I know of in \nthe Federal Government. Not only that, Mr. President, it is a program \nwhich affects most Americans because there are over 100 reactors out \nthere. There are about 80 reactor sites in this country, each of which \nis a potential nuclear waste dump unless we solve this problem, not to \nmention, in addition, the Hanford and Idaho National Labs, as well as \nSavannah River in South Carolina.\n  So, Mr. President, this is not an issue that is going to go away. It \nis an issue that is with us right now.\n  Now, what have we done in this bill? Mr. President, we have cut back \nto less than half the requested funding from the Department of Energy. \nWhat is that going to mean? By reducing funding to $315 million, we are \ngoing to have to stop all work on the environmental impact statement. \nWe are going to have to stop the license application to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. We are going to have to fire between 875 and \n1,300 employees. There will be no work going forward on interim \nstorage. It leaves only a research program with no prospect for \ncompleting the repository any time in the foreseeable future.\n  As a matter of fact, I have put quotes up there from the Director of \nNuclear Waste, which says:\n\n       Under the funding levels the program has historically \n     received, the schedules for . . . start of operation in 2010 \n     are not achievable . . .\n\n  That is, under funding levels that they have historically received, \nwhich is higher than this level.\n\n       A flat funding profile would be insufficient to carry out \n     the program of developing geologic disposal capability by \n     2010 as currently projected.\n\n  That is, if we had level funding at higher levels than this bill \ncalls for, we will not get nuclear waste capability by 2010.\n  What that means, Mr. President, is it is going to cost the consumer \nof electricity from $5 to $7 billion additional, because that is what \nthey have to pay for temporary storage onsite up to 2010. That does not \ncarry us beyond 2010.\n  You can spool those figures up. It is going to cost that $5 to $7 \nbillion, while at the same time we have collected $10 billion for DOE \nto solve the problem the DOE cannot solve. It cannot solve it at these \nlevels of funding problems. We are paying for it twice and not solving \nthe problem.\n  Mr. President, if you want to get a scandal that the people can \nunderstand out there, then do something like let somebody charge up a \nmeal with a bunch of drinks or something to some defense contractor or \nsomebody in the Federal Government. Everybody gets all exercised. They \nunderstand that they are cheating on the Federal Government. They are \ncheating, you know, violating some ethical rule.\n  But when you have a program of this size, the sheer enormity of it \nseems somehow to pass everybody's consciousness. Well, it may pass \neverybody else's consciousness, but I had responsibility for this, and \nI want to put in the Record what is happening. Ten billion dollars has \nbeen collected, and there is no way to solve the problem at these \nfunding levels. You are going to have to spend another $5 to $7 \nbillion, with a ``B.'' Mr. President, those are not incidental dollars; \nthose are huge dollars.\n  Then what is the American public going to say a few years from now \nwhen I guess somebody is going to finally wake up? They are going to \nsay, ``What have you done with all that money and the problem is not \nsolved?''\n  The problem cannot be solved--the Director tells me, Dr. Dreyfus \ntells me, at this level we will never solve the problem. His official \nquotes do not say that. It says:\n\n       If the program receives funding at the levels contemplated \n     in the Administration funding proposal, the Department would \n     be able to carry out the program . . ..\n       Any major reduction . . . would require restructuring of \n     the program plan with significant delays . . ..\n\n  Now, look up there at the top and you get the DOE request; $630 \nmillion \n\n[[Page S16387]]\n\nwas requested this year. We are down to $315 million. Next year it goes \nup to $684 million, then to $713 million, then to $732 million.\n  At the rate we are going, Mr. President, we will be lucky to maintain \nthe $315 million, which means you cannot solve the problem.\n  Now, what does the administration say? The administration says--\nprivately they will tell you, ``Look. This is an election year.'' At \nleast that is what they say inside. But officially they say, ``We \nshould not put any interim storage out at Yucca Mountain until we \ndetermine whether the site is suitable.'' They do not define what \nsuitability in the site is, but a few years ago they said, ``If we have \nthis funding at that level, we can determine suitability by the year \n2002.'' That means if you give them that kind of money. So if you do \nnot give them that kind of money, according to that definition at that \ntime, it would be, I guess, who knows when before you would determine \neven suitability of this site.\n  Mr. President, you cannot solve the problem. Look. Rather than do \nwhat we are doing now--and I have been trying to get this at Yucca \nMountain--we honestly ought to abolish this program, abolish the tax, \nand let the nuclear utilities have the responsibility for their own \nprogram and have the money with which to do it. That would be much \nbetter than playing out this charade.\n  Mr. President, it is a charade. The President does not want to solve \nit. The Congress seems to be incapable of solving it. The antinuclear \nactivists out there, of which there are many, they do not want to solve \nit because by not solving it then they are able to show that nuclear \nenergy does not work.\n  Let me tell you, Mr. President, people are not going to build nuclear \nutilities in this country, not at any time for the foreseeable future, \nand we can foresee a pretty long time. And that is because of the \neconomics of this program. They do not need to try to kill this program \nin order to try to make nuclear energy nonviable. That has already \noccurred. All they are doing is creating a problem all across this \ncountry and creating a big expense for taxpayers.\n  There is a conspiracy here, in effect, Mr. President: The \nadministration, which has a do-nothing attitude; the antinuclear \ngroups, of which there are many; and many out there who want to kill \nthe program; and, believe it or not, the scientists.\n  You say, ``scientists. They are supposed to be the ones in there \ntrying to solve the problem.'' There is a phenomenon, Mr. President, in \nour Government now where sometimes you call on scientists to make a \njudgment in which they may not have a direct interest but their \ndiscipline has an interest, and it is sort of like, if you ask the \nscientists what has to be done, they will give you the most expensive \nanswer because that is in the interest of the science. It is kind of \nlike asking the trial lawyers, ``What do you think we ought to do on \ndamage awards? Should we decrease damage awards?'' They would say, \n``Oh, no. You have got to watch out for the victim.''\n  Well, the scientists, unfortunately, Mr. President, always go with \nthe most expensive thing. We asked the National Research Council, a \npart of the National Academy of Sciences, to study one aspect of this \nthing and to look into the question of human intrusion. In other words, \nwhen you go to build a repository, how much of a safeguard do you have \nto put on that and to what standards must you build that? Let me tell \nyou what the National Research Council said. I really want to get this \noff of my chest because I have been seething ever since we got this \nreport. It is the most outrageous thing I have ever seen by a \nscientist. It says:\n\n       We considered a stylized intrusion scenario consisting of \n     one bore hole of a specified diameter drilled from the \n     surface through a canister of waste to the underlying \n     aquifer.\n\n  What that means is that when we get around to building the \nrepository, in order to ensure its safety, we must ensure that somebody \nis going to put a derrick up there and drill a hole down which pierces \none of these canisters and goes down to the underlying aquifer. You \nsay, how could that possibly happen? You have fences out there and you \nhave guards. I do not know how it happens.\n  I can think of a couple of scenarios. One would be that a meteorite \nhits the country and destroys civilization, as it did--that is the \nnotion, at least--when the dinosaurs died. Another is that you have \nsome big volcano that virtually kills all life except maybe some \ncavemen, a few who survived and are able to rebuild civilization; or a \nnuclear war that virtually wipes out all civilization, except some \npeople in caves.\n  I must say, Mr. President, if those scenarios happen, then why are \nyou worried about nuclear waste anyway? I mean, civilization is gone. \nBut if civilization survives, there is no way that you would not know \nthat the Yucca Mountain repository is there. There is no way you would \nnot know that. We are not going back in civilization, back in the time \nof the ancient Greeks, when the location of the town of Messinia was \nlost and they go back in and dug and found out where it was. Mr. \nPresident, civilization is marching forward, not backward. We are not \ngoing to get into the situation where, some day, people are going to be \ndigging up there and find out that New York City was up there on the \nHudson River. They are going to know that. They are going to know where \nYucca Mountain is. But just assume that this takes place and \ncivilization is wiped out. How are they going to drill this bore hole \nthrough Yucca Mountain and happen to hit a canister?\n  Well, there are two assumptions. One is that they know what they are \ndoing. If they know what they are doing, they are not going to be \ndrilling on Yucca Mountain because there is no mineral activity out \nthere by which you would drill a hole. The second is that they do not \nknow what they are doing, and they are going around randomly drilling \nholes all over the country.\n  Now, what do you think the chances are, Mr. President--a scientist \nought to be able to tell you what the chances are, if you are doing a \nrandom hole in the thousands upon thousands of square miles in the \nUnited States, and you have one little area that is a nuclear waste \ndump, and of the nuclear waste dump, most of it does not have the \ncanisters, just what are the chances of that? Is it 1 in 10 billion, 1 \nin a trillion, 1 in 5 trillion? These scientists ought to be able to \nsay that. But indeed, no, they say that you have to assume ``one bore \nhole of the specified diameter drilled from the surface through a \ncanister of waste to the underlying aquifer.''\n  How did they penetrate this without knowing that they have penetrated \na canister? It is the most absurd thing. In any event, I digressed for \na moment just to tell you what we are up against on this program. We \nhave the scientists, we have the administration, we have the \nantinuclear activists, we have the people in Nevada, none of whom want \nto put in this program, all of which would be fine if we were starting \nout with a question of whether we are going to do nuclear energy or \nnot, you could take this into consideration.\n  But, Mr. President, we have nuclear waste now. We are generating it \nat the rate of about 2,000 metric tons each year. There are 30,000 \nmetric tons of nuclear waste now stored, principally, in what we call \n``swimming pools,'' where you basically put the rods down in pools of \nwater, unprotected from anything. That is the only plan we really have. \nThere are 67 powerplants in 32 States that will have run out. By the \nyear 2010, we will have 85,000 metric tons to be stored.\n  Mr. President, we just simply cannot ignore this problem. I proposed \nan amendment, Mr. President, in the conference committee which said, \nlet us do the long-lead-time things we need to do, the environmental \nimpact statement, the preliminary design, on an interim storage \nfacility, and if you cannot start construction until 1998 and if, in \nthe meantime, it is found to be not a suitable site, then you would \nstop all activity on both the interim storage facility, as well as the \nfinal storage--the repository, the underground facility, and move on to \nsome other place.\n  Now, Mr. President, that was rejected by the conference--rejected on \nthe grounds that a bill is moving through the House, and that that bill \nwill have a chance to be enacted next year. Mr. President, next year we \nhave the same problems we have this year. That is, you have an \nadministration \n\n[[Page S16388]]\n\nthat would oppose that bill, that has threatened to veto that bill, and \nyou still have to produce the same 67 votes--only next year is an \nelection year.\n  Just what are we going to do, Mr. President? We are collecting the \nmoney--$10 billion is already collected--and we have spent $5 billion. \nWe have a program which the director says cannot work. We are facing an \nassurance of having to spend some $5 billion to $7 billion between now \nand the year 2010 on temporary storage, and that is not funded. That is \ngoing to have to be paid for by the utilities.\n  Mr. President, I will be retiring from the U.S. Senate at the end of \nnext year, and I am sure my friends from Nevada--though we are good \nfriends--will perhaps breathe a sigh of relief and will say this guy \nwho has been trying to cram that nuclear waste down our throats in \nNevada is gone and our problem is solved. Well, Mr. President, if we \nare not to do this activity in Nevada, then I say it is time to \nterminate the program in Nevada, terminate the collection of the tax, \nand move on to an alternative program. Let the utilities themselves \nbuild their own, what we call, ``dry cast storage'' on-site. That is \nthe activity that is going to cost the $5 to $7 billion between now and \nthe year 2010. Or, if there is another site other than Nevada, then let \nus start picking that site. Let us start looking at others. I think \nthey have a formation up in Maine which was suitable; and Texas, down \nin Deaf Smith County, I believe it was. Another one is up in Hanford. \nThere was a site down in Mississippi. Potential sites are all over the \ncountry. Of course, there is the Savannah River. There was one in \nTennessee. Let us start looking at those sites, because you have to put \nit somewhere. It either has to be on-site or somewhere.\n  Like the old joke about somebody who was found by an irate husband in \nthe closet of his home and he said, ``What are you doing there?'' and \nhe said, ``Everybody has to be somewhere.''\n  Believe me, nuclear waste has got to be somewhere. What we are saying \nin the Congress is that we do not know, we will put the problem off. \nMr. President, I have seen this problem put off year after year after \nyear while the cost escalates.\n  It was back in 1982 when we passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. That \nact called for us to pick three sites--first a larger number of sites \nand whittle that down to three sites--and then the three sites would be \n``characterized.'' That is, determined whether the three sites would be \nsuitable as a place for the repository, and then the DOE was to pick \none of those three.\n  When we first passed that legislation, the cost of characterization \nwas supposed to be $60 million per site. I thought, just to determine \nwhether a site is suitable--that is outrageous. I remember thinking \nthat so clearly.\n  A few years passed and we had a hearing on it and we asked what was \nthe cost of characterization and activity that was going forward at \nthat time. They said, ``Well, it is going to be $1.2 billion per \nsite.''\n  I then introduced legislation to call on the Department of Energy to \npick one of the three sites and characterize that and thereby save $2.4 \nbillion. My version did not pass because when it got to the conference \ncommittee with the House they said go ahead and name Yucca Mountain--do \nit politically, not scientifically. They had the votes.\n  It so happened that the Speaker of the House was from Texas, one of \nthe three sites. The majority leader was from Washington, the other \nsite. That left Nevada. Nevada got picked. I must say in all fairness \nNevada probably would have been scientifically picked at least. That \nwas the indication I got at the time.\n  But I think Nevada had a proper cause to complain because it was, in \nfact, a political decision rather than a scientific decision, although \nthat might well have been the place where it would have been picked.\n  We then proceeded with Yucca Mountain. What has happened in the \nmeantime, we are now told that the cost of characterization of Yucca \nMountain is not $60 million as initially estimated, not $1.2 billion as \nlater estimated, but $6.3 billion--not to build the facility, just to \ndetermine whether it is suitable.\n  How in the world did it go up that much in cost? Well, I think to a \nlarge extent because these scientists made these kind of determinations \nthat you have to assume all kind of silly scenarios like drilling bore \nholes down through the canisters, like doing every conceivable study to \nkeep these scientists busy for the rest of their lives and for their \nsons' and grandsons' and granddaughters' lives ad infinitum.\n  It is an expanding scope of work which probably is not capable of \nbeing done no matter how much money we put in here and certainly not at \nthe levels that are contained in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I hate to sound a discordant note on what is otherwise \nan excellent job that the Senator from New Mexico has done. In his \ndefense, he has a bill to pass. He has responsibility for that bill. \nThe President has said he would veto this bill if we came up with \ninterim storage. I can understand that judgment. I have a lot of \nsympathy for that judgment. I say that in his defense.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, this body needs to understand, the \nCongress needs to understand, the nuclear industry needs to understand, \nthe American public and taxpayers and ratepayers need to understand \nthat they are being made the victims of a gigantic shell game, a great \nrip-off, in which $10 billion has been collected, $5 billion has been \nspent, and there is no way to solve the problem in the direction we are \ngoing.\n  It will not be solved. People out there who think the Congress has a \nprogram that will eventually lead to a repository, they are wrong, Mr. \nPresident. It will lead to nothing but an endless stream of money \nstretching from here to infinity, with no waste dump at the end.\n  What will happen in the meantime is that the ratepayer will not only \nhave to pay that $10 billion already paid, but the tax at 1 mill per \nkilowatt hour will continue, and in addition to that, the ratepayers of \nthese utilities--these 80 sites around the country--their ratepayers \nwill have to pay for temporary storage on site. Mr. President, $5 \nbillion to $7 billion worth between now and the year 2010.\n  Now, are we going to pass that authorizing legislation later this \nyear or later next year? Mr. President, I hope so. But I can say I have \nno confidence that is so. The history of this program has been delay, \navoid the tough decision, get by until after the next election, get by \nuntil after the next career, make an excuse, spend some more money, \nfund some more scientists, and never, whatever you do, do not ever look \nat the program. Do not ever analyze what they are doing. That can be \nvery, very, disquieting when you find out some of the incredible \njudgments which have gone into this gigantic waste of money.\n  It has been, Mr. President, it has been just incredible to consider \nwhat has been wasted on this program. No one looks into it--at least no \none listens to the alarms--because no one seems to understand.\n  We talk about the bore holes; what does that mean? The scientists \nmust have a reason for that, right? EPA set a carbon 14 discharge level \nof one-millionth background radiation, for the amounts of the carbon \ncontained in the body naturally. Nobody said anything. We tried to \nstraighten that out with legislation. We gave it to the scientists and \nall we got was babble.\n  This report is an embarrassment to the National Academy of Sciences, \nMr. President. It is almost unintelligible. The nuclear waste director \nsays this means that you cannot build a repository--cannot build one no \nmatter how much money. It just cannot pass the test.\n  Some of the scientists who did the report said, ``Oh, no, this will \nmake it easy to do it.'' It is babble, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I hope by my little soliloquy here on the floor today \nthat we can awaken a little interest in this subject, that we can alert \npeople who ought to be interested in it, people in the nuclear industry \nought to be interested in this. Ratepayers ought to be interested in \nthis. The National Association of Regulated Utility Commissioners ought \nto be interested in this.\n  Some years ago they said look, if you do not get this program \nstraightened out, we are going to discontinue allowing you to rate base \nthe 1 mill per kilowatt hour fee. That means that they \n\n[[Page S16389]]\n\nwere going to not pass it on to customers because it was a program that \ncould not work, but we are going to require utilities to eat it--that \nis, to have their stockholders pay for it. I am telling you, this \nprogram cannot work. Who says so? Dr. Dreyfus, who is running the \nprogram, says that at these levels of funding, you cannot have an \nappropriate program. You cannot have a workable program.\n\n  I hope we get a little attention here. I hope early next year we can \npass legislation. If we cannot, we ought to shut this program down.\n  I would like to reiterate my praise for the distinguished chairman of \nthis committee for, otherwise, a very good bill. This is not his fault, \nbecause he is operating under a veto threat. But it, unfortunately, is \ngoing to be his responsibility because he now occupies the position \nwhich I did for so many years, which is the guy who has to make the \nprogram work. And as of right now, it is not working and cannot work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me once again compliment my friend \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Johnston. I am not sure how many people were \nlistening today. But I tell you, there ought to be a lot. Because you \nhave just expressed and explained thoroughly one of the real disasters, \nin terms of the U.S. Government's inability to cope with a serious \nproblem in a realistic way.\n  I can recall about 3 years ago when Senator Johnston was presiding, \nthe issue came up and this project was then going to cost about $3.7 \nbillion. It now comes close to $6 billion, I understand--a little more \nthan the $5 billion the Senator indicated. One of the Senators on the \ncommittee said, ``How much do you think it would cost to build it?'' \nEverybody scurried around. ``Build the facility?'' The conclusion was \nit would cost far less than we are going to spend characterizing the \nmountain.\n  He gave a rather practical suggestion, it seemed to me. You give this \nsuggestion to average Americans, they would have said, ``Do it.'' He \nsaid, ``Why don't you just build it and then find out after it is \nbuilt? Do all the kinds of tests you want as to whether it will \nsucceed. If it will not work, close it down. At least you will have \nsomething there finished and completed.'' Now we are just boring holes \nin and doing scientific work to try to achieve a goal that seems like, \nscientifically, the standards have been set so high we are never going \nto achieve it.\n  We do not have any disagreement on it. I think at this point we are \nnever going to get that depository finished. We are never going to \nprove up the requirements. There are going be more lawsuits around, and \nyou will never get a permanent repository in that site--not for a long \ntime, if ever.\n  So the issue comes, as I see it, what do we try to do on this bill? \nLet me suggest, so there is no doubt about it, we would have put an \ninterim storage facility in this bill and it would have been sited in \nthe State of Nevada, but for the fact that the President of the United \nStates has sent a rather clear signal through his high-level staff that \nthey would veto a bill that designated that site or any other site \nspecifically.\n  I might say to my friend from Louisiana, as hard as he tried with his \namendment, when he finished it all, it was actually designating Nevada \nas the site before we really knew that we would have a final site here. \nHe couched it differently but that is a truism.\n  Essentially, what he, the President of the United States, was saying, \nand his advisers, was: Do not site it there unless the permanent \nrepository is there or we will veto it.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has very few alternatives. What I wanted \nto do was to spend $400 million in this bill and use $85 million to \nmove ahead with the temporary facility, the temporary storage, the \ninterim storage. But we cannot do the interim storage without an \nauthorization bill or without a President signing something. I think my \ncolleague would agree with that. Whether he signs an appropriation bill \nor authorizing bill, the President of the United States has to sign \nsomething for Congress to be able to fund an interim storage facility \nthere or anywhere, because the law does not now permit the Federal \nGovernment to build such a facility anywhere.\n  Having said that, it is clear to me that we ought to at least provide \nsome money in this bill to fund the eventuality of us getting an \nauthorizing bill through here that the President would sign.\n  I say to my friend, Senator Johnston, I do not deny the authenticity \nand truthfulness of his remarks, because he is suggesting it probably \nwill not happen, the President will veto it. It is an election year. \nBut I think we had to do some work and say here is some money. So we \nfenced $85 million in this bill--put a fence around it--and we said it \nwill be spent for an interim facility if in fact this is authorized and \npermitted by the Government of the United States. That money is sitting \nthere. We are saying to the legislators in the authorizing committees \nhere in the Energy Committee, its counterpart in the House: Pass a \nbill. You can start the project.\n  Will the President sign it if we pass it? We do not know. But let me \nsuggest we cannot stall this too much longer. Sooner or later, a \nPresident must sign something that will let us move in a different \ndirection.\n  My original plans were $400 million, $85 million fenced for the \ninterim facility. It turns out that I left the bill that way, and I am \nfully aware that the $315 million does not satisfy the Director of the \nprogram, Mr. Dan Dreyfus' needs to keep this program going on schedule \nas he wanted it going on schedule. But we were going to tone it down \nsome. If we were building a temporary facility, we were going to cut \nthe expenditures on the permanent facility and spread it out a lot \nlonger. I think we are still on that path.\n  I might say for the record, this Senator is not going to be carrying \nthis bill very many years on this floor with funding for the permanent \ndeep repository if we have not solved the issue of an interim storage \nfacility. In fact, I may not carry it one more time without that, in \nterms of continuing what seems to me to be a borderline hoax, in terms \nof promising the American people we are going to have an underground \npermanent repository.\n  The reason I say that is because, in spite of the good work by the \ncurrent Director, Mr. Dan Dreyfus, who used to work for the Energy \nCommittee--and we are all very, very complimentary of his work--the \nrules and regulations that we live by, under that project, just may be \nso that man cannot comply. It may be we cannot comply.\n  So I hope everyone understands today on the floor of the Senate, with \nvery little attention, some very, very serious remarks have been made \nabout the competency of this process, of the legislative process and \nthe President, to work to get something done that must be done.\n  I want to add one other comment. The Senator might not remember it, \nbut I remember it. I speak to my friend from Louisiana. I think some of \nus figured, when then Senator Gary Hart of the State of Colorado \nproposed that we had to close the loop on atomic energy and had to have \na permanent repository, I think some of us were thinking, ``Well, if \nthat gets out of hand, it is calculated to stop nuclear power.''\n  In fact, we may go back to the Record and find that either you or I \nsaid that. We might have said it. That is what it was. It was an \napproach that said you need to close it at the tail end with a \npermanent repository. If you cannot do it, then you cannot have nuclear \nwaste and therefore you cannot have nuclear energy.\n  The calculation is coming true. Not because we cannot do it, but \nbecause we refuse to do it in a commonsense, practical way that is \nreally consistent with engineering and science achievement. So that is \nabout where we are.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record \nwherein the President's staff indicates they would veto this bill and \nmove onto another project.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S16390]]\n\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development \n         Appropriations, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The purpose of this letter is to provide \n     the Administration's views on H.R. 1905, the Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations Bill, FY 1996, as passed by the \n     House and by the Senate. As you develop the conference \n     version of the bill, your consideration of the \n     Administration's views would be appreciated.\n       The Administration is committed to balancing the Federal \n     budget by FY 2005. The President's budget proposes to reduce \n     discretionary spending for FY 1996 by $5 billion in outlays \n     below the FY 1995 enacted level. The Administration does not \n     support the level of funding assumed by the House or Senate \n     Committee 602(b) allocations. The Administration must \n     evaluate each bill both in terms of funding levels provided \n     and the share of total resources available for remaining \n     priorities. The House-passed version of the bill is $1.8 \n     billion below the President's request, and the Senate version \n     is $0.3 billion below the request. With respect to the \n     overall funding levels for programs covered by H.R. 1905, we \n     generally prefer the Senate's recommended funding levels.\n       The Administration has very serious concerns about certain \n     language provisions that may be included in the final bill. \n     One is a provision that would direct the construction of an \n     interim storage facility for nuclear wastes at a specific \n     site. Others are provisions that would override environmental \n     and other laws in specific situations, such as those \n     concerning the Bonnevile Power Administration fish program \n     and, potentially, the Animas/La Plata water project. If these \n     provisions were contained in the final bill, the President's \n     senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.\n       Since taking office, the Administration has developed and \n     implemented a number of policies to increase government \n     efficiency, known as ``Reinventing Government,'' and to \n     concentrate resources on investment programs critical to \n     ensuring a strong economic future. The Administration is \n     disappointed that neither the House nor the Senate, in action \n     on this bill, has been more sensitive to these priorities.\n\n\n           department of energy--nuclear waste disposal fund\n\n       The Administration strongly objects to any language that \n     would designate a nuclear waste interim storage facility at a \n     specific site. Any potential siting decision concerning such \n     a facility should ultimately be based on scientific analyses. \n     If an interim facility is to be developed, FY 1996 spending \n     on it should only be devoted to non-site-specific design and \n     engineering, with the majority of FY 1996 monies in this \n     account continuing to support the scientific investigation of \n     the proposed permanent waste repository.\n       The Administration is disappointed with the funding levels \n     in both the House and Senate versions of the bill for the \n     Civilian Radioactive Waste Management program. The \n     Administration urges the conferees to consider seriously the \n     funding level proposed in the President's budget in order to \n     support fully the scientific work on the permanent repository \n     program.\n\n\n                 bonneville power administration (bpa)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes the inclusion of \n     section 509, General Provisions, in the Senate version of the \n     bill. This section, though somewhat vague, would limit BPA's \n     annual fish and wildlife expenditures and introduce language \n     specifying that BPA's spending is adequate to meet \n     environmental requirements, which overrides existing \n     environmental laws. The inclusion of such an override is \n     unacceptable to the Administration. The Administration is \n     working with the Congress and the various interested groups \n     in the Northwest to try to identify a core program of fish \n     recovery activities that could provide a stable base for \n     several years at a reasonable cost.\n\n\n                     department of energy--general\n\n       The Administration is committed to maintaining the \n     Department of Energy and to moving forward in its \n     restructuring and realignment. We are disappointed that both \n     the House and Senate propose to cut the Department \n     significantly below the FY 1996 request in many areas. \n     Although the Administration appreciates the Senate's overall \n     restoration of nearly $250 million in reductions made by the \n     House to the request for energy supply, research and \n     development, we are concerned about the remaining cuts to \n     many key areas, including the Climate Change Action Plan \n     initiatives and the Department's global climate change \n     research and technology development efforts.\n\n\n                  department of energy--nuclear energy\n\n       The Administration strongly objects to the House action \n     that would eliminate funds requested for the Department of \n     Energy to assist countries with Soviet-designed nuclear power \n     plants in addressing the health and safety problems posed by \n     these plants. The requested $83.5 million was substantially \n     restored by the Senate. Failing to provide these funds would \n     undercut the nuclear safety program developed in concert with \n     other G-7 countries, countries of Central and Eastern Europe, \n     and the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union.\n       The House version of the bill does not provide the $3.9 \n     million requested for completing the processing and \n     stabilization of North Korean spent fuel, which is currently \n     underway. The fuel stabilization effort is important because \n     it will help to ensure that this fuel is not processed to \n     recover plutonium. This program is part of a United States \n     commitment to encourage North Korea to abandon its nuclear \n     weapons program. This key non-proliferation goal would be \n     threatened by the House's action. The Administration urges \n     the conferees to provide the full $3.9 million, as \n     recommended by the Senate.\n\n\n       department of energy--solar and renewable energy programs\n\n       Both the House and the Senate propose significant cuts to \n     the Administration's request for solar and renewable energy \n     research programs. These programs help to create jobs, \n     increase energy security, and protect the environment. The \n     House version of the bill, in particular, would eliminate or \n     drastically reduce many programs that have been making \n     notable technical progress, including many of the most cost-\n     effective implementation programs for reducing greenhouse-gas \n     emissions. The Administration urges the conferees to provide \n     funding at least at the Senate level.\n\n\n                 department of energy--defense programs\n\n       The Administration believes that the Senate additions above \n     the President's request for nuclear weapons stockpile \n     management are unnecessary, especially given the deep cuts \n     made to many of the President's investment initiatives in \n     both the House and Senate versions of the bill.\n       The Administration strongly urges that the conferees \n     provide the Department of Energy with the flexibility to \n     implement dual-use Cooperative Research and Development \n     Agreements in the weapons programs.\n       The Administration objects to the House's proposed \n     elimination of funding for detailed design of the National \n     Ignition Facility (NIF). The Senate proposal to fund the NIF \n     at the President's requested level would simply allow design \n     work to continue without delay and would not initiate any \n     construction activities.\n\n\n                 Department of Energy--Energy Research\n\n       The Administration commends both the House and Senate for \n     supporting the Science Facilities Initiative. However, \n     funding levels proposed by both the House and Senate for the \n     U.S. Magnetic Fusion Energy program send a clear message that \n     the program must be substantially restructured. While the \n     Administration concurs in principle, the President's \n     Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology has concluded \n     that funding over the next several years must be at the level \n     of $320 million to preserve the most indispensable elements \n     of the U.S. fusion effort and associated international \n     collaboration while maintaining momentum toward the goal of \n     practical fusion energy. The Administration urges the \n     conferees to provide at least $275 million for FY 1996.\n\n\n           Department of Energy--Departmental Administration\n\n       The Administration is concerned about the personnel \n     implications of both the House and Senate cuts to the \n     President's requested level of funding for the Department's \n     departmental administration. Funding at least at the House \n     level is necessary to provide an orderly downsizing and to \n     ensure proper departmental oversight during a time of \n     substantial change at the Department.\n\n\n                        Army Corps of Engineers\n\n       The Administration is disappointed that both the House and \n     Senate have rejected a budget reduction strategy for the Army \n     Corps of Engineers that would commit resources to those \n     missions with the Clearest Federal role, while devolving \n     others to State and local governments. Given this rejection, \n     the Administration plans to continue to work with Congress on \n     a budget reduction strategy for the Corps. The Administration \n     urges the conferees to remove language contained in both the \n     House and Senate versions of the bill that would limit the \n     flexibility of the Secretary of the Army in his current \n     efforts to restructure the Army Corps of Engineers.\n       The out-year cost of unrequested new starts is a concern, \n     even though the first year cost is relatively small. For \n     example, those in the House version of the bill would only \n     cost $10 million in the first year, but would require $650 \n     million to complete fully. The Administration urges the \n     conferees to trim the list of projects, especially in the \n     area of beach and shoreline protection projects.\n       The Administration is disappointed with the decision of the \n     House and the Senate not to provide funding for several much-\n     needed environmental studies and research activities. The \n     Administration requests that the final bill provide \n     flexibility for the Corps to allocate its wetlands protection \n     funds to activities deemed to be most effective.\n\n\n                         Bureau of Reclamation\n\n       The Administration urges the conferees to adopt the House \n     level of funding for the Bureau of Reclamation's Safety of \n     Dams Corrective Action program. This funding is necessary to \n     accomplish needed repairs to Federal dams.\n\n\n                       Other independent agencies\n\n       The Administration commends the Senate for restoring funds \n     for the independent river basin commissions. The restored \n     funding is in keeping with the increasing emphasis on State \n     and local resource and project management for local flood \n     control.\n\n[[Page S16391]]\n\n       We look forward to working with the conferees to address \n     our mutual concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M. Rivlin,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me go through Animas-La Plata--Animas-La Plata and \nsome sufficiency language which would have deemed that project to have \ncomplied with all environmental requirements; that is what the word \n``sufficiency'' would have meant. In conference, language was sought to \nmake it sufficient with reference to environmental requirements. \nObviously, the President's staff--the chief advisor said in that same \nletter, which is now in the Record, that if sufficiency language, \ngetting rid of any future environmental contention regarding that \nproject was put in, they would also recommend a veto.\n  It is hard to tell how many of these are for real, when a President's \nstaff says it. But I took this one as pretty serious and a compromise \nwas worked out. I am going to put my interpretation of that compromise \nin the Record.\n  Suffice it to say, there is no sufficiency language in this bill. \nThere is language that says we should proceed with the project, but it \nis clear that no environmental contests are waived. So that means, on \nthe one hand, we are starting to fund the project here in this bill \nwith another piece of money--$10 million. And we are saying, let us \nproceed. But we do in no way waive any challenges that might be made to \nit.\n  Mr. President, I have a few brief comments about language included in \nthe energy and water conference report that pertains to construction of \nthe Animas-La Plata water project. The language in the report directs \nthe Secretary of the Interior ``to proceed without delay'' with those \nportions of the project identified in the October 25, 1991, final \nbiological opinion.\n  There has been much talk about just what this language means. \nSpecifically, opponents of the project have attempted to paint this as \nso-called sufficiency language exempting the project from any further \nenvironmental analyses required by Federal law. Mr. President, this is \nnot the case. The report language does not override existing Federal \nenvironmental requirements, nor does it prevent further judicial \nreview. Consequently, those who say this report language is an attack \non the environment or a subterfuge of the judicial process are simply \nwrong.\n  At the same time, however, the language makes it clear that the \nCongress is absolutely committed to the swift and successful completion \nof this project. Under the terms of the 1988 Colorado Ute Indian Water \nRights Settlement Act, the United States has a trust obligation to the \nSouthern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribes to complete the \nproject.\n  The final bill provides $19.3 billion in budget authority and $11.5 \nbillion in new outlays to finance the operations of the Army Corps of \nEngineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Energy Supply Research and \nDevelopment and Atomic Energy Defense and Related Programs of the \nDepartment of Energy, and several independent agencies.\n  When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $19.3 billion in budget \nauthority and $19.7 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1996.\n  The subcommittee which I chair is within its section 602(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the final bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    ENERGY AND WATER SUBCOMMITTEE--SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT   \n               [Fiscal year 1996, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Budget             \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.....................................  ..........      4,039\n  H.R. 1905, conference report...................      10,656      6,402\n  Scorekeeping adjustment........................  ..........  .........\n                                                  ----------------------\n    Subtotal defense discretionary...............      10,656     10,441\n                                                  ======================\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.....................................  ..........      4,171\n  H.R. 1905, conference report...................       8,680      5,100\n  Scorekeeping adjustment........................  ..........  .........\n                                                  ----------------------\n    Subtotal nondefense discretionary............       8,680      9,271\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.....................................  ..........  .........\n  H.R. 1905, conference report...................  ..........  .........\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget........................................  ..........  .........\n      Resolution assumptions.....................  ..........  .........\n                                                  ----------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory.........................  ..........  .........\n                                                  ======================\n      Adjusted bill total........................      19,336     19,712\n                                                  ======================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary..........................      10,928     10,632\n  Nondefense discretionary.......................       8,680      9,272\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund.............  ..........  .........\n  Mandatory......................................  ..........  .........\n                                                  ----------------------\n    Total allocation.............................      19,608     19,904\n                                                  ======================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n  Defense discretionary..........................        -272       -191\n  Nondefense discretionary.......................          -0         -1\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund.............  ..........  .........\n  Mandatory......................................  ..........  .........\n                                                  ----------------------\n      Total allocation...........................        -272       -192\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I think Senator McCain has been waiting. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have been informed by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota that he is going trick-or-treating with his children \ntonight at 6. I find that a transcendent priority. I will be extremely \nbrief and submit my written comments for the Record. I hope all my \ncolleagues will also make their comments brief so it is possible for \nthose Members with children to be able to partake in this time-honored \nfamily tradition.\n  Mr. President, I will be relatively brief. I am again disturbed to \nfind unauthorized projects and unappropriated projects in the \nconference report. I have said to the Senator from New Mexico on \nnumerous occasions that deprives me of my ability to scrutinize, and \nvote, if necessary, on projects. It is my initial screening--as I say, \nI will submit a written statement for the Record--20 unauthorized \nprojects are in this, ranging understandably from Petersburg, WV, to \nArkansas City, KS, New Orleans, LA, White River, IN, to a Pennsylvania \nenvironmental pilot program. The conference report modifies the bill by \nincreasing the authorization from $17 to $50 million for water and \nsewer projects. Mr. President, $3.5 million is appropriated in the \nconference report. The authorization is only available for projects \nwithin two Members' congressional districts.\n  Mr. President, this is wrong. It is wrong to do that.\n  There is funding for the central Indianapolis waterfront concept \nmaster plan.\n  Mr. President, the Corps of Engineers' authority is not to be \ninvolved in waterfront master plans unless it has to do with flood \ncontrol.\n  The Arkansas City flood control project in Kansas was unauthorized. I \nwill read several of them.\n  The Homer project in Alaska, $3.8 million; Dog River, AL, project, \n$200,000; Sacramento River, CA, $300,000; West Dade, FL, $150,000; \nHolmes Beach County, FL, $150,000; Ohio River, Greenway, IN, $500,000; \nIndianapolis waterfront, $2 million.\n  Mr. President, none of these have been authorized. They were inserted \nin the conference. Mr. President, we deserve better. I do not know if \nthese projects are good or bad, and the American people certainly do \nnot know. And there will be nothing in the Congressional Record to let \nus know if they are good or bad.\n  I notice that we are going to fund the Appalachian Commission this \nyear for a considerable amount of money. I think it is $140 million. \nThat clearly is something that should not continue since every part of \nAmerica now needs the same kind of assistance that those States which \nare now included in the Appalachian Regional Commission receive.\n  Mr. President, I think that it is important for us to understand--\nanother one, $2 million, acting through the Corps of Engineers, to \nauthorize the director to proceed with engineering, design, and \nconstruction of projects for flood control improvement for the \nrainwater drainage systems in Jefferson, New Orleans, and St. Tampa \nParish, LA--authorized to be appropriated $25 million for the \ninitiation and partial accomplishment of projects described in these \nreports. My understanding is that there has been no screening, and that \nthere has been no request for authorization. There has been nothing \nexcept that this was stuck in, in the conference report. The corps has \nnot finished its studies as to whether this is needed.\n\n[[Page S16392]]\n\n  Mr. President, again, I have no doubt that some of these projects are \nworthwhile, and have great virtue. But we do not know whether they do \nor not because they are placed in the conference into the conference \nreport without authorization and without any kind of screening.\n  I would like to finally say there are several appropriations bills, \nincluding the transportation bill and several other appropriations \nbills, which are excellent, where the business of putting in projects \nin conference that were in neither the authorization nor the \nappropriation bills has largely been done away with. I wish I could say \nthat is the same for this bill. It is not the case. And I think that we \nshould reject this practice over time.\n  Mr. President, I hope my friend from North Dakota enjoys his evening \nand his children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we have been listening to two very well \nbriefed men who are handling this piece of legislation here on the \nfloor. When we begin to talk about nuclear storage and that sort of \nthing, spending hundreds of millions of dollars, it kind of goes over \nsome heads. But I want to talk about something that affects real people \nnow. Several weeks ago, Mr. President, in the House an amendment was \nfloated to this bill, and to the reconciliation bill, to sell the Power \nMarketing Administrations. The Power Marketing Administrations with \nhydroelectric furnish low-cost power to rural areas in this country. To \ndo even better than that, the amendment came out on the bill that would \nsell the lakes that provide the water to generate the electricity.\n  I want to tell you. A furor occurred down in my part of the country \nbecause you have recreation, fishing, camping, and swimming on these \nvarious lakes--four of them in Kentucky where a father has taken a son \nfishing and camping, and now that son is taking his son to the lake \nfishing and camping. And it is something a family of low income can \nenjoy.\n  So with all these furors that followed this suggestion, our people in \nmy part of the State said, ``Sell the lakes? Never.'' The calls came to \nWashington, and Speaker Gingrich was contacted. And he assured them \nthat this was off the table--that it would not be considered. But it \nwould be considered when the communities have calmed down a little bit, \nand it would be revisited when the communities are more comfortable \nwith the sale, I believe the Speaker said. But Mr. Kasich, the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, said that they will be sold but it will be \ndone a little later because of the furor. Then the proposal to sell the \nPower Marketing Administrations was proposed, and another furor \nfollowed. Again, the Speaker said that this would be off the table.\n  So you have to watch around this place, Mr. President, because there \nis always someone trying to back door you.\n  If you think the Power Marketing Administrations are off the table, \nor if the power lines and the facilities to generate this electricity \nis off the table, you ought to read page 476 of the reconciliation bill \nfrom the House.\n  We have in the statutory language now that the Secretaries of Energy, \nInterior, and Army cannot sell power marketing administrations. Well, \non page 476 of the House reconciliation bill, they repeal those \nprohibitions. And in the next section they authorize and say, ``The \nSecretaries shall''--that is plural, of Energy, Interior, and Army--\n``shall secure and enter into arrangements with an experienced private-\nsector firm to serve as advisor to the Secretaries with respect to the \nsale of the facilities used to generate and transmit the electrical \npower marketed by Southeastern Power Administration, Southwestern Power \nAdministration, and Western Power Administration.''\n  And so prior to December 31, 1996, they shall come back with their \nreport to sell. And in these instructions in the reconciliation bill in \nthe House, they say they can cluster the generated facilities where \nthey might be sold at a higher price.\n  That does not seem to me that power marketing administrations and the \nfacilities used for such a transmission line are off the table. Lo and \nbehold, Mr. President, in this bill--in this bill--we are about to pass \nhere in the Senate, there is no language under amendment 51.\n  It says:\n\n       The conferees agree that the statutory limitations do not \n     prohibit the legislative branch from initiating or conducting \n     studies or collecting information regarding the sale or \n     transfer of the power marketing administrations to non-\n     Federal ownership.\n\n  Mr. President, the power marketing administrations are not off the \ntable. We are just being backdoored, making big headlines, big \nstatements, ``They are off the table,'' then insert them in language, \ntry to hide it, and in the language of this bill, as an afterthought, I \nsuspect, they authorized GAO for the study.\n  Mr. President, I am torn about whether to vote for this piece of \nlegislation or not because it does authorize GAO to make the study for \nthe sale of these power marketing administrations. So I want to just \nsay to my folks that have an interest in it all across the country--all \nacross the country--that you better be careful because the majority has \nmade up its mind it is going to sell the power marketing \nadministrations. And the testimony in the House committee said that \nrates would go up, the rates would go up.\n  If you want rural electrical rates to go up, you just sell your power \nmarketing administration, and you will see what happens to you. This \nmajority is trying to sell everything.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I also want to thank the Senator from \nArizona for his comments. I am not sure how the Senator arrived at the \nnumber of 20 unauthorized projects, and I do not agree with that \nnumber, but it is accurate that the conference report does include some \nauthorizations for the Corps of Engineers water projects.\n  When the energy and water development bill passed the Senate it \nincluded four provisions which addressed on-going projects. The \nconference agreement includes four additional provisions. For example, \na provision is included in response to the devastating flooding which \noccurred earlier this year in New Orleans, LA, which allows the Corps \nof Engineers to undertake additional measures to limit the flood \ndamages in that city. Another provision allows the corps to transfer \nland to the city of Prestonsburg, KY, for a public park.\n  So, while the conference agreement does include some small \nauthorizations, I do not understand how the Senator arrived at his \nfigure of 20 unauthorized projects in the conference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to clarify a single sentence \nin the conference report accompanying H.R. 1905 relating to economic \ndevelopment activities. Within the Department of Energy environmental \nmanagement account, in the nuclear material and facilities \nstabilization section, there is a sentence that provides: \n``Additionally, none of these funds should be used for economic \ndevelopment activities.''\n  It is my understanding that this language was included because there \nwas concern by some members of Congress that money was being diverted \nfrom cleanup and restoration efforts and used for economic development. \nIt is clear from this language that money should not be used for \neconomic development activities when those activities are unrelated to \nthe project for which the money was appropriated. However, where this \nmoney can be used both to achieve its intended purposes and assist in \ncommunity transition and diversification, it should be so used.\n  The Department of Energy should allow the use of these funds to \nachieve as many positive results as possible and leverage this money to \nassist the communities they serve in achieving economic \ndiversification.\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Domenici. Included in the \nconference report to the fiscal year 1997 Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill are provisions related to the Bonneville Power \nAdministration. I would like to focus on these provisions for a moment.\n  As the chairman is aware, a longer term regional review initiative \nwas recently announced by the Bonneville \n\n[[Page S16393]]\n\nPower Administration and the department of energy. It is my \nunderstanding, as a member of the conference, that the conferees were \naware of and supported this reexamination of Bonneville's statutory \nauthorities and responsibilities. However, it is my understanding that \nthe conferees did not intend their action in this conference report to \nprejudice any future regional discussions regarding the comprehensive \nregional review of Bonneville and the electric utility industry in the \nNorthwest.\n  The sharing of benefits established in the Northwest Power Act of \n1980 has been accomplished in large part through a provision in the act \nknown as the residential exchange. It is my understanding that \nconferees believe there should continue to be a fair sharing of the \nbenefits from the Bonneville system for all ratepayers across the \nregion, consistent with existing law. To further this objective, the \nconferees provided for $145 million to maintain the residential \nexchange benefits at approximately the fiscal year 1996 level. It was \nnot intended that BPA's residential exchange payment of $145 million in \nfiscal year 1997 be recouped from BPA's residential exchange customers \nin the remaining years of the 5-year rate period.\n  The conference report now before the Senate encourages BPA and its \ncustomers to work together to phase out the residential exchange by \nOctober 1, 2001. Furthermore, it is my understanding that the conferees \ndid not intend this encouragement to affect the current development of \nrates by BPA because the outcome of the regional review and settlement \ndiscussions are not known at this time.\n  Mr. President, Let me ask the Senator from New Mexico, if this \ncomports with his understanding?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say in answer to my friend from \nOregon, the distinguished chairman of the full committee and the author \nof the provision we are now discussing, that his statement does indeed \ncomport with my understanding.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank my friend for engaging in this dialog with \nme.\n\n\n                      kotzebue wind energy project\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a concern regarding the conference \nreport to H.R. 1905, the energy and water development appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 1996, and would like to ask Senator Domenici, the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee, a question about the \nKotzebue wind energy project in the State of Alaska.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to try and clarify anything of \nconcern to my friend from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. On page 90 of the original Senate report (S. Rept. 104-\n120), the Appropriations Committee highlighted the Kotzebue project and \ndirected the Department of Energy ``* * * to provide technical \nassistance and other appropriate support for this project.'' \nUnfortunately, on page 60 of the statement of managers accompanying the \nconference report to H.R. 1905 (H. Rept. 104-293), the House and Senate \nconferees indicate that neither technical support nor other support is \nprovided for the Kotzebue project.\n  I am disappointed by the language in the statement of managers. I \nwant to clarify that the conferees certainly did not intend that the \nDepartment of Energy halt its current and future assistance for \nKotzebue, which is an ongoing DOE wind energy project. Under the \nDepartment's sustainable technology energy partnerships [STEP] program, \nKotzebue Electric Association, with the State of Alaska, will receive \n$580,000 in fiscal year 1995 funds from the Department's Wind Program \nfor its 50/50 cost-shared project that will result in the installation \nof wind turbines near Kotzebue. This pilot project is at the forefront \nof Alaska's activities to promote wind energy for many of the State's \nremote communities. The project will provide information on the \npotential of wind energy as a reliable power source in our extreme \narctic climate.\n  Furthermore, based on current DOE estimates, approximately $50,000 in \nfiscal year 1996 funds will be required to provide necessary technical \nassistance and support for the ongoing Kotzebue project, which will \neventually provide 5MW of wind generation for Kotzebue plus outlying \nvillages.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the Senator's explanation of DOE's \ncontinuing involvement in this project, and agree that termination of \nsupport for the project would jeopardize many years of work. \nAccordingly, we did not intend to prohibit the Department of Energy or \nany other agency from continuing and completing on-going technical \nassistance and other support for the Kotzebue, AK, wind project.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the chairman for this clarification. I take it \nthe conference merely meant that no funds have been earmarked for the \nKotzebue project. It does not object to the project.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                            Animas-La Plata\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to commend the conferees to the \nenergy-water development appropriations bill for their action on the \nAnimas-La Plata water project. This conference, led ably by Senators \nDomenici and Johnston and Congressmen Myers and Bevill, has taken a \ndecisive step toward the expedient completion of the Animas-La Plata \nwater project.\n  In 1868, more than 125 years ago, the Ute Bands signed a treaty with \nthe United States. This treaty entitled the Utes to water. One hundred \nyears later, the Ute Tribes were not receiving their entitlement. \nFinally, in 1972, the United States filed suit on behalf of the Ute \nTribes in an effort to quantify the native Americans' water rights.\n  Mr. President, the Ute Tribes have encountered procedural hurdles and \nstiff opposition at every turn. Even though the United States promised \nthis water to these tribes, who more than 100 years ago had been \nrelegated by the Federal Government to dry, arid, lands, the fact is \nthat the Utes have not been provided the water that they were clearly \nentitled to in the middle of the last century.\n  In 1984, events took a turn for the better. All the interested \nparties, including the Ute Mountain Utes, the Southern Utes, Federal \nagencies, the States of Colorado and New Mexico, the local water \ndistricts, and other involved parties sat down at the negotiating \ntable. They worked together, and within 2 years, in 1986, they came to \nan agreement on how water would finally be provided to the Utes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest to my colleagues that this was a rare \ndisplay of cooperation. Water rights disputes in the arid West can be \nbitter, emotional fights of deep acrimony and enormous economic \nconsequence. The Utes could have asserted their Winters Doctrine \npriority water rights in a manner that would simply have disrupted the \nsocial and economic health of the Four Corners area. Instead, they \nchose good faith negotiation. And we are not holding up our end.\n  The agreement, in essence, was this: The United States shall provide \nwater to the Ute Tribes, and in return, the Ute Tribes shall defer \ntheir precious senior water rights. The Utes surrendered their most \nvaluable tribal asset, in return for which the United States promised \nto provide water.\n  The United States would provide water not by taking it away from \nneighboring towns, farms and mines. Rather, the United States would \nbuild the Animas-La Plata project so water could be acquired. This \nproject would create an off-stream reservoir, so that it would not be \nnecessary to dam the Animas River, which would in turn supply the Ute \nTribes and non-Indians in the region with water.\n  In 1988, as a Member of the House of Representatives, I introduced \nlegislation to implement and ratify this agreement. The Colorado Ute \nIndian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a wide margin, and it passed this body without a \ndissenting vote.\n  After Congress decided to provide water by building the Animas-La \nPlata project, the Ute Tribes discovered a new and unexpected enemy: \nThe professional environmental advocacy groups of this country.\n  Mr. President, when we passed the Settlement Act in 1988, at that \ntime the Animas-La Plata project had already met, and was in full \ncompliance with, all the requirements of our environmental statutes, \nincluding the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water Act \nand the Endangered \n\n[[Page S16394]]\n\nSpecies Act. A final environmental impact statement had already been \ncompleted, all the appropriate consultations had occurred, all the \nnecessary permits were in place.\n  When we ordered the Bureau of Reclamation to build the project, we \nexpected the Bureau to do just that.\n  But environmental groups have advanced claim after unfounded claim \nagainst this project. Environmental groups contend that more studies \nand more reviews are needed to complete this project, when in fact, \nthis project has been the focus of years of study and five reports \nissued pursuant to environmental statutes.\n  This project has been the subject of two separate biological opinions \nunder the Endangered Species Act, an environmental impact statement and \na draft supplemental environmental impact statement under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, and a section 404(r) permit exemption under \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  This project has been reviewed with a fine-toothed comb, but \nenvironmental groups have threatened more years--40 years, to quote one \nof them--of litigation and delay. Their avowed purpose is to kill the \nAnimas-La Plata project.\n  Mr. President, I have heard talk of alternatives to this project. \nOpponents of this project suggest that we should consider more \nalternatives. Any party is free to propose an alternative at any time. \nSome have even suggested that there may be a viable alternative to the \nAnimas-La Plata project. However, those who claim that we should \nconsider more alternatives are simply seeking to kill this project. \nThey are not interested in providing water to the Ute Tribes as the \n1988 Settlement Act requires.\n  If a so-called alternative does not meet all of the terms of the \nsettlement, then it is no alternative at all. Some groups claim they \ncan muster an alternative, but the only proposed alternatives would \ntake water away from parties to the 1986 agreement. Mr. President, that \nis not an alternative. That is a sham and a dealbreaker.\n  Why does this situation exist? It exists because environmental \nextremists simply oppose all major water projects --even an off-stream \nproject like this one, designed to minimize environmental impact. They \nignore the social, recreational and economic benefits a water project \nand settlement such as this can bring to an arid Western region. They \ndisagree with the congressional policy decision to meet the water \ndemands of the Ute Indian Tribes and other water consumers.\n  They do not want the Animas-La Plata project to be built, even though \nthat is what Congress has ordered. Because they oppose large water \nprojects, they use environmental statutes as an underhanded subterfuge \nto tie up projects in court. With crafty attorneys, they can delay a \nproject for years, and maybe even kill it.\n  Mr. President, this is what the environmentalists want. They do not \ncare about economic security or even the unsatisfied water claims of \ntwo tribes of native Americans. They will stop at nothing to meet their \nextreme ideological agenda. Frankly, I am also disappointed that this \nadministration has placed the ideological goals of the Fish and \nWildlife Service and EPA ahead of its trust responsibility to native \nAmericans.\n  If the project dies, then this Nation will have again broken its word \nto native Americans. I urge my colleagues not to follow this shameful \npath of dishonor and deceit. There are enough of these unfortunate \nincidents in the history of this Nation's dealings with native \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, the language before the Senate in the Energy-Water \nDevelopment Appropriations conference report directs the Secretary of \nthe Interior to proceed, quote, ``without delay'' and construct the \nAnimas-La Plata project. I urge my colleagues to support this action. \nThis project is the best alternative, in the eyes of Congress, to \nsettle this water rights dispute.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the \nEnergy-Water Development Subcommittee, Senator Domenici, for his fine \nefforts on behalf of the Animas-La Plata project. The Senator's efforts \nare a credit to his uncompromising dedication to the native Americans \nof Colorado and New Mexico, and I'm sure the people of New Mexico \nappreciate his service as much as my constituents in Colorado.\n\n\n                        biofuels energy systems\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to clarify the intent of the Energy \nand Water Development appropriations conference committee with regard \nto their support of the Biofuels Research and Development Program \nwithin the Department of Energy. Based upon contact my office has had \nwith the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development Appropriations, \nit was never the intent of the committee to exclude the other 48 States \nwhen it made note of projects in Hawaii and Vermont. Projects, \nincluding those in my own State of Minnesota, would be eligible to \napply for available funds as would be the rest of the country. \nFurthermore, I understand that it was never the intent of the committee \nto discourage a continuation of the ongoing biomass electric program in \nall States parallel to the ongoing biomass fuels research and \ndevelopment program.\n  While I have received word of the intent of this clarification, I \nwant the record to reflect that I will be carefully watching the \ninterpretation of this conference language by the Department of Energy. \nShould there be any misunderstanding, I will work with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee to rectify \nthis matter.\n  I also seek unanimous consent to have the attached colloquy between \nthe House Energy Subcommittee Chair and my Minnesota colleague, \nRepresentative Minge, on this matter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the colloquy was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Colloquy Between Representatives Myers and Minge\n\n       Mr. Minge. I wish to thank the ranking member for the time \n     and Chairman Myers for entering into this colloquy. I would \n     also commend the chairman and ranking Member for reporting a \n     balanced bill, particularly in support of the Biofuels R \n     Program within the Department of Energy. And I would like to \n     clarify the intent of the conference committee with regard to \n     this program. Am I correct in understanding that nothing in \n     the conference report prohibits continuing research, \n     development and demonstration on energy crops for fuels and \n     electricity or in any way discourages a continuation of the \n     ongoing biomass electric program in all States in parallel to \n     the ongoing biomass fuels research, development and \n     demonstration program, on the understanding that the \n     expenditures for the biomass electric program do not reduce \n     the conferees' allocations to other biofuels programs?\n       Mr. Myers. Yes, the gentleman from Minnesota is absolutely \n     correct.\n       Mr. Minge. I wish to thank the Chairman in regard to the \n     intent of the conference committee.\n\n\n disproportionate civilian r cuts in energy and water appropriations \n                       will hurt in the long run\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express serious concern about \nthe cuts made to civilian energy research and development programs in \nthe energy and water appropriations conference report that will be \nadopted by the Senate today. While some level of reduction to \nGovernment programs may be expected in order to reduce and eventually \neliminate the deficit, the drastic cuts in our civilian R programs, \nnot just in this bill, but across the civilian research agencies--with \nthe possible exception of the National Institutes of Health--are \nshortsighted.\n  Overall, this budget proposes a 17-percent reduction in our civilian \nenergy R from the level requested in the President's budget. An ever \nlarger percentage--35 percent--is cut from solar and renewable energy \nR A chart comparing budget request levels versus the decisions \ncontained in the conference report, which I ask unanimous consent be \nincluded in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks, shows the \nmagnitude of the cuts in the energy and water appropriations bill. Cuts \nthat will start us down a path that will ultimately and inevitably harm \nour Nation's economy and energy security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Republican budget resolution adopted in June will \nreduce our civilian R budget to a four decade low as a percentage of \nour economy by the year 2002. These cuts will not be made up by the \nprivate sector, who are showing, through deep cuts being made in their \nown research \n\n[[Page S16395]]\n\nbudgets, an ever narrower focus and an unwillingness to invest in long-\nterm research projects. So our research dollars will be shrinking while \nthose of our economic rivals, Germany and Japan for example, continue \nto rise. Recognizing the importance of civilian research investments, \nthey and other industrialized countries around the world are seeking to \nemulate the successful American model of the last half century, just as \nwe seem to be abandoning it.\n  In the energy arena, our investments have paid off in terms of \nlowering energy costs and creating new technical advancements in \nphotovoltaic, wind energy, solar thermal, biofuels, and geothermal \nsystems. These developments are positioning the United States as a \nworld leader in new technologies. This has been confirmed by a recently \ncompleted report of the Yergin Task Force on Strategic Energy R which \nfound that ``DOE energy R has resulted in billions of dollars' worth \nof annual consumer energy savings and new business opportunities.'' In \naddition, the Yergin report concluded that technological R \nadvancements from both the public and private sectors are imperative in \norder for our Nation to meet its future energy needs.\n  With all of the significant accomplishments these R efforts have \nyielded, with huge potential in energy products and services markets \nover the next 25 years, and with the serious trade deficit we now face, \nI ask my colleagues, how do these cuts make sense? Well, Mr. President, \nin my opinion, they do not.\n  I plan to vote for the energy and water conference report today. \nGiven where many Republicans started several months ago on the defense \nside of this bill, the conference report we are voting on today is not \nas bad as it could have been. Essentially the bill preserves the \nPresident's initiatives for stockpile stewardship and arms control \nverification and nonproliferation technologies, vital programs for our \nlong-term national security. However, the details that have emerged on \nthe DOE civilian research budget present a very bleak story--one I fear \nwill put our Nation's well-being and prosperity at considerable risk in \nthe long run. I urge the President to continue to fight for adequate \ninvestments in energy research even if he reluctantly signs the bill \ninto law.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  CUTS IN ENERGY R YEAR 1996 ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS  \n                                  BILL                                  \n                        [In millions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Request    Conference\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSolar and Renewable R     423.4        275.2 \nNuclear Energy R     379.8        231.0 \nEnvironment, Safety and Health..................     164.6        128.4 \nEnergy Research.................................   1,721.4      1,518.5 \n    (Of which:                                                          \nBiological and Environmental....................

Mr. President, there is one more important point I want \nto make about this bill. I understand language regarding the Animas-La \nPlata project was considered which would have read, ``In order to \nensure the timely implementation of the Colorado-Ute Indian Water \nRights Settlement Act of 1988, and notwithstanding any other provisions \nof law, the Secretary of the Interior is directed to proceed without \nfurther delay with construction of those facilities approved for \nconstruction in the Final Biological Opinion for the Animas-La Plata \nProject, Colorado and New Mexico, dated October 25, 1991.'' I \nunderstand this language including the phrase ``notwithstanding any \nother provision of law'' was rejected.\n  The conferees adopted substitute language which says, ``In order to \nensure the timely implementation of the Colorado Ute Indian Water \nRights Settlement Act of 1988, the Secretary of the Interior is \ndirected to proceed without delay with construction of those facilities \nin conformance with the final Biological Opinion for the Animas-La \nPlata project, Colorado and New Mexico, dated October 25, 1991.''\n  I understand conferees adopted the language they did because they are \nfrustrated with the pace of the work to comply with existing law before \nthe Secretary can legally proceed to implement the Colorado Ute Indian \nWater Rights Settlement Act. Efforts to finalize numerous steps \nrequired to begin construction of the project, including completion of \na satisfactory supplemental environmental impact statement \ndemonstrating compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, \nClean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act have taken several \nyears. Based on assurances from members of the administration and the \nconference committee, the amendment is intended to provide clear \ndirection to the Bureau of Reclamation to complete the work necessary \nto move forward by complying expeditiously with these and other \nprovisions of law. The House added $5 million to the administration's \nbudget request for the project for fiscal year 1996, and the Senate \nconcurred, to assist the Bureau in its effort to comply with the \ndirections of the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In the conference report language, it is stated that \n$55.3 million is provided for biofuels energy systems. When $27.65 \nmillion is taken out for biochemical and thermochemical conversion, \nthat leaves another $27.65 million. Then $3.94 million goes to the \nregional biomass program and full funding is provided for biomass power \nprojects in Vermont and Hawaii. There is no instruction for the \nremainder of the nonbiochemical and nonthermo- chemical biomass \nfunding. Am I correct in stating that that remainder could be applied \nto the Biomass Power for Rural Development Program?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Minnesota is correct. DOE could apply \nthe funding as he describes.\n  I do not think there is anything further on our side.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, during the past 6 months the Northwest \ncongressional delegation and the Clinton administration have spent a \ngreat deal of time in an attempt to control the costs imposed on the \nBonneville Power Administration's ratepayers by the Endangered Species \nAct mandating recovery of certain salmon runs of the Columbia and Snake \nRiver systems.\n  The threat of a financial collapse of the Bonneville Power \nAdministration and the reality of exploding fish recovery costs borne \nby the region prompted this attention. The Bonneville Power \nAdministration bears many financial burdens to threaten its ability to \nremain competitive. The entire electricity industry is being rocked by \nfierce winds of change that were not anticipated when the Northwest \nPower Act was passed by Congress in 1980.\n  The most immediate and increasing burden on BPA and its ratepayers \narises out of Endangered Species Act-mandated salmon recovery costs.\n  Until just a few weeks ago, Clinton administration officials at the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service estimated that BPA's share of salmon \nrecovery costs for fiscal year 1996 would exceed $600 million. As a \nconsequence, the Clinton administration decided, quite correctly, that \nneither a collapse of BPA nor huge rate increases in salmon costs would \nbe tolerated by the people of the Pacific Northwest, and so the \nadministration announced that BPA's salmon recovery costs would be \nadministratively capped at $435 million for the year. That agreement is \nincorporated in this bill.\n  The Clinton administration also made the political calculation that \nthe \n\n[[Page S16396]]\n\nPresident could not afford to anger national environmental \norganizations by supporting any legislative efforts to control salmon \nrecovery costs borne by Northwest ratepayers. After all, earlier this \nyear, this administration enraged those organizations by signing a \nrescission bill that included provisions on salvage timber and \nNorthwest timber harvest programs. So the administration, aware of this \nslow-burning anger among its environmental constituents, decided that \nit could not support a legislative remedy that would help the \nratepayers of the region because that action would further outrage a \nvital political constituency.\n  The only positive aspect of the resulting agreement is that it \nrepresents the first acknowledgement on the part of the administration \nthat there is an economic limit on Columbia and Snake River salmon \ncosts. But this agreement, while it represents our acknowledgement of \nfiscal reality, is severely flawed and incomplete.\n  The agreement is flawed because it is so vague. First, we have not \nseen any paper outlining the agreement. Second, without legislation, \nthere is no real legal protection for BPA, or for the investment \nalready made by the region's ratepayers.\n  Without such protection, BPA said that many of its customers would \nleave the system and purchase power from cheaper alternative sources. \nBPA said that letting its salmon costs escalate uncontrollably would \npush it to the brink of financial ruin. It was, in my view, no idle \nthreat.\n  But the best that BPA can now tell its customers is that the \nadministration promises that $435 million a year from BPA should be \nenough for fish and, if not, there will be a pool of $325 million in \nFederal dollars if costs exceed that $435 million.\n  Mr. President, if the BPA is on the verge of financial ruin, how can \na promise from the administration to not spend more than $435 million \nprovide the certainty that BPA says it needs? What confidence can we \nhave in an agreement that can be broken if an administration official \ndecides next year that BPA should spend more than the $435 million? The \nanswer: no confidence. And what happens if a Federal judge is asked to \ndecide whether the $435 million was derived by political science rather \nthan biological science and finds that number insufficient to meet the \nEndangered Species Act? Answer--the cap will be broken.\n  What happens if that Federal judge issues orders that require BPA to \nspend more than the $325 million in taxpayers' dollars made available \nby the agreement? Answer--taxpayers and ratepayers will pay more.\n  This agreement provides little, if any, assurance to BPA customers \nthat they--or the Federal Treasury--will not be forced to pick up the \ntab for ESA-mandated salmon recovery. In short, this agreement, with \nall of its what ifs, increases the likelihood that the BPA will soon be \nright back where it started--on the brink of financial ruin because of \nrapidly escalating salmon-recovery costs.\n  The agreement is also incomplete. This agreement does nothing to \nprovide any certainty or predictability for other economic interests \nalong the Columbia and Snake Rivers system. BPA gets short-term relief \nfrom this agreement with the administration, but no certainty.\n  Other rivers system users--ports, PUD's, irrigators, agriculture, \nprivate utilities, non-Federal hydroelectric projects, recreational, \nand commercial users--are left with even less protection from Federal \ndecisions to drawdown reservoirs, spill water over dams, increase water \nflows or even order dam removal.\n  Arguably, this agreement by the administration to limit BPA fish \ncosts, while not changing Federal salmon policy, increases the chances \nthat fish costs will be shifted onto other economic entities in the \nregion. Clearly, these entities are not disinterested spectators. They \nare affected greatly by the vagaries of BPA policies and NMFS decisions \nabout how the water from the Columbia and Snake Rivers will be used. \nThe characteristics of this administration's environmental policies are \ninherent all across this agreement--environmentalists are listened to, \nbut working people do not count.\n  This agreement is flawed because it fails to deal with the root of \nBPA's and the region's problem. The root problem is not how much BPA \nand its ratepayers spend on fish recovery. The root of the problem is \nthat this administration has used the ESA to craft a salmon policy that \nforces the most expensive possible measures for the least productive \nreturns.\n  Despite BPA's agreement with the administration, the necessity to \ncontrol BPA and the region's fish and wildlife costs is hardly \nresolved. Many will use this agreement as an opportunity to declare \nvictory and go home. but if this agreement accomplishes anything, it \nillustrates the need for dramatic action now on legislation \nfundamentally to change salmon restoration and conservation practices \non the Columbia and Snake Rivers system.\n  This agreement is unlikely, in the long term, adequately to stabilize \nBPA's financial position. And, despite the claims of an administration \ncabinet member that this agreement will recover the species, it clearly \nwill do little to restore an abundant Northwest fishery. Why? Because \nthis agreement perpetuates the status quo, a status quo that has \naccomplished little if any salmon recovery.\n    \n    \n  Presently, I am typecast as an enemy of salmon. I would like to dwell \nupon this typecast for a moment. Our last great regional natural \nresource debate was, of course, over the extent of measures to protect \nthe northern spotted owl. I will make a confession. While I do not \ndesire the extinction of that bird, I do not worry overly about its \nsurvival. I believe that it will survive, regardless of Federal \npolicies designed to protect it, but more fundamentally, I don't worry \nbecause I don't believe that that bird is vital to the human condition \nor to life on this planet--while I believe that families and people \nare. I believe that preserving a reasonable amount of owl habitat--our \nold growth forests--is important, but, in truth, if you wish to portray \nme as opposed to the proposition that owls are more important than \npeople, you are not far off the mark.\n  I see salmon in a completely different light. I am committed to \nconserving and restoring an abundant Northwest salmon fishery. My \nlegislative proposal to accompany the energy and water appropriations \nconference report would have locked into place a $500 million a year \ncommitment to Columbia and Snake Rivers river salmon recovery.\n  But ensuring a healthy salmon resource in the Northwest is not a \nbroad enough goal for the Columbia and Snake Rivers system--we must \nalso consider anadromous and nonana- dromous fish, and resident fish \npopulations. I will support Federal legislation that provides that \nconsideration and also assures comparable proportionate commitments to \nsalmon runs in other Northwest river systems. I am convinced that, \nwithin reason, Northwest citizens will make large investments to \nrestore the region's fishery.\n  I believe that the region is committed to such an unprecedented \nenvironmental investment because salmon are important to our Northwest \neconomy--they are important to our society, our culture, our lives.\n  Let me emphasize this point. I will support Federal legislation that \nrequires electric ratepayers in the Pacific Northwest to pay for salmon \nrecovery. I believe that people of the region are committed to this \ngoal and are willing to pay for it. I ask only two conditions in \nreturn: First, that the level of expenditures be reasonably \npredictable, and second, that the expenditures be for scientifically \ncredible measures to strengthen the overall fishery.\n  While it is inaccurate to claim that I am antisalmon, it is \ndefinitely true that I disagree profoundly with the administration's \nsalmon management policies.\n  What exactly is the current Federal salmon management policy in the \nNorthwest? Beyond spending a lot of money, I'm not sure anyone can \nhonestly tell us what's been accomplished, or even what the goal of the \nrecovery plan for Columbia and Snake Rivers salmon is. This is a plan \nthat only a bureaucrat could develop and understand--it's easy to write \na plan like this when there is no political accountability, and you are \nspending someone else's money. That's what the Federal recovery plan \nfor salmon boils down to.\n\n[[Page S16397]]\n\n  Today, Federal management of the Columbia and Snake Rivers system is \ndriven by the ESA and it concentrates on the weakest salmon runs for \nrecovery.\n  Fact: This administration's ESA strategy on the Columbia and Snake \nRivers does not even propose to restore a vibrant Northwest fishery in \nany reasonable period of time. Fact: this recovery plan does not say \nthat our national goal is to have the Columbia and Snake brimming with \nmillions of fish. Instead, the ESA requires the region to focus on \nsaving weak salmon runs--not full species of salmon, not even \nsubspecies of salmon but only on what are called distinct population \nsegments. There actions may mean increasing the number of one listed \nrun of Snake River sockeye from 10 in 1994 to 50 by 2000 forty \nindividual fish. Despite the protestations of NMFS biologists, and \ninside-the-beltway theorists, these recovery measures for sockeye \nsalmon have no connection to an abundant salmon resource.\n  NMFS states that recovery of the listed salmon runs will require 50 \nyears, and acknowledges that a century of extraordinary measures is \nprobably necessary. To those involved in tribal, commercial, and \nrecreational fishing, I warn that NMFS, empowered by the ESA, is \nplanning for a century with no fishing.\n  Do not misunderstand, people in the Northwest do care about \nconserving and enhancing wild salmon. Wild salmon are valuable. But \nthey are valuable because their survival and enhancement can play a \nlarge role in the recovery of an abundant and healthy resource. We have \nlearned that some degree of genetic diversity is important to healthy \nsalmon stocks. The problem with the current law is that it empowers \nFederal regulators to spend unlimited amounts of money to save \ngenetically distinct salmon runs as a goal in itself and not as a \nmeasure to a broader goal.\n  The goal of Federal regulators is not an abundant fishery, nor is \ntheir goal connected in any way to economic reality. Federal policy--\ndriven by saving one genetically distinct run--is in conflict with \nrebuilding an abundant fishery. A fraction of the dollars the Federal \nGovernment is taking from the Northwest economy, dedicated to recovery \nof there specific fish populations, would produce a infinitely greater \nreturn if focused on fish populations throughout the system, including \nsaveable salmon runs and some wild stocks.\n\n  I make these points about current Federal salmon policy because the \nagreement arranged by the Clinton administration and BPA does nothing \nto change what is wrong with current Federal fish management policies \nand practices. This agreement literally papers over the problems \ninherent in poor Federal policy with dollars--dollars paid by Northwest \nratepayers and U.S. taxpayers.\n  But in the end, this flawed Federal policy will not be papered over. \nAs long as Northwest salmon recovery measures and costs are dictated by \nthe Federal Government and the EPA we will court failure. We will have \nhigher costs and little, if any, increase in the number of salmon to \nshow for it.\n  It is time to change the direction of our salmon recovery policies \nand the agreement by this administration and BPA does nothing to do so.\n  Northwest salmon policy should be changed so that it is directed at \nthree goals. First, we must restore an abundant fishery resource. \nSecond, we must enhance the fishery with the least possible economic \ndislocation. Third, we must give the authority over decisions for \nsalmon recovery back to the region.\n  Mr. President, I have my own views about effective salmon recovery \nmeasures, but I will fight hard to see that Federal law is changed so \nthat nobody in Washington, DC--including me--will make the decisions on \nhow best to conserve and enhance fish populations in the Northwest. The \nregion must be given the freedom itself to make those decisions. If our \nregion, after an inclusive and thoughtful process, decides to spend \n$500 million a year to restore one weak run of salmon--I will almost \ncertainly disagree--but as a U.S. Senator, I would defend, absolutely, \nthe region's authority to make that choice.\n  I often disagree with our Northwest Indian tribes on issues of public \npolicy but our Northwest tribes should be heard on how best to restore \nan abundant fishery. I often disagree with Washington State's \nrepresentatives on the NW Power Planning Council, but I believe that \nthe Council should be involved in helping to make these decisions. The \nheads of Northwest fishery agencies and our best scientists should have \na significant voice in this process. The region should decide which \nsalmon runs to enhance--not D.C. bureaucrats.\n  Northwest salmon management measures should be decided by the people, \nlocal governments and interests in the Northwest. Today, the region is \nbarred from making these decisions because of Federal law. Federal law \ngrants to one agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, nearly \ntotal control over our Columbia and Snake Rivers systems. I want to \ndramatically alter this miserable status quo--I want the people of the \nregion to make their own decisions on these issues.\n  Mr. President, our country is now in a state of revolution over the \nexcessive role the Federal Government plays in our daily lives. The \nproposition that we should take power from the Federal Government and \nput it in the hands of local people is driving the debate on issues \nranging from education to telecommunications to transportation to \nwelfare. In the opinion of this Senator, the revolution should not stop \nthere.\n  It shouldn't stop there because these aren't the only fields in which \na revolution is occurring. Another is clearly underway in the way our \ncountry delivers energy to families and businesses. In the Northwest, \nthis requires a thorough review of BPA and the Northwest utility \nmarketplace.\n  Our region is just beginning to explore what to do in the face of \nchanges that will dramatically reshape the region's energy marketplace. \nOver the next few months, I will be seeking the opinions of all who are \nconcerned about what the future holds for Northwest energy policies. We \nwill need to ask questions--tough questions--that don't merely tinker \naround the edges but delve deeper in order to create more competition \nand less reliance on government subsidies. In a word--overhaul.\n  In this process our region will also explore what to do about ESA-\nmandated salmon recovery measures and how to pay for them. I intend to \nparticipate in this process. Questions of energy policy, the role of \nthe Northwest Power Planning Council and salmon recovery and its cost \nwill come before Congress in the next several years.\n  I believe that residents of the Pacific Northwest will not continue \nto tolerate exploding costs in the name of salmon recovery, when the \nimmediate benefits are so slight and the promised benefits are esoteric \nand distant.\n  Much of the Northwest was built based on a model of Federal answers \nto regional needs. Those decisions were appropriated at one point in \ntime because our region could not, without Federal aid, have developed \nand grown. But current salmon recovery measures still reflect the old \nfaith in centralized Federal answers to regional problems.\n  Now, however, like nearly every issue before the Congress, the answer \nto the problems of the last 50 years may not be the answers to the \nproblems of the next 50 years. Policies that assure centralized Federal \ncontrol of energy and salmon policy demand careful review and dramatic \nchange. The status quo is not the answer to the region's problems.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator know and the other Members know it is \nHalloween and not only do Members have children who they would like to \ngo to Halloween with, but there are members of the staff here and all \nover Capitol Hill that would like to observe Halloween?\n  I know these are important issues. I know the Senator from Nevada is \nhere. We had one Senator who has already had to leave to miss a vote. I \nask my colleagues just once to let us go ahead and have this vote and \nsubmit written statements for the Record.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time did the Senator from Nevada want?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, 5 minutes.\n  \n[[Page S16398]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator from Washington need?\n  Mr. GORTON. I suppose I would take about 10 minutes.\n  I think the way in which the question could be answered, I suppose, \nwould be to have the vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the leader wants to get this bill finished \ntonight.\n  Is there any reason on this side the Senators want a rollcall vote? \nCould we just agree the Senator would have 10 minutes?\n  Mr. GORTON. I think I can probably complete in that period of time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator from Nevada want 5?\n  Could we agree to vote at 6:05 p.m.?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. From this side I do not think that a vote is necessary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall vote which \nhas been ordered start at 6:05 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Can the Senator put his statement in the Record--he will not change \nthe outcome of the vote--so I can catch a 6 o'clock train and get home?\n  Mr. GORTON. I will not put my statement in the Record. I do wish to \nmake it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I was going to say, under those \ncircumstances I am perfectly willing to allow the vote to take place \nnow and make statements afterward, if that will help the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That would be wonderful, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate will proceed to vote now. And Senators can put their \nstatements in the Record or make statements after the vote.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] and \nthe Senator from Idaho Mr. [Kempthorne] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nand the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran).

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay the motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you. The bill that has just passed is \nextremely important to my State as it is to a good many States in this \nNation.\n  Mr. President, this bill funds Yucca Mountain at $400 million for \nfiscal year 1996 with $85 million set for a monitored retrieval site.\n  What does that mean? That means that to create a managed site to \nhandle high-level nuclear waste until Yucca Mountain is completed. The \nbill does not designate where this MRS would be located.\n  Under the terms of the current Nuclear Waste Disposal Act, an MRS \ncannot be placed in the same State where the permanent repository is \nlocated. This means that this Congress must act, and I hope it would \nact soon on a bill to designate a site for a monitored retrievable \nstorage.\n  This administration continues to fight a program to open a permanent \nnuclear waste repository. They ask for no money in their budget request \nand they continue to be less than helpful in getting an MRS \noperational.\n  This is a national disgrace, Mr. President. This country has spent \nover $5 billion--let me repeat, $5 billion--of electrical ratepayers' \nmoney at Yucca Mountain, and what do we have to show for it? A 1-mile \nhole in the ground. Which is a start, I have to admit but we have a \nlong way to go before an application can even be filed to begin the \nprocess of opening a repository facility.\n  I have introduced S. 1271, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995. I \nhope we could move on legislation like this.\n  Mr. President, 32 States currently generate power from nuclear \nenergy. A brief summary of a percentage of nuclear energy consumed on a \nState-by-State basis is included for the Record, Mr. President.\n  It is phenomenal to me that 82 percent of Vermont, 74 percent of \nConnecticut and 74 percent of Maine's power is generated by nuclear \nenergy. These States should be working every day to open up an MRS and \na geologic repository so their States do not have to shut down their \nnuclear power.\n  I will say they are simply years away from doing that--and not tens \nof years but a very, very short period of time.\n  It is time for this Senate to come to grips with the issue of nuclear \nwaste. The Governor of my State recently entered into an agreement with \nthe Secretary of Energy to finally remove the DOE and defense nuclear \nmaterials that are stored at the National Engineering Laboratory in \nIdaho.\n  It is imperative that we move forward with operating facilities to \nmeet the terms of that agreement which will remove all materials from \nIdaho in the year 2035.\n  Mr. President, there is a uniqueness about this agreement. It is no \nlonger just a signed piece of paper between DOE and a Governor. There \nis a Federal court order that the Department of Energy is now operating \nunder to deal with the issues of Idaho and to deal with the issues \nacross the Nation.\n  That means 10,851 shipments of spent fuel and transuranic waste will \nbe leaving Idaho. This is the first time Idaho has ever had a schedule \nfor removal. That schedule is now in place and a Federal judge says to \nDOE they must respond.\n  Mr. President, it is time that this Senate and this Congress came \ntogether in its obligation to the American people to build the \nfacilities necessary to solve this very, very important problem.\n  Some day, some ratepayer and some taxpayer is going to catch on to \nthe fact that we are simply spending money and not addressing a \nproblem. Mr. President, $5 billion, $10 billion later, one nuclear \nreactor down, the lights dark in a portion of a major city in this \ncountry because the power can no longer be supplied--that should not be \nthe answer to our problem. We should respond and we should respond in a \ntimely fashion.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for allowing me to proceed.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, before the last vote, I had the floor and \nI was asked shortly after I began my remarks under this bill to allow \nthe vote to take place so that various people can go home.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I am about to make be \nconsolidated with those I made before the vote \n\n[[Page S16399]]\n\nand be printed in the Record before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Kerry be recognized after the completion of Senator \nGorton's statement.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection heard.\n  Mr. KERRY. Could the Senator inform us how long he will anticipate \nspeaking?\n  Mr. GORTON. Approximately 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I was similarly situated with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington. Both of us agreed to forbear making a statement so the \nvote could proceed.\n  I simply want the Senator from Washington--we simply agreed to not \nmake our statement so that everybody could cast a vote, and those who \nwanted to go home went home.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator is correct, and I think that is \nfair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed after the \nSenator from Nevada has completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. How much time are we talking about here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I cannot say because it depends on--there is no way I can \nanswer that.\n  Mr. DOLE. Have you got consent to speak for more than 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KERRY. I have consent to have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no specific time.\n  Mr. DOLE. We did not go into morning business? Because we have a \nspeaker on this side who wishes to speak and I wonder how long he is \ngoing to have to wait.\n  Mr. KERRY. Maybe the majority leader and I could visit for a minute \nand see if we could work that out, Mr. President. Would that meet the \nminority leader's approval?\n  Mr. DOLE. Fine. I just do not want to start speaking here and never \nget back to this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington still controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. DOLE. Why do we not visit while the Senator from Washington \nspeaks?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Are we limiting everyone to 5 minutes?\n  Mr. DOLE. I thought we had gotten the regular, routine morning \nbusiness for 5 minutes. Apparently not.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from Washington, as I understand it, will \nspeak for more than 5 minutes. We have no objection to that.\n  Mr. GORTON. Both the Senators from Washington and Nevada are speaking \non the bill we just passed, deferring their right to speak before the \nvote in order to accommodate Members who wanted to leave.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We understand that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There have been no other time agreements or \nrestrictions.\n  Mr. DOLE. There has been no consent on who speaks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be the Senator from Washington, who \nhas the floor now, then the Senator from Nevada has been recognized to \nspeak following that, and then we had consent for Senator John Kerry of \nMassachusetts to follow.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Was my unanimous-consent agreement to have the speech \nconsolidated before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Gorton appear at an earlier point in the Record.)\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the energy and water conference report that was just \nadopted earlier this evening is correct when it concludes that the \nNation's nuclear waste policy with respect to permanent disposal is \ndeeply flawed.\n  It is a program that has cost some $5 billion, and the solution to \nthe nuclear waste issue in America is no closer to resolution today \nthan it was in 1982. The reason for that, Mr. President, is that \npolitics and not science has been a driving force. The second reason is \nbecause of unrealistic deadlines that have been constantly mandated on \nthe program that have been counterproductive.\n  Based upon some of the comments made by a number of my colleagues \nthis evening, the Nation is about ready to commit another serious error \nin nuclear waste policy as it relates to interim or short-term storage \nor, as it has been characterized by some, a monitored retrieval storage \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, we have been to that show before. In the early 1980's \nthe advocates of nuclear power, in urging upon the Congress the \nadoption of an AFR program, Away From Reactor Program, indicated that \nunless action was taken immediately, a number of nuclear reactors \naround the country would be forced to close down because of the nuclear \nwaste problem and the Nation would face an energy crisis. The Congress \ndid not respond to the request made by the nuclear power industry, and \nno nuclear reactor was closed as a consequence.\n  In the debate that is about to ensue on the interim storage issue, we \nare about ready to fall into that similar trap that was foisted upon us \nby Congress in 1987 in urging unrealistic deadlines and that science is \nto take a second place to the politics of nuclear waste.\n  I think it may be helpful, Mr. President, to respond and to go into a \nlittle of the history of the program.\n  In 1982, the Congress enacted the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. I think \nthe Congress attempted to develop a sensible policy. Its underlying \npremise is that we should search the entire country looking at various \ntypes of repositories. We would look in the New England States of \nAmerica for granite, look in the Southeast for salt domes. We would \nlook in parts of the West for a volcanic material called tuff. Those \nthree sites would be evaluated and studied--``characterized'' is the \ntechnical terminology that is used. And those three sites would be \nforwarded to the President of the United States, and the President \nwould make a decision.\n  The law also contemplated that there would be regional bounds, or \nequity; that is, no part of the country would bear the entire burden of \nthe Nation's nuclear waste disposal.\n  Mr. President, no sooner had that policy been signed into law by \nPresident Reagan in the early part of 1983, than immediately politics \nbecame a driving force. In the campaign year that ensued, candidates \nfor the Presidency asserted that, if elected--the promise was made to \nconstituents of particular States that those States would be off limits \nin terms of being considered for a nuclear waste repository.\n  Indeed, the Department of Energy itself was immersed in the politics \nof nuclear waste and in an internal memorandum concluded that New \nEngland with granite as a possible repository site would be eliminated \nbecause the politics--the politics, not the science, Mr. President--\nwould be too difficult. So one particular region of the country would \nbe written off.\n  Ultimately it was decided that a repository should not attempt to be \nsited east of the Mississippi River, not because of the science, not \nbecause of the geology, but because of the politics.\n  So I repeat, Mr. President, this is a program that has been driven \nnot by science, but by politics and with the imposition of totally \nunrealistic time lines.\n  That is not just the conclusion of the Senator from Nevada. That is \nthe conclusion of virtually every independent comment or observation. \nThe technical review committee, the General Accounting Office, and \nothers have all lamented that politics and unrealistic deadlines have \ncaused the problem.\n  Mr. President, fast forward to 1987, 5 years after the enactment of \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act. In a conference report done in the still \nof evening, without an opportunity to debate the merits of this \namendment, an addition was inserted into the conference report which \nindicated that rather than three sites being studied or characterized, \nonly one site would be studied and that site would be Yucca Mountain in \nNevada.\n  I know of no scientist worthy of that name who would assert as a \nmatter of \n\n[[Page S16400]]\n\npublic policy and good science that that was a sensible judgment. And \nyet the politics dictated that the State of Nevada, a small State with \na small congressional representation, should be targeted out as the \nsite and the only site to be characterized.\n  This was not done in the context of public policy debate. It was not \ndone where the representatives of Nevada had an opportunity to debate \nthe merits or demerits. This was done surreptitiously in a conference \nreport, and as the Members of the Chamber fully understand, that means \nthat it is impossible to debate an amendment to remove that provision \nup or down.\n  I wish I could say that that is the only tragic experience that the \nState of Nevada has had with the politics of nuclear waste. In 1992, \nthe issue before the Congress was in an energy bill. In neither the \nHouse nor the Senate was debate or consideration given, as that piece \nof legislation was processed, to a reduction of health and safety \nstandards that would apply only at Yucca Mountain.\n  Once again, Mr. President, the State of Nevada was victimized by \nhaving a provision inserted into the energy bill that had not been \ndebated, had not been considered by the Members of either House, and \nwas added to the conference report. Once again, the State was \ndisadvantaged in terms of raising legitimate public health and safety \nissues because the conference report is up or down, no opportunity to \namend.\n  The 1987 amendments are known ignominiously in Nevada as the ``screw \nNevada'' plan. The 1992 amendments are ``screw Nevada II,'' and I am \nafraid that we are about to see unfold in this Congress what might be \n``screw Nevada III.''\n  Mr. President, the State of Nevada continually seems to be focused \nwith a nuclear bull's-eye on either Yucca Mountain or the Nevada test \nsite. As in 1981 when the Away From Reactor Program was debated, again \nwe hear the hysteria beginning to mount that unless we provide for \ninterim storage, nuclear reactors will close and, indeed, regions of \nour country may be left without power.\n  Nonsense. No nuclear reactor closed in 1981 as a result of the \nfailure to adopt the AFR program. And no nuclear reactors are about \nready to close today because of the failure to provide for an interim \nstorage.\n  There are two provisions, Mr. President, that currently exist in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act that I apprehend are in danger. One is a \nmatter of fairness. One simply states that if a State is being \ncharacterized, studied, evaluated for the permanent high-level nuclear \nwaste repository, it may not be designated as an interim storage, an \nMRS, monitor retrieval storage. Nuclear waste, whatever one feels about \nthe propriety or the soundness of pursuing nuclear power, ought not to \nbe the burden of a single State. And the Congress in 1992, to effect \nsome semblance of fairness, made that point that if you are being \nconsidered for the permanent repository, you ought not to have to be \nconsidered for the interim storage.\n  Recognizing another political fact of life, a reality, the Congress \nfurther concluded that an interim storage ought not to be selected \nuntil after the permanent site is selected because of the concern that \neverybody in this Chamber fully understands, that once an interim site \nis chosen, it will de facto--de facto--become the permanent site. That \nis the state of the record.\n\n  What is involved with all of this hysteria about the need to have \nimmediately an interim storage? It is the hysteria and propaganda of a \nnuclear power industry. Current law authorizes on-site storage, called \ndry-cast storage, and a number of responsible nuclear utilities have \navailed themselves of it.\n  Not far from the Nation's Capital, I was privileged to visit such a \nnuclear reactor site in Calvert Cliffs where on-site dry-cast storage \ncurrently exists. It results in no change in the law and is available \nas a result of it having been licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission.\n  This provides a window of opportunity of approximately 100 years for \nus to deal responsibly and sensibly with the issue of nuclear waste and \nnot driven by the immediacy of the politics nor of the unrealistic \ndeadlines that are being thrust upon us.\n  I know most Members of the Chamber would assume Nevada is the only \none with a dog in this fight. That is simply not the case. Mr. \nPresident, there are 43 States that will be affected by the transfer of \nnuclear waste across the country. Some of the largest cities in the \ncountry, some of the most populous areas will be affected by some \n16,000 shipments that literally will move from every point on the \ncompass.\n  Not only do we apprehend the possibility of an accident, there are \nliterally hundreds and hundreds of derailments each year in which a \nshipment of high-level nuclear waste could be the subject of an \naccident, more recently in Hyder, AZ, as we tragically found out the \npossibility of an act of terrorism. I cannot think of a more inviting \ntarget: a train load of high-level nuclear waste en route to a major \nmetropolitan area to be targeted for an act of terrorism. As we have \nlearned in the Hyder, AZ, incident, it took but a matter of minutes and \ndid not require much sophistication to effect that tragedy.\n  Mr. President, in this Congress, we have heard a lot about State's \nrights. Most of the debates in the major pieces of legislation that we \nhave had have constantly emphasized the importance of returning to the \nStates, to abandon the notion that the Federal Government has \npreeminent wisdom on major public policy issues, to allow the States to \nmake decisions for themselves.\n  It is for that reason I find it inconsistent with that philosophy \nthat a number of my colleagues in the Chamber are suggesting that the \nFederal Government must preempt local government decisions and somehow \nformulate this policy of having an interim storage site chosen by this \nCongress and the site to be chosen is Nevada. That makes no sense to \nme, Mr. President, and I see no reason why that need be done.\n  I might also point out to my colleagues that there is a certain \nhypocrisy. A number of my colleagues have gotten up and have expressed \ntheir strong support and commitment for nuclear power. Many apprehend \nthat the industry, which is on its death bed in terms of its economic \nvitality and its prospects in the financial markets of the world, they \nbelieve passionately that locating an interim-storage site will \nregenerate interest in terms of the financial markets in the country in \nnuclear power. That is fine if they believe that. We have heard \nimpassioned pleas by the distinguished senior Senator from Louisiana.\n  Let me just say to my colleagues that those of you who believe that a \nnuclear power future is the future that you envision or contemplate for \nAmerica, and if you think that that is the kind of public policy we \nneed to adopt, volunteer your own State. Volunteer your own State. The \ncurrent law permits a State to step forward and say, ``Look, we will \nvoluntarily accept an interim site,'' and if that is what you believe \nand you are honest with your convictions and consistent with your \nconvictions and believe it is in the national interest, then go ahead \nand volunteer your own State.\n  What I take strong exception to and bitterly resent is the notion \nthat somehow only Nevada can be the solution for the interim and the \npermanent nuclear waste problem in America. I do so, Mr. President, \nbecause Nevada has not chosen to have a nuclear power future. We have \nno nuclear reactors in Nevada. We do not want nuclear reactors in \nNevada. We had no part of the decision made by many States to locate \nnuclear reactors in their own States and their own communities, and \nNevada ought not to be called upon to bear the burden of the Nation's \nhigh-level nuclear waste when it neither sought such a policy nor \nparticipated in the decision of other States to do so.\n  So, end this hypocrisy for those of my colleagues who want nuclear \npower to continue as a source of energy for America. Step forward and \ndo the responsible thing if that is what you believe: Volunteer your \nown State. You can do so, but leave my State out of that equation, \nbecause we did not buy into the nuclear bargain that you did.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor to the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16384-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16401-S16403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S16401]]\n\n\n MIDDLE EAST PEACE FACILITATION ACT AND STATE DEPARTMENT REORGANIZATION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, during the interval, I had an opportunity \nto visit with the majority leader, and I think that we have agreed to \ntry to find a way to resolve some of the impasse here. But I would just \nlike to say for the Record, and I think it is a very important \nprinciple that we need to try to set out on the Senate floor at this \ntime with the hopes that it will enable us to depart from a new point \ntomorrow with respect to the issue of the State Department \nreorganization and the reauthorization bill, S. 908.\n  There is currently a direct linkage, regrettably, between the passage \nof the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act and the arrival at an \nagreement by the managers of S. 908. I would simply like to say for the \nRecord, and I do not intend to go on at great length about this or to \ntry to create a firestorm of any kind, but I do want to say for the \nRecord that there are many, many Members on the Democratic side, and \nparticularly all of the members on the Democratic side of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, who feel very, very strongly that it is \ninappropriate to link the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act to a \nreorganization, an internal reorganization of departments of foreign \npolicy in this country.\n  One represents an internal bureaucratic decision; the other \nrepresents an agreement by the United States of America, signed by the \nPresident of the United States, to engage in a certain set of actions \nwith respect to a very volatile issue universally accepted to be one of \nthe most complicated and important to the United States and to other \ncountries in the world.\n  Our ally, Israel, does not deserve to have the peace process made \nhostage to a bureaucratic decisionmaking process in this country. My \nhope is that in order to permit us to go forward, we can be told that \nthat linkage will not exist; that that linkage is inappropriate. I \nthink the time is of the essence here, because this facilitation act \nwill expire within hours--the next 24 hours--and we have a small window \nof opportunity here to try to correct this situation.\n  I might also add, Mr. President, and I say this purely for the \npurposes of making the Record clear as to where we stand, that there \nare now 18 nominations being held up within the Foreign Relations \nCommittee; the START treaty is being held up within the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and the chemical weapons treaty is also being held \nup. Clearly, there is a lot of hostage-taking here, and while I \nunderstand completely the desire of the chairman to move in a certain \ndirection, I think it is equally important that we try to do so with \ncomity, within a collegiate atmosphere and with bipartisanship, because \nforeign policy has always been stronger when we are bipartisan.\n  Let me also say for the Record, I heard the majority leader--and I \nhad a chance to talk with him briefly now--earlier today express his \nconcern that somehow additional requests were made of Senator Helms at \na sort of subsequent, post-meeting time that somehow upset the \nnegotiating process. And I simply want to clarify, for the Record, that \nwe have had a series of meetings with Senator Helms. In fact, on \nSeptember 29, late in the evening, we entered into a unanimous-consent \nagreement which said that after the managers of the bill have agreed on \na managers' amendment, S. 908 would come back to the floor. \nSubsequently, we went to work trying to reach some kind of an \nagreement.\n\n  We had a series of meetings over a period of weeks, and during the \ncourse of those meetings, we managed to pull together a certain number \nof proposals that we made to Senator Helms, including a specific figure \nof reductions. During the course of the meeting with Senator Helms, he \nindicated that the offering of reductions was not sufficient and that, \ntherefore, there was really no room for further discussion at that \ntime. And so the meeting, Mr. President, really terminated prior to our \nhaving completed all of the issues.\n  Subsequent to that meeting, as progress was made in an offering on \nthe numbers and other issues, it became apparent that there might then \nbe more room for discussion, and so those items that were simply never \nreached during the course of that meeting were put on the table, as \nthey had been, I might add, in previous discussions.\n  I have secured from the administration a finite list of items. I have \nindicated to Senator Helms that that list will not change, and it has \nnot changed. I have indicated to Senator Helms that we have even \nscreened out a number of issues from the list that we gave him, which \nthe administration gave us, that we thought were important, but which \nmembers of the committee felt strongly that they did not want to \ndelete. So it is already a reduced list.\n  There is one final issue that the majority leader referred to which \nwe think is a fair issue for concern. As we currently stand today in \nthe Senate, a united Democratic caucus is unwilling to allow this bill \nto move for the simple reason that the caucus objects to having a one-\nsided process foisted on it, where there is not some kind of give in \nthe legislative process. And so we are concerned that, without some \nagreement about a Senate position, a Senate consensus, if you will, \nthat we arrive at to go to a conference without some assurance that the \nSenate position is the position we will try to achieve out of the \nconference, to effectively do nothing now, because it means that \nwhatever we pass here, without some assurances about where we will go \nwith respect to the Senate position in the conference, would simply \nopen the bill up to be completely rewritten in the conference. So we \nwould simply be back where we are, in a position of not having really \nfurthered the legislative process whatsoever and having forced the \nDemocratic caucus to then come back and filibuster the conference \nreport, which takes none of us anywhere.\n  So the purpose of the agreement we reached on September 29, where we \nreleased the Middle East peace facilitation program in order to arrive \nat the agreement of the managers' amendment, we said the following: We \nentered into a unanimous-consent agreement that we would turn to S. 908 \nafter the managers of the bill have agreed on a managers' amendment.\n  Now, if we have agreed on a managers' amendment, and that is the \nreason we allowed the bill to come to the floor, what would the purpose \nbe of taking that position and simply throwing it out the window as we \ngo to the conference? So we have simply asked that as we go into the \nconference, there be some agreement. We are not unwilling to change \nwhat we do; we are not unwilling to suggest that the House might not \nhave a better proposal, or that some other proposal might not be put in \nfront of us at a later time; but we believe that there ought to be a de \nminimis position that the Senate has arrived at and that, by consensus, \nwe would agree on further changes, not that changes could not be made.\n  That is not an uncommon position for the U.S. Senate to take. We \noften instruct our conferees that the position taken in the Senate will \nbe the position. We have instructed conferees that we will not recede \nfrom a certain position. Indeed, when we have had 87 or 90 votes on a \nparticular issue in the Senate, that has almost automatically dictated \nthat was the consensus position of the Senate--that we would not recede \nfrom it.\n  So we do not think we are asking for anything unreasonable, Mr. \nPresident. One of the great difficulties here is that, in the \nunanimous-consent agreement we came to with the chairman of the \ncommittee, there are only 4 hours of debate and only one amendment. If \nwe are to come to the floor with a managers' amendment and only one \namendment, and that amendment is to contemplate a full reorganization \nstructure with major reductions which would affect salaries, posts, \npost closings, and administrative capacity, we have to make sure that \nit is correct. That is not easy. We have to make sure that we have \nreally crossed the t's and dotted the i's and come to an agreement that \nwe can all understand.\n  So I say again to my friend, the chairman from North Carolina, that \nwe are prepared to sit tomorrow, but we are not prepared to sit in a \nhostage situation. We need to know that the committee business can move \nforward, and we need especially to know that this particular peace \ninitiative, which is so vital to our ability to move forward in \n\n[[Page S16402]]\n\nthe Middle East, will not be linked to this particular effort.\n  I cannot emphasize that enough. We are at a critical point in the \nMiddle East peace process. Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank town \nof Janin has just begun. The Secretary has just arrived back from Oman, \nfrom the economic summit, where the United States and Japan and Europe \nare working with countries of the Middle East to finalize the \ninitiatives for the development of the West Bank and Gaza economy. And \nwith the passage, only a week ago, of the Jerusalem initiative in the \nSenate, it is really even more important that the U.S. Senate fulfill \nits role, together with the administration, in representing the United \nStates, that we fulfill our role as a facilitator and an honest broker \nin the peace process.\n  Our policy in the Middle East has always been bipartisan, and we \nbelieve that some things should be above politics. And peace in the \nMiddle East is clearly one of them. So the delinkage, we believe, is \nextremely important, and holding a critical piece of legislation \nhostage to a proposal about how the foreign affairs bureaucracy in this \ncountry is organized, I think, undoes some of that facilitation \ncapacity and honest broker perception.\n  So it is my profound hope that tomorrow we will all make wise \ndecisions dealing with these two items and come to an agreement on a \nmanagers' amendment, which I believe is possible. I hope we will do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I question this whole idea of linkage. \nI do not think it has legitimacy. I have never seen it used to this \ndegree, or in this manner, in the 19 years that I have been in the \nSenate, and I think it is very harmful to the national interests of the \nUnited States.\n  Now all of us have bills we would like to see get enacted. There is a \nprocess one goes through in order for that to be accomplished. Senators \ncan oppose that, and of course under the rules of the Senate, if enough \nMembers are in opposition you may be required to gain 60 votes in order \nto limit debate, in order to get to the consideration of the \nlegislation.\n  Now, the reorganization plan for the foreign policy agencies of the \nGovernment is highly controversial. It has very severe and significant \nforeign policy implications. Some support it, some oppose it, some are \nin between. They support some parts of it, oppose other parts of it.\n  Many objective outside groups who deal in the foreign policy field \nare critical of one or another aspect of the proposal embraced in the \nplan put forward by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Now, that bill was not a bipartisan product out of the Foreign \nRelations Committee--just to the contrary. It has been highly \ncontroversial ever since it has been brought out of the committee, in \nmy judgment.\n  Now, that is one problem: what is to be done on the reorganization.\n  A different problem has been raised by the linkage of the \nreorganization with every other matter in the foreign policy field. \nNow, it is graphically demonstrated at this particular time because we \nhave the situation of holding up the Middle East Peace Facilitation \nAct, which expires at midnight tonight and needs to be extended.\n  Of course, failure to extend the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act \ncould cause serious harm to U.S. national interests and to the cause of \npeace in the Middle East more generally. I will not go into all the \nprovisions of the MEPFA because it is a matter that has been considered \nhere before.\n  It has been moved through by overwhelming support in the Congress. If \nthe United States fails to play its role in that process, other nations \nwill cease to play their part. Of course, the efforts to move towards \npeace will be severely hampered. It is clearly a matter of vital \nnational interest and it ought not to be held hostage.\n  Now, this is not the only hostage that is being held. In fact, the \nlist is very, very long indeed. I do not intend tonight to address all \naspects of that. I do want to make the point that in effect everything \non the Foreign Relations Committee agenda is being held hostage in the \ninsistence that capitulation be made in order to gain their way on a \nsubstantive piece of legislation.\n  The ambassadors are being held up, the START II treaty is being held \nup, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Convention on Biological \nDiversity, the Law of the Sea Treaty, more than a dozen bilateral \ninvestment treaties, mutual legal assistance treaties and extradition \ntreaties are being held up.\n  Some of these treaties may well turn out to be controversial. Others \nare not. In any event, we ought to be able to deal with them. We ought \nto have a business meeting of the committee and address them, report \nthem out, amend them, turn them down--whatever the will of the Members \nmay be on the substance of the matters that are before the Senate.\n  Now, I have seen ambassadors held up on occasion--usually one or two \nof them--but I have never seen this unprecedented situation. There are \ncurrently 18 ambassadorial nominees in the committee who have had their \nhearings and are waiting to be reported. Some have had their hearings \nas far back as early and midsummer. They have been waiting for months \nnow for movement on their confirmation. Others have their files \ncompleted and are awaiting hearings. There is also a large number of \nForeign Service officers whose promotions are being held up.\n  This situation is very disturbing for three related reasons. First, \nit is unfair to the individual nominees and their families who have \nabsolutely nothing to do with this consolidation proposal. The play of \nthe game is that the chairman and others support a certain \nconsolidation proposal, and they in effect say if we do not get our way \non it we are not going to allow any other business to be transacted. We \nwill not act on these ambassadors. We are not going to act on these \ntreaties. We are not going to act on any other matter before the \ncommittee.\n  It has been highlighted here of course because we have this pressing \nissue of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act which expires at \nmidnight tonight.\n  These nominees that are being held hostage--our Foreign Service \nofficers--are not being held hostage by foreigners; they are being held \nhostage right here in the U.S. Senate. It is very unfair to the \nindividual nominees and their families. They are being punished for \nreasons completely unrelated to their nominations.\n  Secondly, I think it is symptomatic of a very disturbing trend \ntowards disparaging and undermining the professionals in the Foreign \nService.\n  Finally, I think it is clearly contrary to the national interests of \nthe United States.\n  Now, many of these nominees have families. They have children who \nshould have started school in the places to which they are expecting to \nbe sent. They have made arrangements in their personal lives to \nundertake this responsibility and they are being taken hostage not for \nan issue that involves their nomination--that is a different matter.\n  None of this involves the nominee or the nominee's record. It is an \nissue totally unrelated to the nominee. They are being used as hostages \nin order for people to gain their way on a completely unrelated issue.\n  Now, U.S. interests also suffer, and I think suffer severely by our \nfailure to send these ambassadors out to assume their jobs. I do not \nknow that I need remind my colleagues about the danger connected with \nthis line of work.\n  The fact of the matter is in the last 25 years more ambassadors have \nlost their lives in service to their country than have generals in the \narmed services. There is an honor roll in the State Department of the \nmen and women who have lost their lives serving the Nation.\n  Not having these ambassadors out there at their posts only can hurt \nthe United States. They are not there promoting U.S. interests such as \nhuman rights, conflict resolution, antiterrorism, counternarcotics \ncooperation, encouraging U.S. exports. They are not there to assist \nU.S. tourists or business people. They are not there to deal with \nsensitive situations. They are not there to promote U.S. good will and \nto represent American values and ideals. Some of these are countries \nlike Malaysia, South Africa, Indonesia, Pakistan, China, Lebanon. \n\n[[Page S16403]]\n\n Let me just quote from a letter that was sent by the American Academy \nof Diplomacy. The American Academy of Diplomacy is chaired by the \nformer Secretary of State, Lawrence Eagleburger. Lawrence Eagleburger \nis cited by the chairman of the committee in support of his \nreorganization proposals. In fact, he testified in front of our \ncommittee in support of certain aspects of the reorganization proposal \nwhich the chairman now is trying to leverage through. He will not take \nit on its own and deal with it through the regular process. He wants to \nhold all these other things hostage to it.\n  Let me quote from the letter the Academy sent on this very issue:\n\n       The Academy has taken no position on the authorization bill \n     which is currently in contention. But it does not believe the \n     country's larger interests are served by linking action on \n     that bill to the ambassadorial nomination process. Doing so \n     would leave the United States without appropriate \n     representation in these countries at a time of dramatic, \n     historical, global change. We believe that decisions on \n     America's diplomatic representation abroad, including both \n     the timing of such action and the qualifications of those \n     nominated, should be made strictly on the basis of our \n     interests in the country involved.\n  I think that is very well put. I commend the entire letter to my \ncolleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. In addition to holding these Ambassadors hostage, the \nchairman is refusing to take action on a number of other very important \nmatters before the committee, a number of very significant treaties. We \nhave completed hearings on the START II treaty. Agreement has been \nreached on all the substantive issues relating to that treaty, but no \nbusiness meeting has been scheduled to consider it. We have not moved \non the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Convention on Biological \nDiversity, and the Law of the Sea Treaty. More than a dozen bilateral \ninvestment treaties, mutual legal assistance treaties and extradition \ntreaties are being held.\n  So, Madam President, I will not go on at greater length. It is late \ninto the evening. There are a number of other observations I would like \nto make on this ambassadorial issue because I think we are being \nterribly unfair to a lot of people, people who really put their lives \non the line and are disparaged, often, here in the Congress in the \ncourse of debate, in a very unfair way.\n  These attacks on these professionals are extremely unfair. They are \nlosing their lives. Then we are told that they wear long coats and high \nhats and live in marble palaces.\n  Ambassador Robert Frasure lost his life in Bosnia. He was not wearing \na long coat and high hat. In fact, as State Department spokesman \nNicholas Burns put it, ``he was riding in an armored personnel carrier \nand wearing a flak jacket, not striped pants.'' His wife recently wrote \na very moving letter to the editor of the Washington Post, in the \ncourse of which she said, in defense--it should never have been \nnecessary for her to have to defend--but she said:\n\n       Our diplomats are some of the finest, bravest, most \n     courageous people I have ever met. In the past 10 years \n     alone, my husband and I mourned the death of seven of our \n     friends and embassy colleagues.\n\n  She then goes on to list them.\n  She says, commenting about these remarks that have been made, about \nthe long coats and the high hats and the marble palaces:\n\n       I am outraged also because I remember the dangers as well \n     as the many hardships our family endured in Bob's 20-year \n     career.\n\n  So, Madam President, I just took the floor to challenge the \nfundamental premise of the legitimacy of this linkage. I have never \nseen it done in this manner or to anything approximating this degree. \nIt is my strongly held view that very important national interests of \nthe United States are being sacrificed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                            The American Academy of Diplomacy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Jesse A. Helms,\n     Chairman, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Academy has noted, according to \n     press reports of August 2, that following a deadlock in the \n     Senate on the State Department authorization bill, a hold \n     would be placed on 17 ambassadorial nominations and that \n     committee action was being canceled or postponed on 22 other \n     nominations subject to Senate confirmation.\n       The Academy has taken no position on the authorization bill \n     which is currently in contention. But it does not believe the \n     country's larger interests are served by linking action on \n     that bill to the ambassadorial nomination process. Doing so \n     would have the United States without appropriate \n     representation in these countries at a time of dramatic, \n     historic global change.\n       We believe that decisions on America's diplomatic \n     representation abroad, including both the riming of such \n     action and the qualifications of those nominated, should be \n     made strictly on the basis of our interest in the country \n     involved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 L. Bruce Laingen,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, \n[Mr. Kerry], and the Senator from Maryland, [Mr. Sarbanes], for their \nremarks and their thoughts. I absolutely agree it is inappropriate to \nlink MEPFA to the State Department legislation. I do not recall in the \nyears I have been in the Senate, 35, or as chairman of the committee, \nany similar action being taken.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the chairman yield on that point? When did the \nformer chairman, if I may say, the very distinguished former chairman, \ngo on the Foreign Relations Committee?\n  Mr. PELL. I think it was 1964.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So the Senator has been on it more than three decades?\n  Mr. PELL. Correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Has my colleague ever seen anything comparable to what \nis now taking place?\n  Mr. PELL. No, and that is the point that bothers me.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. PELL. I think we should deal with the question of the extension \nof MEPFA on its merits and the merits clearly lie with the quick \npassage of the short-term extension. We should not, as Senator Kerry \nnoted, trifle with the peace process for the sake of reorganizing our \nbureaucracy. We should pass MEPFA now with no linkage.\n  In this regard, I am particularly struck by the words of the Senator \nfrom Maryland. I know I am correct in saying I am the only former \nForeign Service officer in the Senate. Because the Foreign Service was \nonly created in 1926 under the Rogers Act, I think I am the only \nForeign Service officer ever to have served in the Senate. I would also \npoint out this linkage that is being created by the chairman of the \ncommittee not only sets a bad precedent, but is a linkage that should \nnever have been made in the first instance. It has not been done in the \npast and it would be a great sin to move this way now.\n  I also congratulate the Senator from Massachusetts on his handling of \nthis debate on this matter. As chairman, and now ranking member, of the \nInternational Operations Subcommittee, he has done an outstanding job.\n  I promised to limit myself to 4 minutes, and I think I have complied.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16401-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16403-S16404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LOUIS BEAULIEU\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise for just a brief moment to pay \ntribute to a friend who has passed away recently. I wanted the Senate \nto have some idea of what a great man he was.\n   Mr. President, my good friend Louis Beaulieu was born March 26, \n1924. He passed away this year on his 71st birthday, March 26, 1995.\n   Mr. President, Louis Beaulieu was not only a friend for over 15 \nyears, but a great American patriot. No, you would not recognize his \nname with the likes of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas \nPaine, but if Louis Beaulieu had lived in 1776, he would have stood \nshoulder-to-shoulder with those great Americans as they carved out a \nNation. Louis Beaulieu had the same trust in God, love of family, \npatriotic spirit, and sense of honor that characterized the Founding \nFathers that Louis admired and loved so much.\n  I want to take a few moments to share with my colleagues a little bit \nabout Louis Beaulieu's life.\n\n[[Page S16404]]\n\n  Louis lived his entire life in Newmarket, NH, and he shared his last \n46 years with his wonderful wife, and my close friend, Lois. Together \nthey had seven children, Judy, Jeanne, Janie, Joanne, Janet, Jill, and \nLouis. For those 46 years Louis also owned and operated a small \nbusiness side-by-side with Lois. ``Beaulieu and Wife Auto Towing and \nSalvage'' was the name Louis gave his business, illustrating his clever \nwit and unpretentious personality.\n  Louis left his hometown of Newmarket to serve his country during \nWorld War II in the U.S. Army. He was stationed in Bremen, Germany \nwhere he was in the counter intelligence corps as well as a French \nlanguage interpreter.\n  Louis' patriotism and sacrifice for freedom was further exemplified \nby his membership in the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign \nWars.\n  He served his community as a member of the Newmarket Lions Club and \nthe Newmarket Historical Society, and tirelessly devoted his energy to \nthe Amos Tuck Society, New Hampshire Right to Life, Gun Owners of New \nHampshire, the National Rifle Association, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the National Chamber of Commerce, and the \nPortsmouth Chamber of Commerce, and, of course, the campaigns of Bob \nSmith as Congressman and Senator.\n  Louis was a hardworking small businessman, a devoted husband and dad, \na veteran, and a dedicated community leader. Louis was also a bedrock \nconservative and was one of the first people who supported me back in \nthe early days when it was ``Bob who?'' Lois and Louis were both \nconfident that I would win a seat in Congress and bring our brand of \nyankee conservatism to the ways of Washington. Without their efforts, I \nwould not be serving here today in the Senate realizing my dream--and \ntheirs.\n  Louis did it all--he made signs, passed out brochures, raised and \ngave money, attended rallys, hosted events, and campaigned tirelessly \nfor me over the years--always with his wife, Lois, at his side. He did \nit all with humor, grace, and sincerity and he never asked for anything \nin return. He was the essence of everything good about America, and \neverything good about politics. He cared, and he worked tirelessly to \nmake America a better country. And he succeeded in doing just that.\n\n  When we lost Louis, we lost a true American patriot, and a very \nspecial man. Lois lost a devoted husband, the children lost a wonderful \nfather, and I lost one of my best friends.\n  I will miss my friend very much. Without the sacrifices that Louis \nmade on my behalf, as I said, I would not be here in the U.S. Senate.\n  I will do my best in the remaining years that I serve here to strive \nto remain worthy of the faith, trust, and confidence that Louis \nBeaulieu had in me, and I will continue to work for the same values and \nthe same principles that Louis so long espoused. In so doing, his \nlegacy will live forever.\n  Louis Beaulieu, ``thanks for the memories'', and the friendship.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a tribute written about \nLouis' wife, Lois, on the eve of his passing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      The Legacy of Louis Beaulieu\n\n                   (By Lois Beaulieu, March 25, 1995)\n\n       My Louis is a legend in his time; he left us a legacy of \n     hope, love, patience and perseverance. And he planted so may \n     seeds in us all. They will be nurtured and grow with his \n     memory and his spirit which is all around us and will live \n     forever.\n       Louis goes far and wide, deep and lasting in our memories \n     and our hearts forever.\n       Family, friends and loved ones are being cleansed and there \n     is a healing process so miraculous he would be proud.\n       He was a good husband, father and friend to all who knew \n     him.\n       Our life together was a beautiful adventure in all we did \n     together. We laughed and loved and cried but always together, \n     good and bad, mostly all good. The memories--oh so many \n     memories--he left with us all.\n       God, thank You for our 46 years together. I know we all \n     belong to You and someday You will call us home to be with \n     You and Louis.\n       Thank You God for our seven beautiful children: our Judy, \n     Jeanne, Janie, Joey, Janet, Joanne, and Jil. Our seventeen \n     grandchildren: Laura, David, James, Jason, Joshua, Javelle, \n     Jamie, Jennifer, Jeremy, Shelby, Mark, Joseph, Jayne, Manny, \n     Joel, Jacob and three great-grandchildren that Louis lived to \n     see and hold and rock: Lucas James, Sadie Anne and 3-week-old \n     Sarah Beth. Oh how he loved his family.\n       He was a proud man and so proud of his wife and told me so \n     often. So, so proud of his bag family and bragged about them \n     all the time.\n       So proud of his business, Beaulieu and Wife we built from \n     the bottom up. He was a great worker, a great lover, a great \n     father, grandfather and great grandfather and--yes--even \n     Santa Claus.\n       He was also a great friend and pal and buddy to all who \n     knew him.\n       He loved life, he loved living, he loved working, and he \n     loved his wife and family.\n       Louis loved his God and Savior Jesus Christ. He is truly a \n     legend, a one of a kind.\n       He is imbedded in our hearts forever. His spirit is alive \n     and well and we feel his presence always around us.\n       Au Revoir, my love, your wife forever and ever--until we \n     meet again--Lois.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16403-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16404-S16419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PRESIDENT STONEWALLING ON AMERICAN POW'S AND MIA'S\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I want to turn to a subject that has long \nbeen an area that I have worked on over the years, and I have come to \nthe Senate floor today to report to my colleagues and to the American \npeople on what I consider to be a very disturbing track record by the \nadministration on the issue of unaccounted for American POW's listed as \nmissing in action.\n  Many of my colleagues are well aware of the deep concern that I and \nothers have had on the POW/MIA issue as a result of some of the \nprevious debates we have had in the Senate concerning United States \npolicy toward Communist Vietnam. But I do not think some of my \ncolleagues or the American people are generally aware of the extent to \nwhich this administration is continuing to stonewall and drag its feet \nin efforts to resolve key questions on this POW/MIA issue. Although the \nadministration's rhetoric might suggest otherwise, the facts show that \nmany leads which could resolve the uncertainty of our missing are not \nbeing pursued with vigor.\n  That is a sad statement to have to make, Madam President. But it is \ntrue. And in some very important areas information is deliberately \nbeing withheld from Congress in addition to information still being \nwithheld by Communist countries abroad.\n  This is an outrage, Madam President. It is bad enough that Communist \ncountries are still withholding information about the remains of our \nservicemen after all these years. But when our own Government \ndeliberately withholds information that would shed light on this issue, \nit is especially outrageous. It is a very serious comment to say that \nour own Government is deliberately withholding information. But I am \ngoing to prove that on the floor of the Senate as I continue my \nremarks, because of the administration's actions and inactions which I \nshall explain in detail in a few moments.\n  Communist Vietnam, Communist Laos, Communist North Korea, and \nCommunist China are all being let off the hook on key questions \nregarding missing American servicemen and women.\n  As a Vietnam veteran who served this country in the United States \nNavy, and as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I find \nthe administration's track record on this issue deeply offensive. I am \ngoing to explain why. But before I do, I think it is important for \npeople to have a perspective of where I am coming from on this issue.\n  Many of my colleagues have worked on this issue in the past. Many are \nfamiliar with some of the things that I have done. I do not think I \nwould be presumptuous if I said that I considered myself to be somewhat \nof an expert on this issue. I have worked on it for 11 years. Before \ncoming to the Senate in 1991, I spent 6 years in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives where I was a member of the POW/MIA Task Force, and \nthere I worked to get access to my own Government files that they had \nin their possession to the families of the missing.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1991, I introduced legislation which \nultimately formed the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. Along with \nSenator Kerry, I cochaired an 18-month investigation by this committee \nwhich sunset at the end of the Bush administration.\n\n[[Page S16405]]\n\n  Our work has been criticized, and some of that criticism is \njustified. However, I do not think anyone would dispute the fact that \nour committee played a pivotal role in helping to open many of our \nGovernment's files on the POW/MIA's from the Vietnam war. We held \nnumerous hearings, deposed hundreds of witnesses, and learned a great \ndeal about policy decisions that were made on the POW/MIA issue at the \nend of the Vietnam war.\n  I am convinced that our work on that committee forced the Government \nof Vietnam to do more than to resolve to the issue, and, although I am \nnot convinced that Vietnam has done enough, obviously, it did move them \nand our own Government in the right direction.\n  Our committee also helped jump start the establishment of a joint \ncommission with Russia which has been researching cold war shoot-downs \nalong with the plight of the Korean war and the Vietnam war POW/MIA's.\n  I know my colleagues would agree with me that our Government owes \njust as much to the families from those wars as they do to the Vietnam \nfamilies.\n  The Korean and cold war families have been forgotten, Madam \nPresident.\n  I have traveled to Russia on two occasions to hold talks on this \nissue. I was the first United States Senator to travel to Pyongyang, \nNorth Korea, and I went there for the sole purpose of discussing POW/\nMIA's. In fact, I have been to North Korea twice to discuss this issue. \nI brought back 11 remains of our servicemen on one of these trips from \nKorea.\n  Finally, I have been to Vietnam five times in the years that I have \nbeen in Congress, and two of those trips were with Senator John Kerry \nof Massachusetts.\n  I point all of this out not to draw to attention to my efforts--I do \nnot want any attention drawn to my efforts--but to underscore that when \nthere is an attempt to dupe those of us here in the Congress by the \nadministration on information, I do not intend to be duped. I continue \nto follow this issue closely. I know what the President has done, and, \nmore importantly, I know what he has not done. And he knows that I know \nwhat he has not done.\n  When the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs sunset in January \n1993--and I might add we had to fight for the funding just to keep it \ngoing that long--we stated the following in our final report:\n\n       With this final report, the committee will cease to exist, \n     but that does not mean that our own hard work on this issue \n     will also end. To the extent that there remain questions \n     outstanding that are not adequately dealt with by the \n     Executive Branch, we will ensure that these questions are \n     pursued.\n\n  Let me now explain those issues that are not being adequately dealt \nwith by the executive branch, in my judgment. I have here a chart. This \nis a summary of several POW/MIA-related provisions from last year's \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  I want the American people to know that this act was signed into law \nby the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, on October 5, \n1994. It is the law of the land. This is not Bob Smith's opinion. This \nis not a congressional resolution. This is the law of the land signed \nOctober 5, 1994.\n  And these POW/MIA provisions that were in this bill right here, those \nprovisions had bipartisan support in this Congress. And, as you know, \nin 1994 it was the other political party who controlled the Congress. \nSo that further exemplifies the bipartisan support of this legislation.\n  When something is signed into law by the President, the \nadministration has a responsibility to adhere to it--it is the law--not \nin a manner that they deem appropriate, but in the manner prescribed in \nthe law. It is now a year later. It is October 1995, 1 year since this \nlaw, the Defense Authorization Act, went into effect. I think it is \nappropriate for us to review whether the administration has fully \ncomplied with that law.\n  Section 1031 requires the Defense Department to assist Korean war and \ncold war POW/MIA families seeking information about their loved ones. \nSpecifically, the Secretary of Defense was required to designate a \npoint of contact for these families that would assist them, the \nfamilies, in obtaining Government records on their loved ones and \nensuring that these records were rapidly declassified.\n  This past week I received the following letter from the Korean/Cold \nWar Family Association of the Missing concerning the Defense \nDepartment's compliance with this law. I want to read it into the \nRecord because it is very disturbing.\n  [Dear Senator Smith:]\n\n       In response to your letter of today's date, I shall \n     herewith attempt to answer in what manner the Defense \n     Department has complied with Section 1031 [right here] of \n     last year's National Defense Authorization Act by the \n     numbers.\n       1. Establish an official to serve as a single point of \n     contact for immediate family members of Korean/Cold War MIA/\n     POW's.\n\n  That is one of the provisions:\n\n       In October, 1994 our association began our requests from \n     the DPMO [or the office of POW/MIA's in the government] to \n     name our Single Point of Contact. Jim Wold [who heads that \n     office] insisted that as the Director of DPMO he was \n     automatically our Single Point of Contact. Once we convinced \n     Mr. Wold that it was feasibly impossible for him to act as \n     such, he agreed to appoint a suitable person. In the first \n     quarter of 1995 we were informed Dr. Angelo Collura would \n     serve as our Point of Contact along with two assistants and \n     at that time were given his phone number. Our ability to \n     reach Dr. Collura by phone has been sporadic at best. On too \n     many occasions, when we were finally able to contact Dr. \n     Collura for follow up to previous requests, Dr. Collura \n     stated he was not able to follow through on questions because \n     he was ``pulled off Korean/Cold War to work on Vietnam War.''\n       2. To have that official assist family members in locating \n     POW/MIA information and learning how to identify such \n     information. We were told explicitly that it was up to the \n     families to locate the information ourselves because 1. DPMO \n     was not tasked to do it and 2. DPMO did not have the assets \n     to do it. So obviously we have had no assistance in this. \n     When questioned on the matter, we were referred to the DPMO \n     contract with the Federal Research Division of the Library of \n     Congress. This contract was for the FRD to ``gather, copy and \n     deliver to DPMO'' documents pertaining to Korean/Cold War \n     POW/MIA held in U.S. archives and agencies. As of July, 1995 \n     20,000 pages have been gathered, copied and delivered to DPMO \n     for families to review. There has been no effort to forward \n     specific case pertinent information to the individual \n     families because no one in DPMO is tasked to do so. This \n     haphazard, certainly overly expensive, redundant method of \n     research was DPMO's intent to comply with an entirely \n     separate section of law. Do we feel assistance has been \n     provided? No.\n       3. To have that official rapidly declassify any relevant \n     documents that are located? Dr. Collura stated it was not his \n     job to declassify documents and he was getting no cooperation \n     from the section of DPMO whose job it was to declassify \n     documents. ``They are too busy with Vietnam,'' or ``DPMO can \n     get no cooperation from the agency which originated that \n     document.'' To date I know of no documents which have been \n     declassified by our Single Point of Contact.\n\n  They go on to say, in conclusion:\n\n       Can you tell me what they do other than to spend over $13 \n     million annually ignoring not only the spirit of the laws \n     passed but the very laws themselves? Surely a private \n     business, contracted for half that amount of money, could \n     comply with all the sections of the 1995 Defense \n     Authorization Act pertaining to POW/MIA's and getting \n     information to the families.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Korean/Cold War Family\n\n\n                                   Association of the Missing,\n\n                                    Coppell, TX, October 23, 1995.\n     Senator Bob Smith,\n     c/o Dino Carluccio.\n       Dear Dino: In response to your letter of today's date, I \n     shall herewith attempt to answer in what manner the Defense \n     Department has complied with Section 1031 of last year's \n     National Defense Authorization Act by the numbers.\n       1. Establish an official to serve as a single point of \n     contact for immediate family members of Korean/Cold War POW/\n     MIAs.

To date I know of no documents which have been \n     declassified by our Single Point of Contact.\n       Dino, I still do not know what our Single Point of Contact, \n     Dr. Collura does other than to be ``pulled off the Korean/\n     Cold War POW/MIAs to work on Vietnam War POW/MIAs'', but then \n     after three years of DPMO, I still do not know what DPMO \n     does. Just today I was told by DPMO that it was not a central \n     point of documentation for POW/MIAs. Can you tell me what \n     they do other than to spend over $13 million annually \n     ignoring not only the spirit of the laws passed but the very \n     laws themselves? Surely a private business, contracted for \n     half that amount of money, could comply with all the sections \n     of the 1995 Defense Authorization Act pertaining to POW/MIAs \n     and getting the information to the families.\n       Again, thank you for your assistance. Without your help, \n     the men and their families would still be in the limbo of \n     1954. Please see attached final form letter sent to all the \n     families.\n           Most sincerely,\n                                                Pat Wilson Dunton,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                 Headquarters, U.S. Air Force,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1954.\n     Mrs. Geraldine B. Wilson,\n     MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, FL.\n       Dear Mrs. Wilson: Reference is made to the letter from \n     General McCormick notifying you that the missing status of \n     your husband has been terminated. In order that you will have \n     all the information presently available to us, I would like \n     to advise you regarding the possible recovery of his remains \n     for return to the United States.\n       The truce agreement reached with the Communist forces \n     provides for certain activities in connection with the \n     recovery of remains of our honored dead from Communist-held \n     territory. It also provides that the specific procedures and \n     the time limit for the recovery operation shall be determined \n     by the Military Armistice Commission. Until the necessary \n     arrangements for the operation have been completed, we will \n     not know when recovery and return of remains can be \n     initiated.\n       I appreciate the anxiety you are experiencing, and regret \n     that no information other than that which as now been \n     furnished you is available at this time. You may be sure, \n     however, that we will notify you immediately when further \n     information becomes available.\n       If I may assist you with any unusual problems or \n     circumstances regarding the above matter, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me. Correspondence should be addressed as \n     follows, to insure prompt delivery to my office:\n       Director of Supply and Services, Attention: Mortuary \n     Branch, Headquarters, United States Air Force, Washington 25, \n     DC.\n       Please accept my sincere sympathy in the great loss you \n     have sustained.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    L.F. Carlberg,\n     Colonel, USAF.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The Secretary of Defense established the Defense Prisoner \n     of War/Missing in Action Office (DPMO) in July 1993 to \n     provide centralized management of prisoner of war/missing in \n     action (POW/MIA) affairs within the Department of Defense. \n     Creation of the office brought together four disparate DoD \n     offices that had been working in the POW/MIA arena for \n     varying amounts of time.\n       In August 1994, the Director, DPMO, on his own initiative, \n     requested an evaluation of his office by the Deputy Assistant \n     Inspector General for Program Evaluation (PED). We focused \n     our initial work on assessing the processes that provide \n     definition, direction, and structure for the organization. We \n     found that well developed processes in these areas were not \n     yet in place. Specifically, we found that: basic missions and \n     tasks were not well defined or communicated within the \n     organization; no strategic planning process was in place; and \n     the organizational structure was turbulent, poorly defined, \n     and not consistent with current policy guidance regarding \n     organizational layering.\n       After documenting these observations and providing a \n     briefing to the Director in December 1994, we redirected our \n     work to provide constructive suggestions on defining mission \n     and tasks, establishing a planning process, and structuring \n     the organization at the DPMO. The results of that work are \n     presented in this White Paper and summarized in the \n     paragraphs that follow.\n\n\n                      defining missions and tasks\n\n       In defining its missions and tasks, the DPMO faces \n     challenges posed by the broad nature of its charter, the \n     different institutional backgrounds of the office's \n     components, and the divergent nature of its internal and \n     external clients. Overcoming these obstacles first requires \n     recognition of the conflicting perspectives that clients and \n     components bring to bear on the operations of the agency. We \n     suggest putting together a specific statement of the \n     organization's purpose and translating it into some general \n     goals as a way to produce awareness of where groups differ on \n     attacking a common problem. This process can also contribute \n     to communication and help foster commitment to the goals that \n     are ultimately established. Only the members of an \n     organization can validly formulate its goals, and the process \n     should incorporate a wide range of input and discussion. \n     However, we do provide some illustrative general goals for \n     DPMO to facilitate our discussion. We recommend finalizing \n     the draft instructions on Missions and Functions as a good \n     vehicle for documenting the results of this effort.\n\n\n                           strategic planning\n\n       Carrying out the missions and tasks established by the DPMO \n     means setting up a good planning process. This involves \n     translating the established purposes into more specific \n     objectives or initiatives. Formulating these specific \n     objectives should take into account the internal and external \n     environment and attempt to identify strengths and weaknesses \n     of the organization. The process should also account for the \n     resources needed to reach the objectives and determine ways \n     to measure progress towards achieving objectives. We point \n     out the strategic planning guidelines set forth in the \n     Government Performance and Results Act and urge the DPMO to \n     adopt this model. We suggest that planning efforts should \n     start small and need not wait until full developed strategic \n     plans are in place. We also recommend that the organization \n     adopt performance measures that are simple to apply and \n     linked to the budget process.\n\n\n                       organizational structures\n\n       In our discussion of organization structure, we recommend \n     that the DPMO refrain from any ad hoc structural changes \n     until it makes a more systematic assessment of its \n     organizational needs. We analyzed three general alternative \n     ways to divide the work and the assignment of \n     responsibilities and authority in the DPMO:\n       Alternative 1: The Current Structure With Well Defined \n     Mission and Tasks.\n       Alternative 2: A matrix-type structure using task forces \n     for specified activities.\n       Alternative 3: A structure that allocates a significant \n     portion of the work load and responsibility structure by \n     geographic region.\n       Criteria we present for analyzing structures include clear \n     lines of authority and responsibility, decentralization where \n     possible, and congruence with the strategy of the \n     organization. In formulating the alternatives, we assume that \n     all current functions will remain with the DPMO. The \n     description of each alternative includes any assumptions made \n     concerning the work processes at the DPMO. We believe the \n     alternatives presented are viable alternatives for \n     consideration, in whole or in part, but only those more \n     familiar with the organization can validate our assumptions. \n     Accordingly, we make no specific recommendations on the \n     structure most appropriate for the DPMO.\n\n\n                           concluding remarks\n\n       In concluding, we recognize the difficulty in setting aside \n     time for such process building. However, in our experience, \n     without the strong leadership that such actions require, the \n     organization will continue to experience difficulty in \n     justifying its resource requirements and completing the \n     assigned mission.\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       Likes building a ship while under sail, it is not easy to \n     meld disparate organizational entities together while faced \n     with multiple operational demands. However, that is the \n     challenge faced by the DPMO Our initial research at DPMO led \n     us to conclude that the organization lacked (1) well defined \n     missions and tasks, (2) a planning system to see that major \n     goals were accomplished, and (3) a stable organizational \n     structure that supported effective management.\n       To assist the office in tackling these areas, we outlined \n     methods that we believe will help the organization define its \n     mission, establish a planning system, and structure its \n     organization. We recognize the difficulty in setting aside \n     time for such process building. However, without the strong \n     leadership that such actions require, the organization will \n     continue to experience difficulty in justifying its resource \n     requirements and completing the assigned mission.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I think the letter certainly sums it up, Madam President. \nThe bottom line is, on section 1031, did the administration comply? The \nanswer is, no, they did not comply. Not only do they not comply, they \nindicate they have no intention of complying, that they cannot comply, \nthey do not have time to comply. \n\n\n[[Page S16407]]\n\n  You have to remember, Madam President, I would point out to you, as \none who has worked very closely in constituent services as a Member of \nthe House and Senate, this is not your typical bureaucrat runaround \nwhere somebody is trying to find out what happened to some particular \nthing in the Government or trying to get to the right agency. These are \nfamilies who lost loved ones, who lost loved ones in the service of \ntheir country, and to get that kind of a runaround from people who are \ntold to comply with law is disgraceful.\n  Let me turn to section 1032. This requires the Secretary of Defense \nto recommend changes to the Missing Persons Act within 6 months; that \nis, by April 5, 1995. This is an act from the 1940's that allows the \nDefense Department to declare that servicemen who became missing in \nhostile territory are automatically dead after 1 year if no information \nsurfaces indicating who they are.\n  Senator Dole, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Lieberman and I sponsored \nlegislation to correct this. However, I wanted to allow the Secretary \nof Defense, to be fair, a chance to submit his own recommendations that \nwe could then work out and reconcile with Senator Dole's legislation \nand the Armed Services Committee. I did not try to say I had all the \nanswers. I knew we had problems. We wanted to work it out.\n  Did we get the report by the end of the 6-month period? The answer \nis, no, we did not. We did not get it until the end of June, 2 months \nlate. It was obvious the Defense Department made no serious attempts to \nconsult with Members of Congress before submitting what turned out to \nbe an inadequate report. Their delay in submitting the required report \nhas pushed back our own timetable in reviewing this matter. As a \nresult, it remains one of the outstanding issues in the current \nconference committee deliberations on the fiscal year 1996 Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  Congressman Dornan in the House has worked tirelessly to revise the \nMissing Persons Act. I want to compliment him for his work. He \nrecognizes the seriousness of this issue, especially as Congress, as we \nspeak, considers sending 25,000 American servicemen into Bosnia, and \nthe White House is leading that effort.\n  Madam President, we have memos from the Carter administration between \nPresident Carter, Secretary of Defense Howard Brown, and National \nSecurity Council staff which show in clear terms how the Missing \nPersons Act was abused, clearly abused, to satisfy other political and \nforeign policy agendas. There are always other items that move to the \nsurface and push this down. As a result, many Vietnam-era POW/MIA \nfamilies endured a great injustice as their loved ones were simply \nwritten off as dead. These memos clearly show why the law needs to be \nreformed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these memos that I have be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SMITH. To sum up on section 1032, Madam President, the record \nclearly shows that the required report was not submitted by the \nrequired date. The administration did not comply. So, again, \nregrettably the answer is ``no'' again to the law which was supposed to \nbe complied with in April 1995.\n  Section 1033 urges the Secretary of Defense to establish contact with \nthe Communist Chinese Ministry of Defense officials on Korean War \nAmerican POW's and MIA's.\n  Madam President, we have learned, through declassified CIA documents \nand through documents obtained from Russia, that the Chinese have a \nwealth of information--a wealth of information --on missing Americans \nfrom the Korean war. In fact, the North Koreans told me that when I \nvisited them in P'yongyang in 1992. They made a point of telling me. \nThey showed me books. They showed me photographs of the camps. And in \nthose photographs, in those books, were Communist Chinese guards.\n  The North Koreans said, ``Senator, we know you're here in North Korea \nlooking for information on American POW's. You ought to talk to the \nChinese because they were the ones that ran the camps. They were the \nones who packed up the American prisoners and took them across the Yalu \nRiver when General MacArthur pushed north.''\n\n  So, Madam President, section 1033 deals with just that matter that \nwas signed into law on October 5, 1994. Three weeks later, the \nSecretary of Defense--this is ironic, but 3 weeks later the Secretary \nof Defense, Dr. Perry, was dispatched to Beijing--not for this issue \nbut another issue more important, more important than this one--where \nhe held high-level meetings with, you guessed it, the Communist Chinese \nMinistry of Defense officials.\n  So when Dr. Perry returned, I was excited. The law had passed. It was \nfresh in their minds. Dr. Perry had been to Communist China meeting \nwith these officials. So I sent him a note and asked him if he raised \nthe subject of unaccounted for Americans held by the Chinese on both \nsides of the Yalu River during the Korean war. I waited. I never got an \nanswer. Several weeks later, I was informed by a low-level bureaucrat, \nmuch to my chagrin, that the subject never came up, never discussed. I \nwas hoping I could say, ``Did we get any leads on some information?'' \nThe subject never came up. In fact, as far as I know, Dr. Perry was not \neven made aware of section 1033 by his defense POW/MIA office at the \ntime. After all, we saw the letter to the families. They are not \ninterested. They are not interested.\n  More than 40 years have passed, Madam President, 40 years, and we \nstill have yet to hold any substantive discussions with the Chinese on \nmissing Americans from the Korean war. Forty years. The families wait.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I was contacted by the daughter of an American \npilot shot down over China--not Korea, China--in the 1950's. \nIntelligence indications are that the Chinese captured the pilot. He \nwas never heard from again.\n  What is President Clinton waiting for before he decides to approach \nChina on behalf of the family of this man? How many more years do they \nhave to wait before somebody simply asks the Chinese what happened to \nhim. How many more years? Is that too much to ask? When the Secretary \nof Defense goes to China for high-level talks, is it too much to ask \nthe Chinese what happened to that pilot that we know was shot down? \nThat is what the Congress recommended. That is what the Congress urged \nby passing section 1033.\n  So again I must check the ``No'' box. Again we come up short. Again \nthe President ignores the law. Again the families wait and wait and \nwait. No one cares. We do not have the assets. We do not have the \nresources. We do not have the time. We do not have the interest to be \nbothered with finding out what happened to that pilot in 1950, do we? \nToo many other important things to do, is there not?\n  This is a terrible message for the President who is about to send and \nwants to send 25,000 more Americans who wear the uniform today into \nBosnia--25,000 more Americans into Bosnia, and he cannot ask his \nSecretary of Defense to ask the Chinese if they know what happened to \nthis pilot and others. I am not holding the President to a standard he \ncannot meet. I am not asking the President to say absolutely bring him \nback alive or dead or bring back information. I am asking him to ask \nthe Chinese what happened to him. That is all I am asking.\n  Section 1034--another section of the law--requires Secretary of \nDefense to provide Congress within 45 days a complete listing by name \nof all Vietnam era POW/MIA cases where it is possible Vietnamese or Lao \nofficials can produce additional information.\n  I am going to skip this section for just a moment because it pertains \nto Vietnam, and I wish to finish covering the two sections on the \nKorean war. However, even though I am going to skip it, as you might \nexpect, we are going to check the ``No'' box here, too, because they \nhave not complied with that either.\n  This is perhaps the most disturbing affront to Congress, the Vietnam \nportion, but I will get back to that in a moment.\n  Let us go to section 1035. This ``requires two reports to Congress on \nU.S. efforts to obtain information from North Korea on POW's and MIA's.\n  ``Do the reports show any progress since October 1994?''\n\n[[Page S16408]]\n\n  We have a situation where the answer happens to be ``Yes.'' But it \nfurther requires the President to seriously consider forming a special \ncommission with North Korea to resolve the issue as recommended by the \nSenate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in 1993, and the answer to \nthat one is ``No.''\n  The remains of those soldiers that we know were in those camps buried \nin North Korea during the war, where are they? I was allowed to visit, \nwhen I went to P'yongyang, the anti-American War Museum in 1992, and I \ncaught a glimpse of their vast archives. It is obvious--obvious--that \nNorth Korea has substantial information on Americans that they shot \ndown, captured, or turned over to the Chinese or had taken from them by \nthe Chinese--room after room after room. We were allowed to see maybe \nhalf a dozen, maybe a few more, 7 or 8 rooms, in an 80- to 90-room \nmuseum full of information on Americans--Americans. It was called the \nAmerican museum. Some in our Government denied it existed, said there \nwas not any such museum. You are wasting your time to go over there and \ntry to find it. North Koreans denied it, too, but we knew where it was, \nand we got there.\n  Let me tell you something. Having served in the Vietnam war and spent \n11 years on this issue, to walk through a museum with letters from \nAmerican POW's that were sent home but never were received at home \nbecause the North Koreans intercepted them and hung them up on their \nwalls as trophies, to see photographs of dead American POW's and live \nAmerican POW's who had been tortured and suffered, to see it all as the \nNorth Koreans proudly displayed with a high-ranking North Korean \nmilitary officer on either side as I and others walked through that \nmuseum, that is tough. That is tough to have to go through.\n  You know what. As tough as it was, it is not half as tough as coming \nback here and knowing I cannot get anybody in Government who cares \nenough to go back over there and try to get answers for these families. \nThat is what is tough.\n  The key question here is, Do the reports show any progress in these \ntwo specified areas? And again the answer to that question is ``No.'' \nAnd the reports make it clear. So I think I will check the ``No'' box \nagain. There was a little ``Yes'' box here. That is the only ``Yes.'' \nIn fact, the discussions with the North Koreans have been at an impasse \nnow for a long, long time. The North Koreans want several millions from \nthe United States for remains they have already turned over. I am not \ninto that blackmail. We have done that to Vietnam now--millions of \ndollars for remains, body parts. That is blackmail. It is disgraceful. \nWe should not agree to it. That is not what I talked to the North \nKoreans about. However, it does not mean that we should not set up a \nbetter mechanism to address all of our concerns--remains, possibility \nthat somebody may be, through some heroic effort, left alive, and \ninformation, all three, as well as the North Korean concerns about \ncompensation for expenses they can justify.\n  It was interesting; a South Korean soldier after spending 43 years in \na North Korean camp came back alive about a year ago. That did not get \na lot of publicity. His picture was not in Time magazine.\n  It was O.J. Simpson's picture or some rock star's picture, but not \nthis guy.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, let me tell you something, he happened to \nbe a South Korean, but what if he had been an American? What if he had \nbeen an American? He would have been on Time magazine, would he not? \nWell, he could have been. He could have been.\n  I do not know what the President or anyone else in our Government \ntoday would have to say to that man, not a young man, not today. What \nwould you say to him when you looked him in the eye when he asked you, \n``Where had you been for the past 43 years?'' What would you say?\n  That is where the second half of section 1035 comes in. The Congress \nrequired the President to give serious consideration to forming a \nspecial commission with the North, and this is something the Senate \nSelect Committee on POW/MIA Affairs recommended in its final report. \nAll 12 Senators-- Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative--agreed \non this point.\n  Nonetheless, the administration, obviously, has not given this \nsuggestion any serious consideration, and if they had, they would have \ncontacted me to discuss what the Bush administration and I had already \nworked out and presented to the North Koreans shortly before President \nBush left office. I was very involved in those discussions and there \nhas been no followup with me whatsoever--not one word from the previous \nadministration or this administration, absolutely no interest, no \nconsideration, no interest whatsoever in what those discussions were. I \nam not a State Department official. I have no authority to negotiate. \nThese were simple discussions, but I thought they might be interested \nin knowing what we talked about and what we might be able to do as a \nresult of those discussions, but I was hoping for too much.\n  But, oh, you hear the rhetoric, though, you hear the rhetoric. How we \nworked so hard, we tried so hard, we have the POW/MIA stamp, we have \nthe ceremonies, POW/MIA recognition day, and we have these great \nspeeches about how we will never forget, ``You are not forgotten.'' \nWords, Mr. President, they are cheap. There has not been compliance \nwith the second half of section 1035. So we will just check the ``no'' \nblock there.\n  Section 1036, require public disclosure of all Defense Department \nrecords on American POW's and missing personnel from the Korean war and \nthe cold war that are in the possession of the National Archives by \nSeptember 30, 1995, 1 month ago. Our National Archives, Mr. President. \nNot the North Korean's national archives, not the Chinese, not the \nRussians, our own archives.\n  Two weeks ago, the administration reported that they had not complied \nwith this section. They need more time, Mr. President. One year was not \nenough. So Senator Kerry and I have now extended their deadline until \nJanuary 2, 1996, in the fiscal year 1996 Defense Authorization Act. We \ngave the administration 3 more months, and it remains to be seen \nwhether they are going to comply.\n  Open up the archives. Let us see what is in there. It is the Korean \nwar, over 40 years ago. Are there national security secrets in there? \nWhat is amazing about this is that Defense Department officials have \nadmitted to me--admitted--and I will not quote them, but they admit it, \nthat they did not even begin to consider whether they would be in \ncompliance with this provision until 10 months after the bill was \nsigned into law.\n  At that time, when they were asked about it by family members, then \nthey decided they might have to do something. It is not that we did not \nwarn them. In fact, after the law was signed last year, I sent a letter \nto the Department of Defense reminding them of this obligation. They \ndid not care about the deadline. It is not important. They have too \nmany more important things to do.\n  So, again, let us check the final ``no'' box, Mr. President. That is \nnot a very good record, the way I look at it. This is the law. This is \nthe law. These are not simple requests by letters. This is the law. Not \none item on there was complied with.\n  The administration, probably not a very good metaphor, basically \nthumbed its nose at the Congress and the American people and the \nfamilies and our Nation's veterans by not complying with the sanctions \nof this law. I am offended, and every single decent American should be \noffended. Every mother and father who has a son or daughter poised to \ngo into Bosnia today, sent there by this President or this Congress, \nought to be offended.\n  This is contempt for the laws of Congress, and I know a lot of laws \nget passed and I know a lot of things are difficult to comply with. God \nknows I understand that. I serve on the Armed Services Committee and I \nsympathize with so many of the regulations and laws with which they \nhave to comply. But I have reminded them over and over. I have offered \nto help. I have given them extensions. Nothing. And yet, if you read \nany manual on POW's and MIA's today, you know what it will say--try not \nto laugh, this is the highest national priority--it says in the \nhandbook, ``the highest national priority.'' If that is the highest \nnational priority, I would hate to see what is, really. The President \nclearly does not care \n\n[[Page S16409]]\n\nabout disregarding this law, and I think the American people are \nrightfully going to hold him responsible for it.\n  Let me come back to 1034, the final point on here. This is the \nsection which last year's law pertained to the Vietnam-era POW/MIA \ncases. This is the most disturbing violation of all, because it \noccurred during the same period--and this is very offensive to me \npersonally--it occurred during the same period that the President is \nshowering the Communist Government of Vietnam with full diplomatic \nrecognition and expanding the commercial contacts there. In fact, the \nState Department and our trade representatives are now coming to the \nHill to brief congressional staff on further efforts to expand the \neconomic relations, to set up the diplomatic office.\n  I have stated all along, and fought this every inch of the way and \nlost, that these initiatives are premature and that they simply amount \nto nothing more than putting profit over principle. That is what it is.\n  Section 1034 requires the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress \nwithin 45 days--this is not an unreasonable request--within 45 days a \ncomplete listing by name of all Vietnam-era POW/MIA cases where it is \npossible that Vietnamese or Lao officials can produce additional \ninformation. Not additional men, not unreasonable requests, not \nsomebody that was blown up in a fire fight that nobody saw, but POW/MIA \ncases where it is possible that Vietnamese or Lao officials can produce \nadditional information.\n  Mr. President, there are 2,170 Americans still unaccounted for from \nthe Vietnam war. We know half of them were believed to be killed in \ncombat at the time of their incident and the other half were listed as \nmissing in action--we know that--which means we did not know what \nhappened to them at the end of the war. That is what it means.\n  There has been a great debate about how many cases Vietnam really \nstill owes us answers on, how many out of these 2,170 can they \nlegitimately give us answers on. We know they cannot do it all. That \nwould be an unreasonable expectation, because in some cases, frankly, \nthey do not know what happened. There was a lot of concern about some \nof the wartime photographs that surfaced in the Vietnamese archives on \ncases where Vietnam had previously said they had no information, no \ninformation, do not know what happened to this guy and suddenly up pops \na photograph.\n  So we wanted a case-by-case assessment on this issue. Now you would \nthink that the Department of Defense would have had this information \nreadily available in some type of a database that is constantly \nupdated, if it is the highest national priority. We are trying to find \nout what happened to the 2,170 men. If we have intelligence information \nthat this or that happened, we ought to be feeding it into a database, \nwe ought to be able to pull it up and send it over here. Wrong.\n  They spend $54 million a year of the taxpayers' money working on this \nissue, and they cannot produce a simple list of 2,170 people in which \nit says on one side this guy was killed in action, here are the \nwitnesses; this guy was captured alive, he was led off, here is the \ninformation; this guy was photographed in a POW camp, never came back. \nThey cannot produce it. They cannot do it.\n  They have the information, Mr. President, because I have read it. I \nhave seen it. Do you know why they do not want to produce the list? I \nwill tell you why. Because if they produce the list, it might screw up \nthe diplomatic relations, mess up the economic gains that American \nbusinessmen are going to make by exploiting Vietnam. That is why they \ndo not want to put the list out.\n\n  How could the President of the United States--any President--proceed \nwith the normalization of relations with any country--in this case, \nVietnam--without first knowing just a simple, basic knowledge of how \nmany cases of missing American servicemen there are? If Vietnamese and \nLao officials had more information on them, based on all of our \nintelligence and investigative activity to date, how can we, in good \nconscience, move on without getting just that basic information--not \nout of the Vietnamese, Mr. President, but out of our own Government--\nwhat they have that they think the Vietnamese and the Lao have?\n  I am not saying account for every one of these men. That is not what \nI am asking for. I am asking them to give me the information on the \ncases of the men that they have in their best intelligence--perhaps a \nwitness, a buddy who saw a guy led off, whatever. Give it to us because \nwe have reason to believe that the Vietnamese would know what happened \nto these men, and we can confront them on this.\n  One example: David Hrdlicka was shot down, captured by the North \nVietnamese in Laos, photographed, filmed, used in Communist propaganda, \nparaded around. Never a word from the Lao or the Vietnamese as to what \nhappened to David Hrdlicka. Do you think they do not know what happened \nto him? Of course, they know what happened to him. But that information \nis in that list.\n  If the Government sends that list over here--our Government--that is \ngoing to be a little embarrassing, because when Carol Hrdlicka, David's \nwife, who has waited all these years, says, ``Why are you normalizing \nrelations with a country that will not even tell you what happened to \nmy husband?'' What are you going to say, Mr. President? The \nadministration has not complied with this law.\n  You have to ask yourself these questions: Why? Why? I could go over \nthere, probably in a month, with a couple of staff people and get it \nmyself. It is there. It is not that it is not there. Of course, it is \nthere. Of course, there is a database. What are they afraid of? Are \nthey covering up or sitting on information that would show the American \npeople that Vietnam is not fully cooperating on missing Americans? You \nbet. You bet. That is exactly the reason why they are not giving us the \ninformation, because it is going to show that the Vietnamese are not \nfully cooperating--are not cooperating in any way, shape, or form, to \nthe full capacity that they could.\n  If this information were released to the public, it would undermine \nall of the rhetoric from the President, the Secretary of State and \ntheir adjectives like ``splendid,'' ``superb,'' and all this \ncooperation they claim we have been receiving from Communist Vietnam. \nThat is what we have heard--not just cooperation, but ``splendid,'' \n``superb,'' ``outstanding,'' ``unprecedented.''\n  Well, boy, it would sure blow that up if the U.S. Congress and every \nstaff member for every Senator and Congressman in this place could look \nat that list. That is why we do not have the list. Hold the list up, \nignore the law until we get it all done, until we get the mission set \nup, get the full diplomatic relations set up, then let it out, but do \nnot do it now; you will sure mess it up.\n  I recall the statements by assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord \nduring his last trip to Vietnam this last May. He stated: ``We have no \nreason to believe that the Vietnamese are not making a good-faith \neffort on the POW/MIA issue.'' Well, Mr. Lord, let me just say it as \nnicely as I can: That is not the truth. That is not the truth, and you \nknow it.\n  If the President has no reason--and that is the exact word--to \nbelieve they are not cooperating, which is what he cited as the basis \nfor announcing his decision to normalize relations this past summer, \nthen where is the list? Why do you not let us see the list?\n  There will be some who will come back down here on the floor, perhaps \ntonight or tomorrow and say, ``There goes Smith again. I thought we \ncould get the war behind us; I want to get it over and move on. I am \ntired of fighting the war.''\n  Some things have to be fought. Some things have to be continued \nbecause they are right. Many of my colleagues in the 1840's and 1850's \nstood on the floor of this U.S. Senate and argued against slavery, and \nit took them a while to get it right, but they got it right, and they \nwere right when they were making those statements and having those \ndiscussions on the floor of the Senate. And we are right now to make \nthem now.\n  History will judge us as being right. History will judge us, who \nstood up and said we did not get the information, not only from the \nVietnamese and the Lao, but from our own Government. We did not get it. \nHistory will judge us as being absolutely right. I do not care \n\n[[Page S16410]]\n\nwho says what differently. History will be the judge. I will stand on \nthat judgment.\n  I want to review in more detail now exactly where we have been \nconcerning this requirement over the last year. I want my colleagues \nand the American people to see what is going on. I know this is a long \nspeech and people want to go home, but it has been a lot longer for the \npeople who have waited for answers for their loved ones, some all the \nway back into the fifties, from the cold war. So I am doing it for \nthem. No one else cares, so I am doing it for them.\n  I want everybody to know what happened over the last year. It would \nmake you sick, Mr. President, to see the obfuscation, the delay tactics \nthat have taken place. I have drawn my conclusion. I am going to be \ncriticized for this. It is a coverup; that is what it is. It is not a \ncoverup in any sense other than you got information and you will not \ngive it to us, according to the law. If you have information that the \nlaw prescribes and you will not give it to us, then you are covering it \nup. If you are not covering up, get it over here. If I get this \ninformation over here tomorrow morning, I will withdraw and retract the \ncomment about a coverup. If I do not get it, or there is some \nindication that I am going to get it quickly, I am going to assume that \nthis information is being covered up so we can get on with \nnormalization and not mess it up.\n  This information, if we get it here, will show that right up to the \npresent, despite all the comments about cooperation, the Government is \nnonetheless holding back information on several hundred--not 10, 12 or \n20--American servicemen that were lost or captured in Communist Laos \nand North Vietnam during the war. Several hundred are on that list. \nWhat is that list? That list is the best case, best information \navailable by the United States Government through intelligence sources, \nbuddies on the battlefield, copilots, back seaters, men on the ground \nas to what happened to these individuals. It is not necessarily that \nthey are alive, but that we know what happened to them, and we think \nthe Vietnamese know what happened to them. That is all we are asking \nfor. But, you see, if we publish that list, it would destroy the \nargument for normalization.\n  Do you know what people say to me? It is amazing. ``Why would a \nVietnamese hold back any information?'' First of all, I am not \ninterested in why. The first question is, are they holding back and not \ndisclosing information about the fate of our men? In the absence of \nthis list of cases, I can only conclude that the administration is \npresently engaged in a coverup of information that would answer this \nquestion in the affirmative. Pure and simple.\n  People will yank this phrase out of context. But if you put it in the \ncontext that I have said it--and I have been quoted out of context \nbefore--they are covering up in providing the information, the best-\ncase information, best available information, as to what happened to \ncertain men who are missing, in order to move forward with diplomatic \nrelations and trade. I am going to let my colleagues and the American \npeople be the judge after they see what happened, because do you know \nwhat? Sooner or later I am going to get that list, because I have seen \nit and I know it exists.\n\n  This list was required by law on November 17, 1994. As that date \napproached, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense sent a letter to \nCongress requesting a 3-month extension. He also informed us there was \nan interagency agreement within the executive branch that no revised or \nnew list would ever be produced.\n  Let me read from the letter we received at the time from the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of Defense.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The fiscal year 1995 National Defense \n     Authorization Act contained a request that the Secretary of \n     Defense report not later than 45 days to the Congress \n     specified information pertaining to the U.S. personnel \n     involved in the Vietnam conflict that remain unaccounted for.\n       This letter is to advise you the study is underway and that \n     considerable progress has been made, but it is unlikely the \n     report will be finalized by the time requested. It is \n     anticipated that the report will be finalized within 135 \n     days, at which time it will be forwarded to your committee \n     for review.\n\n  This was addressed to Senator Nunn.\n\n       The comprehensive review must be carefully constructed to \n     reinforce current and near-term negotiations. Specifically, \n     there is great potential to any new list to cause confusion \n     for the governments of Vietnam and Laos, and this concern \n     resulted in an interagency agreement that would not produce \n     any new lists.\n\n  Gobbledygook.\n  Mr. President, the law does not give the administration the luxury to \ndecide whether or not a new list would be produced. It said produce a \nlist.\n  I reminded the administration of that fact last November. I am, \nfrankly, not interested in some bureaucrat's view about causing \nconfusion for the Vietnamese. The Congress, the American people, and \nthe families are the ones who have been confused by Government \ndistortions on this issue since the end of the war. That is another \nreason we want a straightforward list in the first place.\n  Notwithstanding that, I try to be reasonable, and in spite of all the \nhardships these families try to be reasonable. A 3-month extension \nseemed OK to me, and the Armed Services Committee agreed with it.\n  I met with the Deputy Assistant Secretary in December of last year in \nmy office and told him I had no objection. Even though I did, I said I \nhad no objection to extending the deadline to February 17, 1995. I \nexpressed my amazement that such a list did not already exist. In fact, \nI still do not know how the President can look at normalizing relations \nwith Communist Vietnam without having the list of the American POW \ncases that Vietnam might be holding back on. He is not concerned about \nit. I just am absolutely aghast to think that that does not bother him, \nbecause apparently it does not or he would provide the list.\n  When the new extended deadline began to approach after the Christmas \nholidays last year, rumors started to surface that we still would not \nget the list by the new February deadline. Those rumors turned out to \nbe true.\n  On January 24, 1995, after more rumors surfaced that the President \nmight upgrade relations with Vietnam, several of my colleagues joined \nme in sending a letter to the President reminding him of his obligation \nto provide the required list. In fact, we asked him to give us the list \nbefore any decision was made to upgrade relations.\n  That sent the red flag up, so now we had to speed up the process. Let \nme just say I sent the letter. But let me tell you who else signed it. \nIt was signed by the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Senator \nHelms; it was signed by the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Thurmond; it was signed by the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, Senator Specter; signed by the chairman of the Asian Pacific \nSubcommittee, Senator Thomas; the chairwoman of the International \nOperations Subcommittee, Senator Snowe; the House chairman of the \nInternational Relations Committee, Congressman Gilman; the House \nchairman of the Asian Pacific Subcommittee Bereuter; and the House \nchairman of the National Committee on Military Personal, Congressman \nDornan.\n  The President ignored the request. He said, you will get the list \nsoon, period. This was in January 1995. January 28, he announced the \nformation of liaison offices between Vietnam and the United States in \nboth Hanoi and here in Washington. Fast track, we call it.\n  For the first time now we are allowing the Communist Vietnamese \ngovernment to establish an office here in Washington, even though \nCongress still had not provided the American people with a list, the \nWhite House had not provided Congress with a list of POW/MIA that \nVietnam might be holding back on. No list.\n  I think the administration realized their decision to upgrade \nrelations would not be viewed in a positive light if the list was \nreleased just last February. You can be the judge on that.\n  I next raised the issue with Secretary of Defense Bill Perry at a \nhearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on February 9, 1995. I \ntold Dr. Perry's staff beforehand that I would raise the question so \nthere would be no surprises. I do not play the game that way. I wanted \nhim to have a response ready so I did not catch him by surprise.\n  When I asked him at the hearing if he was going to meet the new \ndeadline by February 17, he said, ``Yes, yes.'' I immediately followed \nup that day with a letter to the Assistant Secretary of Defense.\n\n[[Page S16411]]\n\n  The following day I received a response which stated, ``The \nDepartment will respond to the legislation by February 17, 1995. Let me \nassure you our response to this Congressional requirement will be \nprovided in compliance with the law.''\n  On February 17, 1995, we received a letter from the Secretary of \nDefense which did not comply with the law. I repeat, did not comply \nwith the law. It did not provide the updated listing of cases of \nmissing Americans that Vietnam and Laos officials might have more \ninformation on.\n  I want to read an excerpt from that letter that we received from the \nSecretary of Defense which I have blown up here on a chart. This is the \nletter to Senator Thurmond, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n\n       In response to this legislation, the Department of Defense \n     has initiated a comprehensive review of each case involving \n     an American who never returned from Southeast Asia.\n\n  That sounds good.\n\n       As of February 12, 1995, nearly 50 percent of all cases \n     have been reviewed as part of this process.\n       Completion of this painstaking case-by-case review will \n     take at least several additional months, at which time these \n     findings will be reported to Congress.\n\n  Well, here we go again. We do not have a list. Several additional \nmonths--no list.\n  Is it not a little audacious for the Pentagon to talk about a request \nif a straightforward analysis--let me quote this language which really \njumps off the page, Mr. President. ``Completion of this painstaking \ncase-by-case review will take at least several additional months.''\n  Painstaking. How about the pain and the uncertainty that the families \nhave had to endure with their missing loved ones? Believe me, the \nPentagon's pain on this issue is nothing compared to the pain of the \nfamilies. I think the word is an insult. I take offense with the use of \nthat word to imply there is some analyst over in the Pentagon who is \ngoing through this whole painstaking process of putting a list \ntogether--a simple list of information they already have. I am not \nasking them to extract this from the Vietnamese and Laos but from our \nown intelligence files that we believe the Vietnamese have or the Laos \non our missing men.\n  How would you compare their pain? That must be awfully painful for \nthem, is it not, these bureaucrats going through this painstaking \nprocess?\n  What have they been doing for the last 25 years? What have they been \ndoing for the last 25 years if they do not have the information on \nthese people that are missing? My God, what are they telling the \nfamilies? How can anybody have any sympathy for anybody in this \nadministration or any other administration with that kind of analysis \non this issue?\n  Consider the roller coaster ride that the families have been on year \nafter year, decade after decade, waiting for answers. Hopes up, dashed. \nHopes up, dashed. They are the ones that have gone through the pain, \nMr. President, not these bureaucrats.\n  I am not saying that the people in there are not loyal Americans \ntrying to do a job, but we should get the job done.\n  How much more time do you need? It was clear by this past February \nthat the administration had violated the law. That is the exact \nphrase--violated the law. I sent a long letter, again, to the Secretary \nof Defense on March 7, 1995, and I expressed my disappointment that you \nviolated the law. Everybody else has to comply with the law but \napparently the President does not.\n  A month later on April 7, I received another written response from \nthe Under Secretary of Defense, Walter Slocombe, allegedly on behalf of \nDr. Perry. Let me just read an excerpt from that letter:\n\n       Section 1034's impact has been to refocus the analyst' work \n     to conduct this comprehensive review earlier than \n     anticipated. Currently, DOD has committed 22 of the 33 \n     analysts (67 percent) within DPMO and an additional 12 \n     analysts from Joint Task Force Full Accounting to working \n     full-time on the comprehensive review. To ensure the type of \n     comprehensive review of all 2,211 cases that both Congress \n     and the families demand and have a right to expect, it is \n     essential that the analysts expend the time and scrutiny \n     required to evaluate every individual's case in the light of \n     all available evidence.\n       While there will be no arbitrary deadline, I assure you \n     that DOD will continue to give this effort the utmost \n     attention. I am confident the review will be completed during \n     the summer. The department will report the results of DPMO's \n     review to Congress on its completion.\n\n  That was in April. Imagine that. The law imposes a deadline. That is \nwhat I thought, that you had to comply with the law. I am sure the \nSenator in the chair, the Senator from Missouri, when the EPA tells one \nof the communities in your State they have to comply with the Safe \nDrinking Water Act or Clean Air Act, they nail you with a fine and \nthreaten your community.\n  This law imposed a deadline, and not an unreasonable one. Yet the \nUnder Secretary of Defense says to Congress, ``There will be no \narbitrary deadline.'' In other words, ``To heck with you, Congress. Do \nnot tell me when we have to do this. We will get it when we are ready. \nThat is an arbitrary deadline.''\n  Who is he, Mr. President? Who elected him? Is he under the law? I \nguess not. The Department of Defense must be above the law. And the \nClinton administration, I guess the President himself, he must feel the \nsame way--above the law.\n  You wonder why people are cynical about politics and politicians? It \nis an affront. It is an affront to Congress. I am taking the floor \ntonight, and taking the time to work my way through this because I want \nmy colleagues to know that we have laws on the books that are being \nignored, and blatantly ignored. We are not even allowed to review our \nown Government's assessment to judge for ourselves whether Vietnam is \nfully cooperating. I am not asking for my own assessment. I am asking \nfor our Government's assessment. That is all I am asking for.\n  And then, without getting that information, my colleagues and I are \nasked to rubberstamp the President's discussion on diplomatic \nrelations. That is what we did.\n  I do not think it is going to be that easy. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider these matters the next time they are asked to vote on this \nissue. I certainly commend Senator Craig Thomas for his support in his \ncommittee. I hope it will be a long time coming before you get an \nambassador approved out of the Senate.\n  There used to be an expression as you go along through a speech \n``stay tuned, it gets worse.'' The next chart is a statement from June \n28, 1995, before Congress. This is a full 3 months after the last \nletter from Under Secretary Slocombe wherein he assured us that all his \nanalysts were working full time on these cases.\n  Three months later, in June, we still did not have the list. So, this \nis sworn testimony by Jim Wold, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for POW/MIA affairs. Here is what he said.\n\n       We must never forget, however, that the goal of achieving \n     the fullest possible accounting can only be achieved with \n     diligence and hard work. With that in mind, I launched the \n     ongoing DOD comprehensive review of all Southeast Asia cases, \n     which I hope will be completed in mid-July. This all-\n     encompassing look at every individual case will provide a \n     solid analytic assessment of the appropriate ``next steps'' \n     for achieving the fullest possible accounting. Our \n     unaccounted Americans deserve no less. I will work to ensure \n     that we keep our promise to them. Thank you.\n\n  Jim Wold is not entirely accurate or he would have said the goal will \nonly be achieved when Vietnam decides to fully open its archives and \nits prisons. Then we can say we are diligent hard workers.\n  We can ``say'' that. That is not going to resolve this matter if the \nVietnamese are deliberately withholding information, and I am going to \ndiscuss some of the information that is being withheld. There is a lot \nof heartwarming rhetoric at the end of this statement, ``Our \nunaccounted Americans deserve no less. I will work to ensure that we \nkeep our promise to them.'' That is what he said. That is real nice. \nBut the fact is the administration was supposed to work to get the job \ndone and report it to Congress under the reasonable deadline imposed by \nCongress: 45 days, not 245 days later which was mid-July or 330 days, \nas it now stands, nearly a year since the deadline. No list.\n  This information should already have been compiled and available for \npolicy makers, the Congress and the families. It has been held--it has \nbeen withheld from the American people. They have it. They can put it \ntogether. It may not be in a sheet form that you can just \n\n[[Page S16412]]\n\nsay ``Here,'' listed with the information. They can put it together and \nthey can put it together quickly. They have it. Of course they have it. \nCould they produce it? Yes. Why do they not? Because it is going to \nshow in black and white the degree to which Vietnam is sitting, as we \nspeak, on information concerning the fate of several hundred American \nservicemen. Not a few dozen like the administration likes to claim--no, \nno, no. This is an outrage. It is going to show that they have \ninformation on several hundred Americans.\n  The next chart is a copy of a letter that I sent, again to the Under \nSecretary of Defense, Mr. Slocombe, continuing to try here. This was \ndated August 18, 1995, after the President announced, in July, his \nintention to establish diplomatic relations with Communist Vietnam. You \nremember that debate. I again tried by sending another letter. My \nletter followed a similar letter from Senator Thomas in mid-July on \nthis subject, in which he has made clear his intent to withhold in his \nsubcommittee any funding for Vietnam or any ambassadorial nominee to \nHanoi until this is reviewed by Congress.\n  I commend him for having the courage to do that. He has taken \nconsiderable heat for it. I cannot possibly say how much I appreciate \nhis support. He has been steadfast on this issue as the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific \naffairs.\n  But in my August letter, without reading it all, I basically said: \nMr. Secretary, where is the list? Where is the list? Where is the list?\n  No response. No response from the August 18 letter. Not even an \nacknowledgment, despite numerous followup phone calls after this. \nSenator Thomas--no response.\n  I am told from other sources that these cases finally moved up the \npolicy ladder in the administration, but only after the President made \nhis decision to normalize, which was my point all along. Once we get \npassed that bogey, then we are home free. They did not want to get it \nin the way as the President made his decision. Apparently, staffers at \nthe National Security Council are now ``very concerned'' about \nreleasing this information because of what it shows and the way things \nare worded in the study. The word is that this assessment or study, \nwhich is now being withheld from Congress--and it is being withheld \ndeliberately --shows that Vietnam is likely withholding information on \nhundreds of POW/MIA cases.\n  I want to underscore why I am concerned about this. The fact that we \nstill have in my judgment a discrepancy of several hundred cases with \nno answers from Vietnam or Laos. To do this, I want to refer to the \ncharts, information about POW's from Vietnam that has surfaced in the \nlast 12 years from the Communist Party and intelligence archives of the \nformer Soviet Union. The Russians, to their credit--the Russians to \ntheir credit--have been very, very helpful. I am a member of the U.S.-\nRussian Commission. I met with the Russians on numerous occasions on \nthis subject.\n  For those who are not familiar with the reports about these \ndocuments, let me explain. In 1993, only a few months after President \nClinton was sworn in, the administration received from the Russian \narchives two reports that the Soviet Union, the old Soviet Union, had \ncovertly obtained from the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam war--\ncovertly obtained; a very touchy subject. These were copies of speeches \ngiven by two Vietnamese military officials to the North Vietnamese \nPolitburo in 1971 and 1972.\n  Sections of both of these speeches concern American POW's being held \nby North Vietnam, and they stated flatly that more American POW's were \nbeing held than those the Vietnamese had acknowledged. This is not our \nintelligence. This is the Soviets.\n  I might add that the numbers were larger than those that we had \nassumed.\n  Sections of both of these speeches were looked at. I might add, as I \nsaid, that these numbers were much larger than what we found in the \nParis Peace Accords in 1973.\n  That is the essence of these secret speeches before the North \nVietnamese Politburo. They had told the world that they held X number \nof POW's, but in reality they held X-plus, and they were not going to \nrelease them until we withdrew from Vietnam and paid war reparations, \nwhich we never did.\n  These are not my words. This is the document. As our select committee \nshowed in 1992, yes, we withdrew our military forces in 1975 after \nCongress had cut off the purse strings, but we did not pay the \nreparations that President Nixon had promised the Vietnamese in secret \ncommunications in February of 1973.\n  So the first Politburo report turned over was a translation of a \nwartime secret speech by North Vietnamese Gen. Tran Von Quang, who was \na former Deputy Chief of Staff of the North Vietnamese Army. In their \nreport, he stated that 1,205 Americans were being held. As I previously \npointed out, only 591 came home. So there is an obvious discrepancy. \nGeneral Quang says in the document we have 1,205; 591 came home.\n  The secret Politburo report turned over was a translation of another \nspeech given earlier in the war by the Vietnamese former Vice Minister \nfor National Defense Hoang Anh. Like General Quang, he stated that he \nhad only released a list of 368 names of Americans but that they were \nin fact holding 735. As I previously stated, that figure had gone up to \n1,205 a couple of years later when General Quang addressed the \nPolitburo.\n  These numbers are all confusing, but this is what the report says. \nThis is not a debate about what Bob Smith believes. It is not a debate \nabout that report itself. It is a debate about what this report says. \nIt says it. It is a document taken from the archives of the Soviet \nUnion. I do not know whether these numbers are accurate. I do not know. \nBut I know that General Quang said they were accurate. It was not a \npropaganda document. It was said before the Vietnamese Politburo.\n  Do you not think that President Clinton would be naive if he believed \nthe Vietnamese did not hold back the total number of Americans they had \ncaptured during the war for whatever strategic purposes they deemed \nappropriate at the time? Even former Secretary of Defense Mel Laird, to \nhis credit, had held a press conference in 1970 to say that the list \nthe Vietnamese published at the time was not complete.\n  For the record, I want to say that these two Russian documents \nsurfaced on President Clinton's watch--not on President Nixon's or Dr. \nKissinger's watch in 1973. They did not know about these documents.\n  There can be no doubt that President Clinton has to be the one to \nbear the responsibility with regard to holding the Vietnamese \naccountable in terms of explaining these Politburo reports, these \ndocuments. We cannot go back and say, ``Dr. Kissinger should have done \nsomething on these specific reports,'' because they did not know about \nthis. It is my judgment that the administration has tried to brush \nthese documents aside.\n  There will be plenty of people out there who will say, ``Oh, my, here \nis Smith again.'' This is a disservice to the Congress, and to the \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee, and to the members of our \narmed services. Instead of keeping faith with the American fighting men \nby pursuing information like this until we are certain we are doing \neverything we can to account for the missing Americans, the President \nhas broken faith.\n  What about the investigative activity of these reports? Did we look \ninto them sufficiently? In short, no. The administration has not even \nasked to meet with Hoang Anh, the author of one of these reports, even \nthough he is living in retirement in Vietnam. We are going over there \nto establish diplomatic relations, going to drill for a little oil, set \nup some airline offices, but we cannot meet with Mr. Anh. We cannot \nmeet with him, and have not met with him. There has been no credible \ntype of detailed information from the Vietnamese Government on either \nof these reports, just deny them and that they were accurate.\n  Let me concentrate on that report by Quang which went into a lot of \ndetail about the number of Americans being held. When that document \npublicly surfaced from the Soviet archives in April of 1993, the \nVietnamese put a full court press on it, believe me, to label the \ndocument a ``fabrication.'' They knew \n\n[[Page S16413]]\n\nthe President was close to lifting the trade embargo. In fact, some \nsaid it was created to squash the trade embargo. I do not know who \ncould create it. It came out of the Soviet archives. It was an \nauthentic document. It was said they were caught between a hot rock and \na hard place.\n  What do they do? They lie. They said the report was cooked up and \nfabricated by a Harvard researcher. That is where it got very \ninteresting. This was not a POW/MIA activist. This was not a nut. This \nwas a Harvard researcher who had nothing to do with MIA's. He was over \nthere doing another project. He found it. He said, ``Whoops. Holy \nmackerel. Here, this is something important.'' He tucked it away. His \nname was Stephen Morris.\n  When the Russians officially turned that document over, the Russians \nwere able to convince every reasonable scholar and analyst that this \nwas an authentic intelligence document from the GRU, the equivalent to \nour Defense Intelligence Agency. Simply put, the Russians confirmed \nwhen they turned the document over that the Vietnamese had apparently \nlied to the United States for 20 years.\n  Was there an uproar by the administration, Mr. President? No. In \nfact, the first thing they did was to classify the document secret, and \nwithhold it from the American people. ``Oh, we do not want to mess up \nthe embargo. We cannot let that out.'' But Dr. Morris released it to \nthe New York Times. Now we have a problem. So then the administration \nhad to respond.\n  I have a chart here that is a synopsis of the official comments by \nthe Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n  Let me just quickly go through this. You have to remember that this \nis an independent researcher, Dr. Morris, who finds the document in the \nSoviet archives. The Soviets say it is true, it is an accurate document \nin the sense that it is authentic. You cannot vouch for the exact \nlanguage in it. But these remarks were made by General Quang, it is an \nauthentic document out of the Soviet archives, out of the GRU \nintelligence community. So now we have a problem. This is two Communist \nnations during the war who were friends. This is an embarrassment. And \nthe Communist Vietnamese were livid because it embarrassed them. But \nthey were caught with their proverbial pants down. They had to say \nsomething. Here is what they said.\n  ``Vietnam totally denies that ill-intentioned fabrication * * *. \nRealities prove that the report * * * is completely groundless.''\n  That was in the Foreign Ministry.\n  ``General Tran Van Quang had nothing to do with the General Staff of \nthe Vietnamese People's Army,'' said the Foreign Minister.\n  ``This is a pure fabrication, and we completely reject it,'' said the \nDeputy Director of Vietnam's Office for Seeking Missing Persons.\n  ``* * * it is a forgery document. It's totally false.''\n  This is Le Van Bang, former U.N. Ambassador from Vietnam, the charge \nd'affaires in Washington, DC. He is here now.\n  ``[General Quang] was in no position to make such a report.''\n  ``It's a sheer fabrication. It's non-existent.''\n  ``The intelligence service that manufactured this report was a very \nbad intelligence service. It was absolutely wrong. Never in my life did \nI make such a report because it was not my area of responsibility * * \n*. I had nothing to do with American prisoners,'' said General Quang in \nApril 1993.\n  Did anybody from the U.S. Government, anybody from the Clinton \nadministration, meet with General Quang? You guessed it. No.\n  But I did. I did. I went over and spent a half-hour with him. He lied \nthroughout the entire discussion. The reason I know he lied is because \nI asked him questions that I knew the answer to. He gave me the wrong \nanswers to about just the basic information, about the war years, about \ninformation he had that I knew was accurate. He lied. He lied about \nthis.\n  This is when the Vietnamese really got hot.\n  ``The Russians can possibly open up their documents for you, but as \nlong as the United States side is treating the Vietnamese as `Trading \nwith the Enemy,' we cannot open our documents for this reason.''\n  That is what the Vietnamese said. He said that to me, particularly \nthe Vietnamese official in Hanoi. It is pretty revealing--that last \nquote, Mr. President, because the Vietnamese told me personally--that \nthe Russians can open their documents, but we are not going to as long \nas there is a trade embargo.\n  That is exactly what they said to me. The Russians can open them up, \nbut we are not opening them up until you get rid of the trade embargo; \nthat is, Trading With the Enemy Act.\n  Well, the President lifted the embargo 2 years ago. After he lifted \nthe embargo, we were going to have this whole raft of information which \nwas going to come sweeping out of Vietnam.\n  We were going to be just besieged with it.\n  Well, we still do not have access to their Communist Party records on \nPOW's. We had to get it through the Russians. So much for superb, \nsplendid, outstanding cooperation, Mr. President.\n  Let us look at the second chart. Let us see what the Russians had to \nsay about this document. I hope everyone is following this because we \njust saw what the Vietnamese had to say. These are the Russians. They \ndo not have any reason to be lying to us about this. This is \nembarrassing to them if anything else. It would be the equivalent of \nEngland and the United States with some agreement during the war years \nthat would embarrass one of us against the other. But here we have Dr. \nRudol'f Germanovich Pikhoya, the Chief State Archivist of the Russian \nFederation in August of this year. Here is what he said:\n\n       I am absolutely certain that the numbers--\n\n  That is the numbers of POW's.\n\n     cited by General Quang are true. I believe that the data \n     still exists in Vietnam which deals specifically with U.S. \n     POW's . . . I am absolutely positive that the 1205 figure is \n     absolutely true and correct as far as intelligence data is \n     concerned. As an archivist and someone who has analyzed a \n     great many documents, military and otherwise, I can tell you \n     that this is an absolute truth:\n\n  He has used the word ``absolute'' two or three times:\n\n       This number was announced by Quang at a closed Politburo \n     meeting.\n\n  How do Russians get information out of a closed Politburo meeting? We \ndo not need to get into that, but we all know how to get it.\n  Colonel General Ladygin, Chief, Main Intelligence Directorate of the \nGeneral Staff Ministries of Defense. That is the GRU, the intelligence \narm:\n\n       General Tran Van Quang, according to the position he held \n     in the Vietnamese military political leadership in 1972, \n     would have been fully competent in the matters stated in the \n     report and qualified to speak about them at Politburo \n     sessions of the Vietnamese Communist Party Central Committee.\n\n  Fully competent in the matter stated. They knew who he was. They were \nallies. They knew who Quang was. Of course, they knew who he was. That \nis why they were spying on him, to put it nicely.\n  Captain 1st Rank Alexander Sivets, Main Intelligence Directorate of \nthe General Staff, GRU. Listen:\n\n       I will reaffirm that the 1205 document could not have been \n     used for propaganda purposes. It was a top secret document \n     not intended for anyone outside the chambers of the \n     Vietnamese Communist Party to see . . . the document that was \n     sent to the (Soviet) Central Party Committee is, in fact, an \n     original document and not a fake. We consider that the \n     Vietnamese leaders, in their desire to exploit the POW \n     problem for their own interests, would officially cite a \n     lower figure than the real one. This is something that we do \n     not doubt . . . we believe that there were more (American \n     POWs) than Vietnam was officially admitting to.\n\n  Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, a real hero in my mind, who has worked hard \non this issue on the side of Russia to help us resolve this issue even \nthough he is very sick:\n\n       Upon the request of Senator Smith to President Yeltsin --\n\n  That was a hand-delivered letter that my wife delivered to Boris \nYeltsin, put it in his hand when he visited in America so there were no \nbureaucrats in between:\n\n       Upon the request of Senator Smith to President Yeltsin, \n     President Yeltsin ordered me to conduct additional research--\n\n  I mean we would not want anybody in the administration to give \nYeltsin anything on this so I did:\n\n[[Page S16414]]\n\n     to include in the files of the Main Intelligence Directorate \n     of the Ministry of Defense. . . I have studied exhaustively \n     the mechanism used to gather this document--\n\n  Listen carefully:\n\n       I have studied exhaustively the mechanism used to gather \n     this document, and I can state that I do not know of any case \n     where such information would have been fabricated. . . \n     (General Ladygin) has stated that General Quang was fully \n     competent to give his report.\n\n  That is a nice way of saying we collected intelligence in there. We \nare not going to tell you how we did it, but we did it.\n  Maj. Gen. Anitoliy Volkov:\n\n       The Vietnamese denied this document and said it was put \n     forth to throw cold water on U.S. relations. However, I would \n     say in response that there is an old Russian proverb--you \n     cannot change the words of a song.\n\n  Once it is a song, it is a song. When you change the words, it is a \ndifferent song, is it not, Mr. President?\n  I want to reiterate Mr. President, the Russians have told me right to \nmy face, in my office and in Moscow, that the method by which these \nreports, the Quang documents, were collected were reliable by the GRU, \nthe intelligence gathering agency. And it was a method through which \nthey acquired other significant reports during the war. In fact, they \nacquired another report by General Quang to the North Vietnamese \nPolitburo in June 1972, which has nothing to do with POW's and MIA's. \nIn that report, he talks about North Vietnam losses during the Easter \noffensive in the spring of 1992, and guess what. That information, too, \nwas all accurate. So if he was in a position to know this stuff, how \ncould it not all be accurate? No one in the administration has even \nasked him about it.\n  Let us look at what two former National Security Advisers to the \nPresident had to say about the Vietnamese Politburo report.\n  Now, this is very interesting--very interesting. This was on MacNeil/\nLehrer--Dr. Brzezinski, who was National Security Council adviser to \nPresident Carter, and Dr. Kissinger, who was the Secretary of State and \nthe National Security Adviser to President Nixon.\n  Again, following up on the same two reports:\n\n       Dr. Brzezinski, you've stated publicly, and you're quoted \n     in the New York Times as believing the document--\n\n  The 1205 document.\n\n     is genuine. What convinces you? Dr. Brzezinski, National \n     Security Adviser to President Carter, right after the war. \n     What convinces you?\n       Its style, its content, the cover note to the Soviet \n     Politburo. One would have to assume a really very complex \n     Byzantine conspiracy to reach the conclusion that this is not \n     an authentic Soviet document based on a Vietnamese document.\n\n  Then MacNeil says:\n\n       Dr. Kissinger, what do you think on the question of \n     authenticity, first of all, of the document?\n       Dr. Kissinger: I agree with Brzezinski that those parts \n     that I know something about have an authentic ring.\n\n  Remember, this document deals not just with MIA's. It dealt with a \nwhole raft of things. They have an authentic ring:\n\n       For example, when they (General Quang) described what their \n     negotiating tactics were, those were the tactics they were \n     using in negotiating with us.\n\n  Kissinger was the guy who negotiated the Paris Peace Agreement:\n\n       They say in this document that their proposals were first a \n     cease fire and overthrow of President Thieu, after which they \n     would use the prisoners to negotiate whatever other concerns \n     they had. Now, as of the date of that document, those were \n     their proposals. A month later they changed it, but I could \n     see if you make a report to the Politburo in the middle of \n     September and you want to summarize what the negotiating \n     position is. . . . \n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If that document is authentic, and it is hard to imagine \n     who would have forged it, for what purpose, then I think an \n     enormous crime has been committed, and then we should--I do \n     not see how we can proceed in normalizing relations until it \n     is fully cleared up.\n\n  Dr. Kissinger himself: ``I do not see how we can proceed with \nnormalizing relations until it is cleared up.''\n  Not only has it not been cleared up; we have not even talked to \nanybody about it.\n  Dr. Brzezinski:\n\n       As far as Vietnam is concerned, I think that if this \n     document is sustained, and it looks unfortunately to be \n     sustainable, we have the right to ask the present Vietnamese \n     government to place those responsible in war crimes trials . \n     . .\n\n  Dr. Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser.\n  Let me repeat this:\n\n       As far as Vietnam is concerned, I think that if this \n     document is sustained, and unfortunately it looks to be \n     sustainable, we have the right to ask the present Vietnamese \n     government to place those responsible in war crimes trials . \n     . .\n\n  We did not do that, did we? We just gave them diplomatic relations. \nWe are going to give them money, trade, airplane routes.\n  Dr. Kissinger:\n\n       I don't think that we can normalize relations or ease \n     conditions in international agencies until we have cleared up \n     this issue . . . I don't see how we can proceed with North \n     Vietnamese or with Vietnamese normalization until this \n     question is cleared up . . .\n\n  Well, we did. So much for the impact of two National Security Council \nadvisers, very respected, very knowledgeable, certainly more \nknowledgeable than anyone I know on this issue.\n  Let us look at what the President says, the Clinton administration \ndenials concerning the 1972 Politburo report on American POW's. This is \namazing. You heard Brzezinski, you heard Kissinger, you heard the \nRussians, the Russian intelligence. Now let us hear what our Government \nsays.\n\n       What General Quang told us is not inconsistent with what we \n     knew about him, and I have no reason to disbelieve General \n     Quang.\n\n  That is General Vessey.\n\n       I have no reason to disbelieve [him].\n       The number of U.S. POWs mentioned in the document could not \n     be correct . . .\n\n  Now, we are going to get to the CIA. Now we have to trash this thing, \nblow it up and make sure we could not possibly have any credibility \nleft because we have to normalize. We cannot let this document get in \nthe way.\n  So the CIA says:\n\n       The number of U.S. POWs mentioned in the document could not \n     be correct, they contradict what the U.S. Government knows \n     from years of research and the analysis of thousands of other \n     intelligence documents.\n\n  So, the U.S. Government, the CIA, sitting here in Washington, DC, \nknows more than the Russian intelligence, who were on the ground, \nallies, knows more than anybody else:\n\n       All previously known information and conventional \n     analytical thinking based on this information tend to refute \n     the Russian document . . . Based on historical information we \n     have amassed . . .\n\n  They do not say where they amassed it. They just amassed it. No \nproof.\n\n       We can assume that there is little evidence to support the \n     claims made in the Russian document.\n\n  If I wanted to use profanity on the floor of the Senate--and I will \nnot--there is a word for that, Mr. President. It comes from livestock \nof the male variety:\n\n       While portions of the document are plausible and some \n     portions are accurate and true, evidence in support of its \n     accuracy concerning the POWs is far outweighed by errors, \n     omissions, and propaganda which detracts from its \n     credibility.\n\n  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for POW/MIA Affairs.\n  Let us drop down to Malcolm Toon, the U.S. Chairman, Joint Commission \non POW/MIA's:\n\n       I am now prepared to accept as the best available answer to \n     this annoying problem.\n\n  It is now an annoying problem. That is a very interesting choice of \nwords, an annoying problem. Here is a guy out of the Communist archives \nof the Soviet Union, a general who was in a position to know almost \neverything about POW/MIA's, saying that they had more POW's and MIA's \nin the turnback, and now it is an annoying problem.\n  You bet your boots it is an annoying problem. If you want to \nnormalize relations with a government that held them, it sure as heck \nis an annoying problem. That is what it says, an annoying problem.\n  But this is the one here. This is Robert Destatte, Vietnam analyst, \nDefense POW/MIA Office, statement to the Russian Government in August \n1995. This is bizarre. Destatte is over there. And here is what he \nsays. He is now going to argue with the Russian intelligence. He knows \nmore about it than they do:\n\n       We have accurate knowledge of the movement of prisoners \n     through the Vietnamese prison system. We have accurate \n     knowledge of the numbers and locations of each of the \n     detention camps in North Vietnam, [not only North Vietnam] \n     South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Regarding the number of \n     1205, \n\n[[Page S16415]]\n\n     taking into consideration the Americans who are unaccounted \n     for, it's impossible to come up with the figure 1205 . . . We \n     cannot accept that figure . . . If we look at the document, \n     we know where Tran Van Quang was at the time. We also know \n     what his position was. It's highly unlikely that Tran Van \n     Quang would have presented a report on these issues to the \n     Politburo.\n\n  Listen to that. It is highly unlikely. A very clear, precise word. \n``Highly unlikely that * * * Quang would have presented a report on \nthese issues to the Politburo.'' That he would have is highly unlikely. \n``We cannot accept that figure. . .'' Baloney. They do not know what \nthey are talking about.\n  We are told that there is no way that the numbers add up; General \nQuang did not, could not, have given the report. In fact, we are told \nthere is no reason to disbelieve Quang. I think the fact that he is a \nNorth Vietnamese Communist general that waged war on American soldiers \nfor an entire decade, a Vietnamese general who waged war on American \nsoldiers for a decade, is that not enough reason not to brush this \nreport aside? Do you not think he knew what he was talking about? It \nwas not a propaganda piece. It was a document allegedly of an actual \ntranscription of what he said. He is talking to the Politburo in \nVietnam. He is not talking to the world out there trying to convince \nthem of something.\n  It is amazing that the Clinton administration is so confident on this \npoint. The Russians say it is accurate, that Quang did, in fact, give \nthis report. And the Clinton administration says there is no reason to \nbelieve Quang. It is an annoying problem.\n  I cannot imagine--I am not an attorney, but in a court of law, if you \nwere trying this case, I cannot imagine not getting a conviction that \nthis document was real. If the administration wants to talk about \nwhether the numbers make sense, let us look at the breakdown. The \nnumbers certainly are not impossible. The word was that there could not \npossibly be that many POW's.\n  Well, here they are. There are the 2,170 lost in North Vietnam, South \nVietnam, Laos, Cambodia, China. Total: 1,101. Those are missing.\n  Here are the ones KIA/BNR, another 1,000. We do not know for sure \nthat every one of them is KIA/BNR, body not recovered. So there is \ncertainly enough in the numbers. Baloney.\n  If the numbers do add up, why should the administration let Vietnam \noff the hook on these Russian documents? Why do we not at least \ninvestigate?\n  Let us take Laos as an example. We have 293 personnel missing from \nLaos; another 178 that we believe died during the war. So 293, 178, \nequals 471 in Laos.\n  In the Politburo report General Quang states:\n\n       From other categories of American servicemen in Indochina, \n     we have captured 391 people, including . . . 43 in Laos.\n\n  Well, you are talking about 471. It would seem to me that if you add \n391 and 43, you are somewhere in the vicinity of 430. And if 471 are \nmissing from Laos, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure \nout there could be 430 people that we do not have accounted for.\n  Now, let me read from the excerpts from declassified minutes of a \nWhite House situation briefing in January 1973, 4 months after Quang's \nsecret report.\n  During that White House meeting, Admiral Daniel Murphy of the \nDepartment of Defense stated:\n\n       We don't know what we will get from Laos.\n\n  We are back in 1973 now:\n\n       We don't know what we will get from Laos. We have only six \n     known prisoners in Laos, although we hope there may be 40 or \n     41.\n\n  Mr. President, that is almost the exact number referenced by General \nQuang.\n  We never got any POW's back from Laos. Not one. Not one. Nine were \nsent back by the North Vietnamese into Vietnamese prisons. Not one, \nincluding David Hrdlicka, even though he was filmed and those films \nwere sent all over the Communist world. Never got one back. Not one. \nAnd they were captured and they were held.\n  I was in Laos, flew in by helicopter, went up into the remote areas \nof the caves where Hrdlicka was held. We talked to the villagers who \nheld him. We know he was held there. He was alive. They know what \nhappened to him, too. I am not saying he is alive. I do not know that. \nMy point is they know what happened to him, and there were others \ncaptured along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and Laos by Vietnamese units and \ntaken into Vietnam. As I say, nine of them were Americans. Only nine of \nthem ever came home.\n  In our committee hearings in 1992, Larry Eagleburger had sent a memo \nto Dr. Kissinger. He was a DOD official at the time. He sent a memo to \nDr. Kissinger recommending military action to get back American POW's \nbelieved to be captured in Laos. This was at the time peace accords \nwere being negotiated.\n  President Nixon said, ``It's inconceivable that there were not more \nnames on the POW list from Laos.'' And this number, this 471, tracks \nwith what General Quang said, Mr. President. He was there. Yet, in \nspite of all this, in spite of all these comments, in spite of all this \ninformation, the President of the United States, William Jefferson \nClinton, said ``We're getting superb cooperation'' from the Vietnamese.\n  The Vietnamese have turned over one document concerning shootdowns of \nAmericans in Laos. One. One document, and that is it, even though our \nintelligence agencies believe that the Vietnamese have many more \nrecords on who they captured in Laos. We know they do. And you know \nwhat, if we get that list, we will find out that they do.\n  The Pentagon refers to that one document that we have as the ``Group \n559'' document, since the information was apparently compiled from the \nrecords of the North Vietnamese unit in Laos during the war, which was \ncalled group 559. I might say that document was provided in September \n1993, 20 years later, 2 months after my last visit to Vietnam.\n  It was during that visit I sat with the Vietnamese and went through \ndeclassified documents from our own intelligence agencies page by page \nand conclusively proved that North Vietnamese units were, in fact, in \nLaos during the war shooting down and capturing American pilots. I \nactually read it to them, the Vietnamese. They never heard these \nbefore. It was declassified, so it was perfectly appropriate to do it. \nI actually read them the radio intercepts that we had on these guys \nbeing captured. They were shocked. It was the first time anybody of the \nUnited States ever sat down with the Vietnamese and gave them graphic \nevidence and said, ``Hey, guys, I'm sorry, don't give me the line \nanymore because we have the intercepts, we know you captured these \nguys. We don't know what you did with them 20 years later, but we know \nyou captured them. So why don't you tell us? Stop the game.''\n  Not one shred of information on any of those guys. Not to me that \nyear I was there, not to anybody else after that, but it is splendid \ncooperation, Mr. President.\n  So the Vietnamese put together this summary of shootdowns in Laos. \nThey called it the group 559. They turned it over 2 months later, and \nour analysts at the Pentagon went through that summary and concluded:\n\n       The analysis of this document makes it clear that the \n     Vietnamese have additional group 559 records that may contain \n     information useful to POW resolution. This document makes \n     explicit reference to wartime documents from which \n     information was obtained.\n\n  Do we have these documents? Do we have these documents? No. But we \nare getting splendid cooperation. We are getting the oil money pumping \nover there, opening up the airline routes, get the businesses going \nbecause we are having splendid cooperation.\n  Ask the families, Mr. President, whether they think the cooperation \nhas been splendid. Ask the families if they support normalization with \nVietnam.\n  Since that summary document on Laos losses was turned over in 1993, \npractically nothing--nothing, for the most part--nothing has been \nturned over by Vietnam concerning cases of Americans lost in Laos.\n  All of these people who have come down here and railed against me on \nthis issue over the years, railed against all the things I have said, \nask them to come down here and rail about Laos. See what they know \nabout Laos. Ask them to come down on the floor of the Senate and say, \n``Yes, the Lao and Vietnamese in Laos have given us all the information \non the Lao shootdowns.'' Ask them to do that. See if anybody has the \nnerve to come down and say that.\n\n[[Page S16416]]\n\n  President Clinton has admitted as much in the 6-month overdue report \nwhich he provided to Congress on October 5, 1994. In that report, the \nPresident stated:\n\n       The Vietnamese have not turned over any major documents \n     since September 1993.\n\n  It is another year later, and they still have not done it, but we are \nmoving down the old fast track. Vietnam has done nothing credible in \nterms of releasing these records on American losses in Laos in addition \nto their high level reports on the politburo on the Russians which I \nspoke about earlier. The Russian intelligence data that we stumbled on \nby the action of a researcher named Steven Morris caught them in the \nact, and yet we have to debunk it. We have to say it is not true \nbecause if we say it is true or even indicate it might be true, we \ncannot normalize.\n  What I have tried to do is, as I have gone through this--and I must \nadmit I am getting tired, Mr. President, but I cannot be as tired as \nsome of the families are who have waited, so I am going to get through \nthis. Bear with me just a little while longer.\n  Congressman James Talent, in a hearing chaired by Robert Dornan June \n28, 1995, this is now to Gary Sydow, senior analyst, Defense, POW/MIA \nOffice, Department of Defense.\n\n       Question: Has the United States been granted access to \n     Vietnam's wartime central committee level or politburo \n     records pertaining to the subject of American POW's captured \n     during the war in Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia? Have they given \n     us access to those central committee level or politburo \n     records? Because I understand that is where these matters \n     were discussed. Does anybody know?\n\n  In other words, have they given us access to the politburo records \nGeneral Quang referred to.\n  Gary Sydow, senior analyst: ``The answer to that is no.''\n  That is the end of the statement. I have known Gary Sydow since I \nhave been in the Congress. He is a very respected analyst. He has no \nagenda. He is a good man. He is telling the truth. He told the truth \nbefore Congress. The answer to that is no. But that did not stop \nnormalization. That did not stop normalization, no. We have another \nagenda.\n  Even the administration representatives who traveled to Vietnam and \nthose who are now stationed there have done little, in my opinion, to \npress the Vietnamese for the Quang document.\n  I have to believe in most cases they are honorable men and women, but \nwhy do they not ask for the document, why do they not press for the \ninformation? That is not asking too much.\n  Last Thursday, our new Charge d'Affaires in Hanoi, Mr. Anderson, met \nwith General Quang. Again, I got excited. He is going to meet somebody \nother than me. He is actually going to talk to General Quang. He is \nstill alive. He still has this information in his head. So he is going \nto meet with him, this Mr. Anderson. So I got excited.\n  According to the press reports, the subject of the meeting was to \nthank each other for work on veterans issues, including the missing in \naction from both sides. That is what the meeting was about.\n  General Quang--they could not ask him for a more credible response on \nhis document. The issue was not even raised, as far as I know. This is \nvery disturbing in view of the fact that our new Charge d'Affaires, Mr. \nAnderson, was the State Department's representative on POW/MIA issues \nduring the interagency meetings at the end of the Carter administration \nin 1980. He served with Brzezinski. You would think he would be \ninterested in pursuing these matters now that he is at Hanoi. My office \ncalled the State Department to find out what was actually said during \nthat meeting. If the subject of the Guam report was not discussed at \nthis meeting last Thursday, I would question what the point is of \nhaving diplomatic relations with Hanoi.\n\n  If we are going to have diplomatic relations with Hanoi to get the \nanswers, why do we not ask for the answers? President Clinton said it \nwas the best way to get answers on POW/MIA's. If we are not even going \nto raise the subject--it is obvious that all we are hearing is rhetoric \nfrom the administration, and there is no real commitment to serious \nfollow-up on the issue.\n  Do you know what the sad thing is, Mr. President. I have been on the \nfloor now--I do not even know--a long time. You just wonder how many \npeople really care, other than the families and some who stay focused \non this issue. It is so sad. Earlier in my remarks, I quoted assistant \nSecretary of State Winston Lord when he stated this past may, ``We have \nno reason to believe that the Vietnamese are not making a good-faith \neffort.'' Did he talk to Mr. Sydow? If you are listening, Mr. Lord, \ntalk to Mr. Sydow. He has been around a long time. He knows a lot more \nabout the issue than you do. Read the testimony of the committee, Mr. \nLord.\n  I think it is clear, from everything I have gone through today, that \nthe American people are being misled in terms of cooperation, because \nthey are not cooperating. Are they cooperating at all? Yes. If you want \nto get into semantics, yes, sure. If we pay them several million \ndollars, we can dig around out in the crash sites, find a few teeth, a \nfew bone parts, airplane parts. Sure. That is reasonable. That is \nprogress. I am not opposed to that.\n  But that is not enough. I want the records. I want the Politburo \naccess. I hate to say this, but this administration does not want the \nAmerican people to find out what we already know about our missing \nPOW's, because it is not a pretty picture, Mr. President. If it got \nout--and it will, but it will be after the fact--it would stop \nnormalization because the American people would go crazy; they would \nyell and scream and write letters to their Congressmen and Senators, \nand they would be outraged. That is why we are not going to see this \nstuff until it is all done.\n  That is a sad thing for me to have to stand on the floor of the \nSenate and say. It is especially true when you look at this next chart \nof quotes from President Clinton himself and Vice President Gore. I do \nnot know what more you can do other than to judge people by their \nwords.\n  President Clinton, before he was sworn in as President, stated this \nbecause there was a lot of controversy about his lack of service in the \nwar, and so Vietnam was an issue in the campaign. He said:\n\n       I have sent a clear message that there will be no \n     normalization of relations with any country that is at all \n     suspected of withholding information on missing Americans.''\n\n  That was Bill Clinton prior to his assuming office as President.\n  During the campaign, he said:\n\n       I think that the Vietnamese would be making a mistake if \n     they think they could get, somehow, a better deal from me. I \n     made real commitments to the American people and to the \n     families and friends and the POWs and the MIAs that, you \n     know, we've got to have a full, complete, good accounting \n     before we normalize relations.\n\n  I am sorry to have to give you the bad news, Mr. President, but we do \nnot have a full accounting.\n  Al Gore, the Vice President, who served in Vietnam, was even \nstronger. He said, in 1993, after he took office:\n\n       I'll tell you this. The great push towards normalization of \n     relations is very strong, and a lot of other countries are \n     moving there, but it's not going to go forward until we're \n     satisfied that the Vietnamese government has been totally \n     forthcoming and fully cooperative in giving every last shred \n     of evidence that they have on this issue. We're very \n     concerned about it.\n\n  Every last shred of evidence? Oh, my. Last month, the President said \nthat normalizing relations with Vietnam is the best way to ensure \nfurther progress. Now it is ``further progress.'' You go from, ``we \nhave to get all the answers to normalize'' to ``if we normalize, we \nwill get more answers.'' It is a complete reversal, Mr. President, a \nflip-flop on a campaign promise. The American people need to understand \nthat, and so do the families have to understand that.\n  The last chart, Mr. President--and this is the last chart and the end \nof my remarks for tonight--brings it home directly. This basically is a \nbreakdown, by State, of all the missing. As far as I know, every State \nin the Union has American soldiers missing from the Vietnam war, \nincluding nine from my State of New Hampshire. I want my colleagues to \nunderstand something. These are not just statistics. Behind every one \nof those numbers--behind the nine in New Hampshire, behind the 210 in \nCalifornia, behind the 28 in Louisiana, or the 20 in Montana--is a \nfamily, a brother, sister, father, mother, wife, husband. They all \nwait. They all wait. They all wait. All these years, they wait.\n\n[[Page S16417]]\n\n  You know, in war, you lose people. People die. People get killed, \nlost. People are not found. We understand that, and so do the men and \nwomen who serve understand that, and so do their families understand \nit. But that is not what we are talking about here. We are talking \nabout sharing information that this Government has with the American \npeople, so they can make an intelligent decision, through their \nrepresentatives, about whether or not we should normalize with a \ncountry that did this to us. They have withheld this from us all these \nyears, but we have basically done that--normalized with them.\n  I could go on and on. There is a case involving an aircraft shot down \nby north Vietnamese forces in Laos 1 week after the Paris peace \naccord--just a week after the Paris peace accord, Mr. President, when \nthey all were supposedly accounted for. One week after, it was shot \ndown. At the time, there were national security agency radio \nintercepts, and based on these intercepts, the probable capture and \nmovement along the Ho Chi Minh trail of Americans by the North \nVietnamese in this incident. To show you the agony the families have to \ngo through--and I do not want to get into whether it is right or \nwrong-- now the Pentagon wants to bury the entire crew at Arlington \nbecause they found half of a tooth at the crash site in 1993.\n\n  Now, how do you explain to a family why half a tooth found at a crash \nsite could conclusively tell a family that is their loved one when we \nhad radio intercepts that these guys were taken away from the crash \nsite? How do you do that?\n  I am told this is only forensic evidence that was recovered and now \nthey want to bury the whole crew. Their names have been taken off the \nlist. That is what it is--get that list down. Even though the \nVietnamese may not have provided one shred of documentary evidence as \nto what happened to these men. They know what happened to these guys. \nThey could tell us. If they died, they know. If they were led off and \nexecuted, they know. If they died in captivity, they know.\n  What do they do? They say, go ahead, take your shovels. We will sell \nthe shovels to you, sell you the bulldozers, or lease you the \nbulldozers, give you some men at ridiculously high prices for labor, \nand we will let you go out there and dig around at the crash site when, \nin fact, we have all the information in the archives. We know what has \nhappened. That is progress. That is the cooperation we are getting.\n  It is hard for a family to have to deal with that. Imagine yourself, \na father or mother, a spouse, to have to look at that report, then be \nasked to accept a tooth at that crash site when, in fact, you have \nradio intercepts, intelligence reports that said these men were \ncaptured.\n  I do not know what is right. I do not know if the radio intercepts \nwere right or wrong but the Vietnamese know. They can tell us. They can \ntell these families so we do not have to go through this pain anymore.\n  I have a long list of other cases, and I am not going to go through \nthem. There has been no cooperation of the many requests from Congress \nfor basic information on MIA's.\n  I hope my reason for taking the time of the Senate tonight, I hope \nthat this issue might somehow, some way, hit home for each of my \ncolleagues. When you look up there in your State and you see that \nnumber, think about it. There is a family behind every single number--\nchildren, grown now, some of them, children of their own, down at the \nwall.\n  I have looked at this issue for 11 years, and I know what I am \ntalking about. I know what I am talking about. Communist Vietnam, \nCommunist Laos, Communist North Vietnam and Communist China, as God is \nmy witness, holds information on American service personnel today as I \nspeak. They hold it and they can account for them.\n  We do nothing about it except normalize and go on with business as \nusual as if everything is all right, everything is more important, and \nthen on top of that, we hide it from the Congress in violation of the \nlaw to be sure that we get it doing.\n  If we do not pursue the documents, or call into serious question the \nPresident's ill-advised decision to normalize, I am offended as a \nveteran, as a father with two sons and a daughter, any of whom could be \nsent off to Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, this is a tough issue. There is no question about it. \nIt is a tough issue. The people say to me, ``Senator, why don't you put \nthe war behind you? Why don't you end this?'' Because you have to get \nthe truth. That is all we want, is the truth.\n  We do not want something that you cannot deliver on. If the \nVietnamese cannot provide answers, then tell us why they cannot, but \nprovide us unilaterally with everything that you can. And for God's \nsake, the United States Government, in a timely fashion, please provide \nany information that you have so that the families can finally get the \npeace that they deserve after so many years.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1977.\n     Memorandum for the President.\n       I understand that at your meeting on February 11 with \n     leaders of the National League of Families, you indicated \n     that the moratorium on unsolicited status changes for MIAs \n     would continue. From our conversation before that meeting, my \n     understanding is that the Department of Defense should go \n     through all the files, getting ready to move on a program of \n     unsolicited status changes later this year depending upon the \n     outcome of negotiations with the Vietnamese.\n       Do I correctly understand your wishes?\n     Harold Brown.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    National Security Council,\n\n                                                    March 2, 1977.\n     Memorandum for Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n     From: Michel Oksenberg.\n     Subject: Letter to Carol Bates of National League of \n         Families.\n       Attached at Tab A is a reply for your signature to a letter \n     from Carol Bates (Tab B).\n       I chose a reflective reply, since we wish to sustain Ms. \n     Bates' confidence in us. We still have to cross the difficult \n     bridge with these people.\n       Recommendation: That you sign the letter at Tab A.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    National Security Council,\n\n                                                   March 15, 1977.\n     Memorandum for Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n     From: Michel Oksenberg, MD.\n     Subject: League of Families' Reaction to Presidential \n         Commission to Hanoi.\n       Signs are beginning to accumulate that many members of the \n     League of Families are distressed by the purpose of the \n     Woodcock Commission. They believe it is simply a ritualistic \n     effort to obtain an accounting, with the President already \n     having decided that he will accept whatever the Vietnamese \n     give as sufficient to justify movement toward normalization.\n       I think it important to keep the League on board for as \n     long as possible.\n       I have just talked to Carol Bates, Administrative Assistant \n     of the League. I think that she is basically a reasonable \n     person, and she indicated to me that a letter from you might \n     enable her to prevent the convening of a meeting and/or press \n     conference that would blast this effort before the Commission \n     returns home with its report.\n       Recommendation: That you sign the letter to Carol Bates at \n     Tab A.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    National Security Council,\n\n                                                   March 25, 1977.\n     Memorandum for Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n     From: Michel Oksenberg, MD.\n     Subject: Forthcoming Paris Negotiations with the Vietnamese.\n       You might wish to underscore to the President the \n     desirability of toning down expectations, should a question \n     arise at the press conference about the Paris negotiations.\n       The Vietnamese media have been vitriolic in their attacks \n     on the U.S. They have explicitly linked aid to recognition. \n     They have begun to release additional communications which \n     passed between the Nixon Administration and the DRV.\n       Among other considerations, the hardened mood makes it \n     unlikely that we will be obtaining more information on MIAs. \n     At the same time, in response to the President's request, the \n     Pentagon is forwarding recommendations on status reviews of \n     the MIAs. The Pentagon will recommend that case reviews go \n     forward, i.e., that MIAs be declared KLAs. This will place \n     the President in a difficult political position, should he \n     decide to accept the Pentagon's recommendation. He had \n     earlier pledged not to allow case reviews until adequate \n     accounting had been obtained. And he had raised public \n     expectations that the Vietnamese were going to be more \n     forthcoming on MIA information. Now it looks as if we may be \n     in a deep freeze for at least many months.\n       Placed in the broadest context, when one considers the \n     Vietnamese statements as well as Congressional votes against \n     aid to Vietnam, we see the inability of two bitter enemies \n     swiftly to place the past behind them, as the President had \n     hoped. I have drafted a Q for the President in this realm \n     which I think is appropriate for the occasion and in keeping \n     with his style. You might draw it to his attention (Tab A).\n       Recommendation: That you mention this to the President \n     before the press conference. \n\n[[Page S16418]]\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 1995.\n     Memorandum for the President.\n     Subject: Status Reviews for Servicemen Missing in Southeast \n         Asia.\n       You have asked for my recommendations concerning status \n     reviews for MIAs.\n       As you know, since mid-1973 DoD has conducted status \n     reviews only upon the written request of a missing \n     serviceman's primary next of kin or upon receipt of \n     conclusive evidence of death, such as the return of his \n     remains. The Woodcock Commission concluded (as had the House \n     Select Committee on Missing Persons in Southeast Asia, and \n     the Department of Defense) that there is no evidence that any \n     American servicemen are alive and being held against their \n     will in Southeast Asia.\n       It is true that the Southeast Asian governments probably \n     have significantly more information about our missing men \n     than they have given to us. There is no reason to believe, \n     however, that continuing to carry servicemen as missing in \n     action puts pressure on Hanoi to provide information on our \n     missing men. In fact, the opposite probably is true; it puts \n     pressure on us to make concessions to Hanoi.\n       Status reviews, and obtaining of a complete accounting, are \n     two distinct issues. An accounting that confirms death by \n     direct evidence validates a declaration or presumption of \n     death for a missing serviceman, but it is not a legal \n     prerequisite to a status change.\n       Given the overwhelming probability that none of the MIAs \n     ever will be found alive, I believe the time has come to \n     allow the Secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force to \n     exercise their responsibilities for status reviews as \n     mandated by law even though we have not received a full \n     accounting.\n       Reinstatement of reviews will of course be controversial. \n     Certain members of the Congress, some families of the missing \n     men, and others will charge that it is an abandonment of one \n     MIA.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The resumption of reviews will be preceded by (1) an \n     expression of our strong commitment to obtaining further \n     information about the missing men and (2) careful preparation \n     of concerned groups for the change of policy.\n       The decision will be discussed forthrightly with the \n     National League of Families.\n       Appropriate Senate and House leaders and key members will \n     be given advance notice.\n       The procedures for status reviews will be uniform among the \n     Military Departments, in accordance with legal requirements, \n     and announced through simultaneous letters from the Service \n     Secretaries to the PW/MIA families.\n       The public will be informed of the reasons for \n     reinstituting status reviews and assured that this does not \n     detract from our determination to obtain an accounting. (I \n     suggest that the public announcement would be most effective \n     coming from you, but I am prepared to make it instead.)\n       Your decision:\n       1. Reinstate status reviews in accordance with the \n     foregoing: Approve {time} . Disapprove {time} . Other \n     {time} .\n       2. Presidential statement to apprise public: Approve \n     {time} . Disapprove {time} . Other {time} .\n       3. Prepare for your approval a detailed plan of procedure: \n     Approve {time} . Disapprove {time} . Other {time} .\n                                                     Harold Brown.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today as the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to join with the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire in expressing my profound disappointment with the \nway the Clinton administration is managing--or more correctly, \nmismanaging--our bilateral relationship with the Socialist Republic of \nVietnam.\n  My colleagues know that I was not supportive of the President's \ndecision to normalize relations with Hanoi. This opposition was not \nbased on my dislike of that country's Communist dictatorship, or even \nits brutal repression of its own people--although in this \nadministration's view these two bases seem sufficient to continue to \ndeny recognition to Cuba and North Korea. Rather, I did not believe \nthat we should reward Vietnam with the normalization of relations when, \nin my opinion and the opinion of many of the Members of this body, \nHanoi has not been sufficiently forthcoming with information about our \ncountry's missing and dead servicemen in Vietnam and Laos.\n  I will not rehash the normalization issue; the President made that \ndecision and it serves little purpose to argue about a fait accompli. \nHowever, one of the issues that brings Senator Smith and I to the floor \ntoday are the increasing signs that this administration's has decided \nto explore expanding our bilateral relationship to the economic benefit \nof the Vietnamese Government while completely disregarding the lack of \nVietnamese progress on both the POW/MIA and human rights fronts. \nRepresentatives from the State Department and the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative were scheduled to come to the Hill this week to \nbrief our staffs on the administration's decision to move toward \nexpanding economic relations with Vietnam. Apparently, interagency \ndiscussions have been ongoing to the topic of extending loans and \nassistance to the Vietnamese through the Import-Export Bank, the Trade \nDevelopment Agency, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. \nThis at a time when POW/MIA issues remain unresolved, the Clinton \nadministration is in flagrant violation of a law requiring the \nsubmission to the Congress of a report about the POW/MIA issue, and two \nAmerican citizens remain jailed in Vietnamese prisons for advocating \ndemocracy in that country. The Senator from New Hampshire has already \nspoken forcefully to the POW/MIA issue, so I will limit my remarks to \nthe second and third topics.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton Administration continues to fail to live \nup to its legal obligations with respect to the POW/MIA issue. For \nexample, section 1034 of the act of October 5, 1994, Public Law No. \n103-337, 108 Stat. 2840, requires the Secretary of Defense to provide \nthe Congress with a complete list of missing or unaccounted for United \nStates military personnel about whom it is possible that Vietnamese and \nLaotian officials could produce information or remains. The statute \nmandated that the report be submitted to us by November 17, 1994. When \nthe DOD requested an extension of the deadline to February 17, 1995, we \ndid not object. We did not object when the DOD supplied us with a sadly \nincomplete interim report. But Mr. President, almost 9 months after \nthat date--and almost a year after it was due to be submitted--we have \nstill not received that complete report required by the statute.\n  While I acknowledge that the President has wide latitude in the \nconduct of foreign policy, that latitude does not extend whether his \nadministration abides by the legal requirements of Federal statutes. I \nand several other Senators wrote the President this summer requesting \nthat the Defense Department comply with the law; we are still awaiting \na response. Congress requested the list in order to determine for \nourselves whether Vietnam was providing the United States with the \nfullest possible accounting of our POW/MIA's. Each day that passes \nwithout it, I believe, sends us the signal that the administration is \nindifferent to both our concerns and our role. As the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over Vietnam, I can \nassure the President that as each day passes without our receipt of the \nreport, the likelihood that any ambassadorial nominee or funding \nrequest for that country will be indefinately held in my subcommittee \nincreases commensurately.\n\n  Second, I am very concerned with the seeming disparity with which the \nClinton administration has chosen to treat Vietnam's jailing of two \nAmerican citizens--Tran Quang Liem and Nguyen Tan Tri--versus its \nreaction to China's arrest of Harry Wu. I spoke at length on the floor \non September 5 about Vietnam's atrocious human rights record in \ngeneral, and the case of these two Americans in particular. In August, \na Vietnamese court sentenced Tran and Nguyen who were accused of being \ncounter-revolutionaries and acting to overthrow the people's \nadministration. The two were part of a group trying to organize a 1 day \nconference in Ho Chi Minh City to discuss human rights and democracy in \nVietnam. Radio Hanoi Voice of Vietnam, in somewhat characteristic \nCommunist rhetoric, described their ``crimes'' as follows:\n\n       Taking advantage of our party's renovation policy, they \n     used the pretext of democracy and human rights to distort the \n     truth of history, smear the Vietnamese communist party and \n     state, instigate bad elements at home, and contact hostile \n     forces abroad feverishly oppose our state in an attempt to \n     set up a people-betraying and nation-harming regime. . . . \n     Their activities posed a particular danger to society and was \n     detrimental to national security.\n\n  They were sentenced to terms of 4 and 7 years respectively.\n  When human rights activist and American citizen Harry Wu was arrested \nin the People's Republic of China this summer, the Clinton \nadministration appropriately raised a huge diplomatic outcy. When Wu \nwas jailed, public calls for his immediate release came from the \nhighest levels of the administration. It was made clear that Mrs. \nClinton would not attend the U.N. Women's Conference in Beijing if he \n\n[[Page S16419]]\n\nwas still being held, and that other high-level contacts would be \ndisrupted. In essence, the signal went out that business as usual would \nbe suspended until his release.\n  Well Mr. President, where is a similar outcry about the fate of these \ntwo Vietnamese-Americans? The only statement I have seen from the State \nDepartment so far was one announcing that they had raised this case \nwith the Vietnamese a number of times, here and in Hanoi. The \ninformation available to me and other Members of the Senate, however, \nindicated that the issue was only being raised at the consular level. \nIt was for that reason that Senator Grams introduced, and I \ncosponsored, Senate Resolution 174 calling on the Secretary of State to \npursue their release as a matter of the highest priority and requesting \nthat he keep the Foreign Relations Committee informed regarding their \nstatus. Senate Resolution 174 passed unanimously on September 19, yet \nsince that time the administration gives the appearance of moving ahead \nwith business as usual. I have seen no public statements by the \nSecretary regarding the case, and as the chairman of the subcommittee \nof jurisdiction I have not seen any reports on its status. While I have \nbecome aware that there have been some behind-the-scenes moves to \nsecure their release, it is no thanks to the State Department that that \ninformation came to my attention.\n  During his campaign for President, then-candidate Clinton lambasted \nPresident Bush's relations with China--not dissimilar, I must note, \nfrom those Clinton himself has since adopted--and accused him of \ncoddling dictators. Well, Mr. President, with movement toward increased \neconomic aid in spite of the treatment of our citizens, in spite of \nVietnam's horrendous human rights record, one might be tempted to ask \nwho's doing the coddling now?\n  I have no strong objection to the eventual institution of full \ndiplomatic and economic relations with the people of Vietnam. But to \nmove toward that goal while we have these important issues outstanding \nis, I believe, an affront to the memories of our missing and killed \nAmerican servicemen, their families, and the families of the two jailed \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16404-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16419-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16419-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE NOTICE OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE IRAN EMERGENCY--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 90\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Iran emergency is to continue in \neffect beyond November 14, 1995, to the Federal Register for \npublication. Similar notices have been sent annually to the Congress \nand the Federal Register since November 12, 1980. The most recent \nnotice appeared in the Federal Register on November 1, 1994.\n  The crisis between the United States and Iran that began in 1979 has \nnot been fully resolved. The international tribunal established to \nadjudicate claims of the United States and U.S. nationals against Iran \nand of the Iranian government and Iranian nationals against the United \nStates continues to function, and normalization of commercial and \ndiplomatic relations between the United States and Iran has not been \nachieved. Indeed, on March 15 of this year, I declared a separate \nnational emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act and imposed separate sanctions. By \nExecutive Order 12959, these sanctions were significantly augmented. In \nthese circumstances, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain \nin force the broad authorities that are in place by virtue of the \nNovember 14, 1979, declaration of emergency, including the authority to \nblock certain property of the Government of Iran, and which are needed \nin the process of implementing the January 1981 agreements with Iran.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nfacilitate the development, approval, and use of medical devices to \nmaintain and improve the public health and quality of life of \nindividuals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resource.\n\n\n   the medical technology, public health, and innovation act of 1995\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwould take a significant and responsible step toward improving the \neffectiveness, timeliness, and predictability of the FDA review process \nfor medical devices.\n  Over the past 9 months, I have met with numerous representatives of \nMinnesota's medical device industry, patient advocacy groups, \nclinicians, and officials at the FDA and have concluded that there are \nindeed steps that Congress should take to make the regulatory process \nfor medical devices more efficient. Minnesotans want the FDA not only \nto protect public health, but also to promote public health. They want \nto know not only that new technologies will be safe, but that they will \nbe available to them in a timely manner. Many of Minnesota's medical \ndevice manufacturers, researchers, clinicians, and patients in need of \nnew and improved health care technology have become increasingly \nconcerned about the regulatory environment at the FDA.\n  Two weeks ago I visited SpineTech, which is a perfect example of \nMinnesota's burgeoning, world-famous medical device industry. It was \nformed in 1991 with 4 people, funded by venture capital, and it now \nemploys more than 40 people. It manufacturers a breakthrough disc \nreplacement technology which has been studied in clinical trials for 3 \nyears. The technology, used for individuals with chronic low-back pain, \nhas been shown to result in shorter hospital stays, less invasive \nsurgery and lower medical costs than the alternative therapy.\n  SpineTech filed its premarket approval application in January of this \nyear. The application has not yet been accepted by the FDA and thus the \npremarket approval process has not yet even officially begun. The \naverage total elapsed time for FDA review of PMA applications is now \nabout 823 days. The technology has been available in every other \nadvanced industrialized country for the past 2 years.\n  The technologies that the FDA regulates are changing rapidly. We \ncannot afford a regulatory system ill-equipped to speed these advances. \nAs a result, both Congress and the administration are reexamining the \nparadigms that have governed the FDA. Our challenge will be to define \nFDA's mission and scope of responsibility, as well as to give guidance \non an appropriate balance between the risk and rewards of streamlining \nall aspects of how FDA does its job--including the approval process for \nbreakthrough products.\n  The legislation that I will be introducing would begin to address \nthese objectives in three important ways.\n  First, it would enable the FDA to adopt nationally \nand internationally recognized performance standards to improve the \ntransparency and effectiveness of the device review process and promote \nglobal harmonization and interantional trade. Resource constraints and \nthe time-consuming rulemaking process have precluded FDA promulgation \nof performance standards in the past. This legislation would allow the \nFDA, when appropriate, to simply adopt consensus standards that are \nalready being used by most of the world and use those standards to \nassist in determining the safety and effectiveness of class III medical \ndevices. The FDA could require additional data from a manufacturer \nrelevant to an aspect of a device covered by an adopted performance \nstandard if necessary to protect patient safety. Currently, the lack of \nclear performance standards for class III medical devices is a barrier \nto the improvement of the quality and timeliness of the premarket \napproval process.\n\n  Second, it would improve communication between the industry and the \nFDA and the predictability of the review process. I believe that these \ntwo factors are so important that I have even included what would \nusually be management decisions in the legislation. This bill includes \nprovisions for periodic meetings betwen the applicant and the FDA to \nensure that applicants are promptly informed of any deficiencies in \ntheir application, that questions that can be answered easily would be \naddressed right away, and that applicants would be well-informed about \nthe status of their application. I believe that improving communication \nbetween the FDA and industry would result in greater compliance with \nregulations and that this will ultimately benefit consumers and \npatients.\n  Third, the legislation would help the FDA focus its resources more \nappropriately. PMA supplements or 510(k)s that relate only to changes \nthat can be shown to not adversely affect the safety or effectiveness \nof the device would not require premarket approval or notification. \nManufacturers would instead make information and data supporting the \nchange part of the device master record at the FDA. In addition, the \nFDA would be able to exempt from premarket notification requirements \nthose class II devices for which such requirements are unnecessary to \nensure the public health without first having to go through the time \nconsuming and bureaucratic process of reclassifying them to class I. \nEnabling the FDA to focus its attention where the real risks are will \nnot only streamline the approval process but also benefit consumers and \npatients.\n  Finally, I want to be clear that this legislation is a work in \nprogress. I look forward to working with Senator Kassebaum, the \nchairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and my colleagues \non the committee on the concepts included in my proposal. I will work \nvigorously to ensure they are included in any comprehensive FDA \nlegislation considered by the Senate both this year and in the future. \nI look forward to continuing to work on these issues with Minnesotans \nand to pressing ahead next year on whatever we cannot accomplish this \nyear. Clearly there are actions Congress can take to improve the FDA \nwithout scarificing the assurances of safety that all Americans depend \non.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medical \n     Technology, Public Health, and Innovation Act of 1995''.\n       (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal \n     is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or a repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; MISSIONS STATEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S16423]]\n\n       (1) While the United States appropriately puts a top \n     priority on ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical \n     technologies that are introduced into the marketplace the \n     administration of such regulatory effort is causing the \n     United States to lose its leadership role in producing \n     innovative, top-quality medical devices.\n       (2) One of the key components of the medical device \n     regulatory process that contributes to the United States \n     losing its leadership role in medical device development is \n     the inordinate amount of time it takes for medical \n     technologies to be reviewed by the United States Food and \n     Drug Administration.\n       (3) The most important result of the United States losing \n     its leadership role is that patients in the United States do \n     not have access to new medical technology in a timely manner.\n       (4) Delayed patient access to new technology results in \n     lost opportunities to save lives, to reduce hospitalization \n     and recovery time, and to improve the quality of life of \n     patients.\n       (5) The economic benefits that the United States medical \n     device industry, which is composed principally of smaller \n     companies, has provided through growth in jobs and global \n     trade are threatened by the slow and unpredictable regulatory \n     process at the Food and Drug Administration.\n       (6) The pace and predictability of the medical device \n     regulatory process, together with a perceived adversarial \n     relationship with the Food and Drug Administration, are in \n     part responsible for the increasing tendency of United States \n     medical device companies to shift research, product \n     development, and manufacturing offshore, at the expense of \n     American jobs, patients, and leading edge clinical research.\n       (b) Mission Statement.--This legislation seeks to improve \n     the timeliness, effectiveness, and predictability of the \n     medical device approval process for the benefit of United \n     States patients and the United States economy by--\n       (1) providing for the use of nationally and internationally \n     recognized performance standards to assist the Food and Drug \n     Administration in determining the safety and effectiveness of \n     medical devices;\n       (2) facilitating communication between medical device \n     companies and the Food and Drug Administration;\n       (3) redefining clinical testing requirements to reflect the \n     nature of device evolution; and\n       (4) targeting the use of Food and Drug Administration \n     resources on those devices that are likely to have serious \n     adverse health consequences.\n\n     SEC. 3. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.\n\n       Section 514 (21 U.S.C. 360d) is amended by adding at the \n     end thereof the following new subsection:\n\n\n            ``establishment and adoption of other standards\n\n       ``(c)(1) The Secretary--\n       ``(A) may establish pursuant to subsection (b) performance \n     standards to assist in determining the safety or \n     effectiveness of class III devices under section 515; and\n       ``(B) may amend or revoke the performance standards \n     established under subparagraph (A).\n       ``(2) The Secretary shall, within 365 days of the date of \n     enactment of this subsection, adopt performance standards \n     established by nationally and internationally recognized \n     standard-setting entities and use the standards when \n     applicable to assist in determining the safety and \n     effectiveness of class III devices under section 515.\n       ``(3) The Secretary may not require, as the condition for \n     approving a premarket approval application under section 515, \n     the conformity of a class III device with a performance \n     standard established or adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) or \n     (2), respectively, if the applicant submits data other than \n     that required by the performance standard to demonstrate a \n     reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the \n     device.\n       ``(4) The Secretary, in lieu of requiring data \n     demonstrating the conformity of a class III device with a \n     standard described in paragraph (1) and (2), shall accept \n     certification by the applicant that the device conforms with \n     each standard identified in the application.\n       ``(5) The Secretary may revoke the performance standards \n     adopted under paragraph (2).\n       ``(6) A performance standard established under this \n     subsection for a device--\n       ``(A) shall include provisions to provide reasonable \n     assurance of the safe and effective performance of the \n     device;\n       ``(B) shall, where necessary to provide reasonable \n     assurance of the safe and effective performance of the \n     device, include--\n       ``(i) provisions with respect to the construction, \n     components, ingredients, and properties of the device and the \n     compatibility of the device with power systems and \n     connections to the systems;\n       ``(ii) provisions for the testing (on a sample basis or, if \n     necessary, on an individual basis) of the device or, if it is \n     determined that no other more practicable means are available \n     to the Secretary to assure the conformity of the device to \n     the standard, provisions for the testing (on sample basis or, \n     if necessary, on an individual basis) of the device by the \n     Secretary or by another person at the direction of the \n     Secretary;\n       ``(iii) provisions for the measurement of the performance \n     characteristics of the device;\n       ``(iv) provisions requiring that the results of each or \n     certain of the tests of the device required to be made under \n     clause (ii) demonstrate that the device is in conformity with \n     those portions of the standard for which the test or tests \n     were required; and\n       ``(v) a provision requiring that the sale and distribution \n     of the device be restricted to the extent that the sale and \n     distribution of the device is restricted under a regulation \n     under section 520(e); and\n       ``(C) shall, where appropriate, require the use and \n     prescribe the form and content of labeling for the proper \n     installation, maintenance, operation, and use of the \n     device.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A \n\n\n[[Page S16426]]\n\nNorwegian general officer currently expercises operations control over \nthe American task force Able Sentry.\n  While a U.N. commander has operational control, it is my \nunderstanding that the command of the U.S. task force remains under the \nU.S. chain of command.\n  Mr. President, on October 10, Army Specialist Michael New reported \nfor duty without wearing the United Nations shoulder patch and beret he \nand his unit were issued to wear as part of their uniform while \ndeployed in Macedonia. On October 17, Specialist New was charged for \nfailure to obey a lawful order in violation of article 92, Uniform Code \nof Military Justice.\n  Mr. President, I would also note that Michael New will have legal \nrepresentation and receive due process under these standards, as is \nextended to any military member who stands accused of violating \nmilitary rules. The Army has indicated to me that care will be taken to \nensure military standards of justice and fairness prevail.\n  The situation that has resulted from Specialist New's actions has \ncaused me great concern. As one who feels very strongly about this \nNation's sovereignty and responsibilities placed on our Armed Forces to \nprotect and defend this Nation, I find myself very frustrated with what \nhas happened.\n  Mr. President, my sympathy with his decision to refuse to wear the \nU.N. patch and hat does not change the fact that we must abide by the \nstandards set by the Military Code of Conduct if we are to assure order \nand fairness in the military. Our military must rely on strict chain of \ncommand and order. That is without a doubt.\n  However, the men and women who have chosen to serve this Nation and \nthe American people should not be put in a position which forces them \nto bear allegiance to any nation or organization other than the United \nStates of America. Michael New made the decision to serve in the Armed \nForces in order to defend the United States, not the United Nations. \nTherefore, in order to resolve this situation. I am introducing \nlegislation that prevents any member of the U.S. Armed Forces from \nbeing required to wear, as part of their military uniform, any insignia \nof the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, there is still another, broader issue that must be \naddressed, and that is the use of U.S. forces under U.N. command.\n  It is my understanding that except for some expertise that was \nprovided by a limited number of American advisors, until the past 2 or \n3 years, no American troops had served in U.N. peacekeeping forces. In \nmy view, the United States should not assume responsibility for \nresolving every conflict that develops around the world.\n  American combat troops are not, and should not be used as ``world \npolicemen.''\n  Mr. President, I supported Senator Nickles' amendment to the fiscal \nyear 1994 defense appropriations legislation which would have required \ncongressional approval before American troops could serve under foreign \ncommand, except when the President certifies it is an emergency or that \nour national security is at risk.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment was defeated on a 33 to 65 vote.\n  This issue remains unresolved. Therefore I also support hearings in \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee aimed at reviewing Specialist New's \ncase and the proper role U.S. troops should play in international \nmilitary operations.\n  Mr. President, I would just urge my colleagues to review the bill \nthat I am introducing today in the greater context of this situation. \nWe must not lose sight of the fact that the men and women who \nvolunteered to serve in our Armed Forces, volunteered to defend the \nUnited States of America, not the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1370\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON REQUIREMENT FOR MEMBERS OF THE \n                   ARMED FORCES TO WEAR UNIFORM ITEMS OF THE \n                   UNITED NATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 45 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 45 of title 10.

A bill entitled the ``Snowbasin Land Exchange Act of 1995''; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                THE SNOWBASIN LAND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \neffectuate a land exchange at the Snowbasin Ski Resort located east of \nOgden, Utah. Senators Craig, Bennett, and Burns are cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Basically, the intent of this legislation is simple. It directs the \nSecretary of Agriculture to exchange 1,320 acres of federally owned \nland within Utah's Cache National Forest for lands of approximately \nequal value owned by the Sun Valley Company, which owns the Snowbasin \nSki Resort. Snowbasin is located 30 miles north of Salt Lake City and \nhas been open for skiing since the early 1940s. It is one of the \nworld's greatest areas for snow and winter sports as evidenced by the \nrecent decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to have \nSalt Lake City host the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. It is precisely \nbecause of the IOC's decision that this legislation is necessary.\n  In 1985, a year after it purchased financially plagued Snowbasin, the \nSun Valley Company, recognized as an enviromentally sensitive manager \nof its recreational lands, asked the Forest Service to exchange 2,500 \nareas of land to improve the resort's base facilities and \ninfrastructure. This request was initially reduced to 1,320. Five years \nlater, after conducting an environmental impact statement and extensive \nstudies and public reviews, the Forest Service decided to exchange \napproximately 700 acres. At the same time, the Forest Service reached \nthe conclusions that the future success of Snowbasin requires private \nownership of lands at the base of the ski area and that a land exchange \nwas consistent with the priorities established in the 1985 Wasatch-\nCache Land and Reserve Management Plan.\n  Unfortunately, since 1990 and despite the diligent efforts of both \nthe Forest Service and the Sun Valley Company, little progress has \noccurred toward the exchange. I will not take the time to detail these \ndifficulties. However, my colleagues should know that the land exchange \nprocess has been long, tedious, and very costly to all parties, \nparticularly to Snowbasin.\n  Last June, Salt Lake City was selected as the site for the 2002 \nWinter Olympic Games. Due to its rugged mountain terrain, gradient and \ntechnical difficulty, Snowbasin has been identified as the venue for \nall Downhill, Combined Downhill, and Super G events for men and women. \nThese highly popular races traditionally attract some of the largest \nOlympic audiences. The snail's pace with which the exchange process has \nbeen moving has many people associated with Snowbasin and the Salt Lake \nCity Olympic Organizing Committee, including myself, worried that \nSnowbasin will not be sufficiently prepared to handle the Olympic \nskiing events and their accompanying crowds.\n  I am sure my colleagues can appreciate what it requires for a \ncommunity to prepare a venue to host any Olympic event. In the case of \nSnowbasin, these pre-2002 activities include the installation of \nchairlifts, construction of a connector road, fencing and safety \nnetting, additional ski runs, maintenance buildings, new spectator and \nservice areas, parking lot expansion, restrooms and other items \nidentified in Phase 1 of the Sun Valley Company's Master Plan for \nSnowbasin. These activities must be done in the near future and can be \n\n[[Page S16427]]\n\nmore effectively and environmentally accomplished if done on private \nproperty.\n  In exchange for the forested acreage, the Sun Valley Company will \nconvey four major parcels to the Forest Service that have been \npreviously identified by the Forest Service as desirable for \nacquisition. These parcels are specifically listed in our legislation, \nand their combined acreage exceeds 4,000 acres. Obviously, this land \npossesses outstanding recreational, wildlife, mountain, and access \nvalues for public use and enjoyment. The values of the Federal and non-\nfederal lands involved in this exchange will be determined by utilizing \nnationally recognized appraisal standards.\n  Mr. President, we in Utah are overjoyed that the eyes of the world \nwill be upon us, upon our mountains, and upon the ``Greatest Snow on \nEarth.'' At the same time, there is serious concern whether the \nfacilities to support the Olympics can be constructed, tested for \nsafety, and become fully operational by 2002, especially when \nconsidering it will take three summer seasons to complete the \ndevelopment of Phase 1 of the Snowbasin Master Plan. Pursuit of a land \nexchange at Snowbasin through the administrative process, and possibly \nthe courts, does not alleviate this concern and only exacerbates the \nproblems of timing and uncertainty. Legislative action on Snowbasin \nplaces control of this matter with the Congress, rather than the \ncourts, and will ensure that all aspects of the 2002 Winter Olympic \nGames are in their proper place once the world focuses on Salt Lake \nCity.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully review this legislation and the \nreasons why it is crucial that this proposal be adopted during the \n104th Congress. I look forward to working with them to achieve this \ngoal.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as Utah prepares to host the 2002 Winter \nOlympics, I am pleased today to join my colleague Senator Hatch in \nintroducing the Snowbasin Land Exchange Act of 1995. Snowbasin Ski \nResort, which is owned by Sun Valley Company, will host both the men's \nand women's downhill ski events. This land exchange will direct the \nSecretary to exchange 1,320 acres of Forest Service Lands within the \nCache National Forest for lands of approximate and equal value owned by \nSun Valley Co. This legislation is fundamental to the success of the \n2002 Winter Olympics. It is a win-win situation for all parties \ninvolved and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 1373. A bill to provide for state regulation of prices charged for \nservices provided by, and routes of service of, motor vehicles that \nprovide tow or wrecker services, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  the towing technical correction act\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I introduce an Intrastate Towing \nTechnical Corrections Act. This legislation will clarify that it is not \nCongress' intent to preempt state or local regulations dealing with the \noperation of tow trucks. I would like to recognize the junior Senator \nfrom Washington who introduced similar legislation in the 103d \nCongress, which, unfortunately, was not acted upon prior to \nadjournment.\n  Last year Congress passed the Federal Aviation Administration \nAuthorization Act of 1994. The act included a provision in section 601 \nwhich effectively preempts state and local intrastate trucking \nregulations pertaining to prices, routes, and service. However, it was \nnot Congress' intention to legislate on towing issues; and it has \nopened up myriad problems for the consumer, leading to higher towing \nrates.\n  In Connecticut, towing rates have been deregulated; and tow operators \nare free to charge as much as they want. Now, some may say that the \nmarket should determine prices--and I agree--but in the towing market \nthe consumer has no other recourse, more times than not, than to pay \nthe tow truck operator after the vehicle has been towed. Safety \nconcerns abound also. Especially when considering large tractor \ntrailers that break down on interstate highways.\n  I have heard from many constituents that deregulation is causing \nexorbitant price increases in their towing rates. Again, this was not \nour intention when we passed the Federal Aviation Administration \nAuthorization Act of 1994. This bill will keep towing charges in line \nwith market prices.\n  Plain and simple, Mr. President, deregulation is leading to \novercharging. My bill would let the States set towing rates. It would \nbe beneficial for the consumer and beneficial for States.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record excerpts from an \narticle in the Hartford Courant by Tom Condon, which addresses this \nproblem.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, Aug. 22, 1995]\n\n              Deregulating Towing Has Left Public on Hook\n\n                            (By Tom Condon)\n\n       On Aug. 8, a tractor-trailer driver for Dick Harris \n     Trucking Co. of Lynchburg, Va., pulled his rig off I-95 at \n     Exit 34 in Milford. He didn't hit the narrow exit ramp just \n     right, and the tractor and box gently rolled over.\n       Police called Robert's Service Center of Milford to clear \n     the ramp. The trailer was full of pallets of rolled steel. \n     Robert's crew winched the cargo out of the truck, righted it, \n     then towed everything away.\n       What the owners of the truck aren't happy with is the \n     towing bill, which is for $10,400.\n       ``It's excessive, that's the problem I have with it,'' said \n     Bud Holt, vice president of the trucking company. Holt, who \n     said he is a former state trooper and insurance claims \n     adjuster, said Robert's billed some of the workers at $60 an \n     hour, which ``is too much.''\n       It doesn't matter, Holt. Welcome to Connecticut, where \n     towing rates have been deregulated, and tow operators can \n     charge as much as they want.\n       There is another side to the Milford case. Robert Bruno, \n     owner of the service center, says this was a very complicated \n     operation for which he had to rent expensive equipment. He \n     said he had to winch the heavy pallets out of the truck with \n     a rented low motor, then load them on rented flatbeds. Then \n     he righted the tractor and trailer without damaging them.\n       Bruno said he brought the cargo back to his yard and \n     unloaded it. Then, at the direction of the trucking company, \n     he reloaded it on the flatbeds and took it to a freight yard \n     with a loading dock, so it could be loaded back on the \n     trailer.\n       He said he got the call at 11:30 a.m., and the last of his \n     crew didn't finish until midnight. He said his real cost was \n     almost $14,000, but he decided to give the trucking company a \n     break, hoping for future business. Holt said he understood \n     the job took 10 hours, and said he thought $1,000 an hour \n     excessive.\n       Not so, said Bruno. He said some operators would have \n     gouged the trucking company and charged $20,000 for the job, \n     but said he didn't. Bruno has released the trailer, but is \n     still holding the tractor, until the dispute is resolved. \n     Both sides have lawyers.\n       If this doesn't make the case that deregulation is leading \n     to overcharging, let's go back to old reliable, a guy we can \n     always count on to hose the public, Bob Spillane of Walnut \n     Street Service Inc. of Hartford.\n       On May 10, an ironworker named Pete Toner of Langdon, N.H., \n     parked his Bronco in a private parking lot--never do that--at \n     the corner of Ashley and Garden streets and visited the \n     Ashley Cafe. When he came out, the car was gone. He then \n     walked to the police lockup at Morgan Street, finally learned \n     the car had been towed, called Spillane and got no answer.\n       When he got the Bronco the next day, the bill was $139. He \n     said Spillane didn't answer his phone, then charged him for \n     storage. The tow from the bar to Spillane's garage is one \n     block. This is an outrage, but at the moment motor vehicles \n     officials say there's nothing they can do about it (not that \n     they ever did much about it in the past).\n       On Jan. 1, a federal law went into effect that prevents \n     states or cities from regulating ``price, route or service of \n     any motor carrier . . . or any motor carrier with respect to \n     the transportation of property.'' State officials have \n     interpreted this to mean they can't regulate towing rates.\n       If a convervative is a liberal who's been mugged, an \n     opponent of deregulation is someone who's had to pay $139 \n     after his car was towed one block. If this idiotic law isn't \n     changed, government is going to have to get back into the \n     towing business to keep the public from getting fleeced. We \n     don't want that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16422-2", "month":

Res. 189\n\n       Whereas illegal drug use among the youth of America is on \n     the increase;\n       Whereas illegal drug use is a major health problem, ruining \n     thousands of lives and costing billions of dollars;\n       Whereas illegal drug use contributes to crime on the \n     streets and in the homes of this nation;\n       Whereas national attention has turned from illegal drug use \n     to other issues, and support for sustained programs has \n     decreased;\n       Whereas public awareness and sustained programs are \n     essential to combat an on-going social problem;\n       Whereas the answer to the illegal drug problem lies in \n     America's communities, with local people involved in grass \n     roots activities to keep their communities safe and drug \n     free, and in encouraging personal responsibility;\n       Whereas the annual Red Ribbon Celebration, coordinated by \n     the National Family Partnership and involving over 80,000,000 \n     Americans in prevention activities each year, commemorates \n     the sacrifices of people on the front lines in the war \n     against illegal drug use;\n       Whereas substance abuse prevention, law enforcement, \n     international narcotics control, and community awareness \n     efforts contribute to preventing young people from starting \n     illegal drug use; and\n       Whereas the American people have a continuing \n     responsibility to combat illegal drug use: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designate Wed., Nov. 1, 1995, as \n     ``National Drug Awareness Day''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in recent weeks we have seen mounting \nevidence that teenage drug use in this country is on the increase after \nmore than a decade of decline. One of the principal reasons for this \nchange is that we have lost the public message that drug use is wrong. \nAs a result, a new generation of America's young people are growing up \nwithout a clear message about the dangers of drug use. This is not a \nsituation that we can afford to let continue. The last time this \nhappened, in the 1960's and 1970's, we saw an epidemic of use that cost \nus tens of thousands of lives. Now we see teenage drug use on the rise \nagain. Recent surveys confirm this disturbing trend and indications are \nthat data to be released in the next few days will only confirm the \nworst fears. It is for this reason that Senator Dole and I held a press \nconference yesterday with major family groups, including the National \nFamily Partnership, National Families in Action, CADCA, and PRIDE, to \ndraw attention to the problems of returning teen drug use and the \ndangerous normalization of this use you can now see and hear on TV, in \nthe movies, and in rock music. For this reason I am submitting a Senate \nresolution, cosponsored by over a dozen members, to declare November 1, \n1995, National Drug Awareness Day. It is important that we all \nrecognize the importance of the issue. We need to renew our commitment \nto fighting drug use, to prevent a new generation from becoming victims \nof those who would mislead them into believing that drug use is just an \nalternative lifestyle with no adverse consequences. Drugs kill, they \nmaim, they ruin lives, they cripple potential. We saw what happened \nwhen we ignored the problem once. We cannot let this happen again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16428-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 190--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRINTING OF A REVISED EDITION \n                  OF THE SENATE ELECTION LAW GUIDEBOOK\n\n  Mr. WAGNER (for himself and Mr. Ford) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I would like to take this time to \nexplain some of the votes I cast during consideration of the VA, HUD, \nindependent agencies appropriations bill on September 27, 1995.\n  Senator Bumpers offered an amendment to reduce the appropriation for \nimplementing the space station program with the intent of terminating \nthe program. The Bumpers amendment raised the question as to what the \nUnited States fundamental goals and needs are in exploring space. While \nit is clear that the space station has spurred technological and \nscientific development unrelated to space, I am not convinced that \nthese developments justify the enormous taxpayer expense of the space \nstation. Therefore, at this time, I supported Senator Bumpers' \namendment. Since the amendment failed, however, we will most likely \ncontinue to fund the space station for fiscal year 1996, and as we \nspend more on this program we will come closer to a point at which it \nwould no longer be wise to discontinue funding. I believe we are near \nthat point and will review this budget request again next year to \ndetermine whether eliminating funding for the space station would \nbenefit taxpayers.\n  Senator Rockefeller offered two amendments regarding benefits for \nveterans. One involved compensation for mentally incompetent service-\nrelated disabled veterans and the other would have increased funding \nfor the general veterans medical account. My opposition to these \namendments was not based on their content, but rather on the fact that \nthe funding mechanism for both of these amendments involved waiving the \nBudget Act. More than any veteran-specific funding we can provide, \nbalancing the budget will benefit veterans and their children. Any \namendment which increases spending and puts our country further from \nachieving a balanced budget ought to be rejected. And while I do not \ndoubt that Senator Rockefeller's amendments have merit, his inability \nto find other spending offsets made them impossible for me to support.\n  Senator Lautenberg also proposed to waive provisions of the Budget \nAct in order to provide more funding for the Superfund Program. While I \nshare Mr. Lautenberg's concern for the environment, very few Americans \nfamiliar with the Superfund Program would disagree that it is in need \nof reform. We have spent billions of dollars on the Superfund Program \nalready, and the results have been minimal. Superfund has resulted in \nmore lawsuits, more paperwork, extreme cleanup mandates, and few \ncleanups. This is a classic attempt to throw good tax dollars after \nbad. Without meaningful reform of the program, I am not convinced that \nSuperfund dollars are being well-spent, making it impossible for me to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Senator Mikulski offered an amendment which would have restored $425 \nmillion in funding for the Corporation for National and Community \nService. While I applaud her efforts to encourage Americans to provide \nmore service to their communities, this program costs $26,000 per \nparticipant per year--a level which cannot be sustained in the current \nbudget environment.\n  Furthermore, I could not support funding for this program upon \nlearning that $14 million out of last year's AmeriCorps funds were used \nto fund Federal agencies. While the administration claims it is cutting \nstaff, they are actually playing a shell game with taxpayers' dollars \nby using AmeriCorps workers in the Federal Government. I am confident \nthat the original supporters of this program did not intend for these \nvolunteers to choose Federal employment as their community service.\n  Forty percent of the dollars currently spent on AmeriCorps is used \nfor administrative purposes by the Federal Government. These funds \nwould be more efficiently and effectively spent on a local rather than \na national level.\n  Another amendment which touched on an important social issue was the \nSarbanes amendment to transfer $360 million from section 8 contract \nrenewals to homeless assistance grants to increase funding for Federal \nhomeless programs. Most Americans share a common concern regarding the \nplight of the homeless and agree that the Government should play a role \nin the solution. Nevertheless, I voted against this amendment for two \nreasons.\n  First, the underlying bill provides $760 million for homeless grants, \nwith an additional $297 million in homeless grants funding available \nfrom the earlier rescission bill, which deferred this funding from \nfiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 1996. In total, homeless programs will \nhave $1.057 billion to spend in fiscal year 1996. The Sarbanes \namendment would not increase this funding by one penny. All the funds \nhe proposes to transfer would not be available until fiscal year 1997. \nIn other words, this amendment would not have helped one homeless \nperson next year.\n  Second, I was concerned that an unintended consequence of this \namendment would be to increase homelessness. The bill provides $4.35 \nbillion in funding for section 8 contract renewal. Section 8 subsidizes \nthe construction and operation of apartment buildings, provided the \nowner agrees to rent a certain percentage of those apartments to low-\nincome people. Currently, 1.5 million units are subsidized in this \nfashion, and many of these contracts are due to expire. If they are not \nrenewed, many of the tenants will lose their homes.\n  In order to pay for the increase in homeless funding, Senator \nSarbanes would have reduced funding for renewing section 8 contracts. \nBy taking away from this account, this amendment threatens to put \npeople currently housed under the section 8 program on the street. The \nFederal Government has a role to play in helping the homeless, and in \nthis case the underlying bill fills this role by addressing the needs \nof people already living on the streets as well as ensuring we don't \nencourage additional families to join them.\n  Overall I believe we have produced a solid appropriations bill, one \nwhich stays within the budget limitations necessary to balance the \nbudget by the year 2002, delegates much of the funding to States in the \nform of block grants so that spending is more effective, and revises or \neliminates programs that simply have not been working. I was proud to \nsupport final passage of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16433-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16433-S16434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on October 20, a letter from four \nformer National Security Advisers was sent to the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Committee on Foreign Relations expressing their support \nfor the work of the National Endowment for Democracy [NED]. According \nto these four distinguished experts, NED ``has served our national \ninterest well through its timely support of those who advance the cause \nof democracy.''\n  As we make the difficult budgetary choices that will help guarantee \nfor us and our children a prosperous future, it is essential that we \nnot discard those programs--particularly those that are cost-\neffective--which enhance our long-term security. As the following \nletter from Messrs. Allen, Brzezinski, Carlucci, and Scowcroft points \nout, the National Endowment for Democracy is such a program.\n  I ask that the letter be printed in the Record. The letter follows:\n\n                                                 October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Benjamin Gilman,\n     Hon. Lee Hamilton,\n     House International Relations Committee, Washington, DC.\n       As former National Security Advisers to the President, we \n     are familiar with the work of the National Endowment for \n     Democracy (NED). In our assessment, NED, established under \n     President Reagan as an instrument in \n\n[[Page S16434]]\n\n     his campaign for democracy, and sustained with the bipartisan \n     support of the leadership of both houses of Congress, has \n     served our national interest well through its timely support \n     of those who advance the cause of democracy.\n       The Endowment, a small bipartisan institution with its \n     roots in America's private sector, operates in situations \n     where direct government involvement is not appropriate. It is \n     an exceptionally effective instrument in today's climate for \n     reaching dedicated groups seeking to counter extreme \n     nationalist and autocratic forces that are responsible for so \n     much conflict and instability.\n       Eliminating this program would be particularly unsettling \n     to our friends around the world, and could be interpreted as \n     a sign of America's disengagement from the vital policy of \n     supporting democracy. The Endowment remains a critical and \n     cost-effective investment in a more secure America, and we \n     support its work. We hope that you will join us in that \n     support.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard V. Allen,\n     Frank C. Carlucci,\n     Zbigniew Brzezinski,\n     Brent Scowcroft.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statements were ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16433-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BALANCED BUDGET RESOLUTION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. DOLE. I seek a clarification from my colleague, the \nesteemed chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Roth. It is my \nunderstanding that, in making these revolutionary and necessary changes \nto the Medicare program to preserve it for our Nation's seniors, we are \nconcerned about the effects these changes may have on inner-city access \nto health care services. It is my understanding that it is the Finance \nCommittee's intention to have ProPAC study the effects of these changes \non the access and quality of care to the Medicare beneficiaries served \nby the Nation's urban hospitals who serve large numbers of Medicare \npatients. I understand from the chairman that whatever changes do occur \nin the Medicare Program, it is in the best interests of this Nation to \nensure the health and financial viability of these inner- city \nhospitals so as not to undermine the health of the residents in those \nurban areas.\n  Mr. ROTH. The gentleman, my good friend from Kansas, is correct. I \nshare his concern for residents of the inner cities across the country. \nThe Finance Committee does indeed intend for ProPAC to study the \neffects of these changes on inner city hospitals that provide the \naccess to care for those areas.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is, therefore, my understanding that the chairman of the \nFinance Committee intends to continue to address these concerns during \nthe House-Senate conferencs by including language which would require \nProPAC's annual report to Congress to include recommendations to ensure \nthat beneficiaries served by the Nation's urban hospitals would \nmaintain access and quality of care.\n  In designing the study we would hope that ProPAC would also include \nrecommendations on those hospitals that serve large populations of both \nMedicare and Medicaid patients.\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator is correct. As part of the Senate Finance \nCommittee's deliberation with the House on the Medicare provisions of \nthe conference, we intend to request, and ultimately, include that \nrequirement in ProPAC's annual report to Congress.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the chairman for his clarification and for sharing \nmy concern about the health and well-being of our inner-city residents \nand the hospitals that serve their needs.\n\n\n                           oregon health plan\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will my colleague from Delaware yield for the purpose \nof entering into a colloquy?\n  Mr. ROTH. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. It is my understanding that additional funds have been \nmade available and added to the Medicaid Program. As a result, Oregon \nwill receive more funding during the 7 year budget period than \noriginally expected under the Senate formula.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. As my colleague knows, Oregon is currently in the \nmiddle of a 5-year Medicaid demonstration project known as the Oregon \nHealth Plan which began in 1994. This plan has had an enormous effect \non improving access to basic health care to low-income Oregonians. As a \nresult of the cuts to Medicaid funding included in the original Finance \nCommittee proposal, Oregon's ability to carry out this innovative plan \nwas threatened. Is it your understanding that under the new Senate \nMedicaid formula, Oregon will receive more money than the State \nestimates it will need during the years 1996 through 1999 to operate \nthe Oregon Health Plan under its current Medicaid waiver?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I want to thank the Senator from Delaware and your \nstaff for your assistance in ensuring that Oregon will be able to \ncontinue its innovative experiment. I truly believe other States can \nlearn from Oregon's experience, and you have helped to guarantee that \nthis will happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16434-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING TIMOTHY A. BROWN\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President. I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Capt. Timothy A. Brown, international president of the \nInternational Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots, ILA, AFL-CIO, on \nbeing awarded the Silver Mariner Award and the Outstanding Professional \nAchievement Award by the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, \nNY. Captain Brown was presented with the award on October 12, 1995, at \nan awards dinner held at the Merchant Marine Academy Officers Club.\n  The Silver Mariner Award is given every 5 years to individuals who \nhave attained and sailed on their master's license and who have at \nleast 25 years sailing experience. Individuals receiving the \nOutstanding Professional Achievement Award are selected because of \ntheir achievement within the maritime industry. Captain Brown's labor \nefforts on behalf of the maritime industry as president of the \nInternational Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots led to his \nnomination and subsequent selection by the review panel.\n  The International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots is the \nInternational Marine Division of the International Longshoreman's \nAssociation, AFL-CIO. With 6,800 members, it represents licensed deck \nofficers, State pilots, and other marine personnel on U.S.-flag \ncommercial vessels sailing in international trade and the inland \nwaterways of the United States, the Panama Canal, and Caribbean, as \nwell as crews sailing civilian-crewed military vessels of the United \nStates.\n  Captain Brown richly deserves the great honor which has been accorded \nhim. He has been associated with the maritime industry since graduating \nfrom the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Points, NY, in 1965. \nCaptain Brown continued to associated himself with the maritime \nindustry; from 1983 to 1991 he sailed as a ship's master with SeaLand \nService, Inc. In February 1991, he was elected president of the \nInternational Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots on an interim \nbasis and was subsequently reelected in 1992. During his tenure as \npresident, Captain Brown devoted a great deal of time and energy toward \nlegislative initiatives designed to promote the U.S.-flag merchant \nmarine in a competitive world market. Working at both the grassroots \nand national levels he took the opportunity to explain the importance \nof the U.S. merchant marine to the national defense and the economy.\n  Captain Brown serves as an international vice president of the \nMasters, Mates & Pilots parent organization, the International \nLongshoremen's Association. He is also a member of the Council of \nAmerican Master Mariners and the American Merchant Marine Veterans.\n  Mr. President, again, I congratulate Captain Brown on his \naccomplishment and for being held in such a high regard by his \ncolleagues in the maritime industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16434-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16434-S16435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DAVID HENDEL\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

For nearly 40 years, David Hendel of West Hartford, \nCT has been a fixture at MetLife and he will be sorely missed in those \nhallways.\n  As a past president of the MetLife Veterans Club of Hartford/\nProvidence, \n\n[[Page S16435]]\n\na member of the president's club for 6 years, and 10 years on the \nleadership conference, David has redefined loyalty and dedication in \nthe workplace. If ever there was a man who could be counted on to put \nforth his best effort day in and day out, David Hendel is that man.\n  David has not merely made his mark at MetLife, he has also worked \nhard to better his community and this is what makes him such a special \nindividual. A veteran of the U.S. Army, David has devoted his spare \ntime to such organizations as the West Hartford Zoning Board of \nAppeals, the West Hartford Democratic Town Committee, and Temple Beth \nEl of West Hartford. Truly, David has taught a generation of West \nHartford residents the meaning and value of community service.\n  A true role model, David has shown us all that we must work both as \nindividuals and as parts of a greater community to leave a positive \nmark on the world around us. As Members of Congress, we are charged \nwith improving and strengthening the fabric of this Nation. I hope this \nbody recognizes that, by following the lead of citizens like David \nHendel, we can all advance toward that lofty goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/31/senate-section/article/S16434-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF JOHN DOUGLASS TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to offer a few comments on \nthe nomination of John Wade Douglass to be the Assistant Secretary of \nthe Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition. John has served as \na professional staff member of the Senate Armed Services Committee for \nmore than 3 years, and he has served the committee well.\n  John has been responsible for technology base programs and defense \nresearch and development issues, as well as NATO issues, for the \ncommittee's Democratic members. He has worked on such difficult tasks \nas reducing the size of the Defense Department and its budget while \nkeeping a coherent program of research and technology that will help \npreserve our national security in the decades to come. He has also \ndealt with the thorny issues of Bosnia and NATO expansion.\n  In all his work for the committee, John has offered wise and creative \napproaches to these difficult issues. For example, he has been a \ntireless champion of cost-sharing in Federal dual-use research funding, \nwhich has now become a standard practice for the Pentagon and other \ngovernment agencies. This new standard will save the taxpayer hundreds \nof millions of dollars while improving the chances that the joint \nresearch bears fruit for both the military and civilian users.\n  Mr. President, I have enjoyed the opportunity to work with John over \nthe past 3 years. He has worked with me on a number of issues, always \nwith energy, intelligence, and humor. Clearly, the Navy's gain will be \nthe committee's loss. I want to offer my congratulations to John and \nwish him well in his new position. If he serves the Navy as well as he \ndid the committee, as I am sure he will, the Nation will be well served \nindeed.\n  Mr. SMITH.

These corrections \nwould change the references in section 9 from plural to singular. \nSection 2 of S. 325 makes technical corrections to the Odawa and Ottawa \nRestoration Act. This section corrects all of the references in section \n9 by using the plural.\n  The third section of S. 325 would address a longstanding problem in \nIndian policy. I have worked extensively with my good friend and \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, to repeal the Trading with Indians \nAct. The Trading with Indians Act was originally enacted in the 1800's \nto protect Indians from unscrupulous Indian agents and other Federal \nemployees. The prohibitions in the Trading with Indians Act were \ndesigned to prevent Federal employees from using their positions of \ntrust to engage in private business deals that exploited Indians. These \nprohibitions carried criminal penalties including a fine of up to \n$5,000 and removal from Federal employment. The Trading With Indians \nAct has had significant adverse impacts on employee retention in the \nIndian Health Service [IHS] and the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA]. The \nproblems stemming from the Trading with Indians Act are well-\ndocumented. Because the prohibitions in the Trading with Indians Act \napply to the spouses of IHS and BIA employees, the adverse impacts are \nfar-reaching. For example, if a spouse of an IHS employee is engaged in \na business that is wholly-unrelated to the BIA or the IHS and does not \ntransact business with the BIA or the IHS, the spouse is still in \nviolation of the Trading with Indians Act. It is clear that although \nthis statute served an admirable purpose in the 1800's, it has become \nanachronistic and should be repealed. The important policies reflected \nin the Trading with Indians Act are now covered by the Standards of \nEthical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch.\n  In addition, to the original sections of the bill there are a number \nof additional sections included in S. 325 at the request for a number \nof Indian tribes. Section 4 of the amendment corrects a citation in \nsection 4 of the Indian Dams Safety Act of 1994. Section 5 of S. 325 \namends the Pascua Yaqui Indians Act to capitalize the words ``Pascua \nYaqui Tribe.'' Section 6 amends section 3(7) of the Indian Lands Open \nDump cleanup Act of 1994 to correct the citation to the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act. Section 7 of the bill amends the American Indian Trust \nFund Management Reform Act of 1994 to correct a reference in section \n303(c) of the Act and to correct a typographical error in section 306 \nof the Act. Section 8 of the bill makes several technical and \nconforming changes to the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act. Section 9 of the bill corrects a reference in section \n102 of the Indian Self-Determination Contract Reform Act of 1994. \nSection 10 of the bill corrects certain references in sections 203 and \n206 of the Auburn Indian Restoration Act. Section 11 of the bill amends \nthe Crow Boundary Settlement Act of 1994 corrects several references in \nsections 5, 9, and 10 of the Act. Section 12 of S. 325 corrects a \ntypographical error in section 205 of the Tlingit and Haida Status \nClarification Act. Section 13 of the bill amends section 103 of the \nNative American Languages Act to correct several citations in the \nsection. Section 14 of the bill amends section 5 of the Ponca \nRestoration Act to modify the service area of the Ponca Indian Tribe to \ninclude Indians living in Sarpy, Burt, Platte, Stanton, Hall, Holt, and \nWayne counties in Nebraska and Indians living in Woodbury and \nPottawattomie counties in Iowa. It has been estimated that there are \n110 Ponca tribal members living in these counties who are not currently \neligible to receive services from the tribe. This amendment to the \nPonca Restoration Act would make these members eligible for tribal \nservices from the Ponca Tribe. I would like to recognize the leadership \nof the delegation from Nebraska, Senators Exon and Kerrey, who brought \nthis provision to my attention and urged its inclusion in S. 325.\n  Section 15 of S. 325 amends section 112 of the Yavapai-Prescott \nIndian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1994 to extend the time for \nthe completion of the activities to be conducted by the parties to the \nsettlement by six months. Under the original Act, the Secretary is \nrequired to publish in the Federal Register by December 31, 1995 a \nstatement of findings that includes a finding that the contracts \nbetween the parties for Central Arizona Project water have been \nexecuted. Due to several unforeseen developments, the Department of the \nInterior, the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe, and the City of Prescott have \nrequested an additional 6 months to finalize the agreements and publish \nthe Secretary's findings in the Federal Register.\n  Section 16 of the bill modifies the definition of the term Indian \n``Health Profession'' in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. This \nmodification will allow the Indian Health Service additional \nflexibility in awarding scholarships and offering loan repayment to \nindividuals enrolled in degree programs in the health professions. As \noriginally defined, the term health profession unnecessarily restricted \nthe eligibility of individuals for scholarships. Subsection (b) amends \nsection 104 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to make clear \nthat an individual serving in an academic setting that is funded under \nsections 102, 112, or 114 of the Act who is responsible for the \nrecruitment and training of Indian Health Professionals shall be \nconsidered to be meeting their service obligations under section 338A \nof the Public Health Service Act. This provision will allow an \nindividual to meet their service obligation to the IHS by working at a \nuniversity or other academic setting which is responsible for \nrecruiting and training American Indians in the health professions. The \namendment also clarifies that the Secretary may defer an individual's \nservice obligations during the term of an internship, residency or \nother advanced clinical program. Further, subsection (b) provides that \nany obligation for service or payment by an individual to the IHS shall \nexpire upon their death. It also authorizes the Secretary to waive or \nsuspend a service or payment obligation upon the Secretary's \ndetermination that it would cause extreme hardship or to enforce such a \nrequirement would be unconscionable. Finally, the provision makes clear \nthe terms under which an individual's payment obligation may be \ndischarged in a bankruptcy proceeding. Subsection (c) of this section \nclarifies certain provisions in section 206 of the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act regarding the notice provisions for individuals in \ncollection actions for services provided by IHS or tribal health \nfacilities and recoverable costs in such a collection action and the \nright of the United States and Indian tribes to recover against an \ninsurance company or employee benefit plan.\n\n  Section 17 of the bill provides for the revocation of the charter of \nincorporation of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe under the Indian \nReorganization Act. The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe has requested the \nCongress to accept their surrender of the Corporate Charter of the \nMinnesota Chippewa. By its own terms, this chapter can only be revoked \nby Act of Congress. This provision would revoke the charter. I would \nlike to express my appreciation to my good friend the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone for his hard work and diligence on behalf \nof the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe in advancing this amendment. Section 18 \nof the bill amends section 533(c) of the Equity in Educational Land \nGrant Status Act of 1994 to clarify how the Indian student count shall \nbe applied to the Tribally Controlled Community Colleges. Section 19 of \nS. 325 will amend the Advisory Council on California Indian Policy Act \nof 1992 to extend the term of the Advisory Council on California Indian \nPolicy from 18 months to 36 months in order to allow them to complete \ntheir study of issues affecting California Indian tribes. Section 20 of \nthe bill amends the San Carlos Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act \nof \n\n[[Page S16437]]\n\n1992 to extend the deadline for the parties to the settlement complete \nagreements between the San Carlos Apache Tribe, the Phelps-Dodge \nCorporation, and the Town of Globe for an additional year. This \namendment would extend the deadline from December 31, 1995 to December \n31, 1996. The Department of the Interior, the San Carlos Apache Tribe \nand the other parties to the settlement have expressed their support \nfor this provision.\n  Section 21 of the bill amends section 401 of the Public Law 100-581, \nto provide the authority to the Army Corps of Engineers to provide \nfunding for the operation and maintenance of in lieu fishing access \nsites on the Columbia River. Public Law 100-581 was enacted in 1988 to \nauthorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop 32 Indian fishing \naccess sites along the Columbia River for the Warm Springs, Yakima, \nUmatilla, and Nez Perce tribes. These fishing sites were intended to \ncompensate these Indian tribes for fishing sites which were lost due to \nthe construction of several dams by the Army Corps of Engineers. In a \nJune 25, 1995 Memorandum of Understanding between the Army Corps of \nEngineers and the Department of the Interior, the Corps agreed to a \nlump sum payment of funds to provide for the operation and maintenance \nof such sites. I would like to express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Oregon, Mr. Hatfield, for his leadership in advancing this \nprovision. I have worked closely with him in ensuring that this \nprovision is clarified and provides the necessary authority to ensure \nthat these sites are adequately maintained.\n  Section 22 of the bill provides authority to the Ponca Indian Tribe \nof Nebraska to utilize funds provided in prior fiscal years to acquire, \ndevelop, and maintain a transitional living facility for Indian \nadolescents. I understand that the Ponca Indian Tribe has worked \nclosely with Senator Conrad, who has been the principal sponsor of this \namendment. I would like to express my appreciation for the work of \nSenators Kyl, Thomas, Kerrey, Exon, Conrad, Hatfield, Wellstone, and \nInouye in the development of many of these amendments and I urge my \ncolleagues to support passage of S. 325.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3040) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     treaty fishing site amendment\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the relationship of the United \nStates Government with Native American tribes has often been plagued by \nbroken promises and unfinished tasks. Treaties with the four Columbia \nRiver fishing tribes, the Warm Springs, Umatillas, Yakima, and the Nez \nPerce guarantee them the right to fish in the Columbia River. When dams \nflooded out their fishing sites in the 1930's, the Federal Government \nagreed to provide 400 acres of new sites ``in lieu of those \ninundated.''\n  Throughout the years, we have failed to make good on that commitment. \nAbout 40 acres have been provided, and these areas are in poor \ncondition. In 1988, Congress remedied this dilemma by passing the \nColumbia River Treaty Fishing Access Sites Act. The Act requires the \nArmy Corps of Engineers to rehabilitate the existing sites and develop \nnew sites to the full 400 acres. Once developed the Corps is to \ntransfer the sites to the Bureau of Indian Affairs as trustee for the \ntribes.\n  Since fiscal year 1994, $7.8 million has been appropriated to the \nCorps for this purpose. Expenditure of this money has been stalled due \nto a disagreement between the Corps and the BIA over which would be \nresponsible for operation and maintenance costs after the transfer. The \ntwo agencies have reached an agreement and my amendment will provide \nclear legislative authority for the Corps to transfer the Operation and \nMaintenance funds to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  I am pleased we have reached an agreement that is acceptable to all \nthe parties involved and I am proud that we have fulfilled our \ncommitment to the tribes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation to make \ntechnical corrections in certain laws relating to Native Americans, \nparticularly section 3 of the bill which would repeal the Trading With \nIndians Act.\n  Mr. President, the Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committees, Senator \nMcCain, and I began working for the repeal of the Trading With Indians \nAct during the last Congress. Senator McCain championed the issue in \nthis body. I sponsored the companion bill while I was still serving in \nthe House of Representatives. I want to thank the chairman for his \ncontinuing personal involvement, and for acting so promptly on the \nissue this year.\n  The Trading With Indians Act was originally enacted in 1834, and it \nhad a legitimate purpose at that time--to protect Native Americans from \nbeing unduly influenced by Federal employees.\n  But, a law that started out with good intentions more than a century \nago has become unnecessary and counterproductive today. It establishes \na virtually absolute prohibition against commercial trading with \nIndians by employees of the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. The prohibition extends to transactions in which a Federal \nemployee has an interest, either in his or her own name, or in the name \nof another person, including a spouse, where the employee benefits or \nappears to benefit from such interest.\n  The penalties for violations can be severe: a fine of not more than \n$5,000, or imprisonment for not more than 6 months, or both. The Act \nfurther provides that any employee who is found to be in violation \nshould be terminated from Federal employment.\n  This all means that employees could be subject to criminal penalties \nor fired from their jobs, not for any real or perceived wrongdoing on \ntheir part, but merely because they are married to individuals who may \ndo business on an Indian reservation. The nexus of marriage is enough \nto invoke penalties. It means, for example, that an Indian Health \nService employee, whose spouse operates a law firm on the Navajo \nNation, could be fined, imprisoned, or fired. It means that a family \nmember can't apply for a small business loan without jeopardizing the \nemployee's job.\n  Mr. President, in some cases, the Trading With Indians Act even \nthreatens to break up Indian families. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of a column, which Jack Anderson and Michael Binstein wrote on the \nsubject in December of 1993, appear in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The protection that the Trading With Indians Act provided in 1834 can \nnow be provided under the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Government \nEmployees. The intent here is to provide adequate safeguards against \nconflicts of interest, while not unreasonably denying individuals and \ntheir families the ability to live and work--and create jobs--in their \ncommunities.\n  Both Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Interior \nDepartment Assistant Secretary Ada Deer have expressed support for the \nlegislation to repeal the 1834 Act. Secretary Shalala, in a letter \ndated November 17, 1993, noted that repeal ``could improve the ability \nof IHS to recruit and retain medical professional employees in remote \nlocations. It is more difficult for IHS to recruit and retain medical \nprofessionals to work in remote reservation facilities if their spouses \nare prohibited from engaging in business activities with the local \nIndian residents, particularly since employment opportunities for \nspouses are often very limited in these locations.''\n  Let me cite one very specific case in which the law has come into \nplay. It involved Ms. Karen Arviso, who served as the Navajo area IHS \nhealth promotion and disease prevention coordinator. Ms. Arviso was one \nof those people who played a particularly critical role during the \noutbreak of the hantavirus in the Navajo area several years ago. She \nput in long hours traveling to communities across the reservation in an \neffort to educate people about the mysterious disease.\n  Instead of thanks for her dedication and hard work, Ms. Arviso \nreceived a notice that she was to be fired because her husband applied \nfor a small business loan from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The \nTrading With Indians Act would require it. What sense does that make?\n  Mr. President, repeal of the Trading With Indians Act is long \noverdue. I hope we will pass this legislation today unanimously, and \nthat the House will act on it promptly.\n\n[[Page S16438]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Anderson/Binstein column be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 6, 1993]\n\n                  An Obsolete Law Endangers a Marriage\n\n                (By Jack Anderson and Michael Binstein)\n\n       This fall, Albert Hale nearly decided to make what he \n     regarded as the ultimate sacrifice for his beloved wife of \n     five years: divorce her.\n       I don't want my wife to go to jail,'' Hale said. ``If I can \n     save her from going to jail by divorcing her then that's a \n     real option.''\n       The possibility made the Hales heartsick, and left their \n     young daughter--who overheard one of their hushed \n     discussions--distraught. But a 160-year-old federal law \n     offered little latitude. The Trading with Indians Act of 1834 \n     carries a six-month jail sentence and/or up to a $5,000 fine, \n     and the ``case'' against Regina Hale appeared to be open and \n     shut. If there's a lesson, it may be that old and obsolete \n     laws die hard.\n       The law prohibits all ``commercial'' trading with American \n     Indians by Indian Health Service or Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     employees or ``in the name of a family member or spouse'' of \n     an employee.\n       An IHS official told us there weren't many violations of \n     the law until the government started hiring greater numbers \n     of Native Americans whose spouses often work on the \n     reservations and own businesses. The two main employers on \n     most reservations are the tribal government and the federal \n     government.\n       Albert and Regina Hale are American Indians who were born \n     and reared on the Navajo reservation in Window Rock, Ariz. \n     She is now employed as a personnel staffing assistant for the \n     IHS. He has practiced law on the reservation since 1972. They \n     are raising Regina's 9-year-old daughter in their own house \n     on a 1\\1/2\\-acre lot on the reservation, because that's \n     ``where we're from.''\n       There they lived as a normal happy family, until one \n     morning when Regina opened the mail and discovered that the \n     marriage rendered her in ``violation'' of the Trading with \n     Indians Act and would be ``cause for severe disciplinary \n     action, as well as criminal penalties.''\n       ``We were appalled by the letter . . . but what do you do? \n     How do you as a married couple resolve this? Maybe the best \n     thing to do is get divorced,'' Albert Hale told our \n     associate, Andrew Conte.\n       When the law was enacted, Congress feared that non-Indian \n     officials of the War Department would set up shops on the \n     reservations to fleece Indians of the funds they received \n     from the government. Nearly 160 years later, this dusty \n     relic is haunting Regina and Albert Hale, as well as other \n     Indian couples who work for the IHS or the BIA and who own \n     businesses on reservations.\n       In another case, Karen Arviso, who worked last summer in \n     Crownpoint, N.M., as a community outreach worker to help \n     locate the causes of a mysterious fatal virus in the \n     Southwest, almost lost her job because of the law. When her \n     husband applied for a loan at the BIA to open a gas station \n     on the Navajo reservation, IHS informed her that she would \n     have to resign if he started the business.\n       ``This is one of those anachronisms,'' Rep. Jon Kyl (R-\n     Ariz.) told us. ``The law was needed back 150 years ago, but \n     now you don't need it. This is just one of those things we \n     ought to get off the books because unfortunately real people \n     are in violation of real law and we don't intend for that \n     situation to exist.''\n       Kyl and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) are leading the crusade \n     to repeal the law in Congress.\n       Though the law has seldom been enforced this century, the \n     few instances in which it has been invoked caused \n     inconvenience rather than imprisonment.\n       In the early 1980s, an assistant secretary of BIA who \n     wanted to rent his house to an Indian was prevented from \n     doing so. An official at IHS told us other employees of that \n     agency had been prevented from selling Avon products in \n     predominantly Indian neighborhoods.\n       Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala has \n     promised not to fire or prosecute IHS employees because of \n     violations, but word has apparently not reached Arizona. An \n     IHS official there said ``they haven't heard anything'' about \n     not prosecuting the cases and therefore the Hales and the \n     handful of other people affected by the law are ``still under \n     the gun.''\n       Regina Hale promises to fight.\n       ``My daughter heard us the other night talking about \n     getting a divorce and she . . . started to cry because she \n     didn't understand,'' she said. ``We're going to live through \n     this and we're going to fight.''\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask unanimous consent the bill be deemed read a third \ntime and passed as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 325) was deemed read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 325\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
