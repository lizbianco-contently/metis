We also know that You require us to do justly, love mercy, and \nwalk humbly with You, attentively receptive to Your guidance. \nIntegrity, honesty, faithfulness have not gone out of style; nor has \nabsolute trust in You ceased to be the secret for personal peace and \nthe basis of great leadership.

Mr. President, the 25 minutes has been reserved for \nMembers of the freshman focus group, as we continue our effort to seek \nto focus some of the issues as they appear to those of us who are new \nto the Senate this year, who recently completed an election, who, I \nthink, in some instances have a unique view of what we are doing or \nseeking to do here in the U.S. Senate. So I would like to take a few \nminutes. I will be joined by other Members.\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk just a little bit this morning \nabout process. I admit to not knowing the rules of this place like some \ndo. I seek to know them. I think I do understand that there is a \ndifference between the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House and that they \nwere designed to be different. This is a deliberative body. The rules \nare different, which provide for additional discussion and debate, and \nI understand that, and I think that is proper, certainly.\n  But, you know, we did not come here to procrastinate. We did not come \nhere to extend debate for the purpose of extending debate. We came here \nfor the purpose of thoroughly examining the issues that are before us, \nlooking at the alternatives, and seeking, then, I think, to find some \nsolutions. And that is what voting is all about. If you do not have \nenough votes, you lose. If you have enough votes, you win. And you go \non to something else.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me it has become routine in this session \nof the Congress to extend, to amend, and to debate and, frankly, to \nstall. We have seen a great deal of that. Whether it is unfunded \nmandates, whether it is line-item veto, whether it is balanced budget \namendment, whether it is telecommunications, whether it is product \nliability, we find this interminable number of amendments, many of \nwhich have already been done.\n  Yesterday was a good example. We had extended debate over an issue \nthat had already, I think in almost anyone's mind, been resolved. But \nwe went on. We now will have had 4 days of debate. This is an important \nissue. But everyone rises in the beginning and says: I want regulatory \nreform, but--but--but we want to do it in the right way. The right way \nis a pretty subjective kind of thing. What is right to you is not \nnecessarily right to me.\n  So I guess I am expressing a certain amount of frustration, in that \nit seems to me we have accomplished a considerable amount in the \nSenate, but we have an awful lot before us. We have an opportunity in \nAugust to be home in our districts to talk to people about the \ndirection this country ought to take, to talk to people about specific \nitems. Frankly, that time in August is being constricted. I think it is \nalmost certain we will not be available to go \n\n[[Page S 9828]]\nhome as early as we thought we would. We have a lot of things to do. We \nhave not even gotten to the budget--which, by the way, I think we ought \nto do every 2 years instead of 1. But, nevertheless, that is another \nissue.\n  So we have a great deal to do, a great many things. Welfare reform--\nwe have not even talked about that. The items that have been very high \non the agenda of the American people we have not gotten to.\n  So I guess I am expressing my frustration about the system. I urge my \ncolleagues to take some self-analysis. Certainly, everyone is entitled \nto talk. Everyone is entitled to have an amendment. Everyone is \nentitled to have a view. But they are not entitled to stall the \nprogress. They are not entitled to say we want more amendments, and \nwhen the time comes for amendments there are none to be talked about.\n  The elections we had--every election, but more particularly the last \nelection--was about change. It was about doing something; about making \nthings different than they are. Almost everybody agrees to that. \nEverybody stands up and says we are for change, and then resists \nchange. I understand there is a philosophical difference, and properly \nthere can be. There are those who do not want to change. I understand \nthat. There are those who support the status quo, and I understand \nthat. I do not object to that. I do not object to disagreement. I do \nnot object to argument. But I do object to the fact that we never come \nto a decision, and that is what it should be all about.\n  I think there is a message: The status quo is not good enough. That \nis clear. No one says there should not be regulations. Of course, there \nshould be regulations. Of course, it should not be changed to where we \ndo not have clean air and clean water, and that is not the purpose of \nthis. Of course, we ought not to do things that threaten health. \nClearly this does not do that. This bill is a procedural bill that \ntakes into account some processes in arriving at the implementation of \nregulations. That is what it is about. We have said specifically it is \na supplement. It does not supersede the issues. But that does not seem \nto be good enough. We continue to rehash and go over that. I am \nexpressing a little frustration, Mr. President.\n  In any event, we do need meaningful change. There is no question but \nwhat we are overregulated. There is no question but what the process of \ngiving a grazing lease in Wyoming--that now requires a NEPA \nenvironmental impact study as if it were a national environmental \nchange. It is a renewal of a 50-year-old process that has been going \non.\n  Those are the kinds of things that we need to change. The law \nprovides for multiple use of the land. But you cannot get on the land \nbecause the regulation, as it is implemented, is so costly that doing \narchaeological surveys and those kinds of things we are looking for is \nnot a process that allows regulations to be implemented in a common-\nsense kind of a way.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can move forward. I hope we can move forward \non this issue. Frankly, it affects everyone. We think it affects us in \nthe West a little more where 50 percent of the land is owned by the \nFederal Government. So that anything you do in the Federal Government, \nif it has to do with recreation or has to do with hunting or has to do \nwith grazing or has to do with mineral production, has to go through \nthis extensive regulatory process. That needs to be changed. I do not \nthink there is a soul who would say, ``Oh, no. It does not need to be \nchanged.''\n  Take a look at what we have done in 3 days. We say it needs to be \nchanged. But there are 32 amendments or so sitting out there, many of \nwhich have already been dealt with which have nothing to do with \ncreating a strong bill but have more to do with simply moving back the \ntime when we make decisions.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we do move forward. I hope we can deal with \nissues as they are before us and come to some closure, come to some \nresolution. That is why we are here. That is why we came here. We are \ntrustees. We are trustees for the voters, we are trustees for the \ncitizens, and they are the beneficiaries. They should expect something \nfrom us. That is our opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9827-6", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9828-S9829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to continue discussions on the \nComprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, in an effort to protect the American consumer and \ntaxpayer from pollution, faulty products, contaminants, unfair business \npractices and threats to their livelihood and health, our Government \nhas in fact buried us under a mountain of Federal redtape and \nregulation that far exceeds any recognizable benefit. As a result, the \nAmerican economy stagnates and the American public continues to be \nsubjected to the ever-increasing presence of the Federal Government in \nour business practices and in our daily lives.\n  It is ironic that in an effort to protect the American people and the \nAmerican industry the Federal Government has become an impediment. The \ngreatest challenges to American industry and businesses do not come \nfrom dwindling natural resources or from competition from Europe and \nJapan, or from any number of social and economic challenges facing our \nsociety and culture today. Arguably, the greatest challenges facing \nAmerican businesses and industries and the Americans who depend on them \nare the burdens placed on them by their own Federal Government; a \nGovernment that may or may not always have the best intentions but \nwhose sole purpose is to protect and promote the common good, not to \nsuffocate or stymie its citizens' and industries' well-intentioned and \nlawful pursuits. The need for substantial and fundamental regulatory \nreform cannot be overstated.\n  As we have heard in the last 3 days, the cost of regulation in this \ncountry now exceeds $560 billion every year. It is growing rapidly. And \nit is the rate of this growth which, like that of the national debt, \nthat is so disturbing--growth, unfortunately, that produces no \ncorresponding rise in benefits to either the economy or the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, we have now reached the point where the cost of \nsupposedly protecting ourselves, our businesses and our industries from \nourselves now more than doubles the dollar value that we spend on \ndefending our Nation from foreign enemies. Part of the fault is our \nown. In the past Congress has failed to control the regulating agencies \nthat fall under its jurisdiction. Congress has failed to scrutinize the \nexpense of a regulation as closely as we have included such items in \nthe budget. Congress has failed to consider the cost of regulation to \nthe economy.\n  But just as we are fixing today our budget problems, we can reduce \nour regulatory burden if we have the will to do so. I believe the \nlegislation before us is a positive, necessary and long overdue step in \nthat direction.\n  Mr. President, the regulatory machine in our Government is out of \ncontrol. Regulating agencies have become something akin to nonelected \nlawmakers, and almost predatory in nature when dealing with many \nindustries and businesses. These agencies refuse to follow even the \nsimplest of commonsense guidelines requiring validation of their \nactions for the common good, and that benefits realized from their \nactions outweigh the costs incurred.\n  Where was this simple American principle lost on the Federal \nGovernment? These are the principles which American citizens follow in \ntheir everyday lives, and it should not be difficult or unreasonable \nfor the Government to operate that way also. The arrogance and the \npaternalism that has typified too much of the rulemaking in this \ncountry must end. People are tired of it.\n  The provisions of this bill are based on the commonsense principles \nthat guide a free market economy in a democracy. These are the very \nsame principles that played a critical role in building the America we \nknow today. At the centerpiece of this legislation is cost-benefit \nanalysis. In simple terms, it dictates that before a new regulation \n\n[[Page S 9829]]\ncan be implemented it must be determined to be more beneficial to the \npublic good than it will cost the economy.\n  While cost-benefit analysis has been used in the determination of new \nrules before, it clearly has not been the guiding principle. This bill \ndictates that it must now be the centerpiece of the formulation of any \nnew rule and the basis for its justification or its dismissal.\n  This legislation also establishes--or reestablishes--that regulating \nagencies prioritize their formulation of new rules. Simply stated, that \nmeans the greatest dangers to the public must be addressed first and \nmust be dealt with in the most cost-effective way.\n  The Government should no longer be allowed to saddle the economy with \na supposed protective measure that clearly does not justify the cost it \nincurs.\n  With the inclusion of standardized risk assessment guidelines and \ndecisional criteria, this legislation is designed to prevent extensive \npromulgation of excessive rules from occurring again as it has in the \npast.\n  Mr. President, one of the most encouraging and commonsense provisions \nof this legislation is that it compels the Federal Government to use \nmarket-based alternatives rather than proscriptive brute force \nregulation. Such measures have thus far proven to be extremely \neffective. They are also less costly, and they are fair.\n  One of the most common complaints I hear from businesses, both large \nand small, is the unnecessarily strict and archaic nature of the \nDelaney clause, or the rule that says even very small traces, trace \nelements of materials deemed unhealthy prohibit a company from offering \nthat product to the public. The problem is that technology today has \nprogressed far enough and so rapidly from the time the Delaney clause \nwas first introduced that we can now detect these trace elements of \nsubstances that simply could never have been detected before and at \nlevels that cannot be reasonably argued to be detrimental to ones \nhealth. However, the law has not changed to fit that reality. Such an \ninflexibility does not have the best interests of the public in mind. \nThis legislation will in large part remedy that problem, and not a \nminute too soon.\n  This bill reinforces what this body passed earlier this year in the \nform of the congressional review, S. 219, of any new major rules. This \nprovision will ultimately allow elected lawmakers--not regulatory \nagency bureaucrats--to decide if the new rule is in the best interest \nof the public before rules are applied.\n And perhaps the most encouraging provision of this legislation is the \nexplicit instruction it includes to minimize the impact on small \nbusinesses when formulating and applying rules.\n\n  Mr. President, it is high time we reapply this simple set of \nprinciples by which the economy and society function to the way our \nGovernment works. It is time to hold the Government accountable to the \nsame standards which the public must meet every day. It is unfortunate, \nif not ludicrous, that it would be any other way, and it is no wonder \nthat the American electorate is restless and upset with their \nGovernment.\n  During the course of this debate, we have heard many examples, both \ntelling and anecdotal. These examples remind us exactly how \nunprincipled and how out of control our Government can sometimes be. \nSome of the instances of the regulatory machine run amok are almost \nunbelievable in their egregious violation of common sense and \nindividual rights. But the one fact that must be kept in mind is that \nour Government operates in such a way that the common good is no longer \nthe goal. Regulation has become a goal in and of itself. Not only is \nthat dangerous, it is unfair and extraordinarily expensive--almost $600 \nbillion a year.\n  This legislation should be viewed as nothing short of a necessary \ncomplement to what we are striving to accomplish in balancing our \nbudget. Indeed, this legislation could be viewed as the opportunity to \ngive the American public the biggest tax cut in its history without so \nmuch as increasing the deficit or reducing benefits by a single cent.\n  We would be remiss in our duties as popularly elected officials if we \nfailed in this opportunity by failing to pass this important \nlegislation or by passing it in a form so watered down as to hardly \ncheck the regulatory machine at all. I strongly urge my colleagues not \nto miss this opportunity and not to let special interests or partisan \nconcerns guide our upcoming votes.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9828-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9829-S9830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REGULATORY REFORM COST-BENEFIT LANGUAGE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee at the \nconclusion of his remarks started talking about something that is very, \nvery significant and has been left out of this debate. I have a few \ncomments to make, and then I wish to follow up on that. And that is the \nbudget ramifications of an overregulated society.\n  I am an original cosponsor of the Dole bill. However, I will say that \nI do not believe the bill goes far enough. I would like to have it \nstronger. It does not include a supermandate which would make the new \ncost-benefit provisions apply to all regulations. It specifically \nexempts those statutes which set a lesser standard in the statutory \nlanguage. These exempted laws include many of the environmental \nstatutes such as the Clean Air Act, which really does need a strong \ncost-benefit provision.\n  Half of all regulations issued are from the EPA, and half of all the \nEPA regulations are under the Clean Air Act. So that is why that act is \nso significant. We need to protect human health, but the EPA has gone \nway too far.\n  At the time of the Clean Air Act, the head of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services told the Office of Management and Budget that \nthey had no issues with the air bill. The only health benefit, \naccording to HHS, was removing benzene from gas. This is the head of \nthe public health department saying the bill was not protecting health.\n  When EPA determines risk in their risk assessments they use something \ncalled the maximum exposed individual, which is a person who spends \nevery day of their life, 24 hours a day for 70 years, underneath the \nfactory vent breathing the discharges. And I do not know anybody like \nthat. That is totally unreasonable.\n  They also use the maximum tolerated dose for rats, which is when they \nstuff so much of the substance that they are studying into a rat the \nrat is going to die from stress.\n  For part of the Clean Air Act, they also observed the effects of \nemissions on asthma patients. But what they did was take away their \nmedicine and force them to jog in 110 degrees heat, and nobody does \nthis. This again is not realistic. The only realism you will find is in \nthe minds of bureaucrats who do not live in the real world.\n  We can get 90 percent of the benefits from 10 percent of the costs. \nWhat EPA is trying to do is reach that final 10 percent of the benefits \nwhich incurs the rest of the costs, which is 90 percent. You do not \nneed to be a rocket scientist to understand that 10 percent of the \nbenefits is not worth 90 percent of the costs.\n  We should require that benefits outweigh or exceed the costs of \nregulation. When you reach that 90 percent benefit level, you reach a \npoint of diminishing returns. We are paying for much more than we are \ngetting. Businesses do not operate this way, at least they do not \noperate this way very long, and neither do consumers. The Government \ndefinitely should not either. For an incremental benefit of 1 percent, \nwe should only have to pay an incremental cost of 1 percent or less. \nNowhere else but in the Federal Government do people spend $1 million \nto get $100 worth of benefit, and we must end this practice.\n  The Clean Air Act refinery MACT rule is a perfect example. As \nproposed, the rule would cost approximately $10 million and only save \nless than one-half of one life.\n  The cost-benefit language in the Dole bill is good but not good \nenough. And it is a shame it does not apply to all existing statutes. \nAs a Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I will \nstrive to place good cost-benefit language in all future \nreauthorizations, yet I must point out my disappointment with the cost-\nbenefit language in this bill. Perhaps we can work together and \nstrengthen it later. And, \n\n[[Page S 9830]]\nof course, it is the only dog in this hunt at this time.\n  Let me suggest something. Yesterday, I ran out of time when I was \ntalking about the Regulatory Reform Act, and there are a couple of \nexamples that I wanted to use. I had used some examples from around the \ncountry, but I did not use the local examples.\n  Once before, when we were talking about Superfund abuse, which we are \ndealing with here also, I told the story of a very close personal \nfriend of mine in Tulsa, OK. His name is Jimmy Dunn. His family has \nMill Creek Lumber Co. It is the third generation to run this lumber \ncompany--highly competitive. It is in an environment in which many of \nthem do not exist; they are not able to survive.\n  He called me up. At that time, I was a Member of the House. He said, \n``Congressman Inhofe, the EPA has just put me out of business.'' I \nsaid, ``What did you do wrong?'' And Jimmy Dunn said, ``I don't think I \ndid anything wrong, but for the last 10 years we have been using the \nsame contractor to sell our used crankcase oil.'' And that contractor \nwas licensed by the Federal Government; he was licensed by the State \nGovernment; he was licensed by Tulsa County, and yet they traced some \nof the crankcase oil from this contractor to the Double Eagle Superfund \nsite.\n  He read the letter he received from the administrator of the EPA, the \nlast paragraph of which said we are going to impose $25,000-a-day fines \non you and possible criminal sanctions.\n  Now, we were able to stop that, but for every one that we find out \nabout and are able to help, there are thousands that we do not find out \nabout.\n  I had a visitor in my office yesterday who is the administrator of \nthe endangered species here and a very nice lady, and we visited about \nit. She said, ``Well, I can count on both hands the number of \nprosecutions we have had. It is fictitious to say that we are being \nabusive in the Endangered Species Act.'' I said, ``You miss the point \naltogether.'' For each one that is ultimately a conviction or a \nprosecution, you have 100,000 of them out there that are threats, that \nare threatening those people who are working hard, making money to pay \ntaxes for all this fun that we are having up here.\n  I have a guy that I met 4 days before Christmas. His name is Keith \nCarter. Keith Carter lives in a little town in Oklahoma--Skiatook, OK--\njust north of Tulsa, OK. It is a very small community. Keith Carter \ndeveloped a spray that he puts on horses. I do not know what it does, \nbut apparently there is a market for it. Keith Carter called me 4 days \nbefore Christmas and Keith Carter said, ``Congressman, EPA has just put \nme out of business and I have to fire my only four employees 4 days \nbefore Christmas.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair. I do want to finish this story.\n  What had happened in the case of Keith Carter is that Keith Carter \nhad moved his location from his basement up the street three houses for \na larger place. He told the EPA regional office in Texas about it, but \nhe did not tell the office in Washington, and so they took away his \nnumber. So we got his number back. It took 3 weeks to do it. Finally, \nwe got his number back.\n  He called me back. He said, ``Congressman, I have another problem; \nnow I can't use my inventory, 25,000 dollars' worth of silkscreen \nbottles, because they have the old number on them.''\n Well, this is the type of harassment that has taken place.\n\n  Lastly, since the Senator from Tennessee brought this up, there is a \nbrilliant guy, a Dr. Bruce Yandle from Clemson University, that made a \ndiscovery that everyone should focus on at this time. We are all \nconcerned about deficits. What he discovered was--and he skewed this \ndraft out for us--that there is a direct relationship between the \nnumber of pages in the Federal Register, which indicates the number of \nregulations, and the deficit. These yellow bars down here signify and \nrepresent the deficits during these years starting all the way back in \n1950 going up to the current year. And if you look at this, it follows \nexactly along the line of the pages in the Federal Register. So, I \nwould say to those individuals, if you are looking for another excuse, \nif you do not believe that we have an obtrusive, abusive Government, \nthen look at it from a fiscal standpoint. If you really want to balance \nthe budget, to eliminate the deficit, there is no single greater thing \nwe can do than stop the excessive regulations in our society. And this \nis our opportunity to do it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized under \nthe previous order to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Kassebaum and Mr. Kennedy pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1028 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Nearly all of us in this \nChamber know that there are many Americans confronted these days with \nregulations that they think do not represent common sense, regulations \nthat are too burdensome, regulations that do not seem appropriate or \nright. I understand that. I think some of that does exist. And when and \nwhere it exists, we ought to put an end to it. Americans have enough \ntrouble without having to deal with regulations that do not make sense.\n  But the story of regulations is a story with more than one chapter. \nAnother part of the regulations story is the regulations that we have \nput in place that improve life in this country; regulations that \nrequire inspection of food so that we have safe food to eat; \nregulations that require an approval by the Food and Drug \nAdministration of drugs that are being proposed to be marketed in this \ncountry so that consumers have some confidence that these drugs are \nsafe; regulations that prohibit big corporations from dumping their \nchemicals into our streams and into our lakes and rivers; regulations \nthat prohibit big corporations from pouring pollution into our air. \nMany of those regulations are critically important, and we ought to \nkeep them.\n  It is interesting, most of what we see in the Congress is a debate \nabout failure, it is never much a debate about success. Let me just for \na moment describe for my colleagues a success.\n  Today, we use twice as much energy in this country than we did 20 \nyears ago, but we have in this country today, by all standards of \nmeasurement, cleaner air. Why would we have cleaner air, less \npollution, less smog in this country today than we did 20 years ago if \nwe use twice as much energy? Because this country and this Congress \nsaid we are going to change the way we behave in this country; we are \nnot going to allow polluters to any longer pollute the air; we are \ngoing to require them to clean up their emissions. And the result is a \nsuccess story. It has been the Clean Air Act, with all of its \nimperfections, that has stopped the degradation of America's air. That \nis a success.\n  Should we retreat on that? Should we decide that regulations that \nrequire corporations to stop polluting are burdensome so, therefore, \nthey should not have to stop polluting? Should we go back to the good \nold days where we dump all this pollution into the air and let our kids \nbreathe it and say it does not matter, that we can deal with the \nconsequences later? I do not think so. I do not think the American \npeople would believe that we want to go back to those days.\n  How about water? There is a book by Gregg Easterbrook recently \npublished that talks about these success stories. We have less acid \nrain and cleaner water these days than we had 20, 25 years ago. You all \nremember the story about the Hudson River starting on fire.\n  Now why would a river start to burn? Because of this enormous amount \nof pollution that was going on in this \n\n[[Page S 9831]]\ncountry. Now our rivers and lakes and streams are cleaner and we have \nless acid rain. Why is that the case? Is it because someone decided in \na corporate boardroom someplace we really have to stop doing this, we \nhave to spend money to stop doing it to clean up our water? No, it is \nnot because of that. It is because Congress decided this ought to stop \nand that reasonable regulations and rules ought to require the big \npolluters to stop polluting. The result is, we have cleaner air and \ncleaner water.\n  Are all these regulations perfect? No, not at all. Should some be \nchanged? Yes. But should we retreat in this country on the requirement \nwith reasonable regulations to say to those who would pollute our air \nand water you have to stop polluting? Of course not. We should not \nretreat on that. What we have done there is a success story for our \ncountry.\n  Should we retreat on food safety? Of course not. That is not what the \nAmerican people expect us to be doing.\n  Now, I have been interested in the way this debate has gone here in \nthe Senate. It has gone like every other bill we have seen this year. A \nbill is brought to the floor of the Senate and, within hours, the \nmajority party starts complaining about the minority party stalling. \nWell, this bill was brought to the floor of the Senate much as \nregulatory reform bills were brought to the committee on which I serve, \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. The first such bill we saw in \ncommittee was a moratorium, a regulatory moratorium; and the majority \nparty thought, gee, this really sounds great, we will just stop \neverything, no more rules will be issued. No more regulations will be \nissued. We will stop them in their tracks until a time certain later.\n  Some of us said that does not make sense. We said the bill does not \ndiscriminate between good and bad rules, good regulations and bad \nregulations. We decided to offer some amendments. And so we offered \namendments on E. coli, on clean water, on cryptosporidium, on \nmammography standards, on commuter airline safety standards, which we \nwere sure the majority party did not want to interrupt. Did they really \nwant to interrupt a regulation that establishes the reasonable \nstandards for mammography screenings for breast cancer? No; it turns \nout that is not really what they intended to do. What about E. coli? \nDid they intend to allow for degradation of food safety standards? No; \nit turns out they did not intend to do that either. We went through a \nwhole series of amendments, and it turns out that is not what they \nreally intended to do.\n  Well, they come to the floor with a regulatory reform proposal, and \nwe have a number of amendments that we are prepared to offer. The fact \nis that you cannot get amendments up on the floor. Oh, we got one up \nyesterday and it took all day. The folks that offered the amendment \nwere ready to vote at noon. We did not vote until the end of the day. \nWhy? Well, because the other side is stalling, and they accuse us of \ndelaying. That is a curious, interesting approach to legislative \nstrategy. You stall and accuse the other side of delay. So far, there \nhave been 16 amendments offered on this bill; 14 of the 16 have been \noffered by the other side, and only two by those who want to change the \nbill or would support a substitute to the bill.\n  If we want to finish this bill--and I do--and if we want to move \nahead--and I think we should--we ought to decide to allow all these \namendments to be offered, the amendments that address the specific \nissues. Do you intend really to degrade seafood safety standards? I do \nnot think so. Let us offer an amendment to guarantee that is not the \ncase. Do you intend to undercut and degrade clean air standards? I do \nnot think so. Let us decide we want to vote on that.\n  Let us offer those amendments. I expect most people would be willing \nto offer them expeditiously, with time agreements, and we will vote on \nthem. And no one, in my judgment, could genuinely suggest anyone here \nis stalling. The stall comes from those who bring the bill to the floor \nbut do not want amendments offered that they do not want to vote on. \nThat is the stall. I understand that. But it is not the way we ought to \ndo bills. There are good regulations and bad regulations. We ought to \nget rid of the bad and keep the good.\n  I heard somebody this morning talk about the burden. We place an \nunfair burden on America's corporations with respect to regulations. \nWell, I will tell you, some corporations have relieved themselves of \nthat burden. Two or three applications a day are being approved for new \nplants on the maquiladora border, south of the Mexican-United States \nborder--two or three a day. These are new American plants that move to \nMexico. Why do they move down there? Because Mexico is a place where \nthey can produce things differently than in our country. First of all, \nit is much cheaper; they can pay lower wages, and often they can hire \nkids.\n  Second, they do not have the enforcement on environmental controls. \nYou can move your plant to Mexico and pollute. You do not have to be \nburdened by all of those unreasonable standards in the United States; \nif you are going to produce something, you should not pollute water and \nair. So it costs less to produce there.\n  Is it right? Is that the future? Is that what we want to have happen? \nI do not think so. Is the answer to it to decide we should not burden \nthem, that they should pollute while in this country? I do not think \nthat is the case either.\n  I think we have provided some good leadership with respect to our set \nof regulations on requiring polluters to stop polluting, in requiring \nthose who are involved in processing the meat in this country to \nprocess it in conditions that we feel are safe for the American \nconsumer. I do not understand those who believe that these are burdens \non America's corporations that must be relieved with a bill that cannot \nbe amended because they do not want to vote on these specific issues.\n  We have been treated in recent months to a lot of very substantial \nreforms, some of which I have thought made a lot of sense, some of \nwhich should have been passed when the Democrats controlled the \nCongress and were not. It is our fault. I voted for some of these \nreforms. I voted for unfunded mandates. I thought it made a lot of \nsense. I voted for the line-item veto. Some of these reforms make \nsense.\n  Some of these reforms brought to the floor of the Senate are \ninherently radical reforms, responding to the big money interests of \nthis country. Regulatory reform, for anybody who is interested, has \nbeen largely written by the special interests, by the large corporate \ninterests, largely written by the large corporate interests who want to \nget out from the burden of costly regulations. I understand that. I \nunderstand why they want to do that. But the public interest has been \nestablished here from our perspective that we want that burden imposed \nto require clean air and water and safe food and the rest.\n  We had a fight in North Dakota in the 1970's when they were going to \nprocess coal to produce electricity. I and the then Governor decided \nthe only way we were going to give water permits was to fight for the \nlatest available technology to be put on those plants, which included \nthen wet scrubbers, very expensive environmental control technology, in \norder to protect North Dakota's air. Well, obviously, the coal industry \nand others who were processing that coal, the electric generating \nindustry, did not want any part of that. They did not want that. Why? \nBecause it costs money. I understand why. I understand why they fought \nit. But we were right and we insisted on it, and we now have those \ncoal-fired generating plants in North Dakota. But the fact is the \nlatest available technology was included on those plants, which \nincluded wet scrubbers to reduce the effluent that goes into the air. I \ncannot be more pleased about the fight I was involved in in the 1970's \nrequiring that that happen. We were considered fairly radical at the \ntime. We were environmentalists. We were trying to impose costs on \nindustry. Yes, we were. We wanted those who purchased the electricity \nfrom those plants to help pay the costs of keeping the air clean. Is \nthat radical? Well, it was called radical, but I do not happen to think \nit is. I think it is right.\n  I am a little tired of special interests beating the drum and calling \nthe tune in this town, to suggest that somehow they now need their \nburdens relieved--especially when they tell us of those burdens of \nhaving to comply with the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, food safety \nstandards, and the like. \n\n[[Page S 9832]]\n\n  Yes, let us have regulatory reform, and let us do it in the right \nway. Let us be aggressive in making sure that regulations make good \ncommon sense. Let us get rid of silly, useless regulations, and let us \nget rid of the people that write those kinds of regulations. But, at \nthe same time, let us make sure that we protect this country with \nreasonable regulations that protect our air, water, food safety, and \nmore. That ought to be the job for all of us on the floor of this \nSenate. There ought not be any disagreement about it. Nor should there \nbe disagreement about whether anybody is stalling. If the majority \nparty will simply allow those who believe that amendments are necessary \nto this bill to be offered and debated, this bill will move, and move \nquickly--with proper amendments.\n  But it is disingenuous, in my judgment, to be delaying because you do \nnot want to vote on amendments, and then accuse the other side of \nstalling. That is not much of a legislative strategy and will not \nproduce much of a result for this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell).

Mr. President, I had hoped that the profound disaster in \nSrebrenica would have provoked a greater response from this \nadministration than what we have seen in the last 48 hours. Tens of \nthousands of Bosnians have fled, Dutch peacekeepers are being held \nhostage, young girls are being taken away by Bosnian Serb forces, and \nthe two other eastern enclaves--also U.N. designated safe havens--are \nunder continued attack. Yet, instead of leadership, all the \nadministration has to offer is press spokesmen to defend this \ncatastrophe.\n  The best defense would be a change in the present approach. However, \nthat is unlikely from what the cadre of administration spokesman have \nsaid.\n  Despite the obviousness of this colossal failure, Western leaders \ncling stubbornly to the myth that no other options exit.\n  There are reports that the administration is working with the allies \nto withdraw U.N. forces from the Eastern enclaves and redeploy them in \ncentral Bosnia and Sarajevo. In my view, this would be redefining \nfailure.\n  I remind my colleagues that in the spring of 1993, Secretary \nChristopher went to Europe with the lift-and-strike plan and returned \nwith the joint action plan. This plan was sold as the humanitarian \noption. The option that put the Bosnians' interests first. The joint \naction plan committed the United States, Britain, France, Russia, and \nthe European Union to the protection of six U.N.-designated safe havens \nand closing the borders between Serbia and Bosnia.\n  There are those of us who urged the administration not to go along \nwith this so-called plan, who warned that creating giant refugee camps \nwith minimal defense would support Serbian war aims. We were ignored.\n  I might say these suggestions came not just from this side but on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  The administration went ahead and what a trade. Two years later \nMilosevic is still sending supplies and troops across the border and, \nthe Bosnians are not only defenseless, but undefended.\n  Now we are faced with a widening catastrophe, but there is no longer \nany attempt to save the Bosnians--only to save face. The rapid reaction \nforce is intended to save face.\n  I believe that the United Nations must begin preparations for \nwithdrawal immediately. I am prepared to support the use of U.S. \nforces, if they are necessary, but under strict conditions.\n  If we have to use U.S. forces, it is going to be because of a total \nlack of policy by the Clinton administration. We are going to be backed \ninto the use of U.S. forces because of a lack of clear leadership by \nthis administration. That should be clear to everyone.\n  But even having said that, we have some obligations and I would be \nwilling to support use of U.S. forces--under strict conditions.\n  First, unified NATO command--no dual key.\n  Second, robust rules of engagement which provide for massive \nretaliation if any U.S. forces are attacked.\n  Third, all necessary measures are taken to protect United States and \nNATO personnel from likely threats--from any source, to include \nSerbia--to include the suppression of Serbian air defenses.\n  Fourth, no risking U.S. lives to save equipment.\n  Fifth, agreement from our allies to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia.\n  The administration must know that it will be held responsible and \nthat if these conditions are not met, the risk to U.S. forces will be \nfar greater than necessary.\n  Mr. President, the United Nations must withdraw and the arms embargo \nmust be lifted. The United States cannot continue to subsidize and \nsupport a U.N. mission that serves largely to supervise ethnic \ncleansing and aggression. The United States must exercise leadership \nand support the fundamental right of self-defense.\n  I listened last night to one of the spokesmen, a White House press \nperson, talking about Bosnia. He said, ``Well, we cannot afford to lift \nthe arms embargo. That would cost us money.''\n  What does he think we are spending now? We are spending a great deal \nof money, and we are picking up 31 percent of the tab right now in \nBosnia. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent by \nthe U.S. taxpayers. So I wish if they are going to trot out the press \nspokesmen, at least they should have the facts correct and tell the \nAmerican people the truth, and give them an accurate report of what is \nactually happening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9832-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9832-S9833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? LOOK AT THE ARITHMETIC\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on that evening in 1972 when I learned that \nI had been elected to the Senate, I made a commitment to myself that I \nwould never fail to see any young person, or any group of young people, \nwho wanted to see me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned about the magnitude of the Federal \ndebt that Congress has run up for the coming generations to pay. The \nyoung people and I always discuss the fact that under the U.S. \nConstitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that has \nnot first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate \nof the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 22, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record of the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, Wednesday, July \n12, stood at $4,927,810,673,266.79 or $18,706.05 for every man, woman, \nand child in America on a per capita basis.\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, I have sought this special order for \nrecognition this morning to renew my urging that the Senate conduct \noversight hearings into the incident at Ruby Ridge, a subject that I \nhave spoken on at length on the Senate floor--on May 9, 10, 11, 18 and \n26--and on those occasions urged that hearings be conducted before the \nAugust recess because of what I view to be the urgency of the \nsituation.\n  I renew that request in light of the release by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation yesterday, and the extensive publicity in the news media \ntoday, reporting on the suspension of a ranking FBI agent involved in \nthe Ruby Ridge incident, the suspension occurring ``after authorities \nallege that he destroyed a document that could have altered the \nofficial account of what happened at the standoff on August 22, 1992.''\n  Mr. President, it has been my judgment for some considerable period \nof time that the Congress has been derelict in failing to have \noversight hearings on very serious matters involving Federal law \nenforcement operations in the United States, and that it is up to the \nCongress as a matter of congressional oversight to make sure that there \nis accountability at all levels of the Federal Government.\n  I have considered very carefully the very heavy responsibility of law \nenforcement officials, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms, and others, agencies that I have worked with extensively over \nmy whole career of public service--since I was district attorney of \nPhiladelphia--and have a full appreciation of the very high risks that \nlaw enforcement officers at all levels undertake. But there is great \nconcern in America today about excessive Federal authority, and about \nthe incidents which have occurred not only at Waco but also at Ruby \nRidge.\n  This is in line with the concern in this country, which is as old as \nthe Declaration of Independence itself, in challenging the legitimacy \nof government.\n  That brought the revolution and the founding of the United States of \nAmerica. Our history is full of challenges to be sure that the Bill of \nRights is respected. It is no coincidence that the United States has \nhad the longest record in world history for stable government, no \ncoincidence that record is the result of having a Bill of Rights which \nhas been meticulously enforced, and one of the agencies of enforcement \nis the constitutional prerogative and responsibility of the Congress of \nthe United States to conduct oversight.\n  Mr. President, it is a matter of the utmost gravity when there are \nallegations that there has been the destruction of a document which \ncould shed light on what happened at Ruby Ridge, and this is only \nanother step along the way on matters which already were in the public \nrecord suggesting substantial impropriety.\n  In my statement on the Senate floor on May 26, I referred to a letter \nfrom FBI Special Agent Eugene Glenn, who was on the scene at Ruby \nRidge, and who was disciplined, and Mr. Glenn had this to say on page 6 \nof an extensive letter which he wrote to Mr. Michael Shaheen of the \nJustice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility:\n\n       On August 22, 1992, then Assistant Director Potts advised \n     during a telephonic conversation with the special agent in \n     charge that he had approved the rules of engagement and that \n     he articulated his reasons for his adjustments to the Bureau \n     standard shooting policy.\n\n  At that time, I called the attention of my colleagues to the fact \nthat in my personal conversation with Mr. Potts on May 17, he said to \nme categorically, ``There was never a change in the rules of \nengagement.'' And Mr. Potts advised me further that there was ``no \nauthorization to change the deadly force policy.''\n  Mr. President, as I have said previously in this Chamber, I have \ntalked extensively to people who have participated, been involved in \nthe incident at Ruby Ridge. I talked to Mr. Randy Weaver at some length \nback on May 13, 1995, and got his account of what was truly a tragic \nincident which resulted in the killing of a deputy U.S. marshal, the \nkilling of Mr. Weaver's young son, Sam, who was shot in the back, and \nthe killing of Mr. Weaver's wife, who was holding their infant \ndaughter.\n  The entire incident involving Mr. Weaver occurred, according to Mr. \nWeaver, when he was approached by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms asking if he could sell them sawed-off shotguns, \nwhich apparently he later did in a context where a court found it to be \nentrapment. I questioned Mr. John Magaw, the Director of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and he conceded to me that there was \nwhat he called borderline entrapment in the Weaver case.\n  So that you have a sequence of events of Mr. Weaver living in \nBoundary County, ID, right next to the Canadian border, really wanting \nto be left alone, an incident with this issue of entrapment, and later \nthe marshals coming to the premises of the Weaver household. And then \nyou have an incident, tragic, the killing of a deputy U.S. marshal, two \nmembers of the Weaver family, and then a dispute as to whether the FBI \nacted properly under the rules of engagement; and then yesterday the \ndisclosure that in fact there had been some indication of further \nwrongdoing.\n  This is a matter, Mr. President, in which it seems to me it is \nimperative that the Congress of the United States exercise its \noversight responsibilities.\n  We have had on the record for some time glaring conflicts which need \nto be investigated, inquired into by the Congress--the disparity \nbetween Special Agent Glenn, who is in charge of the FBI office in Salt \nLake City, and the account of Mr. Potts, who has since been promoted to \nthe position of Deputy Director of the FBI.\n  As noted in this morning's Washington Post:\n\n       Last year, a Justice Department task force sharply \n     criticized the FBI action during the incident.\n\n  Referring to Ruby Ridge.\n\n       The task force concluded that the Bureau's conduct \n     ``contravened the Constitution'' and that criminal charges \n     should be considered against the responsible agents. The task \n     force report was forwarded for comment to the Justice \n     Department's Office of Professional Responsibility and the \n     Civil Rights Division. Those offices in their evaluations \n     held that no criminal conduct took place.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I submit that in the context of a task force \nreport saying the Constitution has been violated and suggesting \ncriminal prosecution, and a disagreement within the Department of \nJustice itself, that we have is the quintessential circumstance where \nthe Congress of the United States has oversight responsibilities. And \nyet we sit by idly and do nothing.\n  I have said on the Senate floor that in my judgment Congress has been \nderelict in its duties. I think it is a matter of nonfeasance, the \nfailure to perform a positive obligation and a positive duty. And for \nthe Congress, the Senate, the Judiciary Committee to continue to turn \nits back would amount to more than nonfeasance, perhaps misfeasance, \nperhaps malfeasance.\n  There is great unrest in America today, Mr. President, as we all \nknow, with the development of extensive militia around the country and \na vivid, active distrust for what goes on in Washington. I can \nunderstand that distrust in the face of what I see personally as a \nMember of the Senate and as a Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nI not only understand that distrust and skepticism, but I share it in \nthe absence of any oversight having been undertaken by the Congress, \nthe Senate, and the Judiciary Committee on these important matters.\n  I made an effort to hold these hearings with the Subcommittee on \nTerrorism, the subcommittee which has jurisdiction over these matters, \nand I was thwarted in that attempt to do so. And I took the highly \nunusual step of bringing the matter to the floor of the Senate in a \nresolution calling for hearings on Ruby Ridge, among other things, in \nadvance of the August 4 recess.\n  I had no doubt, Mr. President, no naivete that that resolution was \nnot going to be adopted in the face of our standards as to prerogatives \nof chairmen, but it seemed to me sufficiently serious to bring it to \nthe floor of the Senate and to bring it to a head.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the Terrorism Subcommittee, I have had \na \n\n[[Page S 9834]]\nseries of hearings, four hearings on the subject, one of which involved \nthe militia where law enforcement officials from the FBI, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the State police chief from Missouri, \nand prosecuting attorneys from Phoenix, AZ, and Musselshell County, MT, \ncame forward and testified about the dangers of the militia and at the \nsame time, same hearing, a second panel testified about the reasons why \nthe militia are growing in the United States, members of the militia \ntalking about the distrust of what goes on in Washington,\n accusing the committee, accusing the Senate, accusing this Senator of \ncorruption, and a very heated exchange followed in which I did not take \nthat accusation lightly. And I do not. But I must say, Mr. President, \nthat I worry about our country when this kind of information is open \nand notorious and there is no response from this body, from the \nJudiciary Committee, to have these oversight hearings.\n\n  I think that when you now have, beyond the issues which I have \nraised, where you now have the lead story in this morning's Washington \nPost, under the banner headline, ``Probe of FBI's Idaho Siege \nReopened,'' detailing the destruction of documents on top of the \ncontradictions and problems in this investigation, that this is highly \nlikely to produce the kind of public pressure which it appears is the \nonly way to get any results on a matter of this sort.\n  Mr. President, I think it is a matter of the utmost gravity and the \nutmost seriousness, and we sit really on a powder keg with a lot of \ndistrust and anxiety and anger welling up across the country as to \nexcessive action by the Federal Government. Accountability at the \nhighest levels is absolutely mandated, and it is the responsibility of \nthe Congress and the Senate and the Judiciary Committee to conduct \nthese oversight hearings and, in addition to having discussed these \nmatters privately with the appropriate authorities within our own body, \nI think it absolutely necessary to make the statement as forcefully as \nI can to urge that these hearings be conducted, conducted promptly and, \nin any event, before we adjourn for the August recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9833-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO FRANCIS J. BAGNELL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would now like to take the few minutes \nremaining before morning business expires, in the absence of any other \nSenator on the floor, to comment on the passing of a great American, \nFrancis J. Bagnell, commonly known as ``Reg'' Bagnell, who, as we \nspeak, is having memorial funeral services conducted in the \nPhiladelphia suburbs.\n  Reg Bagnell has been an outstanding figure in the Philadelphia area \nin Pennsylvania and in America as a contributor to important causes. He \nachieved legendary fame as a young football player at the University of \nPennsylvania in the fall of 1946. Reg Bagnell and I were classmates at \nthe University of Pennsylvania in 1951. And I was one of those who sat \nin the stands and admired his prowess. He weighed about 160 pounds and \nplayed tailback. On the old single wing on one glorious autumn day in \n1946, he threw 14 consecutive passes against Dartmouth. And he followed \nhis all-American status by being an all-American contributor to the \nAmerican scene. And I thought it appropriate to take just a few moments \nto recognize Reg Bagnell's great contribution, not only as an athlete \nbut as a community activist and as a great American.\n  I see it is now 10:45, Mr. President, the time to adjourn morning \nbusiness, so I conclude and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9834-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n343. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 343) to reform the regulatory process, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dole amendment No. 1487, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Roth/Biden amendment No. 1507 (to amendment No. 1487), to \n     strengthen the agency prioritization and comparative risk \n     analysis section of the bill.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Mr. Johnston is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, last night after I had left the Chamber \nand repaired to my home, a cloture motion was filed on this bill of \nwhich I was totally unaware. Mr. President, I believe that that was \nexactly the wrong thing to do on this bill. I believe we were making \ngood bipartisan progress on this bill. It is a difficult, complicated \nbill. I think the legislative process was proceeding, if not with \ndispatch, at least with a spirit of dealing with the issues. And I \nthink we have begun to make great progress.\n  Just overnight last night, for example, in a good spirit of \nbipartisan progress, I understand we have worked out the Roth \namendment, I believe to the satisfaction of both sides. That will \nremain to be seen. But I believe that is so. I think we had a session \nscheduled this morning for 9:30 dealing with some of those on our side \nof the aisle who, in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation, wanted to try \nto work out some of the remaining issues. And I think there was some \nhope that that could take place.\n  With the filing of the cloture motion, that meeting was called off \nbecause our side, the Democratic side, had to repair to put in all of \nthese amendments which had to be prepared by, I think, 1 p.m. today.\n  Mr. President, I have just come from a meeting with the majority \nleader and have urged him in the strongest way possible to withdraw the \ncloture motion, to let us continue on in a bipartisan spirit to work \nour way through these amendments. I have not seen yet on this bill \ndelaying tactics. All of the amendments which have been proposed \nobviously have not been amendments which I have agreed with. But I \nthink they were legitimate amendments. And on, for example, the \ncryptosporidium amendment last night--I think that was a serious \namendment--there was also a time limit agreed to. And, Mr. President, \nthat is not the stuff of a filibuster, when you have a serious \namendment with a time limit. So, I am in good hopes, Mr. President, \nthat we can withdraw that cloture motion and let us legislate.\n  Today, I hope to deal, for example, with the suggestion that Senator \nGlenn made yesterday about extending the 180-day period for completion \nof the cost-benefit analysis when you invoke the emergency provisions \nof the bill when there is an emergency with respect to health, safety, \nor the environment. I think we can agree to that. It was a good \namendment. I hope we can agree to that.\n  I am very strongly for removing environmental cleanup or Superfund \nfrom this bill. I hope to join with Senator Baucus in proposing that \namendment this morning. I hope we can get that done with a short time \nagreement.\n  So, Mr. President, I have urged the majority leader, as I say, in the \nvery strongest way possible to withdraw the cloture motion. Let us \nreturn to legislating rather than having to prepare a finite list of \namendments. I will say from my side of the aisle I believe that we can \nsecure cooperation. I do not believe there is a filibuster.\n  Mr. President, if there were a filibuster, we would not have had, \nbelieve me, a 30-minute time limit on cryptosporidium last night. That \nis a great issue to talk about for days. I mean, it has all those \nelements--public health, people dying. It is a serious issue. But it \nwas a serious amendment. We took a vote on it. I happen to be for the \nmotion to table, not because I do not have sympathy on the issue--I \nmean more than sympathy; I think it is a tremendous issue--but because \nI think we had it taken care of. And I might say that I and others \nspoke to Senator Kohl last night and said we believe we are confident \nthat this issue has been resolved by the earlier Johnston amendment.\n  However, we will look at that issue between now and the conference, \nand if it needs fixing, if there is any assurance that we need to give \nto people that cryptosporidium will not be a problem, that the \nregulation of it will \n\n[[Page S 9835]]\nnot be hindered or delayed, we are prepared to do that. I know I heard \nSenator Hatch say that very thing, and I have given that assurance to \nSenator Kohl. That is the kind of spirit which I think we need on this \nbill to successfully pass it.\n  I hear from my caucus that we want a good, reasonable, workable \nregulatory reform bill. We certainly hear that from the other side of \nthe aisle. We ought to build on that spirit. To be sure, there are \ndifferences on how we think we would arrive at that, but they are \ndifferences which can be reconciled.\n  So, Mr. President, I am hopeful that this will be a productive day of \nlegislating; that we will, in fact, withdraw the cloture motion; that \nwe will resume serious legislating in a spirit of bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I got here about a quarter to 7 this \nmorning. I happened to have left before the cloture motion was filed \nmyself and was not sure whether the distinguished majority leader was \ngoing to do that, which he has every right to do, especially where it \nis believed there is a delay for delay's sake.\n  I remember in the last number of Congresses when Senator Mitchell was \nthe majority leader, they would call up a bill and file cloture that \nday on almost every controversial bill--it was just amazing to me--and \naccuse us of filibustering right from the word go. We are now on the \nfourth day of this--actually the sixth. We have had very few \namendments, and the ones that we have had are amendments that seem to \nwant to repeat what is already in the bill.\n  Be that as it may, I showed up for our negotiating session this \nmorning. I had to testify on the Utah wilderness bill at a 9:30 \nmeeting. I showed up and the room was empty. I was prepared, as my \ndistinguished friend from Louisiana was, to sit down with our \ncolleagues on the other side to find out what we can do to narrow the \namendments and resolve any conflicts that exist and try to bring us \ntogether, if we can.\n  I have to say, my friend from Louisiana and I have worked long and \nhard to try and bring us together, to try and accommodate those on the \nother side who differ with us on this bill.\n  There are things we have been able to do and there are things we have \nnot been able to do. On the list they provided us, we gave them answers \non every one of the items, and most of the answers were that we cannot \ndo this. But there were still some areas where we probably could get \ntogether and hopefully resolve some of the differences between the two \nsides. If we cannot resolve differences and the amendments are really \nserious and decent amendments, then we will just have it out on the \nfloor. Whoever wins wins, and we just vote them up or down. I am \nhopeful our side will stand firm against some of these amendments.\n  Nobody is trying to give anybody a rough time. The majority leader \nhas a lot of pressure on him to get this matter resolved and to save as \nmany days as he can so that we do not cut into the August recess. He \nhas all kinds of things on the plate that need to be heard, so \nnaturally he wants to move ahead. I want to move ahead. The \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana would like to move ahead. We would \nlike to resolve the difficulties and certainly have people feeling good \nabout it.\n  I do not think there is any real reason for any person after 5 days \non the bill to pitch a hissy fit with the fact that a cloture motion \nhas been filed. That has happened around here all my Senate career. It \nis not unique. It says, ``Let's get busy, let's work and get this \ndone.'' I hope the two leaders can work out some way of getting this \ndone. I also hope that we can all work together on this floor.\n  This is such an important piece of legislation that I hope we can all \nget together on this floor and help bring it about. This legislation \nwill save lives. This legislation will provide the very best science \napplicable to some of the most important problems and issues of our \nsociety. This legislation will solve the problems, or at least go a \nlong way toward solving the problems of the overregulatory nature of \nour society, and some of the ridiculous regulations that all of us put \nup with.\n  I know some have not liked my top 10 list of silly regulations, but I \nam going to bring them up everyday anyway, because there are those who \nare very dedicated to the bureaucracy around here. That is where their \npower comes from. They can have the bureaucracy do what they could \nnever pass on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It does not make any \ndifference what it is going to cost, the bureaucracy just does it. This \nbill says, no, you are going to have to have a cost-benefit analysis \nand risk assessment to determine how dangerous it is before you go and \nsaddle the American people with unnecessary costs and tremendous \nburdens, and you have to be more serious about regulations rather than \nhave these silly, dumbbell regulations that are eating our country \nalive and costing us billions of unnecessary dollars, to the extent of \n$6,000 to $10,000 per family in this society.\n  Let me just give my top 10 list of silly regulations. This is list \nNo. 5.\n  Let me give you silly regulation No. 10: This is where over two dozen \nagents, some in helicopters, stormed a farmer's field and seized his \ntractor for allegedly harming the endangered kangaroo rat. The farmer \nwas never notified that his land was a habitat for the rat, and even \nthe Federal officials were not certain which type of rats were on his \nland. And yet they came and stopped this farmer from doing his farming \nthat he had done for years on the basis of an alleged harm to an \nendangered alleged kangaroo rat. That is silly, but that is what our \npeople out there are going through.\n  Let me give you silly regulation No. 9: Fining a company for worker \nsafety violations such as: a cut in the insulation of an extension cord \nwhich had been taken out of service, three citations, and a splintered \nhandle on a shovel, in spite of the fact that the shovel was placed in \nthe back of a truck after it broke.\n  Now, that is silly, but that is the type of regulation and \ninterpretation of regulations we are going through in this society.\n  Silly regulation No. 8: Requiring so many procedures that it took a \nbusiness an entire month to hire just one person. Because of such \ncomplexity and the extreme penalties that go with violations, the owner \nhas resolved never, never to hire more than 10 workers, despite the \nfact that each worker logs 500 hours of overtime in a year. He just is \nnot going to put up with this type of regulation, and having 10 or \nfewer, he does not have to. Except he did have to spend an entire month \nto just hire one person.\n  Silly regulation No. 7: Fining a roofing company for failure to have \na fire extinguisher in the proper place, in spite of the fact that it \nhad been moved to prevent it from being stolen by passersby as three \nother extinguishers had been in the preceding 3 days.\n  Silly regulation No. 6: Requiring a trucking company to spend \n$126,000 to destroy nine fuel tanks which were not leaking.\n  Silly regulation No. 5: Denying a wetland permit application and \nordering an elderly couple to remove dirt in an alleged wetland--dirt \nwhich had been placed on the land by the city 10 years before the \ncouple bought the lot--only to concede a year later that the couple did \nnot need a permit to have the fill on their land. That is silly.\n  Silly regulation No. 4: Seeking a $14 million fine against farmers \nwho were accused of violating the Clean Water Act by building a levy to \nprevent their farm from flooding. That is ridiculous, but that is what \nthey did, a $14 million fine against these poor farmers who just wanted \nto prevent their farm from flooding.\n  Silly regulation No. 3: Prohibiting an 80-year-old farmer from \nfarming his land, claiming it was a wetland when a local business \naccidentally cut a drainage pipe.\n  I only have two more, and then I will yield to the majority leader.\n  Silly regulation No. 2: Preventing a company from harvesting any \ntimber on 72 acres of its land because two spotted owls were seen \nnesting over a mile and a half away. No spotted owls had actually been \nseen on the company's land.\n  Let me just go to silly regulation No. 1: Requiring one of our towns \nin this country to build a new reservoir in \n\n[[Page S 9836]]\norder to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and then prohibiting \nthe construction of the reservoir because it would flood a wetland.\n Fines were threatened if the reservoir was built and if it was not \nbuilt. So the town did not know what to do. It would be fined either \nway. That is ridiculous and silly. That is what the American people are \nputting up with.\n\n  We can flood this floor with silly regulations, but we will bring a \ntop 10 list every so often just to remind people of what this is all \nabout: to get rid of this junk and to let us live in more peace and \nsafety in this country.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, first, I want to indicate that I will be \nmeeting with Senator Daschle in 2 or 3 minutes. We will be talking \nabout the schedule for the balance of this month and into August.\n  As I ever said many times--not in any threatening way because it is a \nmatter of fact--there is no question about losing part of the August \nrecess. That is why I have been attempting to move as quickly as \npossible on this bill so we can go on to what I consider to be the next \nimportant thing we need to do before we have the August recess.\n  I will be going over that list with Senator Daschle in a few moments. \nI do not think it is unreasonable, but it will take the cooperation of \nall Members, and it will mean, frankly, every day we lose is a day we \nlose in the recess period, which I think is understandable by most \nMembers.\n  I listened to the comments of the Senator from Louisiana, and I must \nsay I apologize for not notifying him and others earlier. I had \nmentioned it in a press conference, and we thought it was fairly public \nknowledge, that we would file a cloture motion. But more important than \nthe cloture motion is to determine when we can finish this bill and how \nmany amendments there are, and whether we can get time agreements.\n  We have made some progress, but it has been painfully slow. We \nstarted on this bill last Thursday. We had a lot of debate and we did a \nlittle debate Thursday before the recess, and a little bit Friday, and \nwe have had 3 days this week.\n  This is a very important bill. I did not think we would finish it \nthis week, but I would like to finish by next Tuesday. I will discuss \nthat with Senator Daschle, and I will have some announcement to all of \nmy colleagues shortly after that time.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1507, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I send a modified amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify his \namendment.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1507), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Delete all of section 635 (page 61, line 1 through page 64, \n     line 14 and add in its place the following new section 635:\n\n     SECTION 635.

When an action for judicial review of a covered \n     agency action is instituted, any analysis for, or relating \n     to, the action shall constitute part of the whole record of \n     agency action for the purpose of judicial review of the \n     action and shall, to the extent relevant, be considered by a \n     court in determining the legality of the covered agency \n     action.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support my \namendment to encourage agencies to set risk-based priorities. This \namendment incorporates the basic language in S. 291 which I introduced \nin January and which received bipartisan and unanimous support of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. Such language is also in S. 1001, \nintroduced by Senator Glenn.\n  This language has been modified slightly through negotiations with \nSenator Glenn and Senator Johnston.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add the names to my amendment of Senator \nJohnston and Senator Glenn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that on the Roth \namendment regarding risk-based priorities, there be 30 minutes for \ndebate, to be equally divided in the usual form, and that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, this amendment would significantly improve \nupon the current section 635 of S. 343, and it would clarify to the \nagencies what is expected of them regarding priority setting.\n  My amendment provides an effective date by which the agencies would \nset priorities to ensure they achieve the greatest overall risk \nreduction.\n  It also defines certain terms such as comparative risk analysis, and \nmost serious risk, to reduce ambiguity about their requirements.\n  My amendment also lists covered agencies to which this requirement \napplies.\n  This amendment will also ensure that the risk study is based on some \nscience. The comparative risk analysis would have to meet the standards \nfor risk assessment, risk characterization, and peer review already \nprovided in S. 343.\n  The amendment also makes clear that the comparative risk analysis \nacross Federal agencies is institutionalized in agency practice. It is \nnot a one-time event.\n  Instead of specifying a particular scientific body to conduct a \ncomparative risk analysis, the amendment allows OMB to consult with \nOSTB in arranging the comparative risk study across Federal agencies.\n  Madam President, I would like to emphasize that I think it is \ncritically important that we allow full public participation through \nthe risk priority-setting process, and that this amendment assures an \nopen process, allows public comment, and requires that policy judgments \nin the risk study be separated from scientific determination.\n  In sum, this amendment will allow Members to be confident that the \nagencies will use the results of the comparative risk analysis in a \nmeaningful way. It will help ensure that we generate or obtain greater \nrisk reduction at less cost.\n  Madam President, I would like to take some time to speak about the \nneed for this amendment and what it would require. I believe that \nsetting risk-based priorities offers the best opportunity to allocate \nrationally the resources of both the government and the private sector \nto protect human health, safety, and the environment.\n  With this tool of comparative risk analysis, we can make our health, \nsafety, and environmental protection dollars go farther, providing \ngreater overall protection, and saving even more lives than the current \nsystem.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to, one, encourage Federal agencies \nengaged in regulating risk to human health, safety, and the \nenvironment, to achieve the greatest risk reduction at the least cost \npractical; two, promote the coordination of policies and programs to \nreduce risk to human health, safety, and the environment; three, \npromote open communications among the Federal agencies, the public, the \nPresident and Congress regarding environmental health and safety risks \nand the prevention and management of those risks.\n  There is widespread support for setting risk-based priorities by many \ndistinguished experts. As the blue ribbon Carnegie Commission panel \nnoted in its report, ``Risk in the Environment,'' the economic burden \nof regulation is so great and the time and money available to address \nthe many genuine environmental and health threats so limited, that hard \nresource allocation choices are important.\n  In the same vein, in 1995, National Academy of Public Administration \nreport to Congress entitled ``Setting Priorities, Getting Results,'' \nrecommends that the Environmental Protection Agency use comparative \nrisk analysis to identify priorities, and use the budget process to \nallocate resources to the agencies priorities.\n  The NAPA report recommends that Congress ``could enact specific \nlegislation that would require risk-ranking report every 2 to 3 years. \nCongress should use the information when it passes environmental \nstatutes or reviews EPA's budget proposals.''\n  A national comparative risk analysis also was one of the chief \nrecommendations of the Harvard Group on Risk Management Reform in their \nMarch 1995 report ``Reform of Risk Regulation: Achieving More \nProtection at Less Cost.'' \n\n[[Page S 9838]]\n\n  Justice Steven Breyer has emphasized the need for risk-based \npriorities in his outstanding book ``Breaking the Vicious Circle: \nToward Effective Risk Regulation.''\n  Finally, I should note that this idea has its roots in two seminal \nreports, ``Unfinished Business'' (1987) and ``Reducing Risks.''\n  To provide greater protection at less cost, I believe the Federal \nGovernment must systematically evaluate the threats to health, safety \nand the environment that its programs address, and determine which \nrisks are the most serious, most amenable to reduce in a cost-effective \nmanner.\n  This amendment requires each designated agency to engage in this \nevaluation among and within the programs it administers to better \nenable the President and Congress to prioritize resource agencies. The \nrisk addressed by all of the designated agencies would be evaluated and \ncompared.\n  Now, the purpose of these analyses is not to dictate how the \ngovernment uses its resources but to provide Congress and the President \nwith the information to make better informed choices.\n  These analyses will be useful for identifying unaddressed sources of \nrisk, risks borne disproportionately by a segment of the population, as \nwell as research needs.\n  This information will foster a clear reasoning for regulating in one \narea over another, or allocating resources to one program over another.\n  Finally, conducted in the public view, these analyses are likely to \nenhance public debate about these choices and ultimately create greater \npublic confidence in government policy. Hard data will form the \nunderpinnings of the analysis.\n  Public values must be incorporated when assessing the relative \nseriousness of the risk and when setting priorities. After all, \nscientific data alone cannot say which of the following is at greater \nrisk or which should be addressed first. Neurological damage, heart \ndisease, birth defects, a plane crash, or cancer.\n  The comparative risk analysis should be conducted in such a way that \npublic values are asserted and considered. This will require including \npublic input and the comparative risk analysis. When the analysis is \ncompleted, it should be clear to the public and the policy makers which \npart of the risk comparison reflects science and which part reflects \nvalue.\n  To encourage the use of risk-based priorities, my amendment requires \nnot only that each agency set risk-based priorities for its programs, \nbut also for the OMB to commission a report with an accredited \nscientific body, to study the methodologies of comparative risk \nanalysis and to conduct such an analysis to compare risk across \nagencies.\n  The priorities identified must be incorporated into the agency \nbudget, strategic planning, regulatory agenda, enforcement, and, as \nappropriate, research activities. When submitting its budget request to \nCongress each agency must describe the risk prioritization results and \nexplicitly identify how the requested budget and regulatory agenda \nreflect those priorities.\n  Subsection (d) requires the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget to have an accredited scientific body conduct a comparative risk \nanalysis of risks regulated across all agencies.\n  Because comparative risk analysis is still a relatively new science, \nparticularly when used to compare dissimilar risks, subsection (d)(4) \nrequires that, even while the comparative risk analysis is being \nconducted, a study be done to improve the methods and use of \ncomparative risk analysis. The study should be sufficient to provide \nthe President and agency heads guidance in allocating resources across \nagencies and among programs to achieve the greatest degree of risk \nprevention and reduction.\n  Subsection (e) requires each covered agency to submit a report to \nCongress and the President no later than 24 months after the date of \nenactment of the act, and every 24 months thereafter. The reports \nshould describe how the agencies have complied with subsection (c) and \npresent the reasons for any departure from the requirement to establish \npriorities. The reports should identify the obstacles to prioritizing \ntheir activities and resources in accordance with the priorities \nidentified. At this time, each agency should also recommend those \nlegislative changes to programs or statutory deadlines needed to assist \nthe agency in implementing those priorities.\n  This report back to Congress is a very critical element in \nreadjusting the Federal Government's priorities so that we can truly \nachieve the greatest degree of protection for health, safety and the \nenvironment with our resources. Congress needs this information to make \nthe necessary changes.\n  Madam President, we all know that this is a time of limited budgets \nand economic uncertainty. I believe that most of us recognize the need \nto reduce the regulatory burden that costs the average American family \nabout $6,000 per year. But at the same time, the public highly values a \nclean environment, safe workplaces, and safe products. And I must add, \nthat I deeply share these values. I am an environmentalist--proud to be \nan environmentalist. I want to reduce unduly costly regulations, but \nstill ensure that important benefits and protections are provided. So \nthe goal I seek is smarter regulation.\n  This amendment will promote smarter regulation. It will provide much-\nneeded reform, not rollback. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support this language--as they have done in S. 291 and S. \n1001.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I rise to support this amendment by my \nfriend from Delaware, our committee chairman. I think he is doing a \nservice by proposing this amendment.\n  He recognizes we cannot do everything. We do not have money enough to \ndo everything we would like to do. We are trying to reform regulations. \nWe are trying to cut back on regulations, onerous regulations. At the \nsame time, what he is addressing is, even where we are trying to make \nserious approaches to matters like health and safety and so on, where \nwe know we should be doing something in setting new standards for the \nwhole Nation and for every single person, we will not have money enough \nto do all the things people out there would want done. What he is \nsaying is we have to prioritize these.\n  How do you do that? How do you make sure you get the greatest good \nout of every dollar that we spend on health and safety matters? There \nwere a couple of key words there. This is a young science. That is \nexactly what it is. This comparative risk analysis is a fairly young \nscience and it is a new methodology that is being put forward in how to \ndeal with this. Most scientists who are involved with this, I believe, \nfeel it has tremendous promise and can really guide us into doing a \nbetter job of setting our priorities at the Federal level.\n  It can also tell us some things we should not do, by setting these \npriorities. It is not just to say we are going to try to do everything \nso now we will set the priorities of one, two, three, four; how we do \nthese things and include everything in just because somebody came up \nwith the idea. Comparative risk analysis can also say it is going to \ncost you so darned much to do this, or something else, we just cannot \ndo that. So we would be better off taking that money and do overall \nmore good in the long haul by spending that amount of money on \nsomething else, or two or three other things that might improve health \nand safety or whatever.\n  So I am glad to support this. I believe I was added as a cosponsor a \nfew moments ago. I think the distinguished author of this amendment \nasked I be included. If not, I do wish to be included as a cosponsor on \nthis. I am glad to support it. I do not know of any opposition. I do \nnot know whether the Senator from Louisiana wants to speak on this or \nnot, but after he has had time to make remarks, I would be prepared to \naccept the amendment on our part.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is listed as a \ncosponsor.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I yield whatever time the Senator from Louisiana \nneeds.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I commend Senator Roth, not only for \nthe amendment, but the spirit of compromise that has made this \namendment possible. It shows what we can do. Senator Roth has \ncontributed so much to this whole bill and the whole issue of risk \nanalysis and a risk assessment and \n\n[[Page S 9839]]\nregulatory reform. This is but one additional indication of that.\n  The amendment, as offered, enables but does not require participation \nby the National Academy of Sciences in developing methodologies for \ncomparative risk analysis. It applies to a finite list of agencies who \nwould be encouraged to adopt risk-based priorities, and will ensure \nthat risk studies are based on sound science.\n  Madam President, it is a good amendment. I support it. I am glad to \nbe a cosponsor of it. And, again, I congratulate Senator Roth for his \nleadership in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleagues, the \nSenator from Ohio and the Senator from Louisiana, for working with me \nto amend this proposal so it was acceptable on both sides of the aisle.\n  I will be frank. I think it is a critically important amendment. I \nthink we must, if we are going to accomplish the good we all desire, \nprioritize across agencies and within agencies. This will help enable \nus make better use of the resources that are available to make the \nquality of life better for the American people.\n  Madam President, I urge acceptance of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back their time on this \namendment?\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, all time is yielded back on this side.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1507), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1516 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1516 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, line 19, strike out ``180 days'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``one year''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] \npointed out day before yesterday a real fault with this bill, which was \nthat the provision on page 25 of the so-called Dole-Johnston amendment \nrelating to health, safety, or emergency exemptions from the cost-\nbenefit analysis, provides that a rule may go into effect immediately \nif an agency for good cause finds that conducting cost-benefit analysis \nis impractical due to an emergency or health or safety threat that is \nlikely to result in significant harm to the public or natural \nresources. But under that rule, not later than 180 days after the \npromulgation of such rule, the agency must comply with the subchapter; \nthat is, they must complete the cost-benefit analysis, and under \nanother section of the bill can complete a risk assessment if that is \nrequired.\n  Madam President, 180 days, as the Senator from Ohio pointed out, \nsimply is not enough time to get this done. This amendment extends that \nperiod to 1 year. So that, if there is a threat to the public health, \nsafety or the environment, or if there is any kind of emergency, the \nagency can promulgate the rule, get it out, put it into effect \nimmediately upon the declaration that they do not have time to do \notherwise. This would give them then the year to do the cost-benefit or \nthe risk analysis.\n  Keep in mind also that under other provisions of this bill cost-\nbenefit analysis and risk assessment may be done in such form as is \nappropriate to the circumstances; that is, it can be done informally \nsometimes. Under some circumstances, for example, scientific reports \nwhich had been peer reviewed could be used and put into the record in \nlieu of conducting a brand-new peer review risk assessment. So we \nbelieve this would be enough time appropriately to finish such a \nreview.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Ohio for pointing this out. It will \nmake this a much better bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I think this certainly is a move in the \nright direction. We discussed this informally a couple of days ago. I \nhope the year is adequate. I guess if we are discussing this again I \nmight suggest a little longer time or at least put a waiver in for the \nPresident or something, and, if at the end of the year they really just \ncannot do it in that period of time, that the President be granted a \nwaiver authority in that event. That would cover all bases it seems to \nme for the health and safety for all of our people.\n  But certainly the doubling of time from 180 days to 365, to a full \nyear, is a step in the right direction. I think by far the greatest \npercentage of cases this would certainly cover. They could do the \nanalysis and the assessments and all the things that are required \nwithin that period of time.\n  So I would be prepared to accept this. I have a little bit of doubt \nin my own mind as to whether 1 year covers all of the situations we \nmight run into without having a Presidential waiver at the end of that \nin case they were really up against it in some analysis.\n  I do not know whether the author of this, the Senator from Louisiana, \nwould consider granting the President a waiver on the end of that. But \nin any event, I am prepared to accept the 1 year.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I think the Senator's suggestion is a \ngood one which I think we ought to move forward with in the conference \ncommittee. I will point out that there is nothing here that let us say \nthey could not get done in a year. There is nothing in this language \nthat says it is only a one-shot deal. They can put forth another major \nrule at the end of that year and start the 1-year process all over \nagain. So the emergency is really protected by the fact that it says \nthat you can. But in any event, I would be more comfortable with some \nkind of Presidential waiver. I think we could work on that between now \nand conference.\n  Mr. GLENN. Good. I think with that understanding, I am prepared on \nour side of the aisle to accept this amendment. I think it is good with \nthe length of time. It will protect the health and safety and protect \neverybody.\n  Mr. ROTH. Could I ask the distinguished Senator, what is the \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. GLENN. Just that we work further. The Senator from Louisiana is \nextending the time period from 180 days to 1 year, where that might be \nnecessary to go back. And I mentioned the other day that the 6 months \nis hardly enough time to do another complete analysis the way these \nrisk assessments and analyses go, and suggested that we lengthen that \nout to a year. This would be on a re-analysis. The Senator from \nLouisiana agreed with that.\n  I would just question whether there might be some cases--I think they \nwould be rare--where we require really more than a year because some of \nthese things in the original or in the first instance takes several \nyears, 4 or 5 years sometimes, to work out all the rules and \nregulations. But I think in most cases it would be covered by the 1 \nyear.\n  I am happy to go along with that. What we were discussing was putting \nsomething in this also, if at the end of a year there was still a \nhealth and safety matter that was still being worked out, to give the \nPresident a waiver authority to go beyond that 1-year period. The \nSenator from Louisiana was pointing out also that the President could \nintroduce a whole new process. I would not think that would be \nnecessary.\n  Mr. ROTH. I would say that I can support the amendment proposed by \n\n[[Page S 9840]]\n  my distinguished colleague from Louisiana. I would certainly be happy \nto look at the suggestion from the Senator from Ohio. I think it is \nimportant that our process be realistic, that we do not expect the \nimpossible from the agencies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of Senator from Louisiana.\n  The amendment (No. 1516) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, while the majority leader is on the \nfloor, I would like to send an amendment to the desk and see if we can \ndeal with this at this time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1517 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n      (Purpose: To delete the section on ``Requirements for Major \n Environmental Management Activities'' relating to cleanups under the \n  Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and other similar activities)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], for Mr. Baucus, \n     for himself, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1517 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out all of section 628 (on page 42 beginning at line \n     3 strike out all through line 13 on page 44) and renumber \n     section 629 as section 628.\n       On page 73 in the table of contents for SUBCHAPTER II--\n     ANALYSIS OF AGENCY RULES, replace ``628. Requirements for \n     major environmental management activities'' with ``628. \n     Petition for alternative method of compliance.''\n       On page 57, lines 6 and 7 strike out the phrase ``or a \n     major environmental management activity''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, this is the amendment which removes \nfrom the bill the environmental cleanup, or so-called Superfund \nactivities.\n  I ask for the majority leader's attention on this matter because we \ntalked about that this morning. I understand that the majority leader \nmay be willing to withdraw the Superfund provisions from the bill. I \nalso understand that Senators may prefer it be withdrawn by unanimous \nconsent rather than have a vote on it. If that is possible, we would be \ndelighted to have that done at this time. That would avoid the debate \nand the vote.\n                      unanimous-consent agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, if I could come back to that in just a \nmoment, I think we are about to get a consent agreement here. The \nDemocratic leader is on the floor.\n  First, let me indicate that after discussion with the Senator from \nLouisiana this morning, I did, as I indicated, have a meeting with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, with reference to the \ncloture motion and the cloture vote.\n  Obviously, we both have the same interest. We want to finish the \nbill. We do not want to shut off debate, but we do not want delay on \neither side--either side. And I regret not having a chance to indicate \nto the leader personally that the cloture motion would be filed last \nnight, or to the managers. I was at home watching on C-SPAN the \nreaction of Senator Glenn and others.\n  So what we have agreed to, and I will now propound that request--and \nthen the Senator from South Dakota may have a comment--I ask unanimous \nconsent that the cloture vote scheduled to occur on Friday be postponed \nto occur on Monday at a time to be determined by the two leaders but \nnot before 5 p.m.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I would first clarify with the majority leader that \nfirst-degree amendments would still be in order at least as to their \nfiling up until the close of business on Friday. Is that the \nunderstanding of the majority leader?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think that would accommodate a lot of the needs of \nmany Senators on our side. As we indicated last night, many of us felt \nthat the filing of the cloture motion was unfortunate, premature, but I \nthink this will allow us to keep working in a meaningful way.\n  I think it is clear that both sides, Democrats and Republicans, want \nto accomplish a good deal with regard to regulatory reform, and I think \nthere is a lot of progress that has been made. We have raised a number \nof issues. While they have not been addressed and resolved to our \nsatisfaction in some cases, these amendments have been proposed in good \nfaith and have raised very important issues.\n  I am hopeful we can continue to do that today. I am hopeful that at \nsome point between now and Monday we will have the opportunity to \ndebate the Democratic substitute, and we will simply take a look on \nMonday as to where we are and how much progress we have made as to what \nour position on cloture will be. But this certainly accommodates the \nneed to allow Senators to come to the floor, to propose their \namendments, and to have good debate. I think in many cases that can be \ndone with short timeframes and perhaps some without rollcall votes. I \nwould hope we could continue negotiations as well. I think we have made \nprogress in many areas off the floor, and I hope that effort could \ncontinue as well. So I think the majority leader has advanced the \neffort here substantially, and I would encourage support of the motion.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, will the minority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the minority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield. The floor is the majority \nleader's.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is all right; I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I had urged the majority leader today not to go forward \nwith the motion. I am glad he has delayed it. Does this delay meet with \nthe full approval of the minority leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I say to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, who \nhas probably had as much to do with this bill as anybody, this is a \nvery important step procedurally. I think, as I said, this allows us to \ngo forth with additional amendments, perhaps with the substitute, so I \nthink it accommodates the needs of Senators on both sides, and I am \nenthusiastic about the change that is proposed here today.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the minority leader, and I thank the majority \nleader for his willingness to accommodate this legislative process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? If not, the \nChair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, let me further ask, following along what \nthe Senator from South Dakota suggested, that first-degree amendments \nmay be filed up to the close of business on Friday, July 14, or if the \nSenate recesses prior to that time, early, they may be filed up until 4 \np.m. on Friday, even if we were out of here by 1 o'clock.\n  So let me also indicate that I appreciate the cooperation, and I \nbelieve that there is a determined effort on both sides to pass a good \nregulatory reform bill. That is my conclusion after visiting with the \nDemocratic leader and after visiting with the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Johnston].\n  As I have indicated before, what the leader is trying to do, and the \nleader has that responsibility, is move the program, and I would like \nto insert in the Record at this point a tentative agenda between now \nand the time we leave here in August. Hopefully it will be August when \nwe leave here for recess. And I will ask to have that printed in the \nRecord.\n  I will just say, to highlight it, it has us completing this bill on \nTuesday, and then we have Bosnia. And then we have appropriations next \nThursday and Friday, and then the Ryan White provision on July 24, the \ngift and lobbying bill on that date if possible. Then we get into the \nState Department and foreign ops authorization bill, which will take us \nup to July 29, and then the \n\n[[Page S 9841]]\nDOD authorization and DOD appropriations bills would take us up until \nAugust 5, and then begin welfare reform on August 7. And whenever we \nconcluded our business on welfare reform, the recess would begin.\n  Now, all these things are, of course, subject to change because if we \ndo not keep up on the schedule, it obviously pushes us further into \nAugust. If everything worked as we would like it to work, it is \npossible we could begin the recess even before August 12.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record so that \neverybody will have a chance to look at it carefully and then start \ncomplaining to the leader about it.\n  There being no objection, the schedule was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Proposed Legislative Schedule July-August\n\n\n                            week of july 10\n\n       Regulatory reform.\n\n\n                            week of july 17\n\n       Regulatory reform through Tuesday.\n       Tuesday p.m.--Bosnia.\n       Wesnesday--Bosnia.\n       Thursday--Available Appropriations bills.\n       Friday--Available appropriations: Military Construction/\n     Legislative/Energy and Water.\n\n\n                            week of july 24\n\n       Monday--Ryan White bill/Gift lobbying bill.\n       Tuesday through Friday--Start State Department \n     reorganization bill and Foreign Operations Authorization.\n       Saturday session if necessary.\n\n\n                       week of July 31--August 4\n\n       DOD authorization and DOD appropriations.\n       Saturday session if necessary.\n\n\n                          week of august 7 \\1\\\n\n       Monday, begin welfare reform (or earlier if schedule \n     permits).\n     \\1\\ All items must be completed prior to the start of the \n     August recess. As soon as these items are completed, \n     regardless of the day, the Senate will begin the recess.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Tuesday through Friday--Continue welfare reform and \n     available appropriations bills or conference reports.\n       Saturday session possible to complete any items.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In addition, the Chair would add the previous \norder will be so modified to reflect the 4 o'clock modification.\n  Mr. DOLE. With reference to the pending amendment, I will need to do \nsome checking on that before I am in a position to respond to the \nSenator from Louisiana. In other words, the amendment pending would in \neffect take Superfund out of the----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is right, environmental management activities, the \nwhole section, just withdraw that.\n  Mr. DOLE. I assume there will be Superfund legislation this year, and \nso at that time we would address the issues that are removed from this \nbill.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I have heard from many of those Senators involved in \nthe issue, all of whom are anxious to move forward with Superfund in \ntheir committee, and I think there is no hesitation in moving forward. \nI was told this morning that Senator Smith, who chairs the subcommittee \non Superfund, is anxious to move forward but did not want to vote on \nthis; he would rather have it done by the majority leader by unanimous \nconsent. That is the reason I asked for the majority leader's \nattention.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. If I can just have a few minutes to clear that, I \ndid not--we did discuss that this morning at our 8:30 meeting. We did \ndiscuss it briefly with the Senator from Louisiana. It is a very \nimportant provision. There are some of our colleagues who want to leave \nit as it is, others who have mixed feelings on it--in fact, some who \nwould probably vote to remove it. The question is how many would vote \nto remove it. That is sort of the bottom line. If I could have a few \nmoments to check with two or three people.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I think it may be appropriate to \ntemporarily lay this aside unless someone has any problem with it, and \nI think Senator Boxer is ready to move with her amendment under a time \nagreement. So is there any problem with temporarily laying this aside?\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily lay the \npending amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. DOLE. I would like to dispose of the pending amendment if the \nSenator will just give me a few moments.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I withdraw that request.\n  Mr. DOLE. And either have a quorum or if somebody wanted to speak on \nsome other--does the Senator from California wish to speak on another \nmatter?\n  Mr. GLENN. She has an amendment, but she could start speaking on it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am waiting to introduce an amendment on mammograms.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator could start speaking on that.\n  Mr. GLENN. The Senator could start with the agreement that when he \ngets an answer back, she would be willing to yield the floor for that \ndisposition.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will make that into a unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me suggest that as soon as we dispose of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Louisiana, the Senator from California be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator can start speaking now.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized to \nbegin speaking with the reservation that if the pending amendment is \nagreed to, we will then interrupt and do that, and then we will return \nto the Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1524\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, thank you very much for that very \nexplicit explanation of where we are in the process.\n  I want to thank my colleagues because I do think this is a very \nimportant amendment. It affects the women of this country and, of \ncourse, as a result of that, everyone in this country, because one of \nthe tragedies that we face in America today is an epidemic of breast \ncancer. And the amendment that I will introduce at the appropriate time \nwill merely say that a rule that is in process now which will set \nstandards for mammograms will be able to move forward and not be \nsubjected to this new bill.\n  Madam President, one in nine women are at risk of being diagnosed \nwith breast cancer in her lifetime. Breast cancer is the most common \nform of cancer in American women and the leading killer of women \nbetween the ages 35 and 52.\n  In 1995, an estimated 182,000 new cases of breast cancer will be \ndiagnosed, and 46,000 women will die of the disease. Just in the year \n1995. We lost 50,000 brave men and women in the Vietnam war, and the \ncountry has suffered ever since in grief. Every year we lose 45,000 \nwomen, approximately, from breast cancer.\n  We do not know what causes breast cancer, although we are making \nprogress on that front. We do not know how to prevent breast cancer, \nbut the research that is moving forward hopefully will lead us in the \nright direction. We certainly do not have a cure for breast cancer, \nalthough, again, we are making progress. We do have, however, a couple \nof tools. Those are breast self-examination, doctor examination, and \nmammography. Those are the only tools that women have to detect breast \ncancer early, when it can be treated with the least disfigurement and \nwhen chances of survival are the highest.\n  What does that have to do with the amendment that I will be \nintroducing? And I am very proud to say, Madam President, that this \namendment is cosponsored by Senators Murray, Mikulski, Lautenberg, \nBradley, Feinstein, Dorgan, Kennedy and Reid. What does the tragic \nhistory of breast cancer have to do with the amendment that I am going \nto offer? It is directly related. The quality of a mammogram can mean \nthe difference between life or death. If the mammogram procedure is \ndone incorrectly, if a bad picture is taken, then a radiologist reading \nthe x ray may miss seeing a potentially cancerous lump.\n  Conversely, a bad picture can show lumps where none exist and a woman \nwill have to undergo the trauma of being told she may have a cancer, a \nsituation known as a ``false positive.'' Now, truly, I do not know many \nwomen of my age, younger or older, who have not had the trauma of a \nfalse reading. It is very common. \n\n[[Page S 9842]]\n\n  We need to perfect mammograms. But a false positive is obviously \nnothing compared to a radiologist missing a cancer. To get a good-\nquality mammogram, you need the right film and the proper equipment. To \nprotect women undergoing the procedure, you need the correct radiation \ndose. So it is not a mystery. It is not a mystery as far as what we \nneed to do to get better quality mammograms.\n  I am very proud to say that in 1992, Congress passed the Mammography \nQuality Standards Act in order to establish national quality standards \nfor mammography facilities. Now, I want to make a point about that. In \nthis Republican Congress we hear a lot of talk about how everything \nshould be given to the States. Why do we need national standards for \nthis? Why should we have national standards for that?\n  Well, let me tell you honestly, I have never been at a community \nmeeting in my life--and I have been in public life for a very long \ntime--where someone has come up to me and said, ``Senator, you are \ndoing too much to protect the food supply. You are doing too much to \nprotect the water. You are doing too much to make sure that mammography \nis safe.'' On the contrary, it is, ``Senator, I am worried about the \nsafety of the water I drink. I am worried about the safety of the food \nthat we eat. I am concerned about pesticide use, bacteria. What are you \ngoing to do to make it better?''\n  And clearly, when a woman is misdiagnosed and a doctor misses the \ncancer because of a mammogram that was either improperly done or \nimproperly read--we hear it all the time. And we all know cases where a \ncancer that could have been detected early was not detected because the \nquality of the mammogram or the quality of the reading simply was not \nhigh enough.\n  So we passed the Mammography Quality Standards Act in order to \nestablish national quality standards for mammography facilities. At the \ntime, both the GAO and the American College of Radiology testified \nbefore Congress that the former patchwork of Federal, State and private \nstandards were inadequate--inadequate--to protect women. So we are not \ntalking about something here that was not studied. The GAO and the \nAmerican College of Radiology testified before Congress that the \npatchwork that existed before this act, the Mammography Quality \nStandards Act, was inadequate. It was inadequate to protect women.\n  There were a number of problems at mammography facilities: poor-\nquality equipment, poorly trained technicians and physicians, a lack of \nregular inspections, and facilities which told women they were \naccredited when, in fact, they were not accredited. And women walked in \nfor their mammograms. And every woman who had this experience can say \nthat you hold your breath until you get the results. And many women \nbreathed a sigh of relief and said they were cancer free, when in fact \nthey were not cancer free because of the inadequate facilities.\n  If this regulatory reform bill passes, the final rule that implements \nthe mammography act that we passed could be delayed for years. Let me \nrepeat that. And I hope my friend from Louisiana hears it and I hope \nthe majority leader hears it. And this is not coming from one Senator; \nit is coming from the people who know. The FDA says to us clearly that \nif this regulatory reform passes as it is, the final rule implementing \nthe Mammography Quality Standards Act, which is due out in October, \ncould be delayed for years.\n  My friends, we cannot let this happen. Under the interim rules, the \nFDA has already certified over 9,000 facilities as providing quality \nmammography services. If final rules are delayed, then women will no \nlonger be able to rely on the good standards we have put in place.\n  And that is why the amendment that I am introducing with many of my \ncolleagues and my primary coauthors, Senator Murray from Washington--\nand I look forward to her statement following mine--the amendment \nsimply says that the Mammography Quality Standards Act is not a major \nrule and is therefore exempt from the requirements in the regulatory \nreform bill, period.\n  Anyone who gets up here and says, ``You don't need the Boxer-Murray-\nMikulski legislation, we cover it,'' I will look that person in the eye \nand tell them they are playing Russian roulette with the women of this \ncountry, because the FDA has told us we need this Boxer-Murray \namendment in order to make sure that this rule moves forward.\n  So any Senator who stands up and starts questioning this Senator \nabout it is going to have to hear it repeated over and over and over \nagain, as many times as it takes. We jeopardize the health of the women \nof America if we do not adopt this amendment.\n  Some are going to say the Mammography Quality Standards Act does not \nmeet the $100 million threshold established by the bill for major rules \nand, therefore, it would not be affected and we do not need the Boxer-\nMurray amendment. FDA believes otherwise, and I would rather believe \nthem than some Senator who does not know this issue.\n  We know already the cost of this rule is about $98 million, \ndangerously close to the $100 million threshold. With inflation and \nsomebody jacking around the numbers, it could easily go to $100 \nmillion. Some may argue that there are health and safety exemptions in \nthe cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment portions of the bill to \nprotect the Mammography Quality Standards Act. In fact, those \nexemptions apply only when it is ``likely to result in significant harm \nto the public.''\n  The FDA does not believe this exemption would include the mammography \nquality standards. Moreover, since the bill does not define the term \n``significant harm,'' how can we tell if it would apply or not? If a \nwoman has her mammogram read by someone who is poorly trained in \nmammography, is it of significant harm to the public if she dies? It is \ncertainly significant to that woman if that person fails to detect a \ncancerous lump, and to her children and to her family. And if it \nhappened to a Senator's wife, it sure would be significant and they \nwould be rushing to the floor to exempt this rule.\n  I say it is significant. This is such a significant subject--breast \ncancer--that we should make sure we are doing the right thing and \nexempt this rule.\n  Let us concentrate on what we do know. Mammography is the only test \nwe have to detect breast cancer early when survival rates are the \nhighest. We know not enough women, especially older women, have this \ntest. That is why there has been extensive public information campaigns \nencouraging women to get the test, and, therefore, when they do get the \ntest, we need to know that the mammogram they are getting is accurate \nand that the person who is reading the mammogram understands how to \nread the mammogram, and that is why we need this rule, to move forward, \nand that is why we need the Boxer-Murray-Mikulski amendment.\n  It is straightforward. It says that quality mammography is so \nimportant that we should not do anything to prevent the FDA from moving \nforward and continue to implement the Mammography Quality Standards \nAct. I certainly hope we will have broad support for this amendment \nwhen I do offer it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bumpers be added \nas a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As I understand the agreement, I was entitled to speak \nuntil there was an interruption. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurray be allowed to make her comments now, with the understanding that \nif there is, in fact, an interruption regarding the Superfund \namendment, we will lay this matter aside and come back to it \nimmediately following it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, for this amendment and for her very well-\nstated words on this issue. I hope that all of our colleagues took the \ntime to listen to what she had to say. She stated it very clearly for \nall of us why we need this amendment to exempt the Mammography Quality \nStandards Act regulations from the requirements of S. 343.\n  I think we all know that breast cancer has taken the lives of far too \nmany women, and the long list of those who have died include many of my \nown friends. I am sure everyone on this \n\n[[Page S 9843]]\n\nfloor knows of someone who has been touched by breast cancer. It is a \ngrowing health concern and problem in this Nation, and it is a great \nthreat to women's health. It is estimated that during the 1990's, \nnearly 2 million women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 460,000 \nwomen will die from this deadly disease. I assure everyone listening \nthat will include people you know--your sisters, your mothers, your \ndaughters, your friends.\n  In 1992, Congress understood that and they passed the Mammography \nQuality Standards Act. The FDA is responsible for issuing regulations \nunder that act to ensure that medical procedures for mammography exams \nare safe and effective and that mammograms are properly administered \nand interpreted.\n  Most of the regulations implementing the Mammography Quality \nStandards Act are due to be released October of this year. The \nregulations the FDA hopes to implement will set standards, as the \nSenator from California has said, for x ray film quality, requirements \nfor staff, for reading and interpreting those x rays, and standards for \nrecordkeeping. Those regulations will ensure that mammograms are done \ncorrectly and safely so that we can increase the chances of early \ndetection.\n  Under the Dole bill, implementation of these quality controls in \nmammography will qualify as a major rule, either because they may cost \n$100 million to implement or because they may cause a significant \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities. They will then be \nsubject to the cumbersome, expensive and lengthy cost-benefit analyses \nand risk-assessment process.\n  At a time in this Nation when women are already confused by the mixed \nmessages we receive about breast cancer and other diseases affecting \nus, I believe this bill sends yet another disturbing message: That \nCongress will demand that the FDA choose the lowest-cost alternative by \nplacing a dollar value on a woman's life.\n  We cannot let that happen. The potential positive effects of these \nregulations on the lives of women in this country are substantial. \nImproving the quality of mammography translates directly into early \ndetection of breast cancer. Early detection of breast cancer increases \nthe likelihood of successful treatment and survival. Delay in issuance \nof these regulations will cost women's lives.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Illinois, Senator Simon, summed up a \nsimple and important message that is being lost in this debate on \nregulatory reform. He said what we need in this field is some balance, \nand I could not agree more. The American people want their elected \nofficials to reduce wasteful and unnecessary spending and make their \nGovernment work efficiently. They want a balanced approach to \ndecisionmaking about regulations. They do not want costs to be either \nthe only or primary reason for a regulation. They want us to manage \ntheir tax dollars prudently, while also protecting their health and \ntheir environment.\n  The amendment before us on mammography takes a step toward protecting \ntheir health. I hope that I can support eventually a comprehensive bill \nthat provides true Government efficiency and rational decisionmaking. \nUnfortunately, S. 343 as now drafted does not do this.\n  I urge my colleagues to look carefully at the amendment before us and \nto support it. I can assure all of you that women across this Nation \nare disturbed by the mixed messages they have received about \nmammographies over the last few years. One day we are told if you are \nover 40, have one every 5 years. Then we are told, if you are over 50, \nhave one every year. Then we are told you do not need to have one until \nyou are a certain age.\n  Those messages are disturbing because they will cause women not to \nhave mammograms.\n And when we go in to have one, we want to know that it is safe, \neffective, and we can be assured of that.\n\n  This amendment will assure that this bill will not undo the important \nprogress that we have made on this issue in the past several years. I \nstrongly urge all of my colleagues to accept this amendment so that we \ncan move to a better bill.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, at this time, I would rather withhold the \nrest of my debate until I get to lay down the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that coauthors \nbe added to the pending Baucus amendment as follows: Senators Johnston, \nLautenberg, Bradley, Murray, Feinstein, Reid, Moynihan, Glenn, and \nKennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we were discussing the proposal by the \nSenator from California, Senator Boxer. I wanted to rise in support of \nthe concerns she has expressed here. I think they are very valid. \nYesterday, when we were talking about different areas that would be \naffected if we did not change the April 1 deadline, mammography was one \nof those things that would be affected and would have the potential of \nbeing delayed for almost an indefinite period, if they were forced to \ngo back and start the same risk assessment, the same analysis program, \nall over again.\n  Some of the pending rules that would be affected we listed yesterday, \nsuch as lead soldering, iron toxicity, a whole list of those. One was \nmammography. Let me read from a little summary of why we are concerned \nabout this.\n  The Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992, MQSA, requires the \nestablishment of quality standards for mammography clinics covering \nquality of films produced, training for clinic personnel, \nrecordkeeping, and equipment. MQSA resulted from concerns about the \nquality of mammography services that women rely upon for early \ndetection of breast cancer. FDA is planning to publish proposed \nregulations to implement the MQSA.\n  The potential magnitude of these regulations is substantial, and that \nis what the distinguished Senator from California has been addressing.\n  Improving the quality of mammography translates directly into early \ndetection of breast cancer, and early detection of breast cancer \nincreases the likelihood of successful treatment and survival. An \nintramural was published December 21, 1993. This publication of \nproposed regulations--in other words, follow-on--is planned for October \n1995, but it would not be exempt since that occurs after the April 1 \ncutoff time period that is in the legislation now. So that would mean \nthat under S. 343 the whole process would probably be started all over \nagain.\n  That is why I do not think we want to see that happen. I do not think \nwe want to see the standards delayed unnecessarily and set back the \nrules and regulations and place untold thousands of women in additional \ndanger.\n  I certainly rise to support the proposal made by the distinguished \nSenator from California.\n  In addition to that, I do not believe that the letter from the \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services was entered \ninto the Record. I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary \nShalala, dated July 12, addressed to the minority leader, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Department of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: It is estimated that 46,000 women die \n     every year from breast cancer. It is the second leading cause \n     of cancer death in women. Early and accurate detection can \n     save thousands of lives.\n       The Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) of 1992, \n     enacted on October 22, 1992, \n\n[[Page S 9844]]\n     established quality standards for mammography. MQSA resulted from \n     concerns about breast cancer and the quality of mammography \n     services upon which women rely for early detection of breast \n     cancer. The purpose of MQSA is to ensure all mammography done \n     in this country is safe and reliable.\n       We have completed the first phase of this program. To \n     complete implementation, we must issue final rules that will \n     establish the full range of standards necessary for a \n     national quality assurance program. These rules have been \n     developed through extensive cooperation with the National \n     Mammography Quality Assurance Committee, including five \n     public meetings. The rules are scheduled to be proposed in \n     October.\n       This proposal will include a number of the standards \n     required under the statute, such as guidelines for radiologic \n     equipment, consumer protection provisions, and breast implant \n     imaging.\n       Improving the quality of mammography translates directly \n     into earlier detection of breast cancer, which increases the \n     likelihood of successful treatment and survival. Delay in \n     implementation of the final rule due to the unnecessary and \n     duplicative requirements that would be imposed by S. 343 will \n     delay significant improvements in this life saving program. I \n     urge you to ensure that the MQSA final rule be allowed to \n     proceed without delay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donna E. Shalala.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. She points out some 46,000 women die every year from \nbreast cancer. It is the second leading cause of death in women, and \nthousands of lives can be saved if we go ahead and get the standards \nout, get going with these things, set standards for mammography, x \nrays, and all the other things that go into this.\n  The Mammography Quality Standards Act, enacted back in 1992, \nestablished some of these standards. The purpose of MQSA was to ensure \nthat all the mammography that is done is safe and reliable, it does not \ncause more problems than it is trying to cure.\n  The first phase of all this program has been completed. To complete \nimplementation we need the final rules, still, that will establish the \nfull range of standards necessary for a national quality assurance \nprogram.\n  There has been extensive cooperation with the committee that is \ndealing with this, the National Mammography Quality Assurance \nCommittee, five public meetings and a lot of witnesses, and the rules \nare scheduled to be proposed in October of this year.\n  The proposal will include a number of the standards required under \nthe statutes, such as guidelines for radiologic equipment, consumer \nprotection provisions, and breast implant imaging. Improving the \nquality of mammography translates directly into earlier detection and \nthe likelihood of successful treatment and survival.\n  The delay in implementation of this final rule, due to the \nunnecessary and duplicative requirements that would be imposed by S. \n343, because this does not meet the April 1, 1995, cutoff, will delay \nsignificant improvements in this life-saving program. So the Secretary \nurges the Senate to ensure that the MQSA final rule be allowed to \nproceed without delay. That is what the Senator from California does. \nThat is the reason I rise to speak on behalf of her proposal.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lisa Haage be \npermitted privilege of the floor during consideration of S. 343.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1517\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak in favor of the \npending amendment. This amendment is a very simple amendment.\n  Essentially, it is to delete section 628 of the bill, that section \nnow currently in the bill that makes specific changes to Superfund and \nother hazardous waste cleanup. Simply put, changes to Superfund, I \nbelieve, do not belong in this bill. It is as simple as that. This \nregulatory reform bill was considered earlier in the House, and in \nearlier versions, this section was not in the bill. Somehow, somebody \nlater added in this section, section 628.\n  What does it do? Essentially, it says that all the Superfund \nprovisions now also apply to regulatory reform.\n  I do not think that makes sense. That is a substantive change to a \nregulatory reform law. Much worse, Mr. President, in doing so--that is, \nincluding Superfund in regulatory reform--the net result is we would \nhave a present bad situation made much worse.\n  Let me explain. If section 628 is enacted, that is, the provision in \nthe bill which includes Superfund to the new cost-benefit and risk \nassessment provisions in regulatory reform, the Superfund program that \ncurrently exists in our country becomes much more complicated, not \nless.\n  All across the country hundreds of hazardous waste cleanups would be \ndisrupted. They would be delayed. In some cases, they would be halted. \nIf we can believe it, section 628 would actually make the present very \ncomplicated, very unfortunate and very disrupted Superfund program even \nslower, even more complicated, and much more bureaucratic than it \nalready is.\n  I am reminded of the late sage of Baltimore, H.L. Mencken. He once \nsaid, for every complicated, complex problem there is a simple \nsolution. It is easy. But it is usually wrong.\n  I cannot think of a better example of that statement of his. That is, \nSuperfund reforms are very complicated problems. What is the simplest \nsolution presented in this bill? It includes Superfund reform in \nregulatory reform. Simple--and it is wrong.\n  I do not want any person to misunderstand. Those that want to delete \nsection 628 are not defending the status quo. We are not defending the \npresent Superfund program. Far from it. The Superfund has plenty of \nproblems. It must be corrected.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that Superfund was a hastily drafted law \nback in 1979. It was an immediate response to Love Canal. Like most \nhastily drafted laws, it does not work very well. It was not thought \nthrough. Therefore, it is inefficient, ineffective, and many too few \ncleanups and too many lawsuits.\n  There are currently 1,300 cleanup sites--roughly 40,000, but EPA says \n1,300--down from 40,000 to 1,300. Mr. President, 15 years into the \nprogram, out of that 1,300 Superfund sites in our country--that is, \ncleanup of toxic waste--only 278 have been cleaned up. Mr. President, \n15 years, out of 1,300, only 278 have been cleaned up. If we continue \nat this rate, we will finish the job by the year 2040. I might add, \njust in time for my 108th birthday.\n  Unfortunately, the program is slowing down, the present Superfund \nprogram. It is not speeding up, it is slowing down. It now takes almost \n10 years to clean up an average site, and the cost is roughly $30 \nmillion per site, and about 30 percent of the money is spent not in \ncleanup costs but rather on litigation. When as much as 30 cents to the \ndollar goes to lawyers, Mr. President, I think we all think something \nis wrong with the program.\n  I bet that every Senator has his or her own frustrating personal \nexperience with the Superfund--a site where studies have piled up for \nyears, where delay has dragged on, where lawyers and accountants have \nmade money hand over fist, and the local community is left holding the \nbag, and where people have become angry. They want, Mr. President, \nsites to be cleaned up so they can get on with their lives.\n  There are several steps that we should take to improve Superfund. \nFirst, we should establish an allocation system to fairly distribute \nthe cost of cleanups among responsible parties. Current law does not do \nthat.\n  We should reform the liability system so that small businesses and \nmunicipalities are not dragged into burdensome lawsuits.\n  We should improve cleanup standards and take better account of \nscience, economics, and future land use.\n  And we should increase community involvement in the cleanup process. \nRight now, the communities are not involved enough in the early stage \nof Superfund. If they were, the program could work better because the \nlocal folks could say we want this site cleaned up to a higher standard \nfor playground use but this other site cleaned up to a lower standard \nfor industrial use. The communities, the local people, have a much \nbetter idea what that remedy selection should be.\n  There are other changes we should make to the program.\n  Each of the steps is a bit complex. Each requires tradeoffs. Each \nshould be taken carefully. But each step is necessary.\n  This is why Superfund reform is a top priority of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. Last year, the committee reported a bill that \noverhauled \n\n[[Page S 9845]]\nSuperfund from top to bottom, and this year the committee has had seven \nhearings, and the subcommittee chairman, Senator Smith from New \nHampshire, has proposed a sweeping set of reforms and plans to hold a \nmarkup very soon.\n  So the difficult work of rolling up your sleeves and getting the job \ndone of reforming Superfund is well underway and is being undertaken \nthe right way.\n  Unfortunately, section 628 does not advance the cause of reform. It \nsets it back. It takes us in the wrong direction.\n In a nutshell, section 628 subjects any Superfund cleanup or other so-\ncalled environmental management activity that costs $10 million or more \nto the risk assessment and cost-benefit provisions of the bill. That \nsounds pretty straightforward. But consider two points.\n\n  First, this would apply a different standard for risk assessment and \ncost-benefit analysis than exists under current law. So, all of the \nrisk assessment, remedial investigations, feasibility studies and other \nanalysis, and all that bureaucratic gobbledygook that has been done \nunder current law is out the window. Go back to the beginning, this \nsection says. Do it all over again.\n  Second, the new standard applies to hundreds of sites, including many \nsites where cleanup decisions have already been made and even sites \nwhere construction work has already begun.\n  Let me give an example. In my State of Montana we have the largest \nSuperfund site in America, the Clark Fork River, the result of hundreds \nof years of large-scale copper mining. It stretches 120 miles from \nButte, MT, to Missoula. It has 23 priority sites. Only two are cleaned \nup.\n  We have been working for years to get EPA to stop studying and start \ncleaning up. The studies have cost more than $50 million and now, after \nyears of talk, we have a plan that is finally ready to go. EPA, the \nState of Montana, the people of Butte, and the responsible company, \nhave agreed on innovative, cost-effective solutions at several spots \nalong the Clark Fork River.\n  In Butte, for example, rather than remove lead contamination from the \nsoil everywhere, it will only be removed at priority sites, where \nchildren live and play. And to make sure that children remain safe \nunder the plan, they will be monitored. This solution makes sense. It \nis the most sensible way to do the job, and the citizens are anxious to \nget started. But this bill stops all that dead in its tracks. Montana's \nGovernor, Marc Racicot, wrote me last Friday with this comment.\n\n       If it was necessary to undertake the kind of cost-benefit \n     analysis and risk assessment called for in the bill for these \n     response actions, given how long it would take to do this, \n     the clean-up of these sites, if such clean-up occurred at \n     all, would not occur until well into the 21st century.\n       This is all the sillier when one considers that EPA \n     routinely prepares risk assessments and undertakes a form of \n     cost-benefit analysis when it makes a decision.\n\n  So the cleanup at the Clark Fork will grind to a halt. The cleanup \nwill stop until yet another study is completed. The families and \nchildren of Butte, Anaconda, Deer Lodge, Bonner, Lolo, Missoula, and \nall the other towns on the river that live with pollution, fish kills, \nand threats to drinking water for years longer will have to suffer. And \nif the cleanup standard established after these new studies is too low, \nthe damage will be magnified. And all to no purpose, because the EPA \nhas already done the work.\n  Let me give another example: The streamside tailings along Silver Bow \nCreek. Here, the State has just completed a detailed study of seven \ndifferent options for cleaning it up and the people in the community \nhave thought it through. Among other things, they will turn part of the \nsite into a ``greenway'' with bike trails and hiking trails and picnic \nareas. But only one of the seven options is less than $10 million, the \nthreshold under the bill, and that is the option of doing absolutely \nnothing. So any decision to clean up the site, even minimally, will \nrequire new cost-benefit studies to be repeated. Once again, the \ncommunity's plan gets delayed and maybe even gets thrown out the \nwindow.\n  Jack Lynch, the chief executive of Butte-Silver Bow County, wrote me \nto express concern about another cleanup--Berkeley Pit. The pit is an \nopen copper mine just outside of Butte, abandoned when the Anaconda Co. \nleft town in the early 1980's. Mr. President, I wish you could see this \nabandoned pit. It is about a mile and a half wide. Every day it is \nfilling up with about 6 million gallons of what you can loosely call \nwater. In fact, it is a liquid so acidic it might burn your eyes out if \nyou attempted to use it to wash your face. The water is so deep now, \nyou can even see waves on a windy day, and if it is not stopped, it \nwill threaten Butte's ground water. Despite these problems, the bill, \nthe one pending before us, would force the people of Butte to endure \nmore studies and more delay.\n  I can tell you, the people of Butte are up to their necks in studies. \nThey would rather have something done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letters from Governor \nRacicot and Chief Executive Lynch be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                             State of Montana,\n\n                                         Helena, MT, July 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: I write to express concern over \n     certain aspects of the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of \n     1995, as introduced on June 21, 1995. In short, I am deeply \n     concerned that the bill, if enacted into law, would frustrate \n     response actions and restoration of the Upper Clark Fork \n     River Basin NPL sites.\n       In order to explain the basis for my concern, a brief \n     discussion of my understanding of the bill follows: Section \n     628 of the bill imposes requirements for major environmental \n     management activities. The bill defines these activities to \n     include response actions and damage assessments costing more \n     than 10 million dollars pursuant to the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Such \n     activities must meet ``decisional criteria'' established \n     under Sec. 624 of the bill. In order to ensure that the \n     decisional criteria are met, an agency must prepare a cost-\n     benefit analysis and risk assessment (the requirements for \n     which are set forth in Subchapters II and III of the bill) \n     for all such activities pending on the date of enactment of \n     the bill or proposed after such date. However, the bill \n     appears to give an agency some discretion for actions that \n     are pending on the date of enactment or proposed within a \n     year of such date. For these actions a cost-benefit analysis \n     or risk assessment under Subchapters II and III need not be \n     prepared, but an agency can use alternative analyses in order \n     to determine that the decisional criteria are met. For all \n     risk assessments prepared by an agency, even a non-Subchapter \n     III risk assessment, Sec. 623 allows an interested person to \n     petition an agency to prepare a revised risk assessment and \n     then allows for judicial review of the agency's decision.\n       The decisional criteria of Sec. 623 envision two scenarios. \n     The first scenario mandates that an agency determine 1) that \n     the action's benefits justify its costs, 2) that the action \n     employ ``flexible'' alternatives ``to the extent \n     practicable,'' 3) that the action adopts the least cost \n     alternative that ``achieves the objectives of the statute,'' \n     and 4) that the action, if a risk assessment is required, \n     ``significantly reduce risks'' or if such a finding can not \n     be made, that the action is nonetheless justified and is \n     ``consistent'' with Subchapter III (which sets forth \n     requirements and standards for risk assessments). The second \n     scenario is when an agency cannot make a finding that an \n     action's benefits justify its costs. In this case, an action \n     must meet all the other criteria identified above and an \n     agency must prepare and submit to Congress a written \n     explanation of its decision.\n       Section 624 specifically states that its requirements \n     ``shall supplement and not supersede any other decisional \n     criteria. . . .'' Section 628, regarding major environmental \n     management activities contains this same statement.\n       As you are aware, EPA and the State of Montana are \n     presently engaged in a cooperative effort to determine and \n     implement appropriate response actions to address adverse \n     impacts to human health and the environment at the Upper \n     Clark Fork Basin NPL sites. As you are also aware, response \n     actions have been completed, are ongoing, have been proposed, \n     and are in the RI/FS developmental stage.\n       It is important to note that Sec. 628 would apply to \n     virtually all response actions, even ongoing response \n     actions. Section 628 applies to ongoing response actions \n     unless ``construction or other remediation activity has \n     commenced on a significant portion of the activity'' and it \n     is ``more cost-effective to complete the work'' than to \n     undertake the analysis called for by Sec. 628 or the delays \n     caused by undertaking the analysis will ``result in \n     significant risk to human health or the environment.'' This \n     exclusion is so narrowly drawn that almost all response \n     actions, including ongoing response actions at the Clark Fork \n     sites, would be subject to the requirements of Sec. 628.\n       For a pending action, which presumably means either an \n     ongoing response action or a response action for which there \n     is a ROD, or \n\n[[Page S 9846]]\n     for a response action that is proposed within a year after the bill's \n     enactment, which presumably means a proposed plan on a ROD, \n     an agency apparently does not have to prepare a risk \n     assessment or a cost-benefit analysis pursuant to the \n     requirements of the bill. Rather, an agency may use \n     alternative methodologies to make such a determination.\n       Thus, at a minimum, the requirement to prepare a cost-\n     benefit analysis and risk assessment will apply to actions \n     proposed more than a year after enactment. If enacted in this \n     session, the bill would likely impose these requirements for \n     several response actions. For example, the response actions \n     for the Clark Fork River and Anaconda Regional Water and \n     Waste are some years away. If it was necessary to undertake \n     the kind of cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment called \n     for in the bill for these response actions, given how long it \n     would take to do this, the clean-up of these sites, if such \n     clean-up occurred at all, would not occur until well into the \n     21st century.\n       This is all the sillier when one considers that EPA \n     routinely prepares risk assessments and undertakes a form of \n     cost-benefit analysis when it makes a decision. The bill, \n     however, would require preparation of its highly \n     particularized form of these two analyses, while imposing an \n     entirely new layer of what can only be termed ``bureaucratic \n     requirements'' for the performance of these tasks. The end \n     result would be to make the performance of risk assessments \n     and cost-benefit analyses much more onerous than what EPA \n     presently does.\n       Another problem with the bill concerns it provisions for \n     petitions to revise risk assessments. Thus, non-Subchapter \n     III risk assessments that accompany response actions can be, \n     and will be, challenged. Allowance for judicial review will \n     then cause the particular response action to\n      remain in a holding pattern while the sufficiency of the \n     risk assessment is litigated. The end result will be more \n     lawyers and delay.\n       Regardless of whether a strict cost-benefit analysis or \n     risk assessment has to be prepared, all response actions \n     (except those falling within the narrow significant \n     commencement of construction exclusion) must meet the \n     decisional criteria of Sec. 624. Thus, ongoing response \n     actions, response actions for which there is already a ROD, \n     and proposed ROD's will have to retrace their steps and \n     reopen their proceedings in order to make the findings \n     required by this section. And all this after an extensive \n     administrative process, with input from the potentially \n     responsible parties and the public. The lack of finality, \n     which this bill condones and even promotes, results in \n     inefficiencies and, of course, prevents a timely clean-up. I \n     do not believe that such a process constitutes an improvement \n     over the present statutory and regulatory scheme.\n       Then there is the question of the nature of the criteria. \n     The bill states that the criteria do not supersede but only \n     supplement any other decisional criteria provided by law. \n     This may be a distinction without a difference. The \n     decisional criteria mandate specific findings. Thus, they \n     supplement and supersede the cleanup standards of Sec. 121 of \n     CERCLA. In any event, and notwithstanding the provisions of \n     Sec. 121, it is clear that the response action must meet the \n     decisional criteria of Sec. 624.\n       The decisional criteria are not without problems, however. \n     For example, when do benefits justify costs? Put another way, \n     is justification synonymous with benefits > costs? Leaving \n     aside definitional problems, which will lead to much \n     litigation, discourage settlements and cooperation between \n     the PRP and EPA, and put cleanups on a slow track, such a \n     requirement is unnecessary. When EPA undertakes a response \n     action it has made a determination that based on the \n     statutory standards, which include that EPA consider costs, \n     the societal benefits from that action justify undertaking \n     it. This is nothing more than a cost-benefit analysis.\n       Another of the decisional criteria requires that the least \n     cost alternative that achieves the objectives of the statute \n     be selected. This criteria is also highly problematic. For \n     example, two alternative response actions exist at a \n     particular site. One is less expensive than the other but \n     does not protect public health and the environment to the \n     degree that the more expensive alternative does. Accordingly, \n     both alternatives accomplish, but to varying degrees, the \n     objectives of CERCLA. Under this criteria, however, the lower \n     cost alternative would have to be selected, even if the other \n     alternative was slightly more expensive but significantly \n     more protective of public health and the environment. This is \n     nonsensical.\n       The consequences on the Upper Clark Fork Basin NPL sites \n     from the bill would be drastic. To the extent EPA is required \n     to perform the risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses as \n     set forth in the bill, cleanup actions would be delayed for \n     years. Any risk assessment by EPA could also be challenged in \n     petition proceeding. Timely cleanup will also be frustrated \n     by the decisional criteria. PRPs, will utilize the vagueness \n     and uncertainty associated with the criteria as leverage.\n       Thus, PRPs will be unwilling to enter into consent decrees \n     and more willing to take their chances in court armed with \n     the criteria. This will cause fewer settlements of actions. \n     It will also, of course, create pressure on EPA to settle for \n     less. Similarly, even if EPA is unwilling to settle on the \n     terms of the PRPs, EPA will have to take into account the \n     risk that its action may not be upheld if challenged. \n     Accordingly, EPA will seek less in its remedy than it would \n     otherwise. As a consequence, the cleanup of the Upper Clark \n     Fork Basin NPL sites both in terms of its timeliness and its \n     completeness will be jeopardized. Given the impacts to public \n     health and the environment in this area, and the degree to \n     which it will likely not be possible to fully remediate these \n     impacts, any lessening of cleanup will be significant indeed.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The bill also presents a significant threat to the State of \n     Montana's natural resource damage litigation and \n     concomitantly the obligation of the State acting as trustee \n     on behalf of its citizens to redress injuries to natural \n     resources and make the public whole.\n       Major environmental management activities are also defined \n     to include ``damage assessments.'' There is only one form of \n     damage assessment under CERCLA and that is a natural resource \n     damage assessment. Accordingly, it is clear that the bill is \n     attempting to bring within its scope actions related to \n     natural resource damage recovery. It is not entirely clear \n     that the bill is successful in this regard because the bill \n     imposes its requirements on ``agencies.'' Under CERCLA, \n     however, natural resource damages are recovered on behalf of \n     trustees. Notwithstanding the use of the term ``agency,'' it \n     is likely that the bill would be read to impose its \n     requirements on trustees given its clear intent to reach \n     recoveries of natural resource damages.\n       Thus, the State of Montana, in the pursuit of its natural \n     resource damage case, would be bound by the same requirements \n     as EPA for response actions. Restoration actions have not \n     commenced so the State's natural resource damage assessment \n     and restoration plan would be subject to the bill.\n       There are two principal problems. First, the bill would \n     necessitate that the State's assessment and restoration plan \n     be revised to meet the new requirements. This would present a \n     real problem for the State since the litigation is proceeding \n     forward. To revise the State's assessment would bring the \n     litigation to a screeching halt, undo much work that has \n     already been done, and would extend the litigation and \n     administrative process on which the litigation depends for \n     years. It would also cost the State hundreds of thousands of \n     dollars to comply with the bill's requirements.\n       More fundamentally, however, the bill seems to eliminate \n     the possibility of the State recovering restoration costs. In \n     the State's restoration plan various alternatives were \n     identified that would ``restore'' the resource. The plan \n     acknowledged that given the severity of the injury, actions\n      could not be performed that resulted in immediate or near-\n     term restoration, but felt that this fact should not act \n     to disable the State from taking actions that mitigated \n     injury and so hastened--somewhat--the eventual full \n     recovery of the resource. The plan further acknowledged \n     that in the end resources would be restored as a result of \n     natural recovery. As noted, various alternatives were \n     proposed that to varying degrees mitigated injury. One \n     alternative that was always considered was the alternative \n     of natural recovery. This alternative will result in the \n     restoration of resources in the Upper Clark Fork Basin; \n     however, restoration will not occur for thousands or tens \n     of thousands of years. Since the purpose of the natural \n     resource damage provions of CERCLA is restoration and \n     since natural recovery will accomplish restoration and \n     will almost always be the least cost alternative \n     considered, the bill's decisional criteria would mandate \n     the selection of this alternative notwithstanding any \n     other considerations.\n       Please object to the provisions of the Regulatory Reform \n     Act that would be harmful to the interests of the State of \n     Montana.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Marc Racicot,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 Butte-Silver Bow,\n\n\n                                                   Courthouse,\n\n                                         Butte, MT, June 28, 1995.\n     Senator Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Max Baucus: I am writing today to express my \n     concerns about certain provisions of the Regulatory Reform \n     Bill. While I surely understand the need for reform, and I \n     applaud the Senate for taking a leadership role in the \n     development of sound reform policy, I have serious \n     reservations that the provisions related to new cost-benefit \n     analyses for Superfund sites will damage and delay ongoing \n     clean-up efforts in Butte and sites along the Clark Fork \n     River.\n       I can understand how a thorough cost-benefit analysis would \n     be useful for a new site or sites that are early in the \n     process of investigation. However, in Butte, we are well down \n     the road in the decision-making process for several \n     ``operable units'' within the four NPL sites. There are \n     Records of Decision and various Decrees for several sites, \n     such as the Berkeley Pit/Mine Flooding area, the Montana Pole \n     Treatment Plant, the Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, the \n     Priority Soils Area, Lower Area One/Colorado Tailings, and \n     most recently, the Streamside Tailings along Silver Bow \n     Creek. The prospects of stopping this progress to conduct \n     additional cost-benefit analyses (as per the draft provisions \n     of the legislation, Sections 624 and 628) would be damaging. \n\n[[Page S 9847]]\n\n       I can assure you that, in Butte, cost has been a \n     significant factor in the decision-making process. In our \n     efforts to work with the regulatory agencies and the PRP's in \n     our area, we have developed a very practical view of the \n     balance between clean up and resources expended. We have \n     worked hard to incorporate and substantially address cost \n     considerations in the remedy selection process.\n       Senator, I would ask that you ensure that any new \n     legislation designed to provide regulatory reform does not, \n     in the process, slow down the work already in progress where \n     significant decisions have been made. If you would like \n     additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jack Lynch,\n                                                  Chief Executive.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Section 628, the section I think should be deleted, \nclearly causes big problems for the State of Montana. But not just the \nState of Montana. In fact, my best estimate is the provision affects at \nleast 650 Superfund sites across the country. That is virtually every \nState. Let me give the numbers.\n  Today, studies are underway at 263 Superfund sites. Remedies costing \nmore than $10 million have been selected at 285 sites. And cleanup is \nunderway at 430 sites. We do not know how many of these 430 exceed the \n$10 million threshold, but the average cleanup cost is $30 million. So, \nobviously, most exceed the threshold. So a conservative estimate is \nthat half of the 430 sites exceed the threshold.\n  This chart at my left illustrates what would happen to these sites \nunder this bill. Consider the 285 sites where a remedy has already been \nselected. At each site there has been extensive study, public \ninvolvement, and negotiation. After years, people have finally agreed \nabout how to clean up the site.\n  Let me refer to the chart more fully. Now, as I said, there are about \n263 of the sites where study is underway, in red. The yellow shows \nthere are 285 sites where the remedy has been selected. And the green \nshows there are 430 where there is ongoing cleanup. That is the current \nsituation.\n  If S. 343 passes, including the section which we want deleted, what \nwill the result be? The result would be twice as many studies. And it \nwill mean--as the chart shows, only half as many sites will be cleaned \nup. That is a conservative estimate of the consequences of this bill. \nThese sites will get thrown back for further study, which could take \nyears.\n  Consider the 430 sites where there is an ongoing cleanup. Those sites \nalso get thrown back into further study, unless we can prove the \nconstruction has commenced on a ``significant portion of the \nactivity,'' whatever that means, and if other criteria are met.\n  So putting all this together, the impact of section 628 is very \nsimple. The number of studies will double and the number of Superfund \ncleanups will be cut in half. This chart shows it. The red is the \nnumber of studies which will double. The green shows cleanups which \nwill be cut in half.\n  I will say that once more. The number of studies will double and the \nnumber of cleanups are cut in half. A lot more redtape. A lot less \ncleanup. I do not I think that is what we want to do.\n  All across America people will wake up and discover that the \npurported regulatory reform bill has a very surprising effect. They \nwill discover that virtually with no notice whatsoever, Congress has \nstopped Superfund cleanups dead in their tracks, and the residents of \nfrustrated and exhausted communities will discover to their amazement \nthat Congress has decided that Superfund sites need more study, more \nanalysis, and more talk before a single shovelful of dirt can be moved \nor a single thimbleful of groundwater could be pumped.\n  Before concluding, I would like to repeat a point I made earlier. I \nam not defending the status quo. Superfund needs to be reformed. And \nsome of the needed reforms may well relate to risk assessment and cost-\nbenefit analysis. The Environmental and Public Works Committee reform \nefforts are well underway. But the issues are complex, they are \ncontroversial, and we cannot reform Superfund overnight.\n  Ironically, the bill repeats the same mistakes that the original \ndrafters of Superfund made in 1980; that is, it is a hasty \noverreaction. It is a quick fix. It will cause a lot more problems than \nit would solve. But it is likely to have a very harsh consequence as \nwell for the people who want their neighborhoods cleaned up and have \nalready suffered enough.\n  H.L. Mencken must be smiling as he looks down on us from heaven \ntoday. We are addressing a complex, difficult issue and we are \nconsidering a simple, straightforward, easy solution that is dead \nwrong.\n  It is for these reasons I urge my colleagues to support my amendment \nand strike this provision from the bill.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Earlier on we were \nwaiting for a reply to a proposal by Senator Johnston on the Superfund \nwithdrawal bill. The majority leader indicated that he would check on \nhis side and get back to us. I believe it was agreed--correct me if I \nam not correct--that the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, was to \nbe recognized to speak on her amendment with the idea that, if the \nmajority leader came back, we would then complete action on the \nJohnston proposal after which time she would be permitted to continue.\n  Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement provided that once the Johnston \namendment is disposed of, the Senator from California may offer her \namendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes. We were getting in a little time situation here where \nthe Senator from New Jersey was going to speak I believe on a similar \nsubject. I wanted to make sure everybody was aware of what the \nparliamentary situation was in case the majority leader comes back to \nthe floor and we finish the work on the Johnston amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I want to be sure. I intend to speak on the Superfund \namendment, though I support the amendment by the Senator from \nCalifornia. And I assume that, once having that recognition from the \nfloor, I will be able to continue my remarks.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it--correct me, if I am wrong--as soon \nas the Superfund amendment is disposed of one way or the other then \nanybody can call up an amendment. Or is it by unanimous consent that \nthe Senator from California would have the right to call up her \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement provided that the Senator from \nCalifornia would have the right to call up her amendment.\n  The Chair previously recognized the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from New Jersey would be happy with a \nunanimous-consent agreement to yield to the Senator from Montana to \npermit him to make his inquiry and to conduct such business as he would \nlike.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for clearing the \nagenda.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to talk about the \nsection 628 of the pending regulatory reform bill. I am delighted to \ncosponsor this amendment. It deals with environmental cleanup.\n  As the former chairman and current ranking member of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee with the jurisdiction over Superfund, I \nbelieve that adoption of this amendment is critical to achieving real \nreform in the program. Let me begin by explaining it.\n  The language sought to strike has nothing to do with reforming the \nregulatory process. It has everything to do with undermining and \ninvalidating specific regulations. It does not allow the reform \nregulatory process to work. Rather, it is an effort to mandate an \noutcome of that process.\n  The Superfund provision in the Dole-Johnston substitute makes an \nexception to the general rules established in the bill so that efforts \nto regulate Superfund sites--and only Superfund sites--are to be \ntreated differently \n\n[[Page S 9848]]\nthan all other regulatory actions. As we know, the bill currently says \nthat only if a regulatory decision costs more than $100 million it is \nconsidered a major rule, thus triggering lengthy reviews and certain \nprotections in the bill. Only a small percentage of Superfund sites \ninvolve costs of more than $100 million. As a result, most Superfund \nsites would be exempt from the procedures I just mentioned that are \nestablished by the bill.\n  That was apparently unacceptable to those who want to avoid costs and \ndelay in cleanups. As a result, they created the lower threshold of $10 \nmillion which would apply only to Superfund sites. And if that triggers \nsome suspicion in the minds of those who are trying to figure it out, \nthat suspicion is warranted. Every other regulatory decision has to \ncost more than $100 million before it is considered a major rule. But \nat Superfund sites--and only there--the threshold will be considered to \nbe a major rule when it starts at $10 million.\n  There is no logical explanation of why; no justification for the \nexception, just a little provision that treats Superfund differently \nthan any other program in the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, to me it is obvious that there is intentionally or \notherwise a mission here that would emasculate the Superfund program. \nThat may satisfy some who will do what they can to delay the cleanups \nrequired, or at least for it to kill the program. It may help those who \nwant to escape their obligation to pay for the cleanup of sites but it \nwill not satisfy those who want to get after the environmental blight, \nand it should not satisfy anyone who wants to protect the health and \nsafety of the millions of Americans who live, work, or play near \nSuperfund sites.\n  By the way, for many, that is not an option. That is where home is. \nThat is where work is. That is where a school might be. They did not \nchoose to build or to live near these sites. But, unfortunately, once \nthese environmental problems were discovered it was a new learning \nexperience for people. Suddenly, they learned that perhaps the water \nsupply may be contaminated or the ground that their kids are playing on \nmay be dangerous for them.\n  One of the many unintended impacts of this bill is the dead certain \nproposition that it will make the problems that plague the Superfund \nprogram worse.\n  This bill would have the effect of stopping Superfund cleanups in \ntheir tracks apparently under the theory that we need to spend more \ntime doing more studies before deciding what we can do to clean up the \nmess that we have already been studying for years and years.\n  Let us be candid. The Superfund program already contains an extensive \nrisk analysis and cost-benefit evaluation. The private parties who are \nresponsible for the cleanup are already involved in the remediation \nprocess. And so is the affected community. The criticism of the \nSuperfund program is that it studies too much and does too little. Look \nat what we do already.\n  Superfund site remediation decisions are not made casually or without \nconsideration of risks or cost benefit. Under the present law, EPA must \nconduct numerous studies and consider costs and other factors in \nselecting a cleanup remedy. During the remedy selection phase, a \ndetailed risk assessment is conducted by looking at the people and the \nenvironment exposed to the risks associated with the Superfund with \nthis toxic site. For the pathways of exposure, such as ground water, \nsurface water, air, soil, however, the contamination travels in the \nspecific contaminants present at the site.\n  Following these studies, EPA announces a proposed cleanup approach, \nreceives public comment on that approach, and issues a record decision \nto memorialize its final cleanup decision.\n  Often the private parties performing the studies in cleanups have \nbeen very involved in developing the appropriate remedy. We do all of \nthat now. Yet, S. 343 says that we ought to do more studies which \nwould, of course, mean less cleanup. It allows a party to reopen the \nwhole process once a decision about how a cleanup process ought to \nproceed. In fact, it will allow a party to reopen the whole program \neven after construction and implementation of the cleanup program has \nbegun.\n  This legislation virtually requires an expensive, slow, and often \nduplicative study process even if the private parties involved are not \nwanted and did not believe it was necessary. This bill would virtually \nrequire reconsideration and reevaluation of the cleanup strategies that \nare being developed and instituted at hundreds of sites. This would be \na tragic development and a tremendous waste of resources. It would \ncause great consternation at the sites where communities have \nnegotiated and agreed to a level of cleanup that could be overruled by \nthis law.\n  How do we explain to the residents living near Superfund sites that \nwe are going to throw out years of study, years of work, and \nconstruction in many cases and stop and restudy the whole cleanup from \nstart to finish?\n  During the last Congress, EPA, industry and the environmental \ncommunity produced a set of consensus proposals to reform Superfund, to \nreduce litigation, to speed cleanups, to cut repetitive analysis and to \nimprove public participation in the cleanup process.\n  Mr. President, I was again then chairman of the subcommittee, and \neverybody worked hard--Democrats, Republicans, the administration, \noutside groups, be they industry, academic, Government, \nenvironmentalist. Everybody pitched in to try to reform Superfund \nbecause there have been problems with it. No one can deny that. But its \nmission is a purposeful one.\n  As a result of some obstruction, we did not pass that reform \nSuperfund proposal. Frankly, I thought it was an environmental tragedy \nafter so much work and so much agreement had been hammered out with \nparties that typically disagree, and here we are today now first \nreviewing the Superfund program. Once again, it is nearing its \nexpiration date. Lots and lots of money has been spent, billions by the \nway, and much of it in the learning process because, unfortunately, it \nwas not the job that we expected to have to do when we set out to do \nit. It took a lot more because the toxic contamination was a lot worse, \nand as a consequence we are now in a situation where the moneys spent \nup front are beginning to pay off. But we did not get the chance, we \ndid not have the outcome that we wanted to have to speed cleanups and \nto reduce litigation costs.\n  Additional changes to speed cleanup are now being considered in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and they are likely to be \napproved. This bill threatens to go in the opposite direction by \nincreasing litigation, adding more needless analyses and slowing \ncleanups while saddling EPA with new paperwork burdens.\n  Now, I am working with the chairman of the Superfund subcommittee, \nSenator Smith of New Hampshire, on Superfund reform and \nreauthorization. We do not necessarily agree about how the program \nought to be changed, but the fact is that we are talking, and we are \nbringing in witnesses, and we have had testimony and hearings. I think \nit has improved the atmosphere as well as the possibility that \nSuperfund reform is going to be accomplished in fairly short order. I \nbelieve that we agree that reform is supposed to increase speed and \nreduce redundant studies.\n  This bill is inconsistent, Mr. President, with that vision of reform. \nIt is also inconsistent with a serious effort to get Superfund reformed \nand reauthorized rather than have this buried as a subsection of this \nlong and complex bill dealing with regulatory reform. This is not the \nway to do business.\n  Mr. President, Superfund is not necessarily popular with everybody, \nbut cleaning up our hazardous waste is a mission that all of us I \nbelieve can agree upon. It is a very expensive proposition. It has been \nlooked at over the last 50 years, and finally in 1980, a law was \nestablished to move the process along.\n  Now, private parties do not like cleaning up the mess if they caused \nit or if they are found jointly or severally responsible. Insurance \ncompanies do not like it because they have to pay the claims. But the \nstrongest criticism of our hazardous waste cleanup programs is our \nunending studies to determine the proper remedy.\n  In fact, Congress recently spoke to this issue. During the last \nrescissions bill, $300 million was rescinded from the Department of \nDefense cleanup program because it was felt that too \n\n[[Page S 9849]]\nmuch money was being spent on studies and not enough on cleanups. This \nprovision would require yet more money be spent on just such studies \nwhich would both delay cleanups and leave less money for that task.\n  I do not want to go back to Superfund sites in my State and explain \nto my constituents who live near Superfund sites that agreed upon \nremedies are going to be reopened for a further round of studies.\n  I do not want to have to explain that a new study phase will delay \ncleanup for years and years. They do not like that news. I do not want \nto have to tell them that cleanups already begun will suddenly be \nhalted when they have already lived with threats to them and their \nfamily's health for already too long a period of time.\n  Why is this delay inevitable? Well, in addition to the opportunities \nit gives to private interests to create delay, look at what it does to \nthe Government's ability to move forward quickly. The EPA now processes \nabout 10 major rules a year. Under this bill, it is estimated that EPA \nwill have to do a complete risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis \nfor about 45 major rules each year for the various programs it \nadministers.\n  I wish to make clear what happens with a major rule. It involves lots \nand lots of people. It involves lots of computer use. It involves lots \nof calculation. It involves lots of time and lots of money. This is not \nto say that we should not be doing studies. We should. But we have \nalready done them, done them sufficiently I think to answer all of the \nconcerns that people have. But if our amendment fails here and EPA must \ndo a cost-benefit and risk assessment for Superfund sites over $10 \nmillion, it will have to do approximately 650 additional risk \nassessments and cost-benefit analyses.\n  Mr. President, my argument can be summarized in these three points. \nFirst, the bill before us treats Superfund in an unjustified, special, \nand unique way. It contains a special carveout for the particular \ninterests that want to reduce or evade their responsibility to pay for \ncleanups.\n  Second, the bill before us will inevitably delay cleanups, prolonging \nthe risks those toxic hot spots pose to human beings and to the \nenvironment. That delay is a function of the overt mechanisms in the \nbill which require new studies and the practical inability of EPA to \nconduct the number of studies which will be required.\n  We want EPA to be an organization that conducts cleanups. We do not \nwant it to devote all of its time to doing studies.\n  So the bill will cause delay in cleanup, the one thing that we all \nwant to hasten.\n  And third, there is no finding that these new studies are required. \nSuperfund already has sophisticated cost-benefit and risk analysis. If \nyou think there ought to be changes in the way that analysis is \nconducted, then require those changes when we reauthorize Superfund in \nan orderly process. Do not try to force them into a bill that has a \nmuch more general goal of reforming the process by which we regulate.\n  Mr. President, we ought to let the authorizing committee handle \nSuperfund. We are working toward that goal. And when we bring \nlegislation to the floor we can understand it, we can debate it, and \njustify the decisions that we make. Doing reform in the backdoor manner \nproposed by this bill is totally unacceptable.\n  I want to point out what is here on the chart to emphasize, that is, \nthat presently we have already 430 sites where cleanup is underway. We \nhave decisions being made at 211 sites. We have remedy selections at 74 \nsites and studies already underway at 263 sites. If S. 343 passes as it \nis, then what we will do is we will have to study 763 sites. It means \npractically the end of serious decisions about cleanup and beginning \nthe process.\n  What we will be left with is 215 sites with cleanup underway, as \nopposed to 430, and decisions underway for 211 other sites. We will \nmove into the study phase. This will turn out to be a calculous \nlaboratory where everybody will be participating in studies and not \ngetting work done and will exaggerate criticism that now exists that \nall we do is study things to death. We have studied things, I hope not \nto death, but we have studied them for a long time. The decisions are \nmade on the science available, and there is an orderly process. We \nought not tinker with it, but reform it in an orderly way.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the motion that is \nnow before us to strike the special relief language for special \ninterests that are now in this bill. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to make a few remarks regarding Superfund and the \nreasons why it is included in this legislation. There are a couple of \nanomalous things about the Superfund law. One of them is that there is \nno judicial review. And I think it is no coincidence that one of the \nlaws that is working least well, a point that all of us would agree on, \nis also a law that provides for no judicial review. The second thing is \nthat the Superfund law actually does provide today for some cost-\nbenefited analysis and risk assessment. So it is not a new concept when \napplied to this law.\n  But the bill before us, the Dole-Johnston amendment, would really \nprovide a more precise and meaningful procedure for applying that cost-\nbenefit analysis to Superfund so that the net result should be not more \ncostly studies and delay, but a more precise application of a principle \nwhich is already required and which should make much more efficient the \nprocess for deciding the priority of sites to be cleaned up, and \nprobably also make it easier if the judicial review provisions are put \ninto place to really test those that need to be tested and allow the \nothers to proceed to clean up.\n  So we believe that S. 343 establishes strong, good requirements to do \nthe right kind of risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis for \nSuperfund cleanups. And, of course, the point also here is that it is \nin those cases that exceed $10 million. Now, we have heard arguments \nhere by some that would like to see this section removed from the bill. \nI will make the point first of all that there is much more than \nSuperfund in the amendment which would be removed from this bill. We \nwill leave that for others to discuss.\n  But just to focus on the question of whether the Superfund provision \nshould be removed, in many respects Superfund is an example of the best \nof the worst. Unlike many other programs with tangible results, \nSuperfund has almost nothing to show for its billions of dollars in \nexpenditures of public and private funds, I might add.\n  And again, this is a point upon which a lot of us would agree: \nSuperfund has just not met the expectations that we had for it at the \ntime that it was adopted. So clearly, more effective risk and cost-\nbenefit analysis are desperately needed for the program. These are the \ntools that the Government can use in carrying out the requirements of \nthe law.\n  So instead of trying to remove these provisions from the bill, we \nought to be strengthening those procedures so we can really do the \nprioritization necessary to get to the job of cleaning up the sites \nthat need to be cleaned up and leaving the others alone.\n  As I said before, also ironically, Superfund already requires cost-\nbenefit analysis. It requires the President to select appropriate \nremedial actions that ``provide for cost effective response'' and to \nconsider both the short-term and long-term costs of the actions.\n  It requires the President to establish a regulation called the \nnational contingency plan to carry out the requirements of the statute. \nThis plan has several requirements that would contain methods for \nanalysis of relative costs or remedial actions; means for assuring that \nremedial actions are cost-effective over time; criteria based on \nrelative risk or danger for determining priorities among releases of \nhazardous substances for purposes of taking remedial action. The \nnational contingency plan also requires a baseline risk assessment to \nbe performed for every remedial action. This means that for every \nSuperfund cleanup, a risk assessment is supposed to be done right now.\n  It requires the President to identify priority sites that require \nremedial action through a hazard ranking system that must--again, I am \nquoting--``assess the relative degree of risk.'' \n\n[[Page S 9850]]\n\n  So to suggest that somehow both cost-benefit and risk assessment are \ninconsistent with the Superfund is to ignore existing law. It is in the \nexisting law. So by taking it out of that provision, we are not \nremoving that concept. But what we are doing is preventing ourselves \nfrom providing a more effective means of applying the cost-benefit and \nrisk assessment to Superfund.\n  Now what happens at the typical Superfund site? I exaggerate almost \nnone here, Mr. President. You have a release of some kind of hazardous \nsubstance discovered. The presence of this substance in the environment \nmay or may not be harmful. Before that is even determined, practically \nevery small business in the community that has ever had any contact \nwith the site at all gets a letter.\n  The letter basically says, ``We think you are liable. Prove to us \nthat you are not.'' So immediately, you have all of the small \nbusinesses and some big businesses, too, immediately put into the \nposition of being in a group of defendants having to try to prove that \nthey are not liable for something that frequently occurred a long time \nago without knowledge on their part.\n  The costs to small business are very high. And it costs more than \njust money. The cost in time, in terror, literally, in toil and \nfrustration in dealing with the alleged Superfund liability is one of \nthe most gross aberrations in our legal system that we have on the \nbooks today, which is one of the reasons why there has been a lot of \ndiscussion about the reform of Superfund that hopefully we will get a \nlittle later.\n  But every mom and pop operation that sent trash to a landfill that \nbecame a Superfund site knows exactly what I mean. The strict joint and \nseveral retroactive liability in this law is dragging down small \nbusiness for the third time.\n  And the recourse? Essentially none. Because unlike other laws and \nunlike S. 343 before us, Superfund expressly prohibits judicial review. \nNow, is that really what the opponents of this law applied to Superfund \nwant? I do not think it is coincidence, as I said before, that the most \noppressive and maligned and dysfunctional environmental program we have \nis also the one that prohibits redress in the courts. This is something \non which we are all in agreement.\n  So why can we not agree to provide judicial review to Superfund? Why \nis there opposition to having regulatory reform for Superfund in this \nbill? Even the administration has said it needs to go forward.\n  In a memorandum prepared by the Council on Environmental Quality, the \nadministration correctly pointed out the blatant inconsistencies \nregarding its posture regarding S. 343 and its position on regulatory \nreform and cleanup statutes.\n  Here is what this memo states: That opposition to the intent of the \ncleanup provision in S. 343 is ``inconsistent with several \nadministration policies.''\n  Quoting again. ``The administration has repeatedly testified that \ncost-benefit analysis is a `useful tool' in making cleanup decisions.'' \nAgain quoting. ``EPA, DOD, and DOE have made well-publicized \ncommitments to more realistic risk analysis in cleanup activity,'' \nexactly what we are talking about in this bill.\n  Executive Order 12866 requires cost-benefit analysis for regulations \nover $100 million. Many cleanups exceed this amount and the total cost \nof cleanup activities approaches or exceeds $400 billion. Quoting from \nthis memorandum:\n\n       It will be hard, politically and logically, to defend \n     application of the cost-benefit comparison to the former \n     decisions and not the latter.\n\n  This is the administration speaking.\n  Now, critics of this section argue that these reforms should be \naddressed in the Superfund reauthorization, and that is an appropriate \nplace to deal with some of the reforms we are talking about.\n  That is not to suggest, however, that in a bill dealing with cost-\nbenefit analysis and risk assessment and judicial review those matters \nshould not be dealt with in this legislation.\n  I know that Senator Smith, and others who have spoken here, members \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, have been working very \nhard, but Superfund reauthorization may not be completed this year. I \nknow the committee that I sit on, Energy and Natural Resources, \nunderstands the toll this program is taking on industrial facilities, \nsmall businesses and understands the need to get on with the process of \nreform of the process as opposed to the substance, which will, of \ncourse, be covered in the reauthorization.\n  We are cutting our training and operation budgets in the military \nservices and yet we keep getting higher price tags for installation \ncleanups. I cannot even begin to tell you what the runaway cleanup \ncosts translate to in the Department of Energy.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion, I believe that the Superfund \ncleanup provisions in this legislation are entirely consistent with \nexisting law. They are consistent with planned administrative reforms \nthat the Clinton administration is putting in place even now, as \nindicated by the memorandum I cited, and, perhaps most important, I \nthink many of us would agree that Superfund is not a level playing \nfield, that small business is being savaged by what amounts to \ninstitutionalized extortion from regulations.\n  Federal and State regulators have ignored the risk and cost \nconsiderations throughout the process, in spite of the statutory \nrequirement to consider those factors, and that is why this legislation \nis needed. The program is so badly broken and so desperately in need of \nmajor change, largely because the degree and the costs of cleanup have \nproceeded virtually unchecked for years. Simply having these provisions \nin this bill has brought about a new willingness on the part of \nregulators to be more realistic in the remedial action selection \nprocess.\n  The Superfund provisions of S. 343 are consistent with the law, are a \nneeded reform of the remedy selection process, and are an appropriate \nand necessary reform of one of the most expensive, intimidating and \ncrushing regulatory programs for small business in the history of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wonder if the Senator will yield to me?\n  Mr. KYL. I will be happy to yield. Of course.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I heard the Senator \nsay that in the Senator's opinion that the provisions of S. 343, \nparticularly section 628, are consistent with or conform with basically \nthe Superfund cost-benefit or risk assessment provisions now, and \nbecause they are consistent and basically conform, there should be no \nopposition. My question is, if they are consistent, conform, then what \nis the purpose of this provision? That is, the Superfund already does \ncontain, as the Senator already said, cost-benefit and risk assessment \nprovisions in determining sites and remedy selection and plans for \ncleanup. I am just curious, what is the need for this provision?\n  Mr. KYL. Precisely the correct question to ask, and I appreciate it, \nbecause it applies not only to this issue but several others in other \naspects of this legislation. We have Executive orders since the \nadministration of President Ford, for example, which require cost-\nbenefit analysis, but almost all of us, I think, are in agreement that \nthey have not worked. The procedures are not in place to force \ncompliance and to provide for appropriate judicial review.\n  So what I am saying is that while there is a requirement for cost-\nbenefit analysis and risk assessment in the existing law, it is not \nworking, and the provisions of this bill will allow it to work in a way \nwhich gets to the other point that the Senator from Montana was \nraising, and that is that we have spent a lot of money and do not have \na lot to show for it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand. If I might ask----\n  Mr. KYL. We should not delay any longer. I think this legislation \nwill make the existing regulations workable for the first time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Another question. I am just curious of the Senator's \nview, what is the precise language in section 628 that will speed up \ncleanups, that will address the problems small businesses face, that \nwill reduce regulatory red tape, that addresses the joint and several \nand strict liability problem that bedevils so many parties involving \ncleanup sites? I wonder what is the precise language in this amendment \nwhich addresses the real problems--I agree they exist--that so many \npeople face when dealing with Superfund. Can the \n\n[[Page S 9851]]\nSenator point out some language in the amendment that he thinks will \nspecifically help answer some of those problems?\n  Mr. KYL. Sure. The entire section that establishes the procedure and \nthe judicial review, which is missing from the Superfund legislation, \nwill make it possible for individuals to insist that proper risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis is applied, and if it is not, a \nremedy will exist to require it to be applied, something which does not \nexist today.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am just perplexed, in all candor, because the \nprovisions of section 628 with respect to risk assessment are actually \nquite different from current Superfund law.\n  Let me point out some differences. One, under this bill cleanups \nwould generally be required only if the benefits justify the costs. \nThat is a different standard than current law. And second, under this \nbill only the least-cost cleanup option would be selected. That is now \nnot the case under Superfund.\n  So they are not the same. Thus, S. 343, including section 628, would, \nby definition, require EPA, for example, and the States to stop what \nthey are now doing and go back all over again from scratch and start \nthe risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis, which would add more \ncost, more delay, and more red tape. And because Federal facility sites \nwill cost more than $10 million to clean up, the clean up of each of \nthese sites would be further delayed under the provisions of this bill.\n  Why does the Senator believe that those provisions would not \nnecessarily stop the present cleanup program and cause more red tape, \nmore delay?\n  Mr. KYL. First of all, the Senator is absolutely correct. The \nprovisions of this bill are somewhat different from existing law with \nrespect to the specific tests for cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment. That is the whole point.\n  My point in pointing out that cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment are already part of Superfund was to illustrate two things: \nFirst, that the concept is not alien or inimical to Superfund. This is \nsomething that we have already said should be a part of our analysis \nfor Superfund cleanups.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I could just----\n  Mr. KYL. If I could just go on.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sure.\n  Mr. KYL. And second, to note that while that is true, while it was \nour intention, while we wrote the exact words in the statute, it has \nnot worked. And I think we agree on that.\n  So, yes, the answer to the first question is there are different \nprovisions--that is the whole point--to make it work because it has not \nworked in the past. The administration itself, CEQ, pointed out the \nfact that it would be pretty inconsistent to argue you should have \ncost-benefit analysis before, but now it is not appropriate.\n  But the second question I think the Senator asks is the more \ndifficult question and the one that is really important--and I respect \nthe Senator for raising the issue--namely, we want to get on with the \ncleanup of these sites. Will this cause a delay or not?\n  That is a very legitimate question. But I think, again, there are two \nanswers. One, reasonable people can differ whether it will cause delay. \nWe do not want it to cause delay, but we want it to do the right thing, \nand that is the other point here. We have to do the right thing. A lot \nof us believe we are spending millions and billions of dollars, really, \nin activities which are totally nonproductive where the risks are \nexceedingly low, where we ought not be wasting our money, and there are \nother sites that just beg to be cleaned up. Perhaps one of them is the \nexample the Senator from Montana cited where we have to get on with it \nand prioritize those sites and get the job done where the cost clearly \nis outweighed by the benefits to be achieved. So that is the kind of \nanalysis in which to engage.\n  Instead, what we have is taxpayers paying lawyers and consultants \nbillions of dollars to essentially waste time, dollars that are not \nonly Government dollars but also small business dollars and other \nbusiness dollars,\n and that is what we are trying to resolve with this legislation.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield my time. I have concluded my remarks. If \nthe Senators would like to take it at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Arizona. With all due respect, they are really not on target. That \nis for this reason. We all agree that Superfund has terrific problems. \nBut the problems that it has are not solved by this amendment. This \namendment does not even address--does not even begin to address--the \nproblems of the Superfund. In some sense, they are irrelevant to the \nproblems facing Superfund. I will explain that.\n  One of the main problems of Superfund today is joint and several and \nstrict liability. This amendment has nothing to do with that, despite \nwhat the Senator from Arizona would like us to believe. Under joint and \nseveral and strict liability standards today, all parties are subject \nto the same joint and several and strict liability standard. And what \nhappens? Some company--maybe the primary perpetrator that caused most \nof the toxic waste and hazardous waste at a site and other companies \nmay be partners, or another company may have bought the site later, or \na company may have owned the site earlier. A bank might be involved. A \nbank might have made a certain loan to one of the parties. Under the \ncurrent law, they are all lumped in together. They are all jointly and \nseverally liable and subject to strict liability. That is the current \nlaw.\n  Here is what happens. Everybody sues everybody else claiming that he \nis the principal problem--not me but him. Well, everybody that is \nsubject to liability, of course, is jointly and severally liable. That \nis why there are a lot of lawsuits today. It is the standard which \ncreates the lawsuits. All of the people that are involved are suing \neach other.\n  This amendment has nothing to do with that--nothing to do with that. \nSo to stand up here on the floor of the Senate and say this amendment, \nsection 628, is going to solve the problems of the red tape and delay, \nis a nonstatement, it is not accurate. It is not accurate because the \nproblems facing people that cause all of the problems of the Superfund \nare caused by the underlying statute, substantive law not addressed by \nthis amendment.\n  Here is another example. Let us take a small businessman, somebody \nwho has fewer than 50 barrels of hazardous waste at a site, who is a de \nminimis contributor. Under the provisions of the Superfund reform which \nwe tried to enact last year, small businesses would be either exempt if \nthey are particularly small; or if they are somewhat small, they would \nbe entitled to a very expeditious standard and their liability limited \nto their ability to pay. That is a problem that the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee tried to solve last year. But section 628 of \nthis bill has nothing whatsoever to do with these real problems--\nnothing.\n  All section 628 says is cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment \nmust be prepared. It has nothing to do with the problems of small \nbusiness, Mr. President--nothing. Last year, we tried to enact \nSuperfund reform--and as the Senator from New Jersey a few minutes ago \nvery ably stated, it was stopped. We came up with a provision that \neliminated joint and several liability to those who settled their \nliability through a new voluntary allocation system and not through \ncourt. Under this new allocation system companies would have an \nallocator decide which company is proportionately responsible for which \nportion of the waste. And if the company agrees and settles, they could \nnot be sued; they would be immune from a lawsuit. Good idea. Everybody \nthought it was a good idea. Big business loved it. Small business was \necstatic. Environmentalists thought it was great. All the groups came \ntogether and agreed that this is a good, major reform to the Superfund.\n  There are lots of other reforms in Superfund that we tried to pass \nlast year. Some just did not want it passed. It was a disservice to the \ncountry. So here we are all over again trying to reform Superfund. This \namendment has nothing to do with any of that. Nothing. N-o-t-h-i-n-g. \nThe way to solve Superfund, Mr. President, frankly, is not to pass this \namendment.\n  What does this amendment do? It says you take the current lousy, \nbotched up, unworkable Superfund program and add to all of the \nproblems--more problems. It says start over again \n\n[[Page S 9852]]\nand add a new kind of risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis. That \nis what this amendment does. It says, take the current lousy law and \ndelay it further, add more redtape, start all over again. It means \nfewer cleanups. There are lots of sites in this country, Mr. President, \nwhere cleanups are finally agreed to and are in progress. It has taken \n10, 12, 15 years in some cases. This amendment says go back and start \nover again. That is exactly what it does, despite what anybody else \nsays.\n  So the answer, I think--and I have given a lot of thoughtful \nconsideration to this, not rhetoric or a lot of stuff, not playing to \nthe cameras--a thoughtful solution to this, frankly, is to delete this \nprovision from the bill. It is not going to solve the Superfund \nproblems. Somebody might like to say that it does for the people back \nhome. In fact, it makes it worse.\n  Rather, let us solve this the only way these problems can be solved; \nthat is, to lower the rhetoric, quit the demagoguery, sit down and work \nwith all of the people involved. You roll up your sleeves and cross the \nt's and dot the i's and find a solution, which is what happened over a \nyear ago. Many outside groups who know the subject came together, \nworked hard, and reached an agreement. Most of the insurance industry \nalso agreed. Some of the insurance industry did not agree, but most \ndid.\n  Let me read some of the supporters of it: Aetna Life Insurance, \nAllied Signal, American Automobile Manufacturers--this list goes on and \non, and I will not bore the Senate. I am glancing here, and these are \nbig, well-recognized organizations and companies. There must be over \n100 on this list.\n  One of the greatest disservices this Congress has performed, in my \njudgment, in the last several years is the failure to pass Superfund \nlegislation a year ago because it was a solid reform that would have \nhelped people, provided a public service, which is what we are all \nelected to do. This amendment in this bill, section 628, not only does \nnot do that, it makes a bad problem worse.\n  I just ask every Senator and every staff person listening to forget \nthe rhetoric, read the provisions of this bill, section 628, read \nSuperfund, and just think. All you have to do is think. If you think, \nyou are going to reach, I submit, roughly the same conclusion and \ntherefore realize that, maybe we should not be including Superfund in \nthis regulatory reform bill after all. And if we are going to do right \nby our people back home, let us take it out and reform Superfund in the \nright way, through the committee process, something along the lines \nthat we enacted a year ago.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield to no one in this body on my \nenthusiasm for risk assessment. It was I who first proposed, wrote, and \npassed twice a risk assessment provision, which did not pass the House, \nof course, and so we are here today working on this legislation.\n  I believe the concept of risk assessment is one of the most important \nthings we can ever do for this Government. It will save, I believe, \nhundreds of billions of dollars. It will relieve taxpayers and citizens \nof this country of huge and unnecessary burdens and will allow the \nmeans that we have, the dollars that we have in this country, to be \nspent on environmental and health and safety matters, to be applied to \nenvironment and safety and health matters and not to waste, as it is \ntoday.\n  Now, having said that, Mr. President, I rise in enthusiastic and very \nstrong support of this amendment. The reason is that this amendment and \nthe application of this procedure to Superfund, as well as to defense \ncleanups, as well as to cleanups under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, do \nnot fit.\n  They do not fit, Mr. President. We have been talking about Superfund, \nand I concur with comments of my colleague from Montana, that that \nneeds to go through that committee. That committee voted out and passed \nthat bill last year. We need to do that again this year.\n  Mr. President, we have not spoken about cleanup at defense plants. \nCleanup at defense plants is an activity on which we are presently \nspending over $6 billion a year. It is the largest cleanup activity of \nthe Federal Government.\n  Now, Mr. President, we commissioned a report on the Hanford site, \nwhich is the most difficult site and the most expensive site of the \nDOE. They came back with a horror story about how money is being \nsquandered and nothing is being done. I will not go into all the \nreasons, but the principal reasons are that the legal matrix, the legal \nframework that we in the Congress have created for Hanford as well as \nother DOE sites, does not work.\n  We not only have the Superfund, which is applicable to Hanford, we \nhave RCRA, which pertains to chemical wastes. We have a tripartite \nagreement setting standards, dates, and requirements--dates that cannot \nbe met, standards that have not been passed, and using technologies \nthat do not exist.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, we have superimposed upon that an act we \ncall the Federal Facilities Act, under which the Federal Government can \nbe sued and the Assistant Secretary of Energy can be put in jail--\nsomething he is very concerned about--if they do not meet standards and \ndates that are impossible to meet because there is no place, for \nexample, to store the waste, because the waste isolation pilot plant is \nnot ready, and that is the only place available for some of these mixed \nwastes.\n  Mr. President, it is probably only the Congress of the United States \nwhich could have designed a legal framework as confusing, as \ncontradictory, as difficult, as unworkable, as unbelievable as we have \ncreated for our defense plants' cleanups.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] and I \nhave proposed legislation for Hanford. We have proposed to deal not \nonly with CERCLA but RCRA, the Federal Facilities Act, the tripartite \nagreement. We proposed to reconstruct that and do it over again.\n  It is not that we do not want to use risk assessment. Risk assessment \nis central to the issue. It is a risk assessment procedure that would \nbe vastly different from that which we have constructed in this bill.\n  This bill constructs risk assessment principally for Federal \nrulemaking, EPA-type rules. It is workable, a good procedure, which, \nMr. President, I am very proud of the handiwork in the Dole-Johnston \nbill. I think it is workable. I think it will improve environment. I \nthink it will improve health. It will save lots of money. It is a very, \nvery good bill.\n  But it does not fit for defense plants' cleanups. We have to deal \nwith those tripartite agreements. They have, Mr. President, as I am \nsure all my colleagues know, a problem at these defense plants, what we \ncall mixed waste--mixed chemical waste and mixed nuclear waste or \nradioactive waste. One set of regulations for radio-active waste, one \nset of regulations for chemical waste, and no technology yet to deal \nwith the mixed wastes. Some promising research is being done, and no \nplace to put the waste.\n  Literally, our Assistant Secretary of Energy, unless we change the \nlaw, can go to jail for not doing what is impossible to accomplish. \nAbsolutely that is true, Mr. President. The waste isolation pilot plant \nis not ready.\n  By the way, the reason it is not ready is also because we do not have \na well-working risk assessment bill. If we did, they would have done \nthe risk assessment and would not be doing some of the silly things \nthey are doing down in Carlsbad, NM, on delay and unnecessary expense \nin the plan.\n  Be that as it may, WIPP is not ready and we have no place to put the \nwaste and we do not have the technology. It is a grand and glorious \nmess.\n  What we propose if we can pass our legislation, Mr. President, is \ncreate this paradigm, this legal matrix, limit it to Hanford, and then \nwe propose to use that as the model for other defense plants. We will \nhave to modify it--things are a little bit different, at Rocky Flats in \nColorado, et cetera. Each one of these sites has their own \npeculiarities. Some have a lot of plutonium, some have a lot of mixed \nwaste. Hanford has almost every imaginable kind of waste.\n  Each of those deserves the time and attention, in the case of defense \nplants, of the Energy Committee; in the case of CERCLA, of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. They are different problems \nfrom those we seek to serve in the Dole-Johnston bill presently \npending.\n  Mr. President, in including Superfund and environmental cleanup \n\n[[Page S 9853]]\n  in the original Dole-Johnston amendment, we knew at the time that we \nincluded it that it would be subject to an amendment and that it would \nprobably come out. I say ``we'' knew that; I do not want to speak for \nanybody else but myself. Let me say that I and my staff knew it and we \ndiscussed it, and I think the feeling was at that time that it should \nbe included in the draft in order, first, to draw attention to the \nissue; second, to give some leverage in assuring that we would deal \nwith the question of Superfund and of defense cleanup.\n  Indeed, we have had Senator Baucus, the ranking member, come and say \nthat he is anxious, willing, and able and can virtually promise that \nthat committee will deal with the issue.\n  I think there are Members who are so anxious for risk assessment to \nbe made part of CERCLA that they want to get those assurances. I think \nnow we have heard those assurances on the floor of the Senate.\n  I hope, therefore, with those assurances, that the committee such as \nEnergy and Natural Resources, with respect to defense plants, can \nproceed and do our business and enact the legislation that Senator \nMurkowski and I presently have pending. I hope that the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee will expeditiously report out that bill again \nwhich we passed last year, and that we can get on and pass this risk-\nassessment cost-benefit legislation presently pending.\n  Mr. President, I am getting more hopeful and more confident as the \nhours pass, that the spirit in this Chamber is such that it will allow \nthe Senate to pass this bill with a strong bipartisan effort. I think \nacceptance of this amendment will be a strong indication of that. I \nhope we can vote soon.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment by the Senator from Montana.\n  Count me in among those who believe that there are serious problems \nwith the superfund program and the Energy Department cleanup program. \nIt is plain to me that we are spending a lot more money, and a lot more \ntime, on lawyers and bureaucracy than we are on getting these cleanups \nunderway.\n  I agree that the superfund program is not working, and I think we \nneed to make major changes to make it work better. But not at the price \nof further delay and further bureaucracy that will delay these cleanups \neven longer.\n  The Rocky Mountain Arsenal outside of Denver was used for years as a \nproduction facility for chemical munitions by the Defense Department. \nSince the 1950's it was used to produce pesticides. The defense \ndepartment and the Shell Oil Co. left a pretty tough mess.\n  In 1984 the site was listed as a national superfund site, and it is \nnow more than a decade that the site has been under study, and \nsignificant cleanup has already occurred to resolve immediate threats \nto human health and the environment. Just last month a conceptual \nagreement was reached on a final cleanup plan at the arsenal. That \nagreement must go through the public comment process and a final \ndecision should be made by early next year.\n  If this amendment is not accepted, the door will be open to anyone to \nfile a new challenge to this long, tortuously negotiated accord based \non the new rights created under this bill to seek additional cost \nbenefit and risk analysis studies.\n  Some Senators may be familiar with the Summitville mine disaster; \nsince that mining company declared bankruptcy and left my State with a \nmassive cleanup problem, we've seen decisions made and cleanup projects \nbegun. Again, I don't want this bill to be the cause of any further \ndelay in getting this critical work underway.\n  I have other, tough cleanup problems in my State, at Leadville, at \nClear Creek, and many other sites. I want this program to work better, \nand I'll be supporting major changes in the program when we consider \nreauthorization later this year.\n  As any of my colleagues who are involved with superfund know, that \nprocess takes too long and our constituents get very frustrated when \nthey see a lot of planning and not much actual cleanup. I don't want to \nextend that process even a day longer than necessary, and so I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Baucus amendment.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thomas pertaining to the introduction of S. 1031 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we had a lot of discussion in the last 3 \ndays on the need for regulatory reform. We have had a lot of horror \nstories presented about undue regulation and what it has done to small \nbusiness people and farmers of the United States. That impacts \nnegatively on everybody as it inhibits the creation of jobs, as it \nbrings undue costs to the operation of a business and, in many \ninstances, with harm to the public if nothing is changed.\n  I have taken the floor several times to discuss some of these \nproblems with existing rules and regulations, or the implementation of \nthose rules and regulations. I want to address another issue like I did \nyesterday on the subject of wetlands.\n  Before I do, I want to visit a little about the general atmosphere of \nthe debate here on this regulatory reform bill in the U.S. Senate. We \nare led to believe that all of our concern about public health and \nsafety and the environmental policies are going to be thrown out the \nwindow with the adoption of a regulatory reform bill. It is not, \nbecause our bill does not change any of the substantive laws that are \non the books in each one of those areas.\n  If it did, that is what we would call, in this body, a supermandate, \none law overriding others. In fact, we recently adopted an amendment \njust to make it more clear that there is nothing in this legislation \nthat is a supermandate. And we have also been hearing a lot of other \nconcern expressed, mostly on the Democratic side of the aisle, about \nbad aspects of this legislation.\n  I would plead with the Democratic Members of this body who have been \nfighting this bill so hard, that they should want Government to work \nwell. They should want Government to work efficiently. They should want \nGovernment to work in a cost-effective way. They should want Government \nto serve people rather than people serving the Government.\n  Another way to say that is, they should want Government to be a \nservant of the people rather than a master of the people.\n  I know Democratic Members of this body believe that all Government is \ngood. And I know that they believe that basically Government means well \nand does well, and they are willing to give the benefit to big \nGovernment, that when there is some doubt about whether Government is \nreally going to do well, that we ought to err on the side of Government \ndoing it.\n That is a legitimate political philosophy that I find no fault with. I \ndo not accept it, but it is a legitimate political philosophy that we \ncan have in our system of government.\n\n  What does that have to do with the bill that is before us and my \npleading with the Democratic Members of this body? There is nothing \nwrong with believing in big Government. There is nothing wrong in \nbelieving, if you think it is best for the country, in a regulatory \nstate. There may not be anything wrong with believing that regulators \nought to dominate more so than the free market system determinations \nmade in our economy.\n  But the very least, if you believe all those things, you should make \nsure that the regulatory state, that the big Government you believe in, \nwill actually work well and effectively deliver the services that you \nwant delivered. And the fact of the matter is this big Government, this \nbig regulatory state that you like so well not only does not deliver \nwell, but the rulemaking process is much more costly than it need be. \nIt impinges upon the marketplace much more than need be to protect the \npublic health and safety and the environment. And it just does not work \nvery well because it never delivers a decision. You know it is just \nawfully difficult to get a decision out of the Government, and \nparticularly when \n\n[[Page S 9854]]\nyou have two Government agencies fighting each other.\n  The very least--I plead with you--if you believe in the big \nGovernment that you practice, that you ought to be for making it \nefficient and effective. And your big Government and your big \nregulatory state, we are saying on this side of the aisle, does not \nwork very well, and we see S. 343 as a process of making sure that it \nis cost effective because of the cost-benefit analysis, that it has a \nsound basis because we require scientific determinations and risk \nassessment, and that it should not be a law unto itself. We protect \nagainst that in this legislation through congressional review of \nregulatory action and through judicial review of regulatory action.\n  I hope during this debate--and this will be the fourth time I have \nbeen involved in an example just in my State--my State is only 1.5 \npercent of the people in this country, but some horror stories have \ntaken place in my State. Remember the first day I spoke about EPA \nenforcing one of its rules on toxic waste. They had a paid informant \nthat was a disgruntled employee of a local gravel company, the Higman \nCo., in a little town of Akron in northwest Iowa. The information was \nnot correct, but they decided to invade his place of business. One \nquiet morning they came in with their shotguns pumped, their \nbulletproof vests on, 40 Federal and local law enforcement people to \nfind that toxic waste and to arrest the manager.\n  He tried to find out what was the big deal. They told him to shut up. \nThey stuck the gun in the face of his accountant. She is a nervous \nwreck yet as a result of that action. It cost him $200,000 of lost \nbusiness and legal fees to defend himself on a criminal charge that he \nwas not found guilty on because there was not any toxic waste buried in \nhis gravel pit because this process of making a determination was bad.\n  I told you the next day about how there is an EPA regulation on the \nbooks under the Clean Air Act affecting the grain elevators in the \nrural communities where farmers send their grain for processing and for \nsale. We have 700 of these grain elevators in my State. They are \ncharged with proving to the Government that they do not pollute. The \ninitial determination of that is to fill out a 280-page document for \nEPA, which some of these elevators are paying $25,000 to $40,000 of \nconsulting fees to help get filled out properly. Then once they are \nfilled out properly and go to the EPA, only 1 percent of the 700 are \ngoing to come over the threshold determined by EPA that you are a \npolluting business.\n  But what really is strange about that rule is this: EPA assumes that \nyou are going to be polluting 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, when the \nproblem that EPA is trying to get at is a seasonal problem in which the \nelevators are operating for about 30 to 45 days out of a year in which \nthere might not be any problem whatsoever.\n  They have each one of these little grain elevators supposedly in \nbusiness processing grain every day of the year, every hour of the day. \nAny one of these, under that assumption, would have to have the entire \ncorn crop of the entire United States, 10.03 billion bushels, processed \nthrough any one of these little businesses.\n  Then I told you next about the farmer in Mahaska County, IA, that \nbought a farm in 1988. And in 1989 he got permission from the Soil \nConservation Service for clearing some trees and improving the drainage \nsystem. He had the approval of a Government agency of everything he \ndid, even the approval of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.\n  Within just a few months the Corps of Engineers threatened to fine \nhim $25,000 a day because he was doing something without one of their \npermits saying it was a wetland when it was not a wetland. All you have \nto do to prove that is to drill little holes in the ground and find out \nhow close the water is to the surface. And it was not 4 to 5 feet. In \norder to be a wetland you have to have 7 days of continuous water on \nthe land. Yet, they wanted to fine him $25,000 a day for what another \nGovernment agency said he could do. Then later on that first Government \nagency said he could do it. They backed off and said they had made a \nmistake. Then he appeals it through the local, the State, and the \nnational office. Here it is 1995, and he still does not have a \ndetermination of what he can do with that land.\n  As I said to the big Government Democrats that are opposing our bill, \nit seems to me that, if you want to believe in big Government, OK. But \nat least Government ought to be able to give a constituent some sort of \nan answer. If you say they have done something wrong, they ought to be \nable to get an answer. You ought to be able to have the Government \nagencies agree among themselves on what the policy is.\n  This is a perfect example of Government out of control. This young \nMahaska County farmer still does not know where he stands with this \nland. He could potentially pay a lot of fees. In the meantime, he has \npaid a lot of money to try to get what he thought he had the right of \nin the first place by getting a Government agency to say what he can do \nand not do to some of his land.\n  There is no reason why we need four different Government agencies' \ndefinition of what a wetland is. How do you expect a poor farmer to \nunderstand what a wetland is, or even a rich farmer understand what a \nwetland is if four Government agencies do not know what a wetland is?\n  In fact, in the farmer's case I just told you about, the \ndetermination of what was a wetland or not a wetland was based on a \n1989 Corps of Engineers manual that is not even being used anymore.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair).\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in my opinion no other area of \nregulation needs reform as desperately as wetlands regulation. No less \nthan four Federal agencies claim jurisdiction over agricultural \nwetlands and these agencies often use conflicting manuals and \nprocedures in delineating and regulating the use of wetlands.\n  I have addressed this body several times in the past regarding the \ncomplex, confusing, illogical, and downright burdensome way that the \nFederal Government regulates wetlands in agricultural areas.\n  Most of my colleagues must agree with this assessment because in \nMarch, the Senate passed by unanimous consent, a moratorium on new \nwetland delineations. Subsequently, the administration agreed with the \nSenate and imposed its own moratorium. This will allow Congress the \nopportunity to reform existing wetlands policy.\n  Even if Congress does not act, however, S. 343 will force agencies to \nrecognize common sense and sound science when promulgating wetland \nregulations. And when agencies begin to act in a rational manner, maybe \nwe can avoid situations like the one in Iowa that I am about to \ndescribe.\n  Mr. President, as I travel across my State and talk to farmers and \nother property owners, I hear many stories of senseless regulations and \nbureaucratic nightmares. But the problems of a farmer in Greene County, \nIA, may be the most vivid example of the need for common sense in \nrulemaking.\n  This particular farm in Greene County has been continuously cropped \nfor almost 90 years. The original drainage system was installed in \n1906.\n  As this chart illustrates, from 1906 until 1992, the land was framed \nand no wetland existed on this part of the farm. In 1992 this all \nchanged.\n  During the summer of 1992, the local drainage district decided to \nreplace the original system with an open ditch. This was all carried \nout in consultation with the Soil Conservation Service.\n  Prior to the construction of the ditch, the owner of the farm was \ninformed by the SCS that the ditch would result in the creation of a \nsmall wetland, about 150 feet on each side of the ditch.\n  After the ditch was installed, however, the SCS district office \nchanged its mind and classified 14.2 acres as ``converted wetland.''\n  Now once a farmer has part of his farm declared a wetland, it can no \nlonger be cropped. So in effect, the Government is depriving this \nfarmer of the economic use of his own property, even though the farmer \ndid not create the wetland, and even though the land had been farmland, \nnot a wetland, for the past 90 years.\n  At that point, the only recourse available to the farmer was through \n\n[[Page S 9855]]\n  the appeals process. In this case, however, the appeals process only \nmade the situation much worse.\n  Before the first appeal, the SCS had already changed its initial \nwetlands classification of 14.2 acres to 10.8 acres. The SCS area \noffice confirmed this designation during the first appeal. At the \nsecond appeal, the State SCS office decided that the wetland was \nactually 17 acres. And at the final appeal level, at the SCS national \noffice, the wetland was determined to be 28.2 acres.\n  Mr. President, as you can see on this chart, this farm was cropped \nfrom 86 years. But then, through no fault of the farmer, the SCS \ndecided there was a wetland on this land. And this wetland apparently \nwas expanding rapidly--from 10.8 acres to over 28 acres in less than 2 \nyears\n  Keep in mind that nothing had happened during this time that actually \nchanged the size of the wetland. The farmer did not farm the land. The \ndrainage system was not expanded. And no additional water was present \nin the area.\n  The only difference was the way each level of the agency interpreted \nthe wetland regulations. And undoubtedly, the lack of common sense \ncontained in the underlying regulations caused this confusion within \nthe agency.\n  All of this sounds ridiculous until you consider that a real price is \npaid by our citizens who are subject to these regulations. The farmer \nin Greene County, IA will lose thousands of dollars in future income \nbecause the bureaucracy decided that he could not farm his land. Even \nthough this land had been farmed continuously for the past 90 years.\n  It is cases such as this that undermine the faith that Americans have \nin their Government. It is cases such as this that motivate the \nelectorate to throw out a party that has been in control of Congress \nfor the past 40 years. And if S. 343 will help just one person like the \nfarmer in Greene County, IA, then the Senate should pass this bill and \nthe President should sign it into law.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am about to propound a unanimous-consent \nrequest that I think will get us to the Boxer amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that, following the remarks of myself and Senator \nMurray--I will not be very long--the Johnston amendment be laid aside \nand that Senator Boxer be recognized to offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Reserving the right to object. And I appreciate my \nfriend from Utah working on this issue of the environmental cleanup, \nand I hope we will successfully do it. I note that we have been on the \namendment for about 3 hours and that it is not a delay coming from this \nside. I simply mention that to say that I hope we will be able to get \ntime agreements from now on and be able to move expeditiously. We made \ngreat progress today so far. And we will continue.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object. I wonder if it will be \npossible to get a time agreement. Will the Senator give us any idea how \nmuch time it will take? We are going to try to--I will tell everybody I \nwould like to get time agreements on everything that comes out from now \non.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think Senator Boxer----\n  Mr. GLENN. We have to wait on the time agreement. She can go ahead \nand proceed. I will not object to the UC.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I reverse the UC, because I understand Senator Murray \nis only going to take 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Senator Boxer has to come to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Murray is going to speak on Superfund. Why do I \nnot reverse that, have her speak first, I will speak second, and then \nSenator Boxer can offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah. I simply \nrise today to support the Johnston-Baucus amendment that strips the \nSuperfund provisions from this bill. It touches on one of the most \npressing issues facing my home State of Washington: the cleanup of the \ntons of nuclear waste that is contained at the Hanford Reservation.\n  The bill before us specifically targets Superfund sites and subjects \nactivities costing more than $10 million to immediate cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk assessment. This assessment will be required even \nwhere agreements have been reached and cleanup has already begun. All \ncleanup would come to a screeching halt so that the Government could \nanalyze the benefits of cleaning up toxic waste.\n  Hanford cleanup has come under intense and justified scrutiny by this \nCongress. Its critics have railed that it has cost billions of dollars \nand has resulted only in reams of documents, not any actual cleanup. \nThis bill would only exacerbate those problems. Cleanup that is finally \ngetting underway would stop while the Department of Energy conducted \npotentially dozens of more analyses on the benefits of cleaning up the \nnuclear waste that today is seeping toward the Columbia River.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot we do not know about the risks of \nradioactive waste. We do not know how to clean it up, where to store \nit, or how fast it migrates, or any number of things. Because so much \nis unknown, a detailed generic cost-benefit analysis and risk-\nassessment process would be endless and very costly.\n  Let me add, however, that while I do not support the cumbersome \napproach taken in the current bill, I do believe the Hanford site and \nother Superfund sites will benefit from a cost-benefit analysis. In \nfact, I will encourage us to move toward a bill that incorporates risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis into the decisionmaking structure \nat Hanford. We should try to develop a bill that requires consideration \nof costs but does not impose inefficiencies or unnecessary taxpayer-\nfunded analytical costs that result only in reports, but we should not \ndo it on this bill.\n  Finally, I would like to remind this body that the Department of \nEnergy is facing tremendous budget cuts and possibly elimination. \nBurdening it with this review process while at the same time demanding \nthat it improve the pace of its cleanup and reduce costs is a recipe \nfor disaster in my home State.\n  This bill is not the place to make the reforms most of us believe are \nnecessary to improve Superfund. The place to make those changes is in \nreauthorization of CERCLA before the authorizing committee with its \nindepth knowledge of this important law.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Johnston-\nBaucus amendment to strip the Superfund provisions from this bill. Both \ncurrent and future citizens who live near our Nation's nuclear waste \nfacilities will thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9834-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9855-S9856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RACIST ACTIVITIES AN OUTRAGE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am going to divert from this bill for a \nminute on a matter that I consider to be of extreme importance. I have \nbeen reading some accounts in the newspaper, and I would like to take a \nmoment to address something that deeply distresses me.\n  According to certain press reports, several current and former \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearm agents participated in a so-called good \nold boys roundup, an event that is alleged to have involved hateful, \nracist conduct.\n  As many of my colleagues are no doubt aware, this event involved \nhundreds of Federal, State, and local law enforcement agents. When \nAfrican-American agents tried to attend the event, however, they were \nturned away. According to various news reports, participants at the \nevent displayed blatantly racist signs and sold T-shirts displaying, \namong other things, Dr. Martin Luther King's face behind a target and a \npicture of an African-American man sprawled across a police car with \nthe words ``Boys on the Hood.''\n  Apparently other things were available for sale that are, frankly, \ntoo despicable to even be mentioned on the Senate floor. I can only \nexpress my outrage and anger that such activities of this type could \noccur in America and especially when law enforcement officials are \ninvolved. \n\n[[Page S 9856]]\n\n  Mr. President, it means something to me and I think every American--\nit means something--for a person to be a law enforcement officer. Among \nother things, it means that the American people have placed their trust \nin that law enforcement officer. It means that they represent the \npeople, all the people. And it means that they have taken an oath to \nuphold and enforce the law, and if we cannot rely on law enforcement \nofficers to do that, upon whom can we rely?\n  That any American, but especially any law enforcement officer who \nholds a sacred trust, would engage in these racist activities is an \noutrage, and it must be condemned. To be an effective law enforcement \nofficer, you must have the trust and the respect of our people. Indeed, \nlaw enforcement officers take an oath to defend the community. When law \nenforcement officers engage in racist activities, they betray the trust \nof the people and they disgrace the uniforms that they are empowered to \nwear.\n  This is not only a concern of African-Americans, this is a concern to \nall Americans. We have a right to expect that our law enforcement \nofficers will treat all citizens equally. If the press reports are \ntrue, and these officers engaged in hateful racist conduct, not only \nmust their actions be condemned, but they should be dismissed from \ntheir positions, for no one in whom the people's trust is placed should \nbe allowed to destroy that trust by engaging in such hateful behavior.\n  No doubt some of the participants will say that they were aware of \nwhat was going on but did not directly participate. I would ask them, \nWhat were you thinking? If you were at a party and people were selling \ndrugs, would you not do something as a law enforcement officer? Those \nwho would stand by while others engage in this kind of conduct are no \nless guilty than those who turn their heads when crimes are committed \non the street. We simply cannot tolerate any sort of racist conduct on \nbehalf of our law enforcement officers, not of any sort by any law \nenforcement officers.\n  I hope Director Magaw will take swift action to determine whether \nthese allegations are true and, if so, to dismiss those who are \ninvolved.\n  Similarly, I would tell State and local law enforcement agencies to \npurge themselves of agents who would violate the people's sacred trust \nby engaging in such hateful activities. This is America. We are one \nNation under God. We are a Nation that guarantees liberty and justice \nto all people. When one citizen is mistreated regardless of race, \ncolor, or creed, all citizens should be outraged. And when a person \nclothed with the authority of the people engages in hateful conduct, \nthat person's conduct must be condemned by the people. We simply cannot \ncondone racial discrimination in any of its vile forms.\n  Having said that, I have to say almost all law enforcement officers \nare good, decent people, but those who betray the public trust by \ndisplaying deplorable judgment and terrible prejudice, they forfeit \nthat trust.\n  Let me be clear that this is not the voice of political correctness. \nBeing a law enforcement officer is a public trust, because public-\nsafety matters of life and death are in the hands of law enforcement \nofficers. The overwhelming majority of our law enforcement officers are \nreally good people. But if someone authorized to wield a gun in the \nname of the law can organize and find comfort at gatherings such as the \none I have described, that person does not deserve the people's trust.\n  Faced with a threatening situation, or the perception of a threat, \ncan we be confident that such an agent would not react based on \nprejudice if the situation involved an African-American or some other \nminority person?\n  This is not a matter of concern only to African-Americans, I might \nadd. Prejudice is not so readily limited. But I would not want someone \nexhibiting such terrible judgment and prejudice enforcing the law with \nrespect to me either. If it is determined that these various officers \nhave done these things and that these accounts are true, then, I \nreiterate, those law enforcement agents who knowingly participated \nought to be fired. They ought to be terminated.\n We should not have them in positions of trust among the people. They \nshould certainly not wear the badge of the Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms Bureau.\n\n  Having said that, I hope that the director will get behind this, find \nout exactly what the true facts are, determine who the people are who \nare culpable and responsible for this kind of activity. I think they \nshould be fired on the spot.\n  It is just one of those things that you just cannot tolerate in a \nsociety as great as ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9855-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9856-S9879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I know there has been a unanimous-consent \nagreement. Do we have any time agreements or just consent to start \nsomething?\n  Mr. HATCH. We did not have any time agreements because the Senator \nfrom California was not here. Now that she is, we would like to work \nout a time agreement.\n  Mr. GLENN. If the majority leader will yield, we are going to try to \nget time agreements for everything coming to the floor from now on. I \nhope we can get 15 minutes a side for everything that comes to the \nfloor. We are going to propose that. I hope people listening can think \nabout this and agree to it. We have been wasting time with people \ntalking, and also on various subjects that do not have anything to do \nwith the legislation that we are considering here. So I hope everybody \ncan come up with time agreements, if possible.\n  Mr. DOLE. In some cases, there may be second-degree amendments on \neither side. So it may take a bit longer than 30 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader, if he will \nyield on that point, I feel very strongly that I want to have a vote on \nmy amendment. If there is going to be a second-degree, I will not agree \nto a time agreement. I will be happy to agree to 15 minutes on each \nside, but if there is a second-degree, I cannot agree because there is \nno way for me to get a vote on my underlying amendment. It is a problem \nfor me.\n  Mr. GLENN. I think that would be the general attitude all the way \nthrough this thing. Unless we know what is coming up on the second-\ndegree amendment, we are not likely to agree to a time agreement on it. \nIf we can agree to these things without second-degreeing everything----\n  Mr. HATCH. But we do not even know the form of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. We do not even know what the first-degree amendment is.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is the way the Senate operates.\n  Mr. GLENN. Then maybe we cannot get time agreements.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, at 11 o'clock, we said we were going to \nstart mowing them down around here, and I know the Senator from \nLouisiana was surprised when I filed cloture. But, frankly, I was \nsurprised when he offered an amendment to knock out Superfund. I did \nnot know that was going to happen. So there has been a double surprise \nhere. We are trying to come to grips with that amendment.\n  In the meantime, I think there has been agreement to go to the \namendment of the Senator from California. But to suggest that we cannot \nget time agreements and you cannot offer second-degree amendments, then \nI think we are going to be in real trouble, because both sides always \nreserve the right to offer second-degree amendments. It seems to me \nthat it is something we need to work out before we start.\n  Mr. President, the liberal opponents of commonsense regulatory reform \nmust be celebrating after watching some of this week's reports on the \nevening news, and reading some of the stories and columns in some of \nour most distinguished newspapers.\n  Last night, a report on ABC's ``World News Tonight'' claimed \nRepublican supporters of regulatory reform are ``on the defensive.'' \nAnd it is no wonder, considering how the media have fed the American \npeople a steady diet of phony claims that we are out to promote tainted \nmeat and unhealthy food.\n  Liberal New York Times Columnist Bob Herbert a few days ago took a \npage \n\n[[Page S 9857]]\nout of the liberal consumer activist playbook, labeling our regulatory \nreform bill ``An all-out assault on food safety regulations,'' adding \nthat it ``Would block implementation of the Agriculture Department's \nmeat safety initiative for 2 to 3 years, and probably longer.''\n  If this outright distortion wasn't enough, listen to this from \nMargaret Carlson's ``Outrage of the Week'' on CNN's ``Capital Gang'': \n``Senator Bob Dole, under the guise of regulatory reform, is letting \nthe meat industry lawyers block this [meat safety test].'' Wrong again.\n  One network aired a report Monday night that included the following, \nand I quote:\n\n       With Senator Dole's regulatory reform bill, industries \n     could challenge rules they considered too costly or too \n     burdensome. Thirteen-year-old Eric Mueller died in 1993 from \n     E. coli poisoning after eating a fastfood hamburger. His \n     father says any delay in adopting new meat inspection rules \n     is a travesty.\n\n  This is indeed a tragic story. The only problem is, this report, like \nso many others, was simply wrong in its suggestions about this bill.\n  Our legislation has always made it explicitly clear that regulations \nare exempted from any delay if there is ``an emergency or health or \nsafety threat.'' Additionally, the Agriculture Department has already \nconducted a cost-benefit analysis of the meat inspection rule and it \npassed. But the facts did not stop that network from reporting Monday \nnight that, ``A delay is looking more and more likely.''\n  However, on Tuesday, if it was not clear enough already, we \nspecifically added to the bill the words ``food safety, including an \nimminent threat from E. coli bacteria.''\n  But that did not stop the media's drumbeat on food safety. Last \nnight, a network anchor for whom I have great respect claimed that on \nregulatory reform, Republicans ``went further than the public may want \non the issue of food inspection.'' Wrong again. I do not know how many \ntimes we have to say it to get the media to understand the fact that \nthis bill does not compromise food safety. Yesterday, the former head \nof the FDA and four eminent scientists and physicians spoke at a press \nconference to explain how our bill protects food, health, and the \nenvironment--but the media did not seem to notice.\n I did not see it anywhere. It was not on ABC News, CBS or NBC. They \nget some liberal Senator on the floor to make some claim, and that was \nthe news. That was the liberal spin and the one the media jumped to in \na second.\n  But ABC did not stop with the issue of food safety. Then they broke \nout the chainsaws, the strip mining, pesticides, potentially dirty \ndrinking water, and cute endangered animals in their effort to explain \nthe impact of regulatory reform. They do not know any bounds once they \nget carried away with the liberal spin in this body.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few examples of the kinds of \ndistortions we have had to confront on this bill. And I am not the only \none who has noticed this trend. According to a study released last week \nby the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition, ``media coverage of the \ncongressional debate over environmental regulatory reform slants \n`clearly against the regulatory revisions.' '' According to Dr. Robert \nM. Entman of North Carolina State University, who conducted the study, \nthere was a 3-to-1 negative imbalance in news stories about reform \nbetween last November and this May 11. Not surprisingly, the study \nclaims that 74 percent of paragraphs that evaluated reforms were \ncritical, criticism reached 87 percent on editorial pages, and 70 \npercent of the stories on the commercial television networks and in \nweekly news magazines criticized reform. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Advancement of Sound Science Coalition's statement about its study \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Media Reports Slanted Against Regulatory Reform Efforts, Study Shows\n\n       Washington, DC, July 7, 1995--Media coverage of the \n     Congressional debate over environmental regulatory reform \n     slants ``clearly against the regulatory revisions,'' \n     according to a study released today by The Advancement of \n     Sound Science Coalition (TASSC).\n       ``While some outlets refer in favorable terms to the \n     general idea of reform, most devote far greater space and \n     time to denouncing the specific legislation calling for \n     rigorous application or risk and cost benefit analysis,'' \n     according to the study, conducted by Dr. Robert M. Entman, \n     Professor of Communication, North Carolina State University \n     and Adjunct Professor of Public Policy, University of North \n     Carolina (Chapel Hill).\n       ``This study demonstrates once again that the media, \n     whether it is consciously aware of it or not, is portraying \n     important, scientific issues in the same `who's up, who's \n     down' play by play style of reporting that they use in \n     describing political campaigns or football games. While all \n     stories deserve more balanced treatment, stories involving \n     science cry for more fair reporting,'' said Dr. Garrey \n     Carruthers, Chairman of TASSC, a national organization of \n     scientists, researchers, academicians and others.\n       The most striking finding in Dr. Entman's study is the \n     ``negative imbalance in covering the proposed reform \n     legislation.'' Dr. Entman said that there was a three-to-one \n     negative imbalance in news stories about reform. Fully 74 \n     percent of paragraphs that evaluated the reforms were \n     critical. On editorial pages, criticism reached 87 percent, a \n     seven-to-one negative ratio. Among his other findings:\n       70 percent of the stories on the commercial television \n     networks criticized reform.\n       Weekly magazines surveyed also were 70 percent critical.\n       Certain key words function to reinforce negative \n     impressions. For example, the word ``lobby'' or related words \n     show up 10 times as often when referring to those supporting \n     reform as those opposing it, even though both sides are \n     lobbying the Congress.\n       Headlines, which frame the audience's emotional response to \n     the content of the story, were often emotional or slanted \n     opposed to the reform ideas. For example, Time magazine's \n     ``Congressional Chain Saw Massacre'' or Newsday's ``GOP \n     Frenzy Is Gutting Safety Rules.''\n       Visual images portrayed supporters of reform as enemies of \n     the environment. For example, scenes of industrial plants \n     with numerous pipes and tanks; smokestacks spewing smoke; a \n     large bulldozer. Viewers were repeatedly exposed to \n     ``archetypal images of pollution and danger,'' the report \n     states, images likely to ``stir negative emotions toward \n     reform.''\n       While analysis of the ``why'' of this media slant was \n     beyond the scope of Dr. Entman's study, the report says, \n     ``reasons go beyond the standard interpretation of liberal \n     bias. They include the media's tendency to oversimplify; \n     journalists' lack of training in policy analysis; and the \n     commercial incentives that news organizations interpret as \n     requiring appeals to emotion over cognition.''\n       Dr. Carruthers said TASSC commissioned the study because \n     ``we want to offer information on how scientific issues are \n     communicated to the public as another means of ensuring that \n     only sound science is used in making public policy \n     decisions.''\n       ``Too often, legislation or regulations are the result of \n     political decisions, where the science does not back up the \n     action. One way to better understanding this phenomena is to \n     understand how the media portray scientific issues. TASSC is \n     committed to pointing out not only when unsound science is \n     used to make a decision, but also to point out the media's \n     important role in the public's understanding of science and \n     research,'' Carruthers said.\n       To conduct his study, Dr. Entman examined 29 major \n     newspapers across the country, Time, Newsweek and the three \n     broadcast network evening news programs. Stories review \n     included those published or broadcast between November 1, \n     1994 and May 11, 1995.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I know the media have a tough job to do. But \nif I believed everything I saw on the evening news or in the \nnewspapers, I would vote against this bill, too. I imagine if all of \nthe anchor people were on the floor, they would vote against it because \nthey would not read it. They would just listen to some liberal on the \nother side of the aisle and swallow it all and say ``I am against it.'' \nFortunately, the facts are on our side, even if some folks in the media \nare not.\n  This is not a question of partisanship, not a question of anything \nbut commonsense reform. Maybe those who report the news at the big \nnetworks do not worry about things that people have to put up with, the \npeople in my State of Kansas, like businessmen and women, farmers, and \nranchers. That is not their concern. They buy into ``the more \nGovernment the better.'' If you have little Government, let us have a \nlittle more regulation, which costs the average family $6,000 a year.\n  So we will continue to try to correct the record. We know that it \nwill never make the news. In fact, I challenged the media yesterday, \nwhen we had all these imminent scientists and a former FDA commissioner \nthere, to report something they said. There was not one peep, because \nthey were trying to give us facts, not the liberal spin. It makes a \ngreat difference in this body and in this town.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would like to reply to the distinguished \nmajority leader's statement. I want to make it very clear that in S. \n343 we say \n\n[[Page S 9858]]\nthat if there is a real problem, the agency can make an exception and \nsay that the rule can go in.\n  But the rule that could involve safety, health, E. coli, and \ncryptosporidium and all the rest of these things, in the original \nlegislation, could only be in effect 180 days, to give them a chance to \ntake into account all the requirements of the law, and then unless they \nhad it done within 180 days, the regulation that protected the health \nand safety of people in this country would be negated. It would no \nlonger be effective.\n  Now we have changed that on the floor this evening with the proposal \nby Senator Johnston that makes it 1 year instead of 180 days. Most of \nthese regulations take 3, 4, 5 years to come into final form. We still \nhave the danger there that we can, with this legislation, have a \nrequirement to complete all this re-analysis in 180 days. It is not \ndone, the regulation goes out, and whether it dealt with E. coli, \ncryptosporidium or the other things that have caused actual deaths in \nthe country and we know are dangerous, and not need a new \ninvestigation, but the regs would be knocked out.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ROTH. It is true under the original legislation that not later \nthan 180 days after the promulgation of the final major rule to which \nthe section applies, the agency shall comply with the provisions of the \nsubchapter, and as therefore necessary revise the rule.\n  But I am not aware of anywhere where it says the rule is terminated.\n  Mr. GLENN. The rule could be judicially challenged because it had not \ncomplied with the requirements of the legislation, so there would be a \njudicial challenge. The Senator is right. There would have to be a \njudicial challenge, but we are such a litigious society today, I do not \ndoubt there would be multiple lawsuits if there is any crack in the law \nthat can benefit a meatpacker or food processor or whoever it may be.\n  Mr. ROTH. I do not think the court would terminate the rule. A person \ncould go into court and ask that they force the agency to comply with \nthe requirement that the analysis be made.\n  I think the important point to recognize and understand, there is \nnothing in this legislation, unless the distinguished Senator form Ohio \nknows something I do not know, that provides for the termination of the \nrule.\n  Mr. GLENN. Let me reverse this. Does the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the order of business \nwas to recognize the Senator from California. If the Senator would wrap \nthis up in a few seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask my distinguished friend from Delaware, is there \nanywhere in there that says there cannot be a judicial challenge? I \nknow there is not. That means there would be a judicial challenge, the \nanalysis would not be completed, the time would have run out.\n  Mr. ROTH. The question is, was it violated? If they do not make the \nstudy within the times required, then, yes, they can go into court and \nforce the agency to make the study.\n  There is nothing in it that requires the termination of the rule.\n  Mr. GLENN. The Senator does not think there would be a judicial \nchallenge?\n  Mr. ROTH. Not under these circumstances.\n  Mr. GLENN. I think that is guaranteed in this. We would have a \njudicial challenge to this, and the rule would be out because the \nstudies had not been completed.\n  Mr. ROTH. It says here in the legislation a major rule may be adopted \nand may become effective without prior compliance with the subchapter. \nIt specifically provides the rule shall become effective.\n  Mr. GLENN. Followed by subchapter--if the agency in good cause finds \nconducting cost-benefits impractical and so on, but then not later than \n180 days, which is now changed to a year after promulgation.\n  The final rule to which this section applies, ``the agency shall \ncomply with the provisions,'' if they have not done so, it would be \nsubject to judicial challenge. With the provisions of this subchapter, \neach one of those subchapter provisions would have to be met, or the \njudicial challenges, and it is thereafter necessary to revise the rule, \nand if they have not done that, it would still be subject to judicial \nchallenge.\n  Mr. ROTH. But nowhere does it say the rule terminates. In fact, to \nthe contrary. It says the rule goes into effect. The language that the \nSenator just quoted does give the right to go into court and require \nthe agency to make the appropriate study. That is all it does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1517 is set aside. The Senator \nfrom California is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1524 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n     (Purpose: To protect public health by ensuring the continued \n              implementation of mammography quality rules)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mrs. \n     Murray, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Bradley, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bumpers, \n     Mr. Biden, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mr. Daschle \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1524 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to dispensing of the \nreading of the amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, line 7, strike the period and insert the \n     following:\n       ``; or (xiii) a rule intended to implement section 354 of \n     the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 263b) (as added by \n     section 2 of the Mammography Quality Standards Act of \n     1992).''.\n                Amendment No. 1525 to Amendment No. 1524\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1525 to amendment No. 1524.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that nothing in this Act is \n     intended to delay the timely promulgation of any regulations \n     that would meet a human health or safety threat, including \n     any rules that would reduce illness or mortality from the \n     following: heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive \n     lung diseases, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes mellitus, \n     human immunodeficiency virus infection, or water or food \n     borne pathogens, polio, tuberculosis, measles, viral \n     hepatitis, syphilis, or all other infectious and parasitic \n     diseases.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I believe this is a responsible second-\ndegree amendment, that we can dispose of a number of these issues in \nthe spirit expressed this morning by the Democratic leader and managers \nof the bill so we can move on and try to complete action on this bill \nno later than next Tuesday. It is offered in that spirit, the spirit of \ncooperation.\n  My view is it is a good amendment. I hoped it might be acceptable. It \nseems to me that it would save hours and hours of debate here and put \nto rest all the arguments that some people like to make about which \nparty or which side of the aisle is more concerned about some of the \nhealth and safety regulations. We are ready to stipulate we are just as \nconcerned as they are on the other side. We think this would lay that \nto rest. I would hope the amendment would be accepted.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have now been on this bill 6 days and we \nhave handled very few amendments. One reason is that everyone wants to \nexempt some rule or other, or some special interest or other, or some \nissue or other, from the provisions of this \n\n[[Page S 9859]]\nbill. This bill's whole purpose is to make sure that the best available \nscience is applied to regulations.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator from California is very sincere in \nbringing up her amendment. But, it is another in a series of amendments \nthat we will spend the next 3 months debating if we do not find some \nway of making clear that the only purpose of this bill is to improve \nthe regulatory process and that everybody should support that goal.\n  No one is more concerned about breast cancer than I am. It is a \ngrave, grave disease, and each and every Member in this body is \ndisturbed about its incidence and the increase in its incidence. I do \nnot want to see standards delayed unnecessarily any more than Senator \nBoxer or Senator Murray or Senator Glenn.\n  First of all, I think it is important to know that the Mammography \nQuality Standards Act was enacted in 1992, 3 years ago. If the \nproponents of this amendment want to talk about hamstringing the FDA \nfrom issuing regulations on the bill, I think they ought to ask \nthemselves, ``What has the FDA been doing in the almost 3-year period \nsince the bill's enactment?'' They have controlled the FDA for a year \nand a half of that time.\n  I understand that my colleagues have stated today that new, proposed \nregulations are expected this fall to implement the bill. I think we \nought to ask ourselves, ``Why has the FDA allowed almost 3 years to \nelapse before the regulations are issued?''\n  I can answer part of that question. The program is already up and \noperating. The program is already up and operating.\n  As I believe Senator Glenn noted earlier, the program is operating \nunder interim final regulations issued on December 23, 1993. Interim \nfinal regulations are, by definition, final. They have the full force \nand effect of law. There is no requirement that they be made final.\n  I would just like to ask my colleagues, ``What public health issues \nhave been raised that need to be addressed now in new regulations?\"\n  The second thing I would ask is this, ``If these regulations are such \na priority and are needed to save women's lives, then why, on May 8, \nwhen the administration issued its regulatory agenda for the year--and \nI am holding the Federal Register which contains that agenda--then why \ndid the administration when it issued all of its regulatory priorities \nand set target dates for each regulation, why did they not list a \nprojected date for the MQSA final regulation?\n  In fact, they did not list an October date or a September date or any \ndate. Ten weeks ago they talked about the current interim final \nregulation. They did not even mention a new, proposed regulation in the \nbook that was supposed to outline the whole regulatory agenda for the \ngovernment. In other words: It was not a crisis then, so why is it a \ncrisis today?\n  I know my colleague, Senator Boxer, is worried that the Act would get \ncaught up in the $100 million threshold in the bill and would be \nsubject to cost-benefit analysis. In fact, in the administration's own \nregulatory plan, issued only 10 weeks ago, that is just 2\\1/2\\ months \nago, the administration printed the following in the Federal Register: \n``Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992, Anticipated Costs and \nBenefits: Direct Federal costs in 1994 are $13 million.''\n  That is $87 million less than what would trigger this bill's cost/\nbenefit requirements.\n  The administration goes on to say:\n\n       There are approximately 10,000 mammography facilities in \n     the United States. Approximately 8,200 have accreditation or \n     have applied for accreditation and will not incur significant \n     additional cost. The remaining 1,800 facilities will incur \n     approximately $26 million in one-time costs, and recurring \n     costs of about $27 million. Amortizing the one-time costs, \n     the annual costs of the interim rule is about $33 million.\n\n  This $33 million is still $67 million less than needed to trigger the \neffect of this bill.\n  Thus, the OMB certified estimate, printed in the Federal Register \nonly 10 weeks ago, was $33 million. That was 10 weeks ago.\n  How can it be over $100 million today? Or anywhere near $100 million \nnow? Or even within the next number of years?\n  I would like to ask my colleagues who offer this amendment another \nquestion: ``Why will it take years for FDA to do a cost-benefit \nanalysis on something as important, as significant, and as \nunderstandable as the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992?\"\n  I suspect part of the reason is that FDA historically has not had a \nvery good record of moving things through very quickly. This is \nabundantly true with drug approvals, now taking 10 to 15 years at a \ncost of hundreds of millions of dollars for a major drug. No other \ncountry in the world takes that amount of time.\n  Medical device approvals are also lagging way behind the expectations \nof Congress. This is true for countless other regulatory undertakings.\n  In fact, with the FDA we have an agency which is fighting S. 343 as \nhard as it can.\n  We have an agency which is sending up packets of information, raising \nall sorts of red herrings about this bill. We have an agency who wants \nbusiness as usual, who wants to preserve the status quo, who does not \nwant the pressures that this bill will bring upon them to do their job \nin a better fashion and in a better manner.\n  I am not sure we can count on the FDA to seriously take into account \nthe mandates of this bill with this kind of attitude.\n  I would also like to ask why women should not have access to the most \ncost-effective procedures? I think it is important to note that our \nbill does not have the so-called supermandate provision. Our bill does \nnot change any existing requirement of Federal law with respect to the \nneed for quality standards for mammography clinics, including the \nquality of the mammograms, the training for clinic personnel, or \nrecordkeeping.\n  All our bill does is say that in implementing the law, the agency \nmust act in a way so that benefits outweigh costs. It goes to the \nprocess of implementation, not the need for implementation.\n  As one who, as I think everybody in this body knows, was very \ninvolved, with Senator Adams and Senator Mikulski, in drafting the \nMammography Quality Standards Act of 1992, as one who has been a leader \nin this effort, I wish to point out that I recognize the need for that \nlaw.\n  But I also think both the Act and American women can benefit by \nsubjecting the law to a cost-benefit analysis. Especially if the costs \nof regulation under this law reach a threshold of $100 million in this \ncountry.\n  I am aware that last year one rural hospital in Utah had to close \ndown its mammography machine because of the implementing regulations.\n  I would suspect that this has not led to better quality mammograms \nfor the citizens of that rural area. I suspect what it means is that \nwomen in that rural area will not get mammograms at all, because of \nsome of the bureaucratic ensnarlments which occur in the implementation \nof legislation, and indeed at times, in the legislation.\n  S. 343 is essential and it should not be continually tested on this \ntype of basis--which some believe is purely a political basis--when it \nonly delays going forward on this bill.\n  I do not think that my constituents in that rural Utah community have \nbenefitted by this situation. I do not think that is the way the law or \nthe regulatory process are supposed to work.\n  I think that the FDA is fighting this bill with everything it can \nbecause this bill will correct a lot of the excesses out at the agency, \nand, indeed, at every Federal agency. It will make them do better, do a \nbetter job of regulating.\n  So it keeps coming back to the question of why women should not have \naccess to the most cost-effective procedures?\n  As I say, I was involved in writing the MQSA. I have been involved \nwith this issue for years, and with virtually every other health care \nissue.\n  I understand how important the MQSA is. Frankly, this bill would not \nhave the dire effects on the MQSA that proponents of this amendment \nallege, even if the costs of regulation under the law should rise to \nthe level of $100 million--which they will not according to an official \nappraisal by the administration just 10 weeks ago.\n  Let me just mention what the second-degree amendment that Senator \nDole has filed says:\n\n\n[[Page S 9860]]\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that nothing in this Act is \n     intended to delay the timely promulgation of any regulations \n     that would meet a human health or safety threat, including \n     any rules that would reduce illness or mortality from the \n     following: heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive \n     lung diseases, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes mellitus, \n     human immunodeficiency virus infection, water or food-borne \n     pathogens, polio, tuberculosis, measles, viral hepatitis, \n     syphilis, or all other infectious and parasitic diseases.\n\n  You know, the 10 leading causes of death have just been pretty well \ndefined in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It makes it clear the \nFederal regulators can go right ahead and promulgate regulations that \nare necessary in this area.\n  What this bill requires is that they do it in a good, cost-efficient \nmanner with good risk assessment considerations as part of the process.\n  This makes sense.\n  But the reason we listed all of these diseases in the amendment is \nthat we know we are going to get papered to death on the other side \nwith amendment after amendment with every special interest trying to \nexempt themselves from the effects of this bill, when in most cases \nthey would be exempt anyway, just as mammography is. This is all for \nthe purpose of making political statements.\n  We think it is time for the Senate to get around to passing this \nbill. We need to get time agreements and debate the serious issues that \nare really needed to resolved, including the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I point out that the second-degree \namendment starts out with ``It is the sense of the Senate.'' That is \nall it is, a sense of the Senate. It does not give anything binding and \nhas no standing in law whatsoever. It just says the thoughts of the \nSenate at the moment happen to be that.\n  What we are talking about is giving real protections here that the \nSenator from California is offering as a proposal to exempt this from \nsome of the requirements that would be imposed upon it by S. 343.\n  One of the reasons she is concerned about this, of course, is because \nthe existing rule, as has already been pointed out, is going to be \nimproved. They have an improved regulation coming out supposedly in \nOctober. That would be subject now to all of the review processes. It \nwould have to go back through all of the requirements that are in S. \n343, the Dole bill. That does cause delay.\n  My colleague from Utah asks: Why can we not get it out? They have 3 \nyears. What is the delay? If they are concerned about this, why do we \nnot get that out?\n  I think there is a lack of knowledge around here about what a \nregulation is and how voluminous it could be. We used as an example \nyesterday just one. Let me give an example. This is important for \npeople to understand. Regulations are not something you go over there \nfor and have a little meeting, decide this is what you are going to put \nout, and then you put out the regulation. They are required by the law \nthat we passed here to go through multiple procedures such as peer \nreview, public meetings, and scientific analysis in all of these areas.\n  I use this as an example to show why it is not so easy to get a \nregulation out.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. I would rather go through my statement. Then I will yield.\n  The Clean Water Act passed in 1972; was amended in 1972; an amendment \npassed in 1977; in 1987, it had another amendment. For the Clean Water \nAct, one of the things that was required was effluent limitations on \nmetal products and machinery. It took 8 years to get that one \nregulation out of EPA. Could they have done it faster? I do not know \nwhether they could have or not. But for the ``Effluent Limitations \nGuidelines and Standards for Metal Products and Machinery'', which is \nthe title of it, it took 8 years to get out. This is just the index of \nthat regulation, what is covered. I do not know how many pages it is. \nIt is several hundred pages.\n  The other document we have here--this is what they were required to \ndo by the law which we passed here. They do not dream these things up. \nThey are by law. This is the development document for how they do the \nindex and how they do the regs. This is the guideline for it--2 inches \nthick of fine paper.\n  Listen to this: The final documents on this regulation cover shelf \nspace of 123 feet. To give some idea what that means, we asked the \nArchitect yesterday how high this Chamber is. It is about 42\\1/2\\ feet. \nThe regulations on this one regulation out of several hundred put out \npursuant to the Clean Water Act of 1972 are 42\\1/2\\ feet. That means \nthe documentation would be three piles of paper in this well to the \nceiling right here--three piles of paper, and that is just one \nregulation and the backup substantiating documents.\n  Why do we need that much? I do not know. Look in the mirror, Members \nof Congress. Look in the mirror, Members of the Senate, as to why we \nrequired that much. We are the ones who put out the guidelines for the \npeople as to what is required, what they have to do, and all the \nstudies they have to make in order to make this whole thing work. That \nis what is required just in one regulation. That is the reason you \ncannot get these things out in such a short period of time.\n  We have had, under the Presidential Executive order, requirements to \ndo some of the cost-benefit analysis and to do some of the risk \nassessment and so on that is being asked for here. Some of those things \nare already underway. But when we ask why they cannot get these things \nout faster, that happens to be one of the reasons.\n  I just hope that the public and the media that have been excoriated \nhere a little bit this afternoon--not on this side of the aisle--but I \nhope the public and the media have been paying attention to the debate \non this bill, because yesterday we spent most of the day trying and \nfinally succeeding in getting votes on two proposals to exempt two \nrules now in the pipeline designed to protect our people from illness \nand from death:\n  The Daschle amendment to exempt from the potentially destructive \nprovisions of this act a rule that protects meat and poultry from \ncontamination with E. coli was defeated by a vote of 51 to 49; the Kohl \namendment to exempt from the potentially destructive provisions of S. \n343 a rule to protect our drinking water from contamination from \ncryptosporidium was tabled 50 to 48.\n  What do we want to conclude from those votes? What principles should \nwe draw from those votes?\n  S. 343 has a number of exemptions built into it. No one seems to have \npointed these things out. There are a number of exemptions already in \nthis thing.\n  For instance, first, the IRS rules or other rules concerning \nassessment and collection of taxes and duties--these are all \nexemptions.\n  Second, any rule implementing international trade agreements. The \nMaquiladora in Mexico get an exemption, protection. For the safety and \nhealth of Americans, we do not.\n  Third, any rule that authorizes the introduction into commerce of a \nproduct like a bioengineered tomato is free and clear, for instance. It \nis exempted.\n  Fourth, any rule or agency action relating to the public debt--that \nis, selling a Government bond--is exempted, and should be. I agree with \nthese.\n  Fifth, any rule required to be promulgated at least annually pursuant \nto statute. For instance, duck hunting rules. I favor this. We exempted \nduck hunting rules that have to be put out by Federal mandate each \nyear. Duck hunting rules are exempt from this bill. But serious health \nand safety protections are not.\n  Sixth, any rule that approves corporate mergers and acquisitions. \nWall Street gets an exemption. But the average American's protection \nfrom bad meat and bad water does not get an exemption. It does not get \nthat same kind of exemption.\n  Seventh, any rule relating to the safety and soundness of banks and \nlending institutions is exempted.\n  Eighth, any rule by the FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] \nthat reduces regulatory burdens is exempted. Electric utilities, for \ninstance, get an exemption. For protection from bad meat and bad water, \nwe could not even get that same kind of exemption. \n\n[[Page S 9861]]\n\n  Mr. President, I do not object to the above exemptions. I favor those \nexemptions. But I say along with it, do we not want to hit some balance \nand say that the health and safety of our families, of our children, \nour fathers and mothers, deserves similar protections?\n  The health and safety concerns addressed in the E. coli and the \ncryptosporidium votes yesterday are not imagined. Those dangers are not \ndreamed up dangers or mere possibilities. Quite the opposite. E. coli \nand similar foodborne illnesses kill some 3,000 to 7,000 people every \nyear in this country. A couple of years ago in Milwaukee, \ncryptosporidium in the water supply made over 400,000 people seriously \nill and 100 of them died.\n  So these are not imagined dangers, they are real dangers. We know the \ndanger from them. They are not fictitious thoughts that need more and \nmore and more review to determine if there is a danger. Nothing should \nbe permitted to hold up the corrective regulations as could happen \nunder S. 343.\n  I wish to protect the exemptions listed above. I think they are \ncorrect, and I am glad they are in there. Yes, we want to protect \nthose, of course. But I would note that with the exception of duck \nhunting and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the other six \nexemptions deal with economic matters.\n  Now, that, too, is fine as far as I am concerned, but I also firmly \nbelieve that we should show the same concerns for known health and \nsafety matters with all of our people.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. Just a moment until I finish my statement here.\n  Now, it was also brought up that our side of the aisle, apparently it \nis being talked about that we are delaying things somewhat. It was said \nthat the administration is sending up red herrings. Last night, the \ndistinguished majority whip, I believe, termed them nit-picking on our \nside.\n  Yesterday, since we started debate on this bill, we have had 16 \namendments put out, 11 by Republicans; 6 of those were withdrawn; we \nhad five votes on Democratic matters here and these were on such things \nas E. coli, killing 500 people a year; cryptosporidium, from which 100 \npeople died--foodborne diseases kill 3,000 to 7,000 people annually--\nvotes on Abraham and Nunn on small business matters; Senator Dole put \nforward an E. coli amendment himself; Johnston-Levin combined to deal \nwith supermandate problems.\n  So I do not see that these are nit-picking, and these are not red \nherrings. These are very substantive amendments, most of them dealing \nwith the health and safety of the people of this country.\n  What the Senator from California is talking about is something that \nis very important--mammography, the standards for it, and surely having \nthat exempted so that they would not have rules delayed for several \nyears, or the potential for the new and improved rules, they hope, to \nbe delayed for several years, while S. 343, if passed, would force them \nto go back into a reanalysis that could take a lengthy period of time, \nas I indicated, from what happens under just one regulation and all the \nvoluminous paperwork which is part of that process.\n  I do not see these things as being nit-picking as they were referred \nto last night, nor do I see them as a red herring now.\n  So I would like to point out once more before I yield the floor here \nthat the second-degree amendment by the distinguished majority leader \nis a sense-of-the Senate and nothing more. It is not binding in law. \nAnd that is what the Senator from California is talking about. I do not \ndisagree. I do not know whether I would vote for this sense-of-the \nSenate or not. I presume that I would. But it still does not have \nstanding in law. And so it means nothing except it is filling up the \ntree and trying to delay things further, I guess. Delay on this one \ncertainly is not coming from our side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. I suggest the absence of a quorum temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I was going to ask the Senator from Ohio \nand perhaps the Senator from Delaware to tell me about the status of \nthe rulemaking under mammography. What I wish to know is if the \ninformation I have is correct, which is that there is an interim final \nrule which has been published and is in effect on mammography. Is that \ncorrect? I ask the Senator from Delaware, does he know that, or the \nSenator from Utah?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It is. And it has the effect of an interim final rule?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. And as I understand it, in October there will be a \nproposed rule to be published by the FDA. Some say it is not on the \nPresident's schedule; some say it is on the President's schedule. Does \nthe Senator from Utah know?\n  Mr. HATCH. We have been told that that is the case, that there will \nbe a proposal in October. However, it was not listed in the May 5 \nFederal Register which outlined the administration's regulatory program \nfor the year. But we now have been told by the FDA that it is proposed \nfor October.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There is in fact some doubt as to whether that will \nbe----\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think there is much doubt. I think it will \nhappen, but I cannot guarantee it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. But it is a proposed rule to be published in October, \nby some statements?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There may or may not be doubt about whether they will \nactually go to the proposed rule, but they might as of October go to a \nproposed rule.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Now, that proposed rule----\n  Mr. HATCH. The odds are they will.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That proposed rule is not an effective rule; it is, in \neffect, a proposal for rulemaking which will require the full \nrulemaking process. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Now, I also understand that their analysis shows that \nit has a $97 million impact, and under the President's Executive order, \nwhich calls for risk analysis, which has a $100 million cutoff, that \nwould not qualify under the President's order as a major rule?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. They are, however, as I understand it, treating this as \na major rule. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. We are told that, but we do not know that. That is the \nrumor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I understand that they are treating it as a major rule, \nthat they are proceeding with a risk assessment and with a cost-benefit \nanalysis as though it were a major rule.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is our understanding.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Now, I also understand that under the President's \nExecutive order, this risk analysis which they are getting ready to \nperform and the cost-benefit analysis which they are getting ready to \nperform--first of all, has that been done, the risk assessment and \ncost-benefit analysis? Has it been done or is it a plan to do?\n  Mr. HATCH. We do not know whether it has been done. Certainly they \nshould plan to do it.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I was going to put in a quorum call because \nthe distinguished Senator from California had to unavoidably be absent \nfor a few minutes, and she asked I put in a quorum call. I did not know \nwhether this was going to go on very long or not. I would like to wait \nuntil she comes back. She will return within 10 minutes, I understand. \nAnd I hate for all the discussion going on on her amendment without her \nbeing in the Chamber. She asked me to put in a quorum call for just a \nfew minutes, and I will do that and delay things for just a few \nminutes. So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator withhold that request? I had a question or \ntwo I would like to ask him. \n\n[[Page S 9862]]\n\n  Mr. GLENN. This is all on the same subject, though.\n  Mr. ROTH. Regarding the statement the Senator just made, a question \nreferring to that.\n  Mr. GLENN. It is all on the same subject. I would rather wait until \nshe gets back. I let this go a while in spite of her request. It is \ngoing to go on here for quite a while apparently, so I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to raise two or three questions \nwith my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Ohio. I would like to \npoint out that the legislation of the distinguished Senator from Ohio, \nS. 1001, of course, contains cost-benefit analysis, the same as does \nthe bill before us. But in contrast to the legislation that we are \nconsidering which has an exception to the cost-benefit analysis, I \nwonder if the distinguished Senator from Ohio could tell me where S. \n1001 contains any exception from the cost-benefit analysis where it is \nimpracticable because of an emergency or health or safety threat?\n  Mr. GLENN. I would reply to my friend from Delaware that I think the \nmajor difference that protects the health and safety of the people in \nthis country is that all the rules that are under S. 1001, all the \nrules in the pipeline stay in effect. We would not knock any of them \nout. We did not send them back and make them go through another long \nand lengthy process during which time the people would not have the \nsame protection. And also we have no petition process in S. 1001. These \nthings can be bogged down.\n  Mr. ROTH. I would point out to the distinguished Senator, what we are \ntalking about is a future rule. And if we are not in the immediate \ncase, there are going to be other situations where there are going to \nbe serious threats to health or safety. My question to you is, where is \nthe exception in your legislation where it is impracticable to be \nmaking a cost-benefit analysis?\n  Mr. GLENN. I am not sure in the future it is any different from this \nbill at all, as far as in the future. What we are talking about are all \nthese things like E. coli, and cryptosporidium that there could have \nbeen a challenge made to them in this interim period after the April 1 \ncutoff.\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me point out that in S. 343, it specifically provides \nthat ``A major rule may be adopted, may become effective without prior \ncompliance with this subchapter if, A, the agency for good cause finds \nthat conducting cost-benefit analysis is impracticable due to an \nemergency or health or safety threat that is likely to result in \nsignificant harm to the public or natural resources.''\n  My question to you is, where is there that kind of exception, that \nkind of waiver in 1001?\n  Mr. GLENN. Well, let me tell you about E. coli in particular as it \napplies here. The agency has told us the rule that includes E. coli \nprotection is a general one and cannot legitimately be considered an \nemergency rule. Accordingly, the emergency provisions of S. 343 do not \napply to the regulation in the pipeline concerning E. coli. And the \nDole amendment on E. coli does not prevent the USDA proposed regulation \non meat and poultry inspections from being sent back to square one \nagain for cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Again, as far as E. coli is concerned, that specifically is \ncovered in our legislation. But again I would like to know the line and \npage in S. 1001 where there is an exception to the cost-benefit \nanalysis along the same lines contained in S. 343.\n  Mr. GLENN. I cannot give the line and the page right now. But I will \nlook it up here. We will try to get an answer very shortly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. The fact of the matter is that if there is no emergency, \nthen why not do a cost-benefit analysis?\n  If there is an emergency, there is nothing in Senator Glenn's bill \nthat takes care of it.\n  But there is in our bill which is now under consideration on the \nfloor. Under section 622(f) and section 632(c)(1)(A), cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk assessments are not required if ``impracticable due \nto an emergency or health or safety threat that is likely to result in \nsignificant harm to the public or natural resources.''\n  There are no exemptions in the Glenn bill at all for cost-benefit \nanalysis where there is an emergency.\n  I did not mean to interrupt you, but I wanted to point that out.\n  Mr. ROTH. I think it is important to understand that, in a case of \nhealth or safety threat. It does not have to be an emergency. The \nlegislation provides that an exception can be made in the case of an \nemergency or health or safety. So there are three different exceptions. \nSo there does not----\n  Mr. GLENN. I would point out----\n  Mr. ROTH. Or a threat.\n  Mr. GLENN. I would point out to my friend from Delaware the exception \nfor that would only be for 180 days. Then it has to go through all the \nreanalysis and may be held up for years.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is totally inaccurate. There is nothing in the \nlegislation that says the rule terminates.\n  Mr. GLENN. But it is judicially challengeable. And there is nothing \nin there that says it is not challengeable.\n  Mr. HATCH. We just accepted an amendment this morning to make 1 year.\n  Mr. GLENN. One year. I am corrected on that. The original language \nwas 180 days in the legislation. And the Senator from Louisiana changed \nthat to 1 year. And that is correct. That has been changed.\n  Mr. ROTH. I reemphasize a point I made earlier that it can only be \nchallenged in court to have the analysis made. It does not result in \nthe rule itself being terminated. As a matter of fact, this section \nstarts out that a major rule ``may be adopted and may become effective \nwithout prior compliance with the subchapter.''\n  But a second question I would like to ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio is, he spoke about E. coli and of food poisoning and a number \nof others. And yet I do not find any of those matters to be listed in \nthe Democratic list of concerns with S. 343. There were presumably 9 \nmajor problems with the legislation plus another 17 minor problems. But \nI do not recall seeing any of these issues being included as part of \nthe problems with the 777 version of the Dole-Johnston substitute.\n  I have in my hand the document given to us by the Democrats as areas \nof concern with the legislation before us. At 9:30 this morning, we \nwere supposed to have a discussion of these provisions or concerns. \nThat was not held. But nowhere--but nowhere--do I see the issues raised \nin this paper that the distinguished Senator raised this afternoon.\n  Mr. GLENN. Obviously, we missed one. We have one more to add. Put it \non. Fine.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GLENN. I am serious about that. One comment and then I will \nyield.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield to----\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask one question?\n  Mr. ROTH. May I ask who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may ask one question of my colleague?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am happy to yield for a question without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may ask one question, whether it is 1 year, 180 days \nor 1 minute, is it not true that the rule will not terminate?\n  Mr. ROTH. Absolutely. That is exactly the point I have been making.\n  Mr. HATCH. The rule continues to remain in effect.\n  Mr. ROTH. Absolutely. There is nothing in the legislation that \nterminates the rule.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is true on the rule on mammography, is it not?\n  Mr. ROTH. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HATCH. So, what are we arguing about?\n  One reason we filed this perfecting amendment is because there is no \nneed for this amendment from the distinguished Senator from California, \nbecause the bill addresses the issue. There is an interim rule. The \nfact they do not have a final rule is the fault of the administration \nand the FDA.\n  I will say that the amendment of the Senator from California will \nbring \n\n[[Page S 9863]]\nabout a beneficial but unintended effect, because I am quite certain \nthe FDA is going to work hard to get their rule done by October. So \nthat will be a good effect of this amendment, in my opinion, but I \nstill believe there is no reason to keep making these special \nexemptions for anything. Is that not true?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. No, that is not----\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question or \nseries of questions, or does he want to finish his statement?\n  Mr. ROTH. I would rather continue just for the moment. I will be \nhappy to yield in just a few minutes. I think it is extremely important \nto understand that in the Dole-Johnston legislation, on page 25, we \nhave a specific exception to cover the case of emergency health and \nsafety from the general rule of requiring a cost-benefit analysis.\n  Again, I find no such exception in S. 1001. As a matter of fact, I \nlook on page 5 of S. 1001 and it says that:\n\n       The term ``rule'' shall not include--\n       (A) a rule of particular applicability that approves or \n     prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices--\n\n  So forth and so forth.\n\n       (B) a rule relating to monetary policy proposed or \n     promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System or by the Federal Open Market Committee;\n       (C) a rule relating to the safety or soundness of a \n     federally insured depository.\n\n  It goes on with various housing, foreign banks, so forth.\n\n       (D) a rule issued by the Federal Election Commission or a \n     rule issued by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant \n     to section 203 of the Communications Act of 1934.\n\n  Those are the exceptions to the rule, in contrast to our legislation \nwhere we specifically provide a generic waiver.\n  Nor do I find anywhere, and I again ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio, where there is any kind of exception in the case of E. coli \nor breast cancer in the legislation proposed by him.\n  Mr. GLENN. I reply to my friend from Delaware, in our legislation, S. \n1001, rules in the pipeline are permitted to go ahead and be in effect, \nwhere under S. 343, they would have to go back and would have 1 year to \ncomply. If they did not comply, then I do not see anything in here at \nall that says it could not be judicially challenged, which it could.\n  Mr. ROTH. What about next year under your legislation?\n  Mr. GLENN. You cannot guarantee getting these things through. Ours \nleaves things in the pipeline, and we have no petition process. The \nrules in the pipeline would stay in effect. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  Mr. ROTH. The question I am raising, if you have a situation arise \nwhere it is an emergency, a safety threat or a health threat in the \nfuture and it is impractical to make a cost-benefit analysis, where is \nthe exception in your legislation?\n  Mr. GLENN. In the future--if we are talking about in the future, I \nthink both pieces of legislation are pretty much identical to what \nhappens in the future. We are talking about the interim period.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is the point I am making. Our legislation, S. 343, on \npage 25 has a specific exception to cover these situations. There is no \nsuch exception, no such waiver in S. 1001. If I am wrong, I ask for the \npage and line number.\n  Mr. GLENN. I think the difference on this, I reply to my friend, is \nthat you have so many more decisional criteria that have to be complied \nwith in this and all complied with within a year, which is not likely, \nin most cases, to be completed within a year.\n  Mr. ROTH. But I think the complaint, I will say, is the time that \nwould take in making the cost-benefit analysis.\n  Let me ask you this. Does your legislation exempt E. coli? Does it \nhave any exemption covering E. coli?\n  Mr. GLENN. It would not have to because in the pipeline that is \ncovered, and we have no cutoff threshold that would knock it out of the \npipeline, we let things in the pipeline stay in there. So E. coli--\nincidentally, while we are on the subject of E. coli, here is out of \nTennessee right now, July 4, five cases of E. coli being treated. One \nwoman, I think one child has already died, I believe it is. These are \nthe press reports I was just handed a few moments ago, multiple \nnewspaper reports about an E. coli outbreak in Tennessee right now. So \nthese were not theoretical things we were talking about on the floor \nyesterday.\n  Mr. ROTH. The point I would like to make is, yes, there are going to \nbe serious health, safety and other problems. But the important \ndifference between the legislation before this committee and the \namendment being proposed by the distinguished Senator from Ohio is that \nthere is a waiver that anticipates what might happen in the future. \nThat is a critically important difference.\n  Today it may be E. coli, tomorrow it may be heart disease, a third \nday it may be something else. But under our legislation, we have \nanticipated that situation by having a generic exception that covers \nthose situations. That is the reason it is not necessary to spell out \neach of these exceptions as being proposed, except for public relations \nreasons.\n  Mr. GLENN. Let me ask this, then. Does the Senator from Delaware \nbelieve that rules in the pipeline now that deal with health and safety \nshould be permitted to remain in effect without having to go through a \nwhole new series of hoops?\n  Mr. ROTH. Well, we voted yesterday April 1 to make those effective \nunder the Johnston amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. I am talking about things in the pipeline that are not to \nbe completed until after April 1. That is the whole area of contention \nright now--E. coli, cryptosporidium, and all the rest.\n  Mr. ROTH. Here the exception applies. That is the purpose of this \nexception. It applies to those that are in the pipeline.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. ROTH. It applies in the future.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Delaware yield?\n  Mr. ROTH. No, the Senator does not yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I think it is critically important to \nunderstand that the argument made by the proponents of the pending \namendment is that a future anticipated regulation on mammograms would \nbe delayed by compliance with S. 343, and that during such delays, \nlives would be lost.\n  In order to address such issues, the majority leader last Tuesday \noffered an amendment, which was adopted by the Senate, that provides \nthat in exactly those circumstances described by proponents, the \nrelevant agency may issue the rule first and allow it to take effect \nand, thereafter, finish compliance with S. 343.\n  Through the Johnston amendment, adopted today, the agency would have \n1 year to finish its compliance. The language of that amendment says \nthat a rule, such as the mammogram rule, ``may become effective without \nprior compliance''--Let me read that again: ``may become effective \nwithout prior compliance if the agency, for good cause, finds that \nconducting cost-benefit analysis is impractical due to a health threat \nthat is likely to result in significant harm to the public.''\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GLENN. But in that case, the rule would still have to go back and \ngo through the new requirements of S. 343 on being reanalyzed, and a \nnew rule as an improvement would not be able to go into effect until \nthat had been completed, which may be several years later.\n  Mr. ROTH. No, no, that is not correct. Again, I will reread what I \nread twice. It says, ``may become effective without prior compliance * \n* *'' That is critically important.\n  What we are trying to anticipate in the language on page 25 of S. 343 \nis making certain that where a situation arises because of cancer, \nbecause of heart disease, or whatever it may be, the rule can become \neffective without making the cost-benefit analysis if the agency finds \nthat conducting such analysis is impractical due to a health \n\n[[Page S 9864]]\nthreat. Our language is generic. It anticipates that there may be many \ndifferent situations. That is the reason we do not want to get into \nspelling out exception by exception.\n  Mr. GLENN. Might I ask a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask this question with specific reference to the \nmammography proposal. Would it be the opinion of the Senator from \nDelaware that the mammography proposal and the proposal that will be \nmade in October, and on which a lot of work has already been done, \nthose should be permitted to go through and be in full effect without \nhaving to go back and comply with a lot of new rules and regulations, \nas required in S. 343? In other words, it could go into effect and stay \nin effect.\n  Mr. ROTH. The agency has that authority under our legislation, that \nis correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. Without any challenge, without having to go back and go \nthrough the requirements of S. 343, is that correct?\n  Mr. ROTH. Basically, that is correct. They are expected to go ahead \nand make a cost-benefit analysis the year following. They are required \nto make it. But that, again, in no way terminates the rule. The rule \ncontinues so people are protected. That is what the whole point of the \nexception is.\n  Mr. GLENN. A point I made a while ago on what is involved in a \nregulation is that the likelihood of this being completed in a year is \nprobably not very good. It is probably pretty remote. Most rules take \nseveral years to finalize. What happens at the end of that 1-year \nperiod? It would be judicially challengeable and could be knocked out. \nThat is the uncertainty we do not want to leave people with. That is \nthe construction of the argument right there.\n  Mr. ROTH. An individual can go into court and ask that the analysis \nbe made. But that will, in no way, terminate the rule.\n  So the important fact is that we are protecting the American people, \nthe American public. And where there is a health problem, an imminent \nthreat, or whatever, an exception to the rule is allowed. So what we \nhave done in S. 343, in contrast to S. 1001, has anticipated this need.\n  So, again, the distinguished Senator from Ohio made many complaints \nthat, as I said, seem curious to me. He complains that the emergency is \nexempted and S. 343 is insufficient. Yet, his bill, S. 1001, has no \nexemption at all. The question is, why? Is it not needed? Again, he \ncomplains that S. 343 has no individual listing on the E. coli or \nmammography rule. Yet, his bill, S. 1001, has no exemption at all. Why? \nIt is not needed.\n  Mr. GLENN. Are you asking me a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. No.\n  Mr. GLENN. Everything that is in the pipeline stays there. It does \nnot have to go back for reanalysis. That is the reason.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Delaware yield for a question, Mr. \nPresident?\n  Mr. ROTH. My question is--\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Delaware yield for \na question?\n  Mr. ROTH. In just a moment. Again, I want to point out that, in the \nfuture, a situation can arise under S. 1001 where there is a threat to \nhealth or safety, or an emergency and, yet, there is no exception, no \nwaiver permitted under S. 1001. The important point, of course, is that \nthis situation has been addressed in S. 343.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Excuse me. We want to make sure this is understood. Is it \ntrue that this interim rule was issued in December of 1993 on \nmammography?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, that is true.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is it not also true that it was in the pipeline before \nApril 1 of this year?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Which is the date in this bill, and we protect rules in \nthe pipeline, also, do we not?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is true.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think what the Senator is trying to explain here is that \nthe Glenn bill has no protection, no exception at all for E. coli, \nmammography, or any of these other items. And we do. We provide that if \nthere is even a threat, they do not have to do cost-benefit analysis or \nrisk assessment.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. If there is a threat, we do not have to do cost-benefit \nanalysis or risk assessment.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. No, it is not.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. GLENN. What the Senator says is not correct, no matter what you \nsay. Our bill has the Administrative Procedure Act to go along with----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield for my statement?\n  Mr. ROTH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. The Administrative Procedure Act says that when the \nagency, for good cause, finds and incorporates the finding and a brief \nstatement of reasons therefore----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can only yield for a question. \nDoes the Senator from Delaware yield for that purpose?\n  Mr. GLENN. Well, I will ask a question. Would the Senator agree with \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, that it covers our bill, in that when \nit says, ``When the agency for good cause finds and incorporates the \nfinding and a brief statement of reasons there in the rules issued, \nthat notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable and \nunnecessary and contrary to the public interest,'' it would also mean \nthat the agency could control what is an emergency and not? In your \nbill, it goes back for a year's reanalysis. It is required.\n  Mr. ROTH. I point out that the Senator is making my argument. That \nlegislation applies, obviously, to S. 343. So what you are, in effect, \nsaying is that none of these exceptions that have been discussed in the \nlast 3 days are necessary because they are already covered by the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.\n  Mr. GLENN. Well----\n  Mr. ROTH. That is the main point I have been trying to make, that \nthese specific exceptions are not necessary. If you want to put it on \nthe basis of the basic rule, fine. But I will also point out that, in \nour specific legislation, we have waivers both with respect to cost-\nbenefit and with respect to risk assessment. So that is the reason we \ndo not think any of these special cases are necessary.\n  Mr. GLENN. Would the Senator agree, then, that we should change S. \n343 to just say that rules in the pipeline stay in effect?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would not.\n  Mr. GLENN. That means they have to go back through a whole new \nprocedure that will delay them for years and years.\n  Mr. ROTH. The Administrative Procedure Act exception, as I said, \napplies to S. 343 equally. But we do have a better exception. The APA \nexception only applies to notice and comment for the rule. The \nexception in S. 343 applies to cost-benefit analysis, and that is what \nis critically important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a clip regarding E. coli that has been occurring \nin Tennessee in the last few days.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the News Sentinel, June 30, 1995]\n\n                 Bacteria Studied in Illness of Boy, 11\n\n                            (By Ken Garland)\n\n       Maryville.--State health officials hope to know by this \n     afternoon if an 11-year-old Maryville boy--hospitalized since \n     Sunday--is suffering from a severe form of sometimes-fatal E. \n     coli bacteria.\n       Logan Duckett, son of John and Debbie Duckett, was in fair \n     condition Thursday and is expected to suffer no lasting \n     effects from the illness, said Dr. Charles Raper, his doctor.\n       The boy was hospitalized after suffering since June 22 with \n     diarrhea, Raper said. Preliminary test results by the \n     hospital laboratory indicated he might be suffering from \n     0157:H7, the name for the severe form of E. coli.\n       The state health department is conducting laboratory tests. \n     ``We're waiting on confirmation,'' said Dr. Paul Irwin, East \n     Tennessee director of the Tennessee Department of Public \n     Health. ``We know it's E. coli; we just don't know if it is \n     0157:H7.''\n       E. coli is a bacteria found in meat that has been tainted, \n     usually with feces, Raper said. Proper cooking of the meat \n     will kill the bacteria, officials said.\n\n \n[[Page S 9865]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to get the floor more \nthan an hour after I introduced a very important amendment. There is a \nlot of talk about the bill in general. I guess it is time to give a \nlittle bit of a wake-up call to some of my colleagues.\n  This second-degree amendment which would act as a substitute for the \nBoxer-Murray-Mikulski amendment is the most cynical parliamentary \nattempt to gut an amendment that I have ever seen.\n  I have only been here a few years. I have seen a lot of second \ndegrees from both sides. Usually when you second-degree an amendment, \nit has something to do with the underlying amendment. The underlying \namendment that I have put forward would say that the rules regarding \nmammography shall move forward and they will not be encumbered by this \nbill.\n  We have heard three learned Senators squabbling over there for 60 \nminutes. No one understands anybody else. Ask what is on page 9, page \n4, line 1--if these three cannot agree, and they are friends--imagine \nthe field day the lawyers will have.\n  Should we move this mammography rule forward? Is it stuck? Is it \nstopped? I want to say I do not want to play Russian roulette with the \nwomen of this country.\n  When I laid down my amendment, it was very clear. I am really glad we \ncan talk about it. It basically said it was very important to keep this \nrule moving. It is interesting that my friend from Utah complains it \nhas taken so long.\n  On the one hand, he says there is too much regulation and the \nbureaucrats cannot wait to regulate; on the other hand, he complains \nthat this regulation is taking too long. We cannot have it both ways. \nBetter they are careful with this rule.\n  I will go into what this rule does. It is complicated. The fact is, \nwe should not derail it now; 46,000 women every year die of breast \ncancer, and many of them, tragically, die because the mammogram they \ntook was inaccurate or the technician was not highly trained, or the \nequipment was not good, it was slipshod.\n  Then I am told that I am offering a special-interest amendment. I \ntake great offense. What is the special interest? The women of America? \nGive me a break. The women of America want this amendment.\n  I have a letter on all Members' desks, supporting this amendment, \nfrom the National Breast Cancer Coalition. Is that a special interest? \nIf women who have had breast cancer, who have had loved ones have \nbreast cancer, survivors, if that is a special interest, I do not know \nwhat is going on around here.\n  I will name the special interests--the people who do not want to be \nregulated, who do not want to upgrade their mammography equipment, who \nwant to get away with hiring people to work for them who are not as \nwell trained and maybe come at a cheaper price. We should talk the \ntruth around here for a change.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from California, her \namendment specifically exempts the Mammography Quality Standards Act \nregulation from the underlying bill, is that correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The second-degree amendment placed on the desk by \nSenator Dole is simply a sense of the Senate, is that correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct. It is a sense of the Senate that does \nnot even deal with this subject matter. It just says that nothing in \nthis bill will harm anybody.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator from California will let me ask another \nquestion, certainly she sat with me throughout the budget debate and \nlistened to our colleagues say sense-of-the-Senate resolutions are not \nbinding, and I assume she feels as I do, and I will ask the Senator, \nwill the Senator be able to go back to her friends diagnosed with \nbreast cancer or to women in her State and say, ``Don't worry, we have \ntaken care of you with a sense of the Senate that is not binding?''\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say that any Senator who went to someone who was \nworried about breast cancer and said the sense of the Senate was going \nto do one thing to move forward the rule on mammography would simply \nnot be telling the truth.\n  Of course, the Senator is correct. We cannot tell anybody who cared \nabout this issue that the Dole substitute does a thing to help move the \nmammography rule along.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  I had the feeling that my Republican colleagues would offer a second-\ndegree amendment like this because they have done it before on other \namendments.\n  They did not tell me they were going to do this, but they wanted a \ntime agreement, and I said absolutely. I would give 15 minutes on my \nside, 15 on their side if there were no second-degree amendments. They \nsaid, ``Gee, we have not seen your amendment, Senator, how can I do \nthat?''\n  I gave my amendment, and miraculously in 30 seconds the majority \nleader appeared with this sense-of-the-Senate substitute. That was fast \nwork. But it will not work. It will not work. I am telling my friends \nthat 46,000 women die of breast cancer every year, so I will stand on \nmy feet for 46,000 minutes or 46,000 hours or whatever it takes, and I \nknow my friend from Washington is in complete agreement so there are \ntwo of us, at least.\n  And by the way, there are a lot more on this amendment and I will \nmention who they are.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has in a very important way changed this \ndebate from just the questions of regulations of rules into real terms.\n  What we are talking about as the Senator from California and the \nSenator from Washington, we are talking about mothers, we are talking \nabout sisters, women in our society for whom the incidence for cancer \nhas grown significantly over the period of recent years with regard to \nbreast cancer.\n  Does the Senator realize that when the Senate, in the last Congress \nwent on record, it was a unanimous vote, unanimous out of our committee \nto develop these regulations, unanimous in the U.S. Senate to move \nahead, unanimous in the House of Representatives in their committee, \nand unanimous on the floor to develop the regulations? The need is out \nthere.\n  Can the Senator possibly explain to any Member why, when it was the \nresult of careful consideration both in terms of the committees and the \ndebate here, the recommendations that were made by the testimony that \nwas given overwhelmingly favorable with a sense of urgency in asking \nnot to delay and to move ahead, and now we have the final regulations \njust being brought up, that we are asked to follow through some other \nprocedure, some other procedure, some other words, which we find out \nthe meaning of which is still very much left in doubt?\n  I do not know whether the Senator from California was here when we \ndebated the Civil Rights Act, when we spent months here trying to \ndebate the difference between significant and manifest.\n  Here we have a change in the food standards into insignificant risk \nwithout definition. We will come back to that later during the course \nof the debate on food standards and food safety.\n  Can the Senator explain to the American people why, if there was such \na sense of urgency that Republicans and Democrats, all Americans, are \ngetting behind and say get about the business of doing it? Does it make \nany sense to the Senator?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, who is such a leader in all health \nissues, including this breast cancer issue--it makes no sense to me. \nAnd that is why I committed myself, and I know my colleagues have as \nwell, and I am so appreciative the Senator was able to get to the floor \nat this time, to focus on this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just finally, is the Senator concerned, as I would be, \nthat there may be manufacturers who are out there, who are producing \nequipment today, that do not meet the standards, and that would be put \nin a position to question the standards in the future because their \nequipment does not meet those standards, and they would be able to \ndelay the implementation of those standards? Or there may be groups out \nthere that are going \n\n[[Page S 9866]]\n\nto question and challenge it because they do not have the training and \nthey do not want to comply with the various things. We have heard that, \nas a reality. We have heard of manufacturers. We have heard of \ncorporate interests that want to resist these kinds of standards.\n  But what we are faced with is why should we side with those interests \nwhen we have something which is of such importance to women, not just \nto women in our society, to mothers in our society, to sisters, to \nwives, to members of our families--that is so important.\n  Why should we desist and give in to these special interests, which \nare the special interests which are the manufacturers that will be able \nto tie this up, even under the existing standard, with the look-back \nprovisions, and all the other kinds of mechanisms which have been \nreviewed? I would like to stay away from those. We can get into those \nin debate, because there are those here in the Senate who would like to \njust tie us up and talk about procedure when the Senator is talking \nabout the impact on real people. Why should we side with those \ncompanies or manufacturers who will delay this rather than with the \nsound health policy that would implement it?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend, he is so right, because he \nworked so hard on getting the bill through and getting the law passed \nin 1992. Now the rule is coming to fruition in October. We are going to \nhave the rule.\n  If the Senator would have been here, I say to my friend from \nMassachusetts, three friends from the opposite side of the aisle could \nnot even agree on how this new legislation is going to work. What we \nare saying is, do not put at risk the women of America for this battle \nover words. The Senator is so right. We get down to this battle over \nwords and lines on pieces of paper. I am just so pleased the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts came here because, after all, why do we have rules? \nBecause we pass legislation.\n  And the Senator reminds me--which I frankly did not remember--that \nRepublicans and Democrats voted unanimously for the legislation that is \nleading to this rule that is coming forward in October. Why on Earth we \nare going to get into a delaying tactic here, I do not know.\n  I say further to my friend, I am worried even about this debate, that \npeople listening to this debate, business people, may think we are \nlosing our will to move forward with safer standards. It is not just \nthe Senator from California, or Massachusetts, or Washington, who are \nfearful of this. We have the agencies telling us very clearly that if \nthis bill passes without amendment, this rule will be derailed. If we \nare going to make a mistake--and our colleagues assure us they are \nwrong--I do not want to make a mistake in this subject area. Frankly, \nthere are other areas I would not get so upset.\n  What I find very interesting is the Senator from Utah said we cannot \ntake this anymore. It will be 3 months. It will be exemption after \nexemption after exemption from this bill.\n  The bill has a ton of exemptions for business. But when the Democrats \noffer exemptions for E. coli--which we just heard there is another \nproblem in Tennessee in the last few days on that; and we offer an \namendment on cryptosporidium, and today on mammography--oh, we are \ntrying to slow it down. We are standing here for the special interests.\n  God, I hope the American people are watching this.\n  The majority leader's sense of the Senate has no force of law. We \nhave already stated that. It has nothing to do with the underlying bill \non mammography. It is a general statement which we all can agree with. \nIn nothing that we ever do, do we intend to hurt the fight against \ndisease. But yet, the underlying Boxer amendment, which we are going to \nget a vote on--because, unlike my Republican friends, I am going to \nclearly state what I intend to do, so I hope they are listening. I \nintend to get a vote on the underlying amendment, period. You can \nsecond-degree me all night and all day tomorrow and the day after and \nthe day after and the day after and the day after--we will have a vote \non the underlying amendment.\n  So I hope sooner rather than later we can come to that agreement. We \ndid come to that agreement on the E. coli amendment, where the Senator \nfrom Louisiana had his second-degree voted on separately and then the \nunderlying amendment came after. Sad to say, we got 49 votes.\n  Everything you could think of is in the second-degree amendment, in \nthe substitute, except that you should not beat your wife. That was not \nin there. But nothing specifically to do with exempting the mammography \nrule.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what they are stopping here, if we do not \nget to the underlying Boxer amendment: Specifying performance standards \nfor x-ray equipment. I would say that is rather important, because if \nyou get a mammogram and the x-ray equipment does not meet the standard, \nor a high enough standard, they can miss the cancer.\n  I had a friend who had her mammogram; they told her it was fine, but \nthank God she found the lump herself and we hope she will make it. They \nmissed it. How am I going to tell her that, oh, I just decided for \nconvenience I would not press my amendment and we are going to vote for \nsome sense of the Senate? I cannot.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do not know if the Senator is familiar with the 1992 \nstudy by the Physician Insurers Association of America that found that \n35 percent of all claimants with breast cancer had a negative mammogram \nand 14 percent had equivocal mammogram results.\n  This is prior to the time when we took action to pass this \nlegislation, the rules of which are about to go into effect to protect \nAmerican women.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So is my friend saying that half of the mammograms may \nnot have been fully accurate?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 35 percent false negative; 14 percent \nwere equivocal--in the 1992 study, which is the most comprehensive \nstudy. As compared to the mammography, the most recent studies now, \naccording to the GAO report, find that high-quality mammography can \nfind 85 to 90 percent of breast tumors in women over 50, and discover a \ntumor up to 2 years before a lump can be felt.\n  That is in 85 to 90 percent, with the high-quality mammography, with \nwell-trained people, versus the recent study, the 1992 study, that \nshowed 35 percent false negatives with another 14 percent that were \nequivocal. This is what we are talking about: Real life and death.\n  I think that the Senator would agree with me that we are not saying \nthat these mammogram standards will solve all of the problems and that \nall breast cancer is going to be resolved. We are not going to be able \nsay that all of the people who should have those tests and who should \nreceive them will receive them. But it is a beginning.\n  Final point this: We heard so much that one of the first orders of \nbusiness by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle was medical \nmalpractice reform. You can do more about medical malpractice reform by \nimplementing these mammogram standards because you are going to get \naccuracy and you are going to save lives and not have the resulting \nkinds of challenges that come out.\n  So I think the point that the Senator was talking about, a friend \nthat experienced these tragic or unfortunate kinds of results, is \nillustrated by all of the testimony that we had, which, as the Senator \nfrom Washington and the Senator from California and others have pointed \nout, is the reason we got the unanimous results.\n  So it is important, I think, to understand what is before the U.S. \nSenate; that is, whether we are going to go forward with a procedure--\ncould we have order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senators please take their \nconversations to the Cloakroom?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The Senator from California has the floor, but I think the Senator \nfrom California and the Senator from Washington will agree that we are \ntalking about a process and a procedure that will be able to really \nhave an impact and save real people's lives. We know that will be the \nresult based on the information that we have, and that under \n\n[[Page S 9867]]\nthis legislation we are putting them at risk.\n  There will be those though say, ``Well, we have a new kind of way, a \nnew process and procedure. We do not know how it will be interpreted. \nBut why don't you take your chance and roll the dice?'' Would the \nSenator be willing to do that with her daughter? I certainly am not \nprepared to do it with mine. And I do not think any American family \nwould be prepared to do it with their wife, daughter, or their mother. \nWhy should we ask the American people to go ahead and take that chance \nand not address that issue during the course of this debate?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to say to my friend from Massachusetts--and I \nthank him for bringing those statistics to our attention--that 35 \npercent of the women are told they are OK, there is nothing wrong, when \nin fact there was a lump present. The Senator is so right to come to \nthis Chamber to talk about his daughter and to talk about my daughter. \nOne of the things I said is that the first time a Senator's wife has a \nproblem, they will be on this floor saying, ``Oh, let us pass the Boxer \namendment.'' You know it hits home.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from California yield on that question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I want to make sure I understand the process here \nbecause I am very concerned about the 46,000 women every year who die \nbecause of breast cancer. Friends of mine, friends of yours, and \nrelatives want to make sure that we have in place the best possible \nassurance that when those women have a mammogram it will be safe and it \nwill be accurate.\n  If the current bill passes as written, there is a real concern that \nthe rules and regulations that are going to go into effect can be \nchallenged, that they will not be put into place.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is absolutely correct. As we said, and we saw \non this floor arguments over interpretation, this bill is a lawyer's \ndream. I am not willing to put the women of America at risk so that a \nbunch of lawyers can go to court and squabble like we just saw happen \non the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  The Senator is right.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. So the underlying amendment will assure those \nregulations will go into place after October and women can have a \nmammogram and know that there is a degree of assurance of accuracy in \nit that does not exist today.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is true. The rule is going to specify performance \nstandards for X ray equipment; it is going to expand and standardize \nrequirements for recordkeeping on medical records and reports.\n  By the way, many times women are not notified in a timely fashion of \nthe results of their mammogram. It sounds strange. But it is true. That \nis one of the areas this rule will cover.\n  Lastly, there will be expanded quality assurance to allow flexibility \nfor review based on achievement of objectives.\n  The fact of the matter is that there will be more specific personnel \nrequirements of the people who take these mammograms to ensure that \nthey know what they are doing and do not miss a lump. They will specify \nprocedures and techniques for mammograms of women with breast implants.\n  As I know the Senators know, we have worked on this issue. It is a \nbig problem when a woman has a breast implant to figure out what is \nbehind that implant. And it could be breast cancer that is undetected.\n  All of this will be in the rule. My friends on the other side of the \naisle think so little of this amendment and this rule that they are \nwilling to second degree it with a litany of wonderful promises that \nhave absolutely no force and effect and impact of law.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. On that point, would the Senator from California agree \nthat if the sense of the Senate passes, there is no way to go home and \nassure our mothers and sisters and our daughters that they are going to \nhave safe, accurate mammograms?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would say to my friend that not only is there no way to \nassure them, but I would warn them that a bill that had unanimous \nsupport has essentially been derailed, and a rule that was about to be \npromulgated was taken off track.\n  So I think the Senator is exactly right in bringing this home to a \nperson-to-person discussion.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let us come back just for a moment and look at where we \nare. We have accepted now the Nunn amendment, which provides certain \nprovisions or procedures that are going to affect the small business. \nNow, we have the response of one of the floor managers which said that \nsince this does not reach the capacity, that you might not even be \naffected. Under the Nunn provision, this would be affected.\n  Under the criteria for the examination, one of the matters that they \nhave to look at prior to the implementation is voluntary compliance. \nThat is one of the provisions. We have the voluntary compliance. We \nhave geographical distribution, and other requirements for other \nprovisions which I know others would love to be debating all afternoon \nabout. But there are the voluntary requirements.\n  There will be those who will say, ``Why should we go ahead? Let us \nsee what we can do from a voluntary point of view.''\n  Let us look at what happened when we had the voluntary compliance. \nPrior to the passage of the law, the American College of Radiology had \na voluntary quality assurance program, and 38 percent of the clinics \nfailed. Here they tried to do it voluntarily.\n  People asked why we need regulations. What we are saying is that \nthose mothers who went in and got tested, and with inadequate \nmanufacturing, inadequate procedures, and poorly trained people, \nthought they were free, and then come down with breast cancer when it \ncould have been avoided, or at least their recovery could have been \nassured.\n  They say, ``Well, you have that heavy hand of Government regulation \nover there.'' I certainly would want that heavy hand if it is going to \nprotect any member of my family. And I think most Americans would, \nbecause individuals cannot make air clean, they cannot make water \nclean, and they cannot solve all of their problems in terms of \npesticides and other factors.\n  Let us see, voluntary--what happened in this particular issue \naffecting so many of the women in our country? We had a voluntary \nquality assurance program, and 38 percent of the clinics failed and a \nthird did not even participate in the program. They said, We are not \neven going to participate. We do not know what happened because a third \nrefused to participate in a voluntary program. That is an alternative.\n  We could go back into those kinds of procedures when we are about to \nsee the implementation of something that is going to give assurance to \nthe American public that we are going to have quality in terms of \nmanufacturing, well trained, with a good kind of enforcement, \nhopefully, and assurance.\n  I just am amazed that--I am not really amazed because we go through \nthis on many different issues. But this is really one of just such \nenormous importance and consequence to the families in this country \nwhen they say, ``Well, let us just try and not have regulations. Let us \njust have a voluntary process.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I may on my time ask my friend a question, that is, or \nmy friend from Washington, how many times have you been in a community \nmeeting in your home State of Massachusetts or your home State of \nWashington where a constituent has come over and looked you in the eye \nand grabbed you by the sleeve, and said, ``Please, Senator. Please, \nSenator, don't regulate mammograms. Don't regulate food and safety. You \nare doing too much to make the water safe\"?\n  I really do not understand what is behind this bill. I mean, I do. I \ndo. I think there is a lot of speculation behind it. But from the \nstandpoint of the overall issues, has my friend ever been told that the \nheavy hand of Government is making mammograms too strict? I ask him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Absolutely not.\n  I think the American people hopefully are beginning to understand \nwhat this debate is about. Even with regard to OSHA, with 10,000 rules \na year, if you had 99.9, or your child got 99.9, you would say, \n``Pretty good; pretty good.'' Well, if you said 99.9 percent of the \nregulations were not tested, I am not even prepared to say that, and \nneither is the \n\n[[Page S 9868]]\nhead of OSHA.\n But if you are up to, say, 99.9, you would still have 100 regulations \nthat made no sense, that none of us would support. And we are hearing \nthem every morning, we hear our favorite 10. They are using that to \nundermine the importance of the protection of mammography or for our \nfood or for our air, for our water. The American people, hopefully, are \nbeginning to understand this.\n\n  All of us understand the importance of making progress and reducing \nthe regulation and releasing the energies and expansion and trying to \neliminate bureaucracy and duplication and overlap, and the leadership \nis being provided by Senator Glenn, by Senator Levin, and others in a \nbipartisan manner--Senator Roth I see in the Chamber at this time. It \nhas been bipartisan efforts that have come out of those committees \nvirtually unanimous, Republican and Democrat. But we are throwing these \nover, at least not being able to address those kinds of issues and are \nbeing asked now to suspend, or effectively emasculate this particular \nkind of provision on mammography. That makes no sense.\n  I wish to commend the Senator and ask if she would agree with me that \njust doing a sense-of-the-Senate is really, I think, trying to raise a \nfalse sense of expectation. Would the Senator not agree that we are \nreally doing something when we are not? And for all the lists that are \nmade out there that the majority leader--I mean we will take some time \nand go through other kinds of diseases that may not have the total \nnumbers of the ones that have been included, but nonetheless, unless \nthey are listed or exempted, otherwise would fall under this process \nand procedure and put at risk families in this country. That would be \nunacceptable. Is the Senator troubled by that process as well?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am troubled by this process. I think it is a back-door \nway to undo legislation that, as my friend has pointed out, was \nunanimous--everyone agreed with the legislation--but when it comes to \nthe rulemaking, they try to stop it.\n  It is interesting; I do not know if my friends saw the poll which was \ndone that clearly showed that when the American people were asked, ``Do \nyou want to cut regulation that has to do with protecting health and \nsafety and the environment?'' 62 percent said no.\n  Well, what does that mean? It means you do not go at the Clean Water \nAct, you do not go at the Clean Air Act, and you do not go at the \nMammography Quality Standards Act, and you do not go at the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, but you back door it. And this is a clear-cut \nexample of back-door politics. You do not take it on because the \nAmerican people would be in an uproar. They want clean air. They want \nclean water. They want protection when they go for a mammogram or \nanother medical procedure. They are fearful without standards.\n  We already know we have problems. The Senator pointed out that we \nhave problems in this area. Is this a time to turn back when a third of \nthe women get a result which says they are fine, there is no lump \nfound, and in fact it is a false reading? My goodness, I think they \nwould want us to do more, and that is what the rule is all about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I just ask one question? And I see others who want \nto inquire. Does the Senator find it somewhat ironic? Here we have seen \nin terms of national health policy that women have been effectively \nshunted aside. That was a tragic reality. It was tragic in terms of the \nNIH programs and investigation in osteoporosis, breast cancer and \novarian cancer, a wide range of different areas, even though there is \nbasic research that is being done at the NIH in terms of clinical \napplications. But by and large one could say that women's health issues \nwere not a matter of central importance in terms of the American health \nagenda. Now we have seen in very recent years, in the last Congress, \none of the earliest pieces of legislation was to ensure that there was \ngoing to be a fundamental commitment in terms of the NIH for women's \nhealth-related issues for research. We are gradually catching up.\n  I would like to hear in this Chamber why we have the fact that women \nhave half the number of heart attacks as men but only have half the \nrecoveries men do. What is it about that? I mean why? We are putting \nresources in terms of research into these areas which affect real \npeople and affect our families, and now we have seen that at last, \nunder this administration with the leadership of President Clinton, \nMrs. Clinton, Barbara Mikulski, and both of our distinguished Senators \nwho are here, Senator Boxer and Senator Murray, we have seen the effort \nto make sure that we are going to continue that progress. And here we \nhave at the start of this Congress rolling into July a major assault on \na major health issue that affects better than half of our population.\n  Do the Senators find in their own mind, I would ask either the \nSenator from California or the Senator from Washington, some puzzlement \nwhen we have been so far behind on women's health issues--and certainly \nthat has been true in research in these other health policy questions--\non one extremely important matter, and that is in terms of breast \ncancer, which affects so many, and increasingly so, and we know that we \ncan make progress --there are so many areas that still escape us about \nwhat we can do in terms of making progress, but we know that in this \narea we can make a difference in terms of giving some assurance to \nwomen that there is a better chance of curing and treating breast \ncancer with these kinds of standards, that when we do have that \nopportunity, there are those who want to say no, or let us just go a \ndifferent way and maybe we will end up with the same result. We do not \nknow quite what these words mean. But why do the women of this country \nhave to jump through these additional hoops as well?\n  Does the Senator find that somewhat ironic, that we find ourselves in \nthat position on a Thursday afternoon when we ought to be trying to \nfind out and be debating what more we could do in terms of women's \nhealth issues, children's health issues, parents' issues in this \nChamber rather than try to put them at greater risk?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Not only do I find it puzzling, but I have to say to my \nfriend, as he put his question forward, I realized something very \ninteresting, and that is this is the third exemption amendment, as the \nSenator knows, that we are facing. The first one was E. coli, which is \nthat bacteria that is found in hamburger meat and kills kids mostly and \nold people, and we have a case now in Tennessee--I do not know if the \nSenator is aware of it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We had Mrs. Sullivan from Haverhill, MA, who works hard \nall day--I address the Senate; I will not take much time--works all \nday, goes to school at night, active life, whose greatest problem was \nshe ate a hamburger and $300,000 later and in a most painful, \nexcruciatingly painful kind of condition at Mass General Hospital has \nbeen able to survive but is still today in a weakened condition. And we \nhad, earlier this morning, her sister, who happens to be a nurse, and \nobviously because she was a nurse was able to, I think in a family \nsituation perhaps, get somewhat earlier kind of treatment for that \nextraordinary woman whose life will never be the same--that with regard \nto food health standards. And then we have, as the Senator pointed out, \nthe machine in here that is rolling over the protection of food safety \nfor the American people. I just wonder why the Senator thinks this is \nthe case.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think if you read the Contract With America, there was \na guideline in there. But what I wanted to make a point about, I say to \nmy friend from Massachusetts, is this. When he asked the question, is \nit not interesting whenever an issue of women's health comes up we \ncannot seem to get any forward movement? What I wanted to point out to \nmy friend from Massachusetts is this. When the E. coli amendment came \nup, I say to my friend, there was a substitute second-degree amendment \nthat tried to deal with the E. coli problem. So there was a second-\ndegree amendment to deal with the E. coli problem. And unfortunately it \npassed. It was not an effective way to go. We lost by two votes. Then \nthe cryptosporidium one came up. They defeated that, up or down. But \nnow that the Senators from California, Washington and Massachusetts and \nthe other women in the Senate on the Democratic side, put together an \namendment on breast cancer, guess what? What is the second-degree \n\n[[Page S 9869]]\namendment, I say to my friend? It has nothing to do with breast cancer. \nIt has nothing to do with mammography. What is wrong?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Is this the first sense-of-the-Senate that we have dealt \nwith as well?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Oh, yes. This is the first sense-of-the-Senate. They \nsubstitute a very strong amendment to move forward mammography rules \nwith a big fat nothing. A sense-of-the-Senate that does nothing and \ndoes not even mention women's health or mammography. It is \nextraordinary. And that is why I am willing to stand here day after \nday, and night after night, and morning after morning, with my friends, \nuntil we get a vote up or down on the mammography issue, and if my \nfriends want to stay here through the weekend and through next weekend \nand the weekend after that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to commend all those who have been involved with \nthis. But would she not agree with me--I did not want to take the focus \noff the issue really of the mammography--but basically what we are \ntalking about--I call this the ``Polluters and Poisoners Protection \nAct.'' We are basically talking about not only in terms of questioning \nthe safety on terms of breast cancer mammography standards, but we are \ntalking about unsafe drinking water that will affect that family, and \nunsafe meat and the E. coli which you just referenced on that, and we \nare going to come down here to the change on the unsafe fruits and \nvegetables, and the unsafe baby foods with the changes in the food \nstandard.\n  And as the Senator has focused on the E. coli, cryptosporidium debate \nlast night, and now the mammography standards, basically we are talking \nabout these other elements. Would the Senator not agree with me?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. This is part of the process.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is part of the whole process. I want to indicate \nthat the Senator has really brought the focus and attention on this \narea. We cannot solve all of the problems in these areas of drinking \nwater, and meat and the vegetables and baby foods. We can make them a \ngreat deal safer. We think that we are putting at very significant risk \nall these kinds of protections for the American people. But the Senator \nfrom California is saying on the mammography we have specifics. ``Do \nnot take this away from protecting the American women. Take your hands \noff these standards that can make a real difference for the protection \nof mothers and sisters and daughters.'' And I just want to commend her \nand thank her very much.\n  But I did want to inquire whether the Senator from California or the \nSenator from Washington agreed with me that we have parallel threats to \nthese other areas in this legislation. And that the American people \nought to understand that as well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I certainly hope that the American people are watching \nthis debate. You know, you can get off on these different sections of \nthe bill. The lookback procedures, the petitions, all the rest of it. \nAnd that is what I believe the proponents of this bill want us to \ndebate. They want to debate, how many days will it be reviewed? How \nmany months will it be reviewed? The bottom line is this bill, if it \npasses without substantial amendment, is going to derail an urgent rule \nthat is coming forward in October that will provide standards for those \nwho are in the business of providing mammography, the majority of which \nare terrific people, but there are always those who cut around the \nedges. And that is why we need these rules, these national standards, \nso that a woman in California gets the same quality mammogram as a \nwoman in Massachusetts or Tennessee or New Hampshire or Vermont or \nRhode Island or Louisiana or Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Or Minnesota.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from California agree with me--because \nI feel very puzzled and baffled and really concerned--that this \namendment which deals very specifically with women, our mothers, our \nsisters, our daughters, our friends, who have had breast cancer, and \nwho are counting on us as the Nation's leaders to assure them that when \nthey go in for a mammography, that they have strict standards; that \nthis amendment that deals with women, and women alone, has a sense-of-\nthe-Senate second-degree; that I believe, if I am not mistaken, when \nthe Senator spoke to it this morning she was not even able to send her \nown amendment to the desk. When her amendment was at the desk we were \nnot allowed to speak about breast cancer for over an hour, but we did \nlisten to a long litany about charts and graphs and process and long \nwords and ambiguities. And we are finally here able to speak to the \nrealness of this. But I also heard when this was being discussed \nbefore, ``Do not worry about this. It is only going to cost $98 \nmillion.'' Is that what the Senator from California heard as well?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Oh, yes. Yes. They say, ``Oh, the estimate of cost is $98 \nmillion. Since our bill says if you are under $100 million you do not \ncome under this, do not worry. Do not worry.''\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Would the Senator yield?\n  Is it not clear that $98 million is darn close to $100 million, and \ncould reach $100 million? And not only that, it is my understanding \nthat in the House bill that has passed the threshold is $25 million.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. When it gets to conference we will see somewhere between \n$25 and $100 million. So mammographies will be impacted.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Would the Senator not agree, in this legislation as \ncurrently drafted, it says if there is a significant impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities it will be exempt as well? This \namendment will not only be applicable because of the cost but it will \nalso be because a substantial number of mammograms are done by small \nentities.\n  Is that not correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is so correct. And I do not like to use--well, \nI will be as delicate as I can. I think claims on this Senate floor \nthat mammography improvements are safe, without the Boxer-Murray \namendment are false claims, because of what my friends have pointed out \nin this question time.\n  First, the fact that we know $98 million is the cost of this \nregulation. And that is about as close as you can get to $100 million. \nAnd, of course, when this bill goes to conference, with Newt Gingrich \nand his friends, they have a $25 million trigger. You do not need to go \nto Poli Sci 101 to know where the numbers come out. We will be lucky if \nit is $50 million. So ipso facto, protection gone.\n  And the second point that both my friends pointed out, which is \nimportant for this debate, is that under some amendments that we passed \nhere, small businesses will be exempted if a substantial number, by the \nway not defined, talk about a lawyer's dream, substantial number of \nsmall businesses are impacted.\n  We are talking about endangering the lives of women. And when my \nfriend says our sisters, our grandmothers, our daughters, our \ngranddaughters, I think it affects our grandpas and our dads and \nbrothers and our husbands too. When a woman gets breast cancer this is \nnot only her fight. It is a family struggle. And when a family finds \nout that it was a mammogram that was not read correctly, or an x-ray \nmachinery was defective, imagine the feeling that they lost a member of \ntheir family that could have been saved. And that is what we are \ntalking about here. So if they want to talk on the other side about \nlookbacks and sunsets, and waivers and all the rest--it is new speak. \nWe now have new speak around here. We do not get to the issues. Thank \nGod for the Senator from Massachusetts for coming over here and helping \nus focus. Thank God for him\n for all these years fighting these battles, sometimes quite a lonely \nfight. I hope the American people listen, listen up. I am going to get \na vote on the underlying amendment.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Then I assume the Senator from California feels, as I do \nat this point, that we will not be dismissed by a sense-of-the-Senate \n\n[[Page S 9870]]\namendment; that on the underlying amendment, that clearly says to all \nwomen in this country that we will continue forward and put in place \nassurances for them on mammographies, there will be a vote on this \nfloor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We both guarantee that, and I know the Senator from \nMassachusetts joins us in that, as I am sure the Senator from Minnesota \ndoes, who is here listening and I am hoping will be asking us some \nquestions in a short time. We are going to have a vote on the \nunderlying amendment, period. Period. There is no recess that is going \nto stop us, either. You want to push us up against the recess? OK. \nForty-six thousand women a year die of breast cancer. We will stay. We \nwill stay through the summer. We will stay through Thanksgiving, \nChristmas. We will stay. We will stay through Hanukkah, Passover, \nEaster.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The next Congress.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The next Congress, and none of us wants to have to do \nthat because we have families, too. We have families, too. But we will \ndo that because one in nine women is going to get breast cancer. Count \nup the women in this Chamber. Somebody is going to get breast cancer.\n  I will say this, sometimes you cannot help what happens. Sometimes \nyou cannot help what happens. But many times you can, and we know that \nearly detection is the major tool that we have in the fight against \nbreast cancer.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be glad to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will not take but a couple of minutes. I have from \nmy office watched the Senator from California, the Senator from \nWashington, and the Senator from Massachusetts out on the floor, and I \nreally have been moved by what you have said.\n  My wife, Sheila, is not here today. But her mom passed away from \nbreast cancer, and we feel very, very strongly about these issues.\n  The Senator talks about having an up-or-down vote and we will be here \nfor as long as it takes. If I could just ask my colleagues, why do you \nfeel so strongly about this? Let us just forget all the statistics, all \nthe charts, all the numbers. Why do you feel so strongly about this?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I thank my friend for asking the question. I feel \nso strongly about this because I think that this bill is a backdoor \nattack on a very important series of laws that were passed in a \nbipartisan way to protect the American people. I feel very strongly it \nis a backdoor war on these laws. That is how I feel, because I do not \nthink there would be support for repealing any of these acts. There are \na lot of special interests out there that do not want the Clean Water \nAct and the Clean Air Act. Why? Because they feel it in their \npocketbook.\n  While we all agree we do not want unnecessary and burdensome \nregulations, and all of us are willing to vote to end that, we feel \ndeeply committed that we will not reverse years of progress. I do not \ncare if it is in the Contract With America.\n  So I feel very strongly that when there is an attack on a law that \nprotects the health and safety of the American people, it is an \nobligation of U.S. Senators to point it out and to stand on their feet \nand to fight. I think that is what we are doing.\n  We all know people who have been misdiagnosed.\n  I talked about a friend of mine who, because the mammogram was not \nread properly, suffers terribly, and we pray that she will make it. But \nevery day is like a nightmare because she did not catch it early.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator from California will yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator has asked a critical question, why would \nsomebody be willing to stand out here on their feet and speak over and \nover until they are given an up-or-down vote on a very simple \namendment. It is because of the women we know--personal friends and \npersonal relatives who have died from breast cancer because it was not \ndetected early. One out of nine women today will be diagnosed with \nbreast cancer. Nine out of ten women will survive if it is detected \nearly. I am determined to make sure that on my watch on this floor of \nthis Senate that I will not allow any of those women to go undetected. \nI think it is incumbent upon all of us to see that that occurs.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am not yielding at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield to the Senator from \nUtah?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, I will not. When I simply asked for a parliamentary \ninquiry before, Senators would not yield to me.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would have yielded to you. You did not ask me.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to my friend for a parliamentary inquiry without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate that. I thank you. Let me make a couple \ncomments. There is nobody on this floor that feels more deeply about \nmammography than I do. Nobody.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask, is this a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I am going to ask a question, and I want to make a \nfew statements so I can get to the question.\n  There is nobody on this floor who has worked harder, as one of the \nprime cosponsors of the mammography bill. But is it not true that there \nis an interim rule in effect on mammography?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The interim rule does not affect the issues that I read \nto the Senate. I will reread them. It does not go to these issues. \nThese issues are of crucial importance. They involve the performance \nstandards for x-ray equipment; expanding and standardizing requirements \nfor recordkeeping; expanding quality assurance; clarifying personnel \nrequirements; and specifying procedures and techniques for mammography \nfor examinees who have breast implants.\n  Mr. HATCH. Are they not in effect now?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, there is no rule. I will be happy to share this with \nthe Senator. This is a description of the rule that is going to go into \neffect in October.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes; I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, if the Senator stated it accurately, \nthe new rules are likely to be significant improvements to the interim \nrule. They include performance standards for radiological equipment; \nstandards for uniform imaging of women with breast implants; and \nestablishing consumer plate procedures.\n  None of these areas are addressed in the interim regulations. So the \ninterim rule, although much better than what would have existed, still \nwill be strengthened with the permanent requirements.\n  I see others who want to speak, but let me mention, I was listening \nto the exchanges. I was going back into the hearing record and the \ntestimony of Dr. Roper, who was the head of the CDC when we were having \nthose hearings, and pointing out the controlled studies have shown that \na 35- or 40-percent reduction in mortality related to breast cancer is \npossible.\n  I will make a comment and ask the Senator whether she agrees with \nthis. Does the Senator agree that Dr. Roper's testimony was powerful \ntestimony when he pointed out that controlled studies have shown that a \n35- or 40-percent reduction in mortality related to breast cancer is \npossible? However, in order to achieve this level mammography, clinical \nexamination must be performed, interpreted, and reported as accurately \nas possible. Subsequent steps, including biopsies and other \nfollowthrough procedures, must be timely and of high quality.\n  We, along with the Public Health Service Agency and relevant \nprofessional organizations, provide leadership to aggressively pursue a \nprogram designed to ensure the highest standards of excellent and early \ndetection of breast cancer with mammography and assure the maximum \nbenefit for lifesaving technology for all Americans.\n  This is the testimony in favor of this legislation by the head of the \nCenters for Disease Control, appointed by the previous administration. \nControlled studies have shown that a 35- to 40-percent reduction in \nmortality for cancer is what we are talking about for women. \n\n[[Page S 9871]]\n\n  Let me just ask the Senator whether she would agree with what was a \nvery powerful comment, and that was during the course of our hearing, \nMrs. Langor, who is the head of the National Association on Breast \nCancer. This is her statement. I ask what is the reaction of the \nSenator from California.\n\n       We hear many sad things at NABCA, but one of the saddest is \n     the story of the woman who has done everything correctly. She \n     scheduled her mammogram, has received a clean bill of health, \n     then she finds she is dying of breast cancer, not always due \n     to negligence, but rather due to inexperience, poor equipment \n     maintenance, or wrong equipment. She was relying on her \n     medical provider to develop quality care. Her life has been \n     destroyed. Her confidence is gone. She has conveyed this \n     message to every woman she knows. A vital element in our \n     attempts to control the breast cancer epidemic is knowing \n     that after our hard work reaching, educating, and reassuring \n     every American woman about mammography, that it is \n     increasingly safe and affordable, mammography is also \n     universally effective. It is the right of American women to \n     receive screening mammography of the highest quality and the \n     responsibility of lawmakers to grant them that right.\n\n  You cannot say it any better than that. That is what the mammography \nstandards bill has done. This legislation is putting this at risk. At \nrisk is that very eloquent statement.\n  I ask the Senator, again, why we should take any risks at all in \ndoing it after we have had all the testimony in the world. We know \nabout the problems we cannot solve. We can make an important impact in \nterms of the safety and continued life of women in our society. Why \nshould we throw that over and go to some other kind of process and \nprocedure which, for me, is not worth the paper that we have it written \non.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. He is so right. Women are already at \nrisk for breast cancer. Forty-six thousand a year die of it, and now we \nare going to add to the risk and derail a rule that--no matter how many \ntimes the Senator asked me the question, I will come back and tell you, \nno, there are no final regulations in place for the x-ray machines. \nThere are no regulations. There are regulations in place for \naccreditation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to resolve this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendments numbered 1524 \nand 1525 be withdrawn.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is agreed to by both sides. We are going to give you \na separate vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving my right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will propound the unanimous-consent \nrequest, I think we are ready.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that amendments 1524 and 1525 be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So, the amendments (Nos. 1524 and 1525) were withdrawn.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will soon send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no other amendments be in order, that a \nvote occur on the amendment at 5:05 p.m., with the time equally divided \nin the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object. I want to make sure that \nbefore the vote on the Boxer-Murray-Mikulski amendment there be 1 \nminute on either side.\n  Mr. HATCH. If we hurry, we have almost 8 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to make sure that there is a little time on each \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nvote Senator Boxer be recognized to offer an amendment, the text of \nwhich is amendment No. 1524, and that no amendments be in order to the \nBoxer amendment, and a vote occur immediately after 1 minute for \nSenator Boxer and 1 minute for Senator Hatch, without any intervening \naction or debate on the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, I have \nhad a conversation with the Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nOklahoma about whether we would be able to accept the other pending \namendment, which is the Superfund amendment, accept that by unanimous \nconsent. Do we know whether we can do that at this time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not prepared to do that at this time. But we will \ncertainly look at that.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I say to my colleagues that I think that is in the \nworks. That is, I have requested that we be able to do that. And so I \nhope after the vote on the Boxer amendment, we would be able to accept \nthat by unanimous consent. I would assume that no one on our side would \nobject. But I would like to get that notice out just in case.\n  Mr. HATCH. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1531 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1531 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, add the \n     following: It is the sense of the Senate that nothing in this \n     Act is intended to delay the timely promulgation of any \n     regulations that would meet a human health or safety threat, \n     including any rules that would reduce illness or mortality \n     from the following: heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic \n     obstructive lung diseases, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes \n     mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or water or \n     food borne pathogens, polio, tuberculosis, measles, viral \n     hepatitis, syphilis, or all other infectious and parasitic \n     diseases.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments re: exemptions for mammography be in order during the \npendency of S. 343.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I can be clear about the order. The Senator from \nCalifornia has 5 minutes and the Senator from Utah has 5 minutes, is \nthat correct? I want to make that clear. Or is the floor open to \nwhoever seeks recognition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between now and 5:05 is evenly \ndivided between the two Senators, which means the Senator has about \n3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I have no objection to voting for the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \noffered by Senator Dole. That is fine. It has nothing to do with my \namendment, however, which gets to the issue of mammography. I hope \nSenators, in a bipartisan spirit, will support both.\n  There is nothing wrong whatsoever with Senator Dole's amendment. It \nis just that, for the last, let us see, about 3 hours he intended for \nit to substitute for the Boxer-Murray-Mikulski amendment which, to this \nSenator, made no sense, and to many other Senators, it made no sense.\n\n[[Page S 9872]]\n\n  I am not going to yield to anybody because I only have 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes. I hope that Senators are listening to this debate. It has been \nclearly demonstrated via the fact that if we do not pass the Boxer-\nMurray amendment, we are playing Russian roulette with women's lives. \nLet me tell you why. In October, a rule is going to go on the books \nthat sets standards for mammography.\n It is carrying out a law that passed in 1992.\n\n  This is not fun and games. This is about breast cancer that is going \nto strike one out of every nine women in this Chamber. The most painful \nsituation is one where a woman was told her mammogram was fine, only to \nfind out the technician could not read it or the machine was faulty and \nshe has to undergo the most radical kind of therapy.\n  So my friends can argue about line 6 and line 2 and sunset clauses \nand all the rest. If Members care about this, Members vote yes. Play it \nsafe for the women of this country and do not gamble. The rule that is \nabout to come out is a rule that will make it far safer. Why on God's \ngreen Earth do we want to derail that? To score a political point?\n  Think again. The American people are catching on to this debate. This \nis a back-door assault on a bill that was passed in 1992 by Republicans \nand Democrats alike. But rather than repeal sections of it, we are \nmaking it so hard that the rule to carry it out will never go into \nplace.\n  The first day a Senator's wife comes down with breast cancer and it \nwas missed on a mammogram, we will be on the floor changing this bill.\n  Mr. President, 46,000 women every year die of this disease. We have \ntalked about our moms, our grandmothers, our sisters, and our \ndaughters. What about the fathers and sons and the grandfathers? It \naffects each and every American, just as when a man gets prostate \ncancer and is taken away from the family.\n  If ever there was a time to pull together as Senators for both \nparties, this is it. Why do we have to fight over everything around \nhere?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Boxer, in offering this amendment that protects the public \nhealth by ensuring the continued implementation of mammography quality \nrules.\n  As the original coauthor of the Mammography Quality Standards Act, I \nwas especially proud when this act was adopted in 1992. The Mammography \nQuality Standards Act requires all facilities providing mammography to \nbe accredited and certified. This is extremely important in our efforts \nto detect breast cancer early when treatment is available and less \ninvasive.\n  For the past year, the mammography quality standards have been \nreviewed by a Mammography Advisory Committee. It is my understanding \nthat the FDA is now prepared to move forward with the publishing of \nthese rules in October.\n  The women of America have waited since October 1992 for these \nmammography quality standards to be implemented. A delay at this time \nwill result in needless deaths and disability by women who are tested \nby facilities and equipment not meeting Federal, uniform quality \nstandards for mammography.\n  We are so close in getting these final rules for mammography quality \nstandards approved. We must ensure that the mammogram women receive is \nof the highest quality possible.\n  I urge immediate passage of this amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor this important \namendment to ensure that regulations providing for quality standards in \nmammography screening are fully implemented as swiftly as possible.\n  Despite promising scientific advances in the treatment and diagnosis \nof breast cancer, this disease remains a major health threat to \nmillions of American women. Breast cancer is the second leading cause \nof death among women. Last year alone, it is estimated by the National \nCancer Institute that over 182,000 new cases of breast cancer were \ndiagnosed and more than 46,000 women in the United States died as a \nresult of this devastating disease.\n  This disease often strikes women in the prime of their lives and, as \nwomen get older, the odds of developing breast cancer steadily \nincrease. One in eight women will develop breast cancer at\n some point in their lives. With statistics this sober, nearly every \nfamily will be directly affected by this disease.\n\n  In 1992, I cosponsored the Mammography Quality Standards Assurance \nAct because I knew of the critical importance of accurate breast cancer \nscreening. Mammograms are among the most difficult tests to perform. If \nimages are not clear or if tests are improperly read, cancers can be \nmissed, leading to delayed treatment and premature death.\n  Prior to the adoption of this act, only a patchwork of Federal State, \nand voluntary standards existed for mammography. Women could not be \nassured that their mammograms were properly administered, interpreted \nor communicated to them or their physicians.\n  In absence of a cure, mammography and the early detection of breast \ncancer is still the most effective weapon women have to fight this \nincreasingly common--and often fatal--disease.\n  Currently, the FDA has in place interim rules for the Mammography \nQuality Assurance Act which establish national standards to ensure the \nsafety and accuracy of breast cancer screening procedures. However, the \nfinal proposed regulations are not expected until this October. While \nthe interim regulations are enforceable and have established rules for \naccreditation, certification and annual inspection, it is crucial that \nwe do not delay in full implementation of final regulations.\n  I am aware that there are questions as to whether S. 343 would have \nany effect on the implementation of these standards, but I believe that \nit is critically important to be absolutely sure that these regulations \nare not derailed, or delayed. The mammography standards were passed \nnearly 3 years ago and we must move forward on this important women's \nhealth issue.\n  The proposed final regulations further ensure the safety of \nmammography in significant ways. They specify performance standards for \nx-rays, develop procedures for examining women with breast implants and \nstandardize requirements on medical records and mammography reports. \nEach of these reforms are essential to ensuring that all mammography \ndone in this country is as reliable as possible.\n  Early detection of breast cancer will save countless lives. The \nMammography Quality Standards Assurance Act ensures that women get the \nbest possible breast cancer screening and that they will have the best \nchance of treating their cancer once diagnosed.\n  We owe it to each family touched by this devastating disease that \nthese critical standards be exempted from any additional regulatory \ndelays and that they become effective before more precious lives are \nlost to breast cancer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). All time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think this is important, and I am glad to \nhave an opportunity to get the points on the record.\n  I have to say again that interim regulations are by definition final. \nPerhaps the new, proposed regulations will be here in October; we have \nbeen assured by those on the other side that this is so.\n  But I have to keep point out that these interim regulations do have \nthe full force and effect of law.\n  This particular debate is filled with misrepresentations. \nNevertheless, I still think it is an important debate and I am glad to \nhave an opportunity to get some key points on the record.\n  Mammography is an important tool in our effort to fight a dread \ndisease which now affects an estimated one in nine women.\n  I believe we should do all we can to protect against breast cancer. I \nam one of the original sponsors to help to write one bill that does \nthis. I am the sponsor of a bill last year to require that another \nbreast cancer screening tool, self-examination, be taught at all \nfederally funded health clinics. My record in this area is clear.\n  But whether or not we want to fight breast cancer is not the point of \nthis debate. Of course, we all want to fight breast cancer, and all \nother cancers for that matter.\n  The point is that there are regulations in effect to implement the \nMammography Quality Standards Act. They were promulgated in December \n1993, 1\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  Nothing I have heard in this Chamber changes that or has convinced me \na new proposed regulation under MQSA, \n\n[[Page S 9873]]\nwould make a significant improvement in the health of women who might \nget breast cancer.\n  Nevertheless, in the spirit of moving the larger debate along and \nrecognizing that by the administration's own published estimate, it is \nlikely new rules from MQSA would not be subject to the cost-benefit \nanalysis of this bill, I, personally, am willing to accept this \namendment.\n  If this amendment is necessary to give America's women peace of mind, \nI think it should go forward, even though I, personally, believe it is \nnot needed.\n  I do have to underscore again that this bill addresses the \nmammography situation. It addresses the E. coli. If a rulemaking meets \nthe bill's thresholds, there still can be exemptions for health \nemergencies or even health threats. It is hard to believe that the \nadministration would not consider the possibility of meat contamination \nor increased exposure to breast cancer threats to public health.\n  Our bill allows those exemptions as I have cited before.\n  I personally resent the representations that have been made on the \nfloor in this regard. It is important that members read the language of \nthe bill; perhaps they have not.\n  The Glenn bill does not allow such exemptions. We put a lot of effort \nto make sure we take care of these problems.\n  I am frustrated because we are undergoing untold hours on the floor \njust, for the most part, so that political points can be made.\n  I think it is time to start working on the heart of this bill. If \nthere are major problems in this bill that really need to be corrected, \nwe should address them.\n  I hate to say this, but I have been working in good faith to try to \naccommodate the other side, to try to work on this problem and get this \nmatter resolved, and make sure that they are happy with these \nprovisions.\n  I am concerned because I perceive that we are continuing to get \namendments which are permutations of issues which have already been \nresolved, such as the impact of the bill on the ability of Federal \nagencies to address public health problems.\n  One has to conclude that the purpose of all this is to drag out the \ndebate. That is fine.\n  My personal recommendation is that we should vote for both amendments \nand get this past us and move on from there. We need to start working \non the bill, rather than all these amendments that really do not \ndeserve to see the light of day because we have taken care of them in \nthe bill.\n  I do not see how anybody can disagree with that.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mrs. \n     Murray, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Bradley, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bumpers, \n     Mr. Biden, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mr. Daschle, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1532.\n       On page 19, strike the period and insert the following: ``; \n     or (xiii) a rule intended to implement section 354 of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 263b) (as added by \n     section 2 of the Mammography Quality Standards Act of \n     1992).''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe under a previous order I have 60 \nseconds to present the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order? The Senator deserves to \nbe heard.\n  Mr. President, we are not in order. Mr. President, I make a point of \norder that the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the amendment that is before the Senate \nwould exempt the new mammogram rules from this bill. When you vote on \nthe Boxer-Murray-Mikulski amendment, I ask you to think about your \nmother, your sister, your daughter, your granddaughter, and cast a vote \nthat will assure them the best chance to survive breast cancer. And the \nbest chance to survive breast cancer is to have the best equipment run \nby the best personnel.\n  That is what these rules are all about. We do not want to derail \nthose rules because, otherwise, the cancer could be missed. And all of \nus know too many cases where tragedy has ensued. The better standards \nthat are being proposed in the rule that will come out in October will \nabsolutely be derailed because they came out after the April date that \nis specified in this bill.\n  So without the Boxer-Murray-Mikulski amendment, and so many other \ngood Senators who are on it, we will derail safe mammograms.\n  Please vote aye and join with the National Breast Cancer Coalition in \nsupport of mammography quality standards.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am going to recommend that everybody in the Chamber vote \nfor this amendment, but I have to say this is another 3- or 4-hour \nexpenditure of time that did not have to occur.\n  The administration, by its own official publication, said only 10 \nweeks ago that the anticipated costs of implementing the Mammography \nQuality Standards Act of 1993, a bill that I helped to write, would be \nabout $33 million.\n  Now we are told up to $97 million, although the administration has \nnot provided us with any details on that cost estimate or why it has \nchanged so dramatically in 10 short weeks. But in any case, $97 million \nis still $3 million less than the threshold of this bill and could be \nmade even less if the administration so desired.\n  On the other hand, I do think we should vote for it, because it may \ngive some peace to some people who do not \n\n[[Page S 9874]]\nunderstand this matter is already covered.\n  I continue to believe that our bill would not engender the ill \neffects the other side believes.\n  However, breast cancer is a serious, serious problem, and I would not \nwant to create any feelings in that community that the Congress does \nnot take the problem seriously. Because we do.\n  So I think that we should vote for the Boxer amendment, and then move \non.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

What is the pending business?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1517\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Johnston amendment \nNo. 1517.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee \non Superfund Waste Control and Risk Assessment, and as a member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I have been closely following the \nprogress of the pending regulatory reform legislation, S. 343, as it \npertains to Superfund. I believe this is an important bill, and I think \nit makes a significant improvement in modernizing an outdated \nregulatory system.\n  I have to admit that I have some concerns about Superfund being \nspecifically targeted for reform in this legislation. Before I outline \nthese concerns, however, I think it is important to recognize how we \nhave gotten to this point.\n  Everyone in this Chamber can agree that our Nation's system of \nenvironmental regulations has had its successes: Americans are \nbreathing cleaner air, and drinking cleaner water today than they did a \ngeneration ago. Nonetheless, there is uniform consensus that the \nSuperfund program, however well intended, is not living up to its \npromises. Over the last 14 years we have spent over $30 billion dollars \non this program, yet today, we have completed the cleanup at only 70 of \nthe more than 1,300 sites on the national priorities list. Clearly we \ncan and must do a better job of cleaning up these sites.\n  Beginning this past January, I conducted a series of 7 hearings and \nreceived testimony from more than 60 witnesses in an effort to formally \nincorporate a wide variety of views on the issue of Superfund reform. \nIn addition, Congressman Mike Oxley, the chairman of the House \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Hazardous Materials, and I met with \nnumerous groups in candid, off-the-record meetings. Participants \nincluded: environmental groups, potentially responsible parties, \nrepresentatives of the environmental justice movement, State and local \ngovernments, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of \nDefense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Interior, think \ntanks, and insurance companies.\n  After taking the time to digest and analyze the information provided \nby these groups, I released, on June 28, 1995, a Superfund reform \noutline which is a comprehensive effort to radically reform the \nSuperfund program. At this time, I ask that a copy of my proposal be \nentered in the Record after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Based on comments I have received in response to this proposal, I \nplan on quickly moving to draft a Superfund reauthorization measure \nthat will be available later this summer. I have pledged to the \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, that this legislation will be available \nfor full Senate consideration and final passage later this year.\n  This past Monday, I visited a variety of Superfund sites in New \nHampshire. One of these sites, the Coakley Landfill in North Hampton, \nNH, involved the cleanup of a former landfill site. After 10 years of \nstudy, the Environmental Protection Agency determined that in addition \nto capping the site, it wants to require the construction of a $10-\nmillion-dollar groundwater pump and treat system. The EPA is insisting \non this remedy even though there are no pathways to human exposure, and \neven though the pollutant could be addressed in the same amount of time \nthrough natural attention. All of the potentially responsible parties, \nthe State of New Hampshire, and the local communities have agreed that \nthis expensive system in not necessary. Nonetheless, the EPA is \ncontinuing to go forward.\n  I can understand the impatience of my colleagues in dealing with this \nfrequently onerous program, and I can appreciate their desire that \nSuperfund be addressed in this legislation. Frankly, in light of its \npast record, the Superfund program is the poster child for regulatory \nreform. Nonetheless, given the fact that my subcommittee has been \nworking diligently to quickly develop legislation on this issue, I \nbelieve that this matter should be addressed in the context of a \ncomprehensive Superfund reauthorization bill, rather than in S. 343. \nFor this reason, I am asking my Republican colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Baucus amendment.\n  I want to make something perfectly clear. Although I would prefer \nthat these issues be dealt with in the context of a Superfund \nreauthorization measure, I agree in spirit with the changes included in \nthis legislation. The fact is that all too frequently the Superfund \nprogram ignores common sense principles when dealing with toxic waste \ncleanups.\n  I believe that risk assessment and benefit-cost analysis should be \nutilized in determining how and when we will be cleaning up these toxic \nwaste sites. While I think it is appropriate that this language not be \nincluded in the regulatory reform legislation, I want to make it very \nclear that the use of appropriate risk assessment and benefit-cost \nanalysis will be part of a comprehensive Superfund reform measure.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        Superfund Reform Outline\n\n                 (Introduction from Senator Bob Smith)\n\n       The Superfund program has had its successes. It is not, \n     however, a successful program. When seeking input on the \n     future of hazardous waste cleanup in the United States, I \n     held no preconceived notions about what would or would not \n     work. I believed that every legitimate idea had a place on \n     the table, and was guided by one important premise: the \n     Superfund program is in need of dramatic reform. My goal has \n     been--and will continue to be--to solicit input and support \n     from all interested parties to achieve that reform.\n       Creation of this document was an open process. The \n     Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control, and Risk \n     Assessment, which I chair, held 7 hearings and received \n     testimony from more than 60 witnesses in an effort to \n     formally incorporate a wide variety of views on the issue of \n     Superfund reform. In addition, Congressman Mike Oxley, the \n     Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and \n     Hazardous Materials, and I met with numerous groups in \n     candid, off-\n\n[[Page S 9875]]\n     the-record meetings. Participants included: environmental groups, \n     potentially responsible parties, representatives of the \n     environmental justice movement, state and local governments, \n     the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of \n     Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of \n     Interior, think tanks, and insurance companies. I also \n     solicited the input of all members of the subcommittee, \n     Chairman John Chafee, Ranking Member Max Baucus, and the \n     Majority Leader.\n       The release of this Superfund Reform Outline is a natural \n     extension of that process. The purpose of the document is to \n     solicit additional constructive comments, ideas and \n     criticisms that can be used during the bill-drafting process. \n     The document is divided into three parts. Section I provides \n     a brief history of the Superfund program, beginning with its \n     inception in 1980 and continuing through to present day. \n     Section II explains the principles that were used to guide \n     the development of the reform measures. Section III provides \n     a detailed summary of my recommended proposals.\n       The legislative proposals contained in Section III are \n     intended to serve as the building blocks for a comprehensive \n     reform of the Superfund program. They are not intended to be \n     all inclusive, and no signal, either positive or negative, is \n     intended if any item has been omitted from the outline. It is \n     plausible that the final version of a comprehensive Superfund \n     reform program may not precisely mirror all of the elements \n     contained in this document.\n       I would appreciate that any specific comments on this plan \n     be provided in writing. These comments should include your \n     name, address and phone number, and should be forwarded no \n     later than July 10, 1995, to:\n       Jeff Merrifield, Counsel, Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste \n     Control and Risk Assessment, Hart Senate Office Building, \n     Washington, DC 20510.\n       The Superfund program must be transformed into a more \n     responsive, efficient and fair system for cleaning up \n     hazardous waste sites and returning them to productive use. I \n     believe this document provides a blueprint for reaching that \n     goal. I look forward to receiving your input.\n\n\n                        section i--brief history\n\n       The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and \n     Liability Act (``CERCLA''), also known as ``Superfund'', was \n     passed and signed into law during the post-election session \n     of Congress in 1980. The Superfund program was intended to \n     enhance the federal government's ability to compel parties \n     responsible for causing contamination at sites such as Love \n     Canal, New York, and the ``Valley of the Drums'' in Kentucky, \n     to either clean up the contamination or reimburse EPA for the \n     costs of doing so.\n       The cleanup program that Congress enacted was premised on \n     the principle that the ``polluter pays,'' through a system of \n     strict, retroactive, joint and several liability. If those \n     responsible for site contamination (potentially responsible \n     parties or ``PRPs'') could not be found, or were unable to \n     pay, EPA could use a special Trust Fund (hence the term \n     ``Superfund'') to pay for the cost of cleaning up these \n     sites. This ``Superfund'' was funded through taxes on the \n     chemical and petroleum industries. Superfund was further \n     amended in 1986 when Congress enacted the Superfund \n     Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (``SARA''). SARA \n     extended and expanded the Superfund taxes and authorized \n     expenditures of $8.5 billion through December 31, 1991.\n       Although the Superfund program has achieved some successes, \n     there is widespread agreement that the program is troubled. \n     When CERCLA was enacted, it was expected that only a few \n     hundred sites would need to be cleaned up and that the \n     program would require relatively modest funding. Both of \n     these expectations have proven to be inaccurate. Currently, \n     there are over 1,300 sites on the Superfund list (known as \n     the National Priorities List or ``NPL''), and during the last \n     few years, EPA has been adding an average of approximately \n     30-40 new sites per year to the NPL. To date, the \n     construction of long-term cleanup remedies have been \n     completed at fewer than 300 contaminated sites.\n       As the magnitude of the problem has increased, the \n     projected cost of the program has risen accordingly. Congress \n     originally set aside $1.6 billion for NPL cleanups when it \n     created the Trust Fund in 1980. Six years later, Congress \n     increased the amount in the Fund to $8.5 billion. In 1990, \n     Congress added another $5.1 billion. Overall, it is estimated \n     that the total amount of money spent on Superfund since 1980, \n     including the settlement costs of PRP's, is in excess of $25-\n     $30 billion.\n       Given these problems, the Superfund program has been widely \n     criticized, primarily on the following four major grounds: \n     (1) the liability system is unfair and has resulted in \n     excessive litigation and other transaction costs, diverting \n     attention and money from site\n      cleanup; (2) the cumbersome and often overly prescriptive \n     remedy selection process has delayed clean up actions and \n     driven up cleanup costs; (3) states and local citizens do \n     not have the ability to fully participate in the selection \n     and implementation of appropriate remedies; and (4) the \n     stigma of being listed as a Superfund site often creates \n     economic disincentives for the redevelopment and reuse of \n     contaminated properties.\n\n\n                     SECTION II--GUIDING PRINCIPLES\n\n       Community Empowerment.--The citizens who are most adversely \n     impacted by the cleanup of hazardous waste sites near their \n     homes should be empowered with a greater role in the \n     decisionmaking process and an increased responsibility in \n     helping to select the remedial action that will protect human \n     health and the environment, foster rapid economic \n     redevelopment, and promote expedited restoration of natural \n     resources.\n       Enhanced State Role.--The states have developed an \n     extensive and sophisticated level of expertise in addressing \n     the problems of hazardous waste contamination outside of the \n     Superfund program. Reform of Superfund should recognize this \n     level of expertise, and should endeavor, to the greatest \n     extent possible, to empower the states to assume the lead \n     role in the Superfund process. An enhanced state role \n     recognizes that the states have a much greater day-to-day \n     involvement with their citizenry and are in a better position \n     to respond to the needs and desires of the affected \n     communities.\n       Sensible Cleanup Standards.--The goal of protecting human \n     health and the environment must remain at the forefront of \n     any Superfund reauthorization measure. Nonetheless, sensible \n     Superfund reform efforts recognize that our ability to clean \n     up some sites is constrained by both a technical inability to \n     provide permanent solutions, as well as a limitation on \n     national financial resource. Cleanup decisions should be \n     premised on a careful analysis of the potential risks to \n     human health and the environment, as well as a logical \n     balancing of financial expenditures on remedy selection.\n       Establish Fairer Liability Requirements.--When Superfund \n     was originally adopted in 1980, its primary purpose was to \n     clean up hazardous waste sites that threatened human health \n     and the environment. The adoption of retroactive liability to \n     pay for this program has unfairly penalized a number of \n     individuals and corporations that disposed of hazardous \n     materials in compliance with then existing federal and state \n     environmental laws. In addition, this liability system \n     created an incentive for litigation which has resulted in \n     slower cleanups and more money going to lawyers. The reform \n     of the Superfund should not only strive to lessen incentives \n     for litigation, but it should also result in a greater \n     percentage of money being dedicated towards cleaning up \n     sites.\n       Restoring Natural Resources.--The sole purpose of natural \n     resource damages is to provide for the rapid restoration and \n     replacement of significant natural resources that have been \n     damaged by contact with hazardous materials. Financial \n     compensation from persons who\n      caused these damages should be used solely for the purpose \n     of restoring or replacing these resources, and should not \n     serve as a means of seeking retribution or punitive \n     damages from potentially responsible parties.\n       Expedited Economic Reuse.--Although the original purpose of \n     Superfund was to provide for the quick cleanup of hazardous \n     waste sites, the Superfund cleanup process has resulted in \n     delayed site cleanups, economic uncertainty for affected \n     communities, and a disincentive for industry to redevelop so \n     called ``brownfield sites.'' Reform of Superfund should \n     provide incentives for the voluntary cleanup of industrial \n     sites and the expedited reutilization of urban areas to \n     promote rapid economic redevelopment and reuse.\n       The Future of Superfund.--Superfund was originally intended \n     to be a temporary program lasting for only a short period of \n     time. A comprehensive reform of Superfund should result in \n     meeting that goal. Over the next few years, this program \n     should be targeted towards completing the cleanup of the \n     Superfund sites remaining on the list, significantly reducing \n     the federal involvement, and allowing states to take the \n     primary role in the cleanup of our nation's hazardous waste \n     sites. While the Environmental Protection Agency should \n     continue to be involved in the emergency removal program and \n     research and development efforts, the eventual elimination of \n     the national priorities list should result in a system where \n     the states, and not the federal government, determine the \n     speed, method and order that hazardous waste sites will be \n     cleaned up.\n\n\n                     section iii--proposed reforms\n\n               1. Community Response Organizations (CROs)\n\n       A. Creation of CROs.--Under this title, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (``EPA'') or applicable state (see state \n     role below) will provide for the establishment of community \n     response organizations (``CROs'') to provide direct, regular \n     and meaningful consultation throughout the response action \n     process. CROs shall be established whenever: (1) the EPA or \n     the applicable state determines that such a group will be \n     helpful in the cleanup process; (2) when the local government \n     requests such an organization; (3) when 50 citizens, or at \n     least 20 percent of the population of a locality in which the \n     national priorities list (``NPL'') facility is located, \n     petition for a CRO; or (4) when a representative group of \n     potentially responsible parties (``PRPs'') request \n     establishment of a CRO.\n       B. CRO Activities.--CROs should comprise a broad cross-\n     section of the community, and its duties should include: (1) \n     serving as a forum to assist in gathering and transmitting \n     community concerns to the EPA, states, PRPs and other \n     Agencies on a variety of issues related to facility \n     remediation, including facility health studies, potential \n     remedial alternatives, and the selection and implementation \n     of remedial and removal action and land use; and (2) serve as \n     a resource for \n\n[[Page S 9876]]\n     transmitting site information back to the community. CROs shall be the \n     preferred recipients of any\n      technical assistance grant (``TAG''), and in addition, can \n     receive administrative assistance from the EPA and the \n     States.\n       C. CRO Participants.--A CRO shall have a membership not to \n     exceed 20 persons, who shall serve without pay. The EPA or \n     applicable state will solicit, accept nominations and select \n     the members of the CRO. The makeup of the CRO shall represent \n     a broad cross section of the local community, including \n     persons who are or historically have been adversely affected \n     by facility contamination in their community. Local residents \n     shall comprise no less than 50 percent of the total \n     membership of the CRO. Membership on the CRO will represent \n     the following groups:\n       1. persons residing or owning residential property near the \n     facility or persons who may be directly affected by releases \n     from the facility. At least one person in this group shall \n     represent the TAG recipient if such a grant has been awarded \n     prior to the formation of a CRO;\n       2. members of the local community who, although not \n     residing or owning property near the facility, may be \n     potentially affected by releases from the facility;\n       3. members of the local medical community and/or public \n     health officials;\n       4. representatives of local Indian tribes or local Indian \n     communities;\n       5. local representatives of citizen, environmental, or \n     public interest groups with members residing in the \n     community;\n       6. local government which may include pertinent city or \n     county governments;\n       7. workers employed at the facility during facility \n     operations;\n       8. facility owners;\n       9. representatives of potentially responsible parties, who \n     represent, wherever practicable, a balance of PRP interests; \n     and\n       10. members of the local business community.\n\n                    2. Enhancing the Role of States\n\n       A. Empowering the States to List and Delist Sites.--Section \n     105 would be modified to provide the states with sole \n     authority to veto the addition of any site that\n      the EPA proposes to add to the National Priorities List. \n     States would also be given the authority, with the \n     concurrence of the PRPs, to have sites taken off the NPL \n     to be managed under existing Resource Conservation and \n     Recovery Act (``RCRA'') authorities.\n       B. State Delegation for NPL Sites.--States would have the \n     option of receiving delegation for the cleanup of NPL sites \n     on either a site-by-site or statewide basis. Under this \n     provision, states would request the delegation of all NPL \n     sites within their state, or they could select specific sites \n     on a site-by-site basis, or the state could choose to assume \n     delegation of no sites.\n       States that choose to take NPL sites under this delegation \n     plan, would be required to utilize federal liability and \n     remedy selection procedures.\n       States that currently have authorization for a corrective \n     action program under RCRA, could submit a self-certificate of \n     competence to the EPA. Such certificate shall specify whether \n     the state seeks site-by-site or statewide delegation. The EPA \n     would be required to grant automatic certification of these \n     state programs.\n       States that do not have RCRA corrective action authority \n     would certify that they have the financial and personnel \n     resources, organization and expertise for carrying out the \n     implementation of the program. Within 90 days of the \n     submission of the state certification, the EPA would be \n     required to review the certification and determine if the \n     state's proposal was sufficient to run a delegated program. \n     At the end of 90 days, if the EPA failed to state an \n     objection to the state certification proposal, the delegation \n     would automatically take effect.\n       C. Sole State Control of Delegated Sites.--Once a state \n     receives its certification from the EPA, the state will have \n     the exclusive authority for implementing and enforcing the \n     federal Superfund program. Delegated states would have the \n     sole authority for implementing the program, including, but \n     not limited to, remedy selection, enforcement, as well as \n     activities under CERCLA sections 104, 106 and 107. The EPA's \n     periodic review of the state programs shall be limited to \n     auditing the state's use of program funds and a narrow \n     ability to decertify states that fail to materially conduct \n     enforcement and cleanup activities.\n       D. State Remedy Selection.--States that are delegated \n     Superfund authority would be required to apply cleanup \n     standards consistent with the federal Superfund program. Any \n     state with a delegated program could apply cleanup standards \n     more stringent than those required under the federal program, \n     however, the state would be required to bear the additional \n     costs of such remedies rather than the Trust Fund or the \n     PRPs.\n       E. Non-Superfund Sites.--The states would be authorized to \n     conduct cleanup activities for all facilities that are not on \n     the Superfund list. This would include, with\n      the exception of the 90 sites added under this proposal, all \n     of the sites which are currently on the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability \n     Information System (``CERCLIS'') list.\n       F. Voluntary Cleanup Programs.--In addition to delegated \n     authorities outlined above, state could also seek expedited \n     EPA approval of state voluntary response programs. Under this \n     provision, a state would be able to establish voluntary \n     cleanups at hazardous waste sites with the exception of the \n     following: (1) portions of NPL sites for which a ROD has been \n     issued; (2) portions of sites where RCRA subtitle C plans \n     have been submitted and closure requirements have been \n     specified in a plan or permit; (3) portions of sites where \n     corrective action permits or orders have been issued, \n     modified, or amended to require specific corrective measures \n     pursuant to RCRA sections 3004 or 3008; (4) portions of sites \n     controlled by or to be remediated by, a department agency, or \n     instrumentality of the executive branch of the federal \n     government; or (5) portions of a site where assistance for \n     response activities may be obtained pursuant to subtitle I of \n     RCRA from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund.\n       G. State Assistance Grants.--An appropriate level of \n     assistance grants should be provided to the states over a 3 \n     year period to build and enhance state Superfund program \n     capabilities. Additional block-grant funding shall also be \n     provided for voluntary and non-CERCLA cleanups that are \n     administered and conducted by the states.\n\n                      3. National Priorities List\n\n       A. Flexible Cap.--Amend Section 105 to provide that the EPA \n     would be allowed to add a total of thirty (30) new sites to \n     the NPL each year for three (3) years following passage of \n     the bill. The EPA would be required to determine and \n     prioritize, on a national basis, which 90 sites present the \n     greatest threat to human health and the environment. These \n     sites would be added to the NPL only upon concurrence from \n     the associated state (see State Role below).\n       B. Sunset Provision.--Three years from the enactment of \n     this legislation, the EPA would not be authorized to add any \n     additional sites to the NPL. At the completion of cleanup at \n     sites remaining on the capped NPL, the EPA authority shall be \n     limited of providing a national emergency response \n     capability, conducting research and development, providing \n     technical assistance, and conducting oversight of grant \n     programs to the states.\n       C. Expedited Delisting.--Amend Section 105 to provide that \n     sites shall be delisted once the construction of the selected \n     remedy is certified as complete. An informal rulemaking shall \n     be completed 90 days after the passage of the act outlining \n     the process through which expedited delisting shall take \n     place. If the implemented remedy\n      includes institutional or engineering controls, then the EPA \n     or the applicable state should conduct a review of the \n     site every 5 years. Delisting shall in no way relieve the \n     EPA or the applicable state regulators from conducting \n     ongoing cleanup activities, monitoring or post-cleanup \n     operations and maintenance requirements.\n\n                          4. Remedy Selection\n\n       A. Enhanced Cleanup Flexibility.--Amend section 121(b) to \n     eliminate the preferences for permanence and treatment in \n     selecting a remedy at Superfund sites. The EPA shall be \n     directed to consider all options for addressing contamination \n     at a site including, containment, treatment, institutional \n     controls, natural attenuation, or a combination of these \n     alternatives, and select the remedy that protects human \n     health and the environment at the lowest cost. The remedy \n     selected shall recognize the limitations of currently \n     available technology.\n       Interim containment and remediation shall be used at sites \n     where no current technology is available to remediate sites \n     to the containment levels necessary to protect human health \n     and the environment. Interim remedies shall be preferred \n     where: (1) other treatment remedies are available only at a \n     disproportionate cost; (2) innovative treatment technologies \n     will be available within a ``reasonable time'' (3-5 years); \n     and (3) the threat can be contained during the interim time \n     period. The EPA or the applicable state shall review the \n     interim containment plan every five years after the date of \n     construction to determine if a continued threat to human \n     health the environment warrants a modification of the interim \n     containment remedy.\n       B. Revise the ARAR Mandate.--Amend section 121(d) to \n     eliminate the requirement that remedial actions must meet \n     applicable, relevant and appropriate requirements \n     (``ARARs''). Instead, allow the EPA and the applicable states \n     to utilize remedies that are more responsive to the specific \n     site conditions and risks.\n       C. Protection of Human Health.--Amend section 121 to \n     specify that selective remedies should be protective of human \n     health and the environment. Remedies shall be judged to be \n     protective of the environment if they (1) protect against \n     significant risks to ecological resources which are necessary \n     to the sustainability of a significant or valuable ecosystem \n     and (2) do not interfere with a sustainable functional \n     ecosystem that is consistent with the targeted land use. The \n     objective is protection of human health and the environment \n     from realistic and significant risks through cost-effective \n     and cost-effective remedies.\n       D. Requiring an Unbiased Risk Based Analysis.--Amend \n     section 121 to require that risk-based decisionmaking be \n     utilized to: (1) identify the principal elements of potential \n     risk posed by the site, and any cumulative effects posted by \n     adjacent NPL\n      sites; (2) analyze the relative health and environmental \n     benefits of alternative remedies and (3) demonstrate that \n     the approved remedy will protect human health and \n     environment in light \n\n[[Page S 9877]]\n     of the actual or planned future use of the land and water resources. \n     The tools that the EPA or applicable state would be \n     required to utilize in making this risk assessment would \n     include:\n       1. actual or plausible exposure pathways based on actual or \n     planned future use of the land and water resources \n     (industrial, commercial, residential, etc.);\n       2. site-specific data shall be used in preference to \n     default assumptions; and\n       3. where site-specific data are unavailable, utilize an \n     acceptable range and distribution of realistic and plausible \n     default assumptions regarding actual or likely human \n     exposures and site-specific conditions, instead of high-end \n     or worst case assumptions.\n       E. Planning for Future Land and Water Use.--Amend section \n     121(b)(1) to require EPA or the applicable state to quantify \n     the actual or planned future use of the contaminated land and \n     water resources based on a mix of several factors including: \n     (1) previous use of the landholdings; (2) site analysis and \n     surrounding land use patterns; (3) current zoning \n     requirements and projected future land uses; and (4) input \n     from CROs, elected municipal and county officials, local \n     planning and zoning authorities, facility owners and \n     potentially responsible parties. The EPA or the applicable \n     state shall then utilize the balancing factors listed below \n     in selecting a remedy:\n       F. Reasonable Remedy Selection.--Amend section 121(b)(1) to \n     require the EPA or the applicable state to select the most \n     effective remedy that protects human health and the \n     environment, unless the remedy is technically infeasible or \n     the incremental costs are not reasonably related to the \n     incremental benefits. The following balancing factors should \n     be utilized in determining the most sensible, cost effective \n     remedy:\n       1. the effectiveness of the remedy to protect human health \n     and the environment;\n       2. reliability of the remedy to protect human health and \n     the environment over the long-term;\n       3. any short-term risks posed by implementation of the \n     remedy to the affected community, and to remediation workers;\n       4. the relative implementability and technical feasibility \n     of the remedy; and\n       5. acceptability of the remedy to the affected community.\n       G. Establishing Reasonable Groundwater Cleanup \n     Strategies.--Section 121 should be amended to require that \n     remedy selection for groundwater should include a \n     consideration of the current and future use of the resource, \n     including both the nature and timing of uses. The remedy \n     selection should consider a range of possible remedies \n     including pump and treat, point of use treatment, containment \n     and natural attenuation. The application of the possible \n     remedies shall be weighed against the balancing factors \n     outlined in section F (above) to determine the most cost \n     effective remedy that protects human health and the \n     environment that is not technically infeasible or where the \n     incremental costs are not reasonably related to the \n     incremental benefits. The type and timing of the resource \n     use, technical feasibility and reasonableness of cost shall \n     also be considered where the contamination threatens \n     uncontaminated, usable groundwater.\n       H. Enhancing Emergency Response.--Amend section 104 to \n     increase the duration of Emergency Response actions to 24 \n     months, and increase the authorized cap to $4 million per \n     site. Provide increased flexibility to emergency response \n     managers to conduct removal and cleanup activities beyond the \n     currently authorized level, where such action may \n     significantly reduce or eliminate the necessity for further \n     remedial activities at such a site.\n       I. Reviewing Past Remedy Decisions.--At sites where a \n     record of decision (``ROD'') has not been signed, the EPA or \n     the applicable state shall apply the remedy cleanup \n     provisions contained within this bill. At sites where a ROD \n     has been signed, but where construction has not begun, the \n     EPA, the applicable state or the PRP can request a review of \n     the ROD to determine if the remedy reform changes contained \n     within the bill would result in a lower cost remedy that \n     protects human health and the environment than the one being \n     proposed. At sites where construction has begun, or where \n     construction has been completed, the EPA or applicable state \n     may conduct and implement a modification of the ROD where the \n     EPA or applicable state or the RPR can demonstrate that the \n     changes in remedy selection contained in the bill would \n     result in a total life cycle cost reduction of at least 10 \n     percent. Under no circumstances could a review of a ROD \n     result in the selection of more costly remedies, nor would \n     there be any reimbursement for past costs. Appropriate \n     limitations would be placed on this review process to limit \n     the potential for additional litigation.\n\n                         5. Liability Standards\n\n       A. Repeal Retroactive Liability for Pre-1981 Disposal.--\n     Amend section 107 to provide that no person shall be held \n     liable for the removal or response costs related to\n      hazardous substance disposal at non-federal NPL sites that \n     occurred prior to December 11, 1980. Such costs shall be \n     paid from the Hazardous Substance Superfund (``the \n     Fund''). For those sites where disposal occurred both \n     prior to and after December 11, 1980, the fund would \n     utilize an independent allocator who would apportion the \n     liability for this pre- and post-1980 disposal. Such \n     allocator would also determine the proportionate level of \n     liability for post-1980 disposal as is described below. \n     Retroactive liability repeal would not apply to federal \n     liability that occurred at nonfederal facility NPL sites. \n     This retroactive repeal program would include a mechanism \n     to ensure that PRPs remain on the site to conduct the \n     cleanup program.\n       The fund would also assume the costs of any ongoing \n     operations and maintenance costs (``O) for the \n     proportionate level of pre-1981 disposal activities. The \n     independent allocation process mentioned earlier would also \n     determine the level of pre- and post-1980 liability for \n     ongoing O for any facilities that were in construction or \n     had completed construction prior to the passage of this act.\n       The fund would also assume that proportionate level of \n     liability for pre-1981 disposal activities at those \n     facilities where construction was underway at the time of the \n     act, but where the payment for that construction had not been \n     completed. In addition, the fund shall reimburse PRPs for \n     construction payments made after June 15, 1995, where such \n     activity was incurred to address pre-1981 liability. At PRP \n     led sites, the PRP shall remain responsible for conducting \n     cleanup activities, but shall be reimbursed from the fund \n     consistent with the principles outlined above.\n       B. Proportionate Liability for Post-1980 Disposal.--Section \n     107 would be amended to create a proportionate liability \n     scheme for removal costs, response costs and NRD at non-\n     federal facilities at which hazardous substances were \n     released. Such proportionate liability system would utilize \n     an independent allocator that would determine the appropriate \n     level of liability of each party currently liable under \n     section 107(a) of the existing law.\n       No person shall be held liable for more than the share of \n     removal, response or natural resource damage (``NRD'') costs \n     attributable to that person's conduct. In determining the \n     person's proportionate share of liability, the following \n     factors shall be considered: (1) the amount of hazardous \n     substances contributed by each party; (2) the toxicity of the \n     hazardous substances involved; (3) the mobility the \n     materials; (4) the degree of involvement of each party in the \n     generation, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal \n     of the hazardous substances; (5) the degree of care \n     exercised, taking into account the hazards posed by the \n     material; (6) the degree of cooperation with federal, state \n     and local officials; and (7) any other equitable factors as \n     the allocator determines are appropriate.\n       At non-federal sites, the fund shall pay the costs of \n     ``orphan shares,'' which shall be defined to include the \n     shares attributed to bankrupt or dissolved parties, as well \n     as\n      shares that cannot be attributed to any party due to \n     insufficient proof. Any PRP unwilling to pay its allocated \n     share can be sued by EPA for all unrecovered costs at the \n     site, including any orphan shares and de micromis shares. \n     Thus, non-settlors may be held liable for the orphan \n     shares and de micromis shares in addition to their own \n     shares. Settling parties would receive complete \n     contribution protection.\n       C. De Micromis Disposal Exclusion.--Amend section 107 to \n     provide an exception from liability for certain parties who \n     arranged for, or accepted for, disposal, treatment, or \n     transport of municipal solid waste which contained not more \n     than 110 gallons of liquid materials containing hazardous \n     waste, or not more than 200 pounds of solid materials \n     containing hazardous waste.\n       D. Lender Liability.--Amend CERCLA to limit the liability \n     of lenders or lessors that: acquire property through \n     foreclosure; hold a security interest in the property; hold \n     property as a lessor pursuant to an extension of credit; or \n     exercise financial control pursuant to the terms of an \n     extension of credit. This section would limit the lenders \n     potential liability to the gain in property value resulting \n     from another party's response action to a release or \n     threatened release. A lender would still be liable if it had \n     caused the damage, release or threat.\n       1. Fiduciary Activities.--The liability of fiduciaries \n     would be limited to the excess of the assets held in the \n     fiduciary capacity that are available for indemnity. \n     Nonetheless, fiduciaries may be held liable for failure to \n     exercise due care which causes or contributes to the release \n     of hazardous materials. In addition, a fiduciary could be \n     held liable for independent actions taken or ownership of \n     properties unrelated to their fiduciary capacity.\n       2. Owner Operator Definition.--Amend section 101(20) \n     Superfund to provide that the term owner or operator does not \n     include a person who does not participate in management but \n     holds indicia of ownership to protect the security interests \n     of others, nor does it include a person who does not \n     participate in management of the facility prior to \n     foreclosure.\n       3. Participation in Management.--Amend section 101(20) of \n     Superfund to provide that ``participation in management'' \n     means actually participating in the management or operation \n     affairs of a vessel or facility, and does not include merely \n     having the capacity to influence, or the unexercised right to \n     control, vessel of facility operations.\n       E. Response Action Contractor Liability.--(``RACs'') Amend \n     section 119 of the Act to provide a negligence standard for \n     activities undertaken by RACs. In addition, amend section \n     101(2) to provide that ``owner and operator'' does not \n     include in persons performing on written contracts to provide \n     response action activities.\n\n[[Page S 9878]]\n\n       F. Other Small Business Liability.--There are a variety of \n     other CERCLA liability concerns that have been raised by \n     small business that have not been outlined in this \n     legislative specifications paper. Nonetheless, such concerns \n     are intended to be addressed within the context of a \n     comprehensive CERCLA reform measure.\n\n                         6. Federal Facilities\n\n       A. Enhanced State Delegation.--Qualified states could be \n     delegated CERCLA authority at Federally owned or Federally \n     operated facilities, consistent with certification \n     requirements described above.\n       Delegation would be contingent upon: (1) states applying \n     identical clean up standards and processes at Federal sites \n     as are applied to non-Federal sites, (2) allowing \n     uncontaminated or cleaned up parcels of property to be reused \n     as rapidly as possible, and (3) applying a definition of \n     uncontaminated property that includes property where \n     hazardous materials were stored but not released.\n       The Department of Energy's Defense Nuclear Facilities where \n     the federal government is the sole PRP would remain under the \n     jurisdiction of the EPA. In addition, a limited number of \n     Department of Defense sites with exceedingly complex \n     environmental contamination would also remain under the \n     jurisdiction of the EPA.\n       A risk-based prioritization processes, consistent with \n     remedy selection criteria described above, will be utilized \n     to rank proposed actions at federal facility operable units. \n     Existing Federal Facility Compliance Agreements would be \n     renegotiated based on the identified priorities. These \n     agreements would form the basis by which federal facilities \n     would be regulated by the EPA or the applicable states.\n       B. Clarifying Radionuclide Regulation.--A minimum standard \n     for radionuclides would be established. Such standard would \n     also account for naturally occurring radioactive materials \n     (``NORM'').\n       C. Promoting Innovative Technology.--The use of Federal \n     facilities to encourage and promote innovative cleanup \n     technology that can be used at Superfund sites would be \n     authorized. EPA would be required to develop an expedited \n     permitting process to collect cost and performance data on \n     new characterization, cleanup and waste management \n     approaches.\n\n                      7. Natural Resource Damages\n\n       A. Recoverable Damages.--Amend section 107 to provide that \n     natural resource damages shall only be recoverable for actual \n     injury to measurable, and ecologically\n      significant functions of the environment that were committed \n     to allocated to public use at the time of the conduct \n     giving rise to the damage. The recovery shall be limited \n     to the reasonable cost of restoring, rehabilitating or \n     acquiring a substitute or alternative resource as well as \n     the cost of assessing damages to that resource. With the \n     exception of direct monetary damages resulting from a lost \n     use of the natural resource, there shall be no recovery \n     for lost use or non-use damages.\n       B. Liability Cap.--Amend section 107 to clarify that no \n     natural resource damage liability shall result from \n     activities where the release or releases of hazardous \n     substances occurred prior to 1980. Where the placement of \n     hazardous materials occurred prior to 1980, but where \n     additional releases resulting from that placement occurred \n     after 1980, the PRP shall be liable for post-1980 releases \n     with a total potential liability not to exceed 50 percent of \n     the amount spent on remedial action. Where the placement of \n     materials occurred both before and after 1980, and where the \n     release or releases of hazardous substances occurred after \n     1980, the total potential liability of the PRP shall not \n     exceed 75 percent of the amount spent on remedial action. \n     Where the placement and release of the hazardous materials \n     occurred wholly after 1980, the total potential liability of \n     the PRP shall not exceed 100 percent of the amount spent on \n     medial action.\n       C. Evidentiary Standard.--Amend section 107 to eliminate \n     the rebuttable presumption in favor of trustee assessments \n     for any natural resource damages claim in excess of $2 \n     million. For all claims in excess of $2 million, the trustee \n     shall establish all elements of the NRD claim by a \n     preponderance of the evidence, which shall be reviewed de \n     novo by a court, upon petition of any party who is \n     potentially liable for NRD at the site.\n       D. Natural Recovery.--Amend section 107 to require that \n     trustees shall give equal consideration to actions that \n     promote the use of natural recovery as an acceptable \n     alternative to replicating the precise physical, chemical, \n     and biological properties of resources prior to injury.\n       E. Cost Considerations.--Amend section 107 to require that \n     restoration alternatives should include a consideration of \n     the most cost effective method of achieving the restoration \n     objective (i.e., the restoration, replacement or acquisition \n     of ecologically significant resource functions) and not \n     solely the replication of the resource.\n       F. Cleanup Consistency.--Amend section 107 to require that \n     the NRD restoration standards and restoration alternatives \n     selected by a trustee shall not be duplicative of, or \n     inconsistent with, actions undertaken pursuant to sections \n     104, 106 and 121 of the act. In addition, trustees should be \n     involved early in the remedy selection process to ensure \n     consistency between resource restoration and cleanup \n     activities.\n       G. Double Recovery.--Amend section 107(f) to provide that \n     there shall be no recovery for NRD under Section 107 if \n     compensation has already been provided pursuant to CERCLA or \n     any other federal or state law.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana, [Mr. Johnston] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nagreed to and that a motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Was that reached, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico object?\n  Mr. DOLE. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 1517) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would ask the Senator from Arizona how long he \nwould like to take. We have an amendment that is pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If there is a pending amendment and the managers are \ninterested in moving forward, I will withdraw that unanimous-consent \nrequest, if it is the will of the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand there is no amendment \npending; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from New Mexico is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will let me send \nan amendment to the desk, and then I will be glad to yield 10 minutes \nto him.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1533 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n (Purpose: To facilitate small business involvement in the regulatory \n              development process, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Bond and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mr. Bond, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1533 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have cleared this request with Senator \nLautenberg and with Senator Lott.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when an amendment by Senator Lautenberg, \nwhich deletes the language of the toxic release inventory, is \nconsidered, that there be 1 hour evenly divided; that no second-degree \namendments be in order; and that there be a vote up or down on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico still has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to Senator McCain 10 minutes, if the Senate \nwill permit me to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to yield 10 \nminutes, and when he finishes, the floor be returned to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico to debate the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona. \n\n[[Page S 9879]]\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have the floor. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GLENN. I want to ask a question of Senator Domenici. Would he be \nwilling to enter into a time agreement?\n  Mr. DOLE. Will there be any second-degree amendments on Domenici?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say to Senator Levin, this has nothing to do \nwith toxic matters, nothing to do with that part.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if the Senator from Arizona will yield to me \na moment, we would like to get a time agreement on the Domenici \namendment and then whatever we work out on the Lautenberg amendment. We \nwould like to have a window of opportunity from 7 until 8 where there \nwill be no votes. So if we can have one vote before 7, and then any \nother votes will be after 8 o'clock. Maybe we can work that out during \nthe 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wanted to ask the distinguished majority leader why we \ncould not just work ahead and not have a window of opportunity?\n  Mr. DOLE. You mean work right on through?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will both be here. That will be all right with me. I \nthink it is going to work out that way. I do not know how much time the \nSenator from New Jersey would want. If we reach an agreement, I think \nit is going to be about an hour on each amendment. I am perfectly \nwilling to continue to operate without any window, but a number of my \ncolleagues have obligations away from the Capitol. Obviously, the \nimportant thing is to finish the bill. That is the most important \nthing.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Without the time being charged to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona, without his losing his right to the floor.\n  I can understand the desire of Senators to have a window, but there \nare some of us who understand that we have to stay here. We do not have \nany obligations away from the Hill. I have a wife and my little dog, \nBilly, at home. I would like to get home a little more often a little \nearlier. These windows of opportunities keep us here, those of us who \nare willing to, they keep us here in order to accommodate a few who \nwant to run hither, thither, and yon, perhaps for good reason. But it \ndelays the rest of us from getting the work done and getting home.\n  At the same time when we have these windows of opportunities, who \nstays around here and listens to the Senators talk? This is a poor way \nto do business. I do not say this critically of the majority leader, \nbecause I have been the leader on previous occasions. I just hope we \nwould not fall into a habit here of having these windows of \nopportunities and keeping others here who are willing to stay here and \nwork and get home and know what is being said by Senators who take the \nfloor for debate.\n  Mr. DOLE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from West \nVirginia, my friend. I think someone said 2 hours would do. I said, no, \nan hour should be adequate. Maybe that will not happen. Obviously, the \nimportant thing is to finish this bill. I think we have made some \nprogress here, hopefully, this afternoon. If we can have time \nagreements, if they are less than an hour, there will be less than an \nhour window. I will work with the Senator from West Virginia. My little \ndog, Leader, misses me and your old dog Billy, we have not gotten them \ntogether yet.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if the leader will yield, Senator \nLautenberg has a request for a 1-hour time agreement. That would be a \ngood 1-hour window right there.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will Senator Dole under the same unanimous consent agree \nto another comment? Will the leader yield? We also have Senator \nFeingold. I just want to get it out so people know how many possible \nvotes we have. Senator Feingold has an amendment. We have a couple of \nother Senators who may want to bring up amendments tonight.\n  Mr. GLENN. Senator Pryor has one also.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I just want everybody to be aware.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator from Arizona will yield to me one additional \nmoment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Could I have 20 seconds here? All of these agreements on \nwho is going to come up with whatever, all the agreements on time are \ngoing to be contingent on not having second-degree amendments. I think \nwe can work out time agreements or an agreement not to have second-\ndegree amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. I cannot speak for anybody on that. I do not have any \namendments. Others on either side may wish to reserve that right. It is \nmy understanding the other side cannot agree to any vote before 7:15. \nSomebody on that side must already be out the window.\n  So we would be happy to try to work it out. We can have two votes at \n8 o'clock. If we can get agreements on the Domenici and Lautenberg \namendments, we can do it at 8 o'clock.\n  Mr. GLENN. Senator Lautenberg can accept a time agreement, but not if \nthere is restriction on second-degrees.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand it, we cannot give that assurance.\n  Mr. GLENN. OK. So there will not be any time agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. What about Domenici, is that subject to second-degree?\n  Mr. GLENN. We are still going through Domenici to see what is in it.\n  Mr. DOLE. Why do we not let Senator McCain proceed? I think he has a \nvery important statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9856-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9879-S9880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ATROCITIES IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not know how many of my colleagues \nsaw the picture on the front page of the New York Times this morning. \nIt is an unusual and historic picture. When you first look at it, all \nyou see is a group of refugees. If you look a little closer, you will \nsee men in military uniform. Those men are part of what has been called \nthe U.N. Protection Force. They are standing by observing men being \ntaken out of Srebrenica who are suspected, by Bosnian Serb forces of \n``war crimes,'' young women being taken out for purposes that I cannot \ndescribe, old women and children who are starving to death and being \nforced to walk unknown distances.\n  Rather than describe it in my words, let me just read:\n\n       In what has been a ritual of previous ``ethnic cleansing'' \n     campaigns by the Bosnian Serbs to rid territories of Muslim \n     populations, the Serbs who took Srebrenica separated the \n     military-age men from the refugees and said they would be \n     ``screened for war crimes,'' a United Nations spokesman here \n     said.\n      The air was filled with anguished cries as the Bosnian Serbs \n     loaded the first 3,000 women, children and elderly . . .\n\n  Mr. President, we have gone from a situation where the Europeans were \nsupposed to be protecting people to now sitting by and watching \natrocities and war crimes being perpetrated before their very eyes. And \nthey stand by helpless. What could possibly be the effect throughout \nthe world of scenes such as this?\n  Mr. President, as Senator Dole said in his recent statement, it is \nover. It is over, Mr. President.\n  ``It was quite a horrifying scene,'' said Steven Oberreit of Doctors \nWithout Borders. ``There was screaming and crying and panic. They \ndidn't know where they were being taken to.''\n\n       The refugees fled to Potocari on Tuesday night after \n     Bosnian Serb troops swept into the town of Srebrenica, the \n     heart of the United Nations safe area . . .\n       Today, 1,500 Bosnian Serb troops, backed by tanks . . . \n     overran the base with no resistance after they threatened to \n     shell the refugees and kill the Dutch peacekeepers they were \n     holding hostage if NATO warplanes intervened.\n\n  Mr. President, we have crossed the line from danger to humiliation. \nWe have crossed the line from attempts to do the right thing to \ndegradation and dishonor.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow this to continue. And if events follow \nunchecked, next will be the enclave of Zepa, and then Gorazde, and \nnext \n\n[[Page S 9880]]\n\nmaybe even Sarajevo. Mr. President, it is time they got out, and it is \ntime we helped them out, and it is time we help the Bosnian Muslims \ndefend themselves.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. McCAIN.  Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am glad to hear the Senator on the floor \nspeaking to this. Would the Senator acknowledge what everybody forgets? \nI know the Senator is angry about it, as well. I want to remind \neverybody that the reason why the U.N. observers are there is that the \nUnited Nations went in and disarmed--disarmed--not only did we fail to \nallow the Bosnian Government to get arms, the arms that existed, we \nwent into Srebrenica--the United Nations did, with our support--and \ndisarmed the Bosnian Government, disarmed the Muslims, disarmed the \nCroats, in return for a promise that we would protect them. And when, \nin fact, it was clear and the Dutch were called in for air strikes by \nNATO, Mr. Akashi said no.\n  I want everybody to remember what the Senator from Arizona is saying \nhere. Not only did we not protect, we affirmatively--the United Nations \nand the West--disarmed those safe areas, took their weapons and said, \n``We promise you in return that we will keep the Serbs from the door.'' \nBut they knocked on the door, knocked it down, and there was nothing \nthere for them to defend themselves with.\n  Now, as the Senator from Arizona said, they stand by and watch. And \nit is not the fault of those Dutch blue helmets. It is the fault of the \ncontact group. It is the fault of the West for failing to intervene, at \na minimum with air power, significant air power. But I think the \nSenator is absolutely correct. This is an atrocity. We should lift the \nembargo immediately and we should make available what, under the law, \nthe President is allowed to do.\n  Two years ago, this Senate and Congress passed a piece of legislation \nauthorizing the President, in his discretion, to make available up to \n50 million dollars worth of weapons off the shelf now for those people.\n  I stood in Tuzla the last time this happened and watched trucks come \ninto Tuzla loaded with women and children, and I thought they were \ncelebrating when I first saw them because they were holding up children \nin these dump trucks above their heads. As they unloaded the dump \ntrucks, I understood why the children were being held above their heads \nand held outside of the dump truck. Do you know why, Mr. President? \nBecause when they opened the gate and got out, there were three \nchildren smothered to death in the bottom of those 1995 versions of \ncattle cars being dragged into Auschwitz. If these were not Moslems, \nthe world would be reacting, just like if it were not Jews in the \nthirties, the world would react. Shame on the West.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted \nan additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the emotion of my friend from \nDelaware. I appreciate his compassion. I think the challenge before us \nnow is to try to devise, working with the administration, a way to end \nthis tragedy as quickly as possible for a minimum loss of human life, \nrecognizing at this point that there are no good options. There are no \ngood options in Bosnia today. What we need to do is choose the least \nbad option if we expect to stop this ongoing tragedy.\n  The reason I pointed out this picture again--this is the first time, \nI think, in history we have ever seen a picture of people who are in \nuniform, designated as peacekeepers, standing by and watching people \nbeing ethnically cleansed, mass rape, and, of course, the arrest and \nprobable torture of young men. That is what the U.N. Protection Force \nhas been reduced to. That is why, in my view, this was ill-conceived \nand flawed from the beginning--because it was an attempt to keep peace \nwhere there was no peace.\n  I wanted to give some facts as to how bad the situation is. Let me \npoint out that I believe the United States should be prepared to assist \nin the effort to help remove the United Nations protection force and \nremove U.N. and allied forces from Bosnia. I want to just lay out the \ncriteria. I hope at some time we can have a significant debate and \ndiscussion of this issue, possibly as early as next week. But I want to \nlay out the following criteria, because we have to be clear.\n  The operation must be conducted under U.S. or NATO command. It must \nhave a clear mission objective, precluding any danger of mission creep, \nand the operational rules of engagement must be established and \napproved by NATO. Under no circumstances should the United Nations be \npermitted to participate in any way in the planning or implementation \nof a withdrawal operation. To allow any U.N. influence would be to risk \nthe same failed policies from which UNPROFOR so clearly suffers. To \nallow U.N. participation in command decisions would be to risk \nrepeating the gutless refusal to destroy Serb air defenses, a U.N. \ndecision which led to the shootdown of an American F-16 last month.\n  Mr. President, the administration has committed 25,000 U.S. forces as \npart of an evacuation force. Once again, we must recognize that we must \nbe willing to devote whatever forces in support that are necessary to \nsuccessfully complete the mission--an overwhelming force to guarantee \nthe safety of our men and women in uniform and those of our allies.\n  Finally, Mr. President, clear warnings must be issued to all parties \ninvolved in the Bosnian conflict. Should one American be injured or \nkilled while participating in a withdrawal operation, the United States \nwill not hesitate to use its military might to punish such aggression.\n  I would like to be specific. If the Bosnian Serbs harm Americans \nwhile this rescue operation is going on, I suggest the most punishing \nair strikes imaginable, and going as far away as Belgrade, if \nnecessary.\n  Mr. President, it is our obligation morally to rescue the U.N. \nProtection Forces. It is also our moral obligation to do everything \nnecessary to protect the lives of our young men and women who are \ninvolved in that operation,\n and make the cost so extremely high that we can guarantee to a \nsignificant degree the safety of those men and women.\n\n  Every day UNPROFOR stays, every hostage that is taken, every attack \non the safe areas, every strategically ineffectual air strike and every \nsortie that has no mission but returns safely to base, creates the \nperception of a feeble Western alliance.\n  Every day UNPROFOR is in place is another day that the Bosnian \nGovernment forces are precluded from protecting themselves against Serb \naggression. Remove UNPROFOR, lift the arms embargo and allow the people \nof Bosnia to fight for their future.\n  Unfortunately, harsh, cold, military facts will resolve this \nconflict. One side will prevail. I hope it is the lawful government of \nBosnia. I find it very troubling that we have interfered with these \nrealities to the benefit of the aggressor, by imposing an arms embargo \non the victim. If we are unwilling to commit American forces to defend \nBosnians, we cannot in good faith prevent the Bosnians from defending \nthemselves.\n  I want to thank Senator Dole for his proposal on this issue. I hope \nthat next week we will take up this issue as soon as possible. Every \nhour that we delay, more innocent people will die. Every hour that we \ndelay, will mean more humiliation and degradation of the United Nations \nand NATO. The repercussions of this kind of dishonor will reverberate \naround the world. We must bring it to a halt.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first let me commend my colleague from \nArizona for his eloquent statement and my colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Biden. I certainly share the views they both expressed this \nevening.\n  This is a tragedy I do not believe we will be able to measure for a \nlong, long time. It will have an impact on the West for decades. I hope \nwe can take up the Bosnia resolution as early as next Wednesday or \nTuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9879-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9880-S9902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill. \n\n[[Page S 9881]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we are trying to get some order so Members \nwill know precisely what will happen.\n  As I understand, Senator Domenici is prepared to offer an amendment, \nand he is prepared to enter into a time agreement. That cannot be done \nuntil Senator Glenn has an opportunity to look at the amendment. We are \nnot certain whether or not there will be a second-degree amendment.\n  I am advised that we can now deal with the Lautenberg amendment \nwithout a second-degree amendment, and it will be 1 hour equally \ndivided.\n  I ask unanimous consent when Senator Lautenberg offers his amendment, \nNo. 1535, that no amendments be in order, that there be 1 hour for \ndebate to be equally divided in the usual form, and when the Senate \nvotes, the vote occur on or in relation to the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I shall not object. Is it \npossible we could set a precise time on the Lautenberg vote?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is what we are trying to work out. We will not take up \nthe Lautenberg amendment, I assume, for another 20 minutes, so the vote \nwill not come until the end of that hour.\n  We hope we get an agreement on the Domenici amendment, also on the \nFeingold amendment, and also on an amendment by Senator Pryor.\n  We are looking at the Feingold amendment. We did not have a copy of \nSenator Pryor's amendment.\n  If we can start getting these agreements, I can advise my colleagues \nwhen we will have the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I guess I \nam not clear.\n  The majority leader, then, would not be prepared to set a time for \nthe vote on the Lautenberg amendment until we know whether we can \nsequence more amendments and determine from that whether we might be \nable to sequence, then, the votes following consideration of all the \namendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct. There have been a couple of suggestions \nmade. One, that we can sequence four or five amendments and have all \nthe votes tomorrow morning.\n  We would be here this evening debating the amendments, and those who \nhad other plans or just wanted to frankly do something else, that they \nwould be free to do that this evening. We would have votes tomorrow \nmorning.\n  I think that is what we are trying to put together. There are four \namendments we are aware of. I think the Senator from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, has an amendment. We are trying to contact her.\n  I think fairly soon we will have the Glenn amendment, the big \namendment, the substitute amendment, which I assume will probably take \nsome time to debate on that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Leader, I have one on the OSHA provisions, and I \nwould be glad to enter into a time limit tomorrow if we are sequencing. \nI would be glad to be in touch with the floor manager staff. We will \nmake a copy available.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are many amendments that are outstanding. I just am \nwondering whether or not the majority leader was suggesting that there \nwas just that limited few amendments that were still outstanding, \nbecause there are many, many.\n  Mr. DOLE. I hope the number is not too large. I know there are a \nnumber of amendments.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If the distinguished majority leader would yield, I have \nan amendment. I think it could possibly even be accepted by both sides. \nI am not certain.\n  Even if it has to be debated and voted on, I would agree to 30 \nminutes time, 15 minutes equally divided, sometime tomorrow, and no \nsecond-degree amendments to be offered.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand, we have a copy of that amendment, and I \nwill have Senator Hatch and Senator Roth look at it.\n  I would hope that even if we reach some agreements that Members with \namendments would stay tonight and try to dispose of those amendments. \nThey may be acceptable or reaching some agreement, where we could have \nthe vote, if not tonight, sometime tomorrow morning.\n  I think there is good-faith effort on the part of the leaders to keep \nthis bill moving. I think we have gone over a couple of large hurdles \nthis afternoon. If we can make some progress this evening, even though \nthere might not be any votes after a certain point, we could still stay \nhere. The managers are anxious to be here late tonight, to deal with \namendments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader would yield, would it not be in \nthe interest, for the benefit of those who are waiting to offer \namendments, to at least provide a sequence? We have Senator Domenici \nprepared to go now, and then Senator Lautenberg immediately after that. \nIf it would be appropriate then for Senator Feingold and Senator Pryor \nto follow Senator Lautenberg --if we know the sequence perhaps we could \nthen----\n  Mr. DOLE. I make that request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, what we intend to do is \nto speak for 20 minutes on our side on this Domenici amendment, giving \nyour side a chance to look at it.\n  We will yield the floor and then permit going to Senator Lautenberg. \nThat hour will elapse and then by that time your staff can have looked \nat ours, we will come back to it and finish it--whether it is 10 \nminutes, 20 minutes--and then of course you can go to the next one.\n  So that is understood as the sequencing for the conclusion of the \nDomenici amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That was my understanding, that we were going to set \naside the Domenici amendment in order to accommodate the other \namendments, and come back to the Domenici amendment after we had a \nchance to look at it.\n  Mr. DOLE. Following the Pryor amendment, the amendment by Senator \nHutchison, an amendment on reasonable reliance.\n  If I could renew that request, that following the debate by Senator \nDomenici, 20 minutes, we then move to the Lautenberg amendment, and \nafter completion of debate on the Lautenberg amendment, be followed by \ndebate on the Feingold amendment, to be followed by debate on the Pryor \namendment, to be followed by debate on the Hutchison amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader would yield, I am informed \nSenator Feingold has a second amendment very similar in nature to the \nPryor amendment that he would be willing to accept a short time \nagreement on, so if we could put that on the list as well, I think that \ncould accommodate Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. DOLE. And that he would follow the Hutchison amendment; is that \nall right?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, were \nthere any--did this ask for no second degrees on any of those \namendments?\n  Mr. DOLE. Not at this point. We are trying to get the sequence. If we \ncannot agree on second degrees, that will present a problem. We are at \nleast trying to sequence amendments so Senators will know when they may \nbe expected to be here to offer their amendments, and obviously we \nwould like to have additional amendments if anybody has an amendment. \nThe Senator from Massachusetts will do his, I understand, tomorrow?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would prefer that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, technically you did not \nsay upon completion of Lautenberg we would return to Domenici before we \ngo to the next amendment, and that should be there.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thought I did.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You did not.\n  Mr. DOLE. Did not. All right. I guess I could not remember your name.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is pretty hard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object--I have no intention of \nobjecting--may I ask, is it the intention to vote on all these \namendments this evening? As I understand it, we are only sequencing the \namendments now. Some of them may be played out on tomorrow?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct. Some may be accepted, as I understand it. \nSome may need rollcall votes.\n  Mr. BYRD. And some might go over to tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOLE. Some might go over. I am not quite ready to announce that, \nbut I \n\n[[Page S 9882]]\nagree with the Senator from West Virginia, we are going to take them \nup. We can either vote as they come up or we can stack the votes, if \nthat is satisfactory.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I can understand the necessity for stacking \na few votes, but I would object to stacking a great number of votes.\n  What do we mean by a great number?\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. I would say two or three--that is a small number.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I have no problem with two or three. But I think we \nought not to stack a great number of amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. If we did, we would check with the Senator from West \nVirginia and provide for a little debate between each.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is all right up to, say, three.\n  Mr. DOLE. But if we decided to do three this evening and the balance \ntomorrow morning, would that be satisfactory?\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no problem with three votes. I hope we will stay \nhere and do them. But there are many of us that sacrifice a great deal \nin order that one or two Senators, on this side of the aisle and on \nthat side of the aisle, keep an engagement off the Hill. The rest of us \nare pinned down here waiting on action. We sit here for an hour or 2 \nhours before we get a vote.\n  I am not attempting to get in the majority leader's way or the \nminority leader's way. I am not attempting to force my will on the \nSenate. But I am one Senator who sits here and waits on action that \ndoes not accommodate me at this hour of the evening, to stack votes, \nhold off votes, or to have a window. There are a lot of other Senators \nhere who would rather be home with their spouses than to be sitting \naround waiting on a window to expire so we can get down to business to \naccommodate one or two Senators.\n  Mr. DOLE. I understand. I hope this will work to everyone's \nsatisfaction. We will keep that in mind.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the information of my colleagues, I was the one who \nrequested that we stack the vote and maybe several votes for tomorrow \nmorning. The reason I was doing that is because a lot of us do have \nfamilies and would like to have dinner with their families. I cannot do \nthat tonight because I am involved with some of these amendments, so I \nam not speaking for myself, but I know a lot of colleagues--some of our \ncolleagues do not live real close to the Hill, either. They might live \n20 miles away, so they cannot really wait for 2 hours.\n  So it is my suggestion that we do as many amendments as possible. \nMaybe some of these amendments--we now have an order for five \namendments. It may well be that we can accept two or three of these \namendments without rollcall votes. In all likelihood, the Lautenberg \namendment will require a vote. I am not sure about the Feingold \namendment or the Pryor amendment. Maybe we can accept the Pryor \namendment.\n  I would like to see us make as much progress as possible. We have a \nlot of work to do. I also hope the majority leader will say that this \nis not the end of the work tonight.\n  I hope we plow ahead, because I know people said they have amendments \nand I know we are running out of days. So I hope the leaders and the \nmanagers of the bill will be willing to stay in and work through as \nmany amendments as possible and stack whatever rollcalls are necessary \nuntil possibly 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me respond. I do not disagree with the Senator from \nOklahoma or anybody else. I think we all have the same objective and \nthat is to try to finish the bill. As long as we are moving. What we do \nnot want to do is sit around and wait for somebody to come back from \nsomewhere, so 80 of us wait for 5 to come back. I have done that \nbefore, as the Senator from West Virginia has. But I think we have a \nsequence now and we have the people here who will be here and be \ndebating these amendments. I think for the next hour and a half, we are \ngoing to have total debate without, probably, a single quorum call. I \nthink that should satisfy everyone.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. This is the late night, I might add. Thursday is normally \nthe late night. We are going to continue.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I think we have a good chance of being able to work out \nsome of these without a record vote. We have some changes I think we \ncan work out with Senator Domenici and then, at least from my \nstandpoint, that would probably not require a record vote.\n  Senator Pryor's amendment does not sound as though it would require a \nrecord vote. At least, speaking for myself, it sounds reasonably \nnoncontroversial.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Fine.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. So you have--that is five. If two of them do not \nrequire record votes, that is a maximum of three, and we could let our \ncolleagues go home and see their dog Billys.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think the best thing we can do now is start the debate.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the majority leader yield for a question? As I \nunderstood this, and so we straighten it out--I checked with the \nParliamentarian a moment ago. I think there was a little doubt as to \nthe order here. As I understood it, it was this: Domenici, 20 minutes; \nLautenberg; back to Domenici, then at the end of that; then Feingold, \nPryor, Hutchison, back to Feingold again, and Kennedy tomorrow \nprobably; is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. Unless we can finish this evening. I think we will probably \nbe on it tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest? Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have 20 minutes \nto be used as I see fit; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1533\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment is made up of two parts. \nThe second part is an amendment proposed by the chairman of the Small \nBusiness Committee, who is present on the floor, Senator Bond. So I \nwill try to divide the time rather equally, using 10 minutes and \nyielding 10 to him--maybe a little more on my end, in proportion. There \nare more words in my amendment than his, which probably means I should \ntalk a little longer.\n  I am glad the Senator finished. I yielded 40 minutes ago, I thought, \nand we would have already been finished with me, but we got a lot of \nwork done so I am pleased to have yielded.\n  Mr. President, I sent this amendment to the desk in behalf of Senator \nBingaman, Senator Bond, and myself. I think all of us have had \nexperience in our home States, in one way or another, talking to a lot \nof small business people, men and women, sometimes couples, and a lot \nof minority businesses and a lot of women-owned businesses that are \nsmall and startup.\n  Frankly, when it comes to regulations, the most consistent complaint \nis that the regulatory process never involves small business until it \nis all finished and it is too late. They are not around to make \npractical suggestions to seek just some ordinary, common sense in this \nprocess. Many regulations take a long time from beginning to end. As a \nmatter of fact, some take 2 years, Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  What we seek in the first part of this amendment is precisely what \nthe small business people have told us, and told this administration, \nthat they desperately want. Last year, five agencies, including the \nSmall Business Administration, EPA, and OSHA, held a forum on \nregulatory reform. Let me quote what they said:\n\n       . . . the inability of small business owners to comprehend \n     overly complex regulations, and those that are overlapping, \n     inconsistent and redundant.\n\n  They have indicated that:\n\n       The need for agency regulatory officials to understand the \n     nuances of the regulated industry [small businesses, women-\n     owned businesses, minority businesses] and the compliance \n     constraints of small business.\n       The perceived existence of an adversarial relationship \n     between small business owners and Federal agencies.\n\n\n[[Page S 9883]]\n\n  All of these were statements made at that forum that this \nadministration held with small business for small business.\n  So let me read one more time:\n\n       The need for more small business involvement in the \n     regulatory development process, particularly during the \n     analytic, risk assessment and preliminary drafting stages.\n  That is what they said was the paramount problem. It is in their own \nreport.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has a lot of pages to it because, \nwhenever you start mentioning Federal agencies and bureaucracies, you \nhave to make all kinds of references. Essentially this would create a \npartnership, not an adversarial, not a take-it-to-court, not a \nmandatory situation, but would create panels wherein small business \nwould become partners with the agency officials that are doing this \nwork. So that before the regulations are finalized, they would have \nsome input into what the regulations have to say, whether they are \nconsistent, whether they are too confounding, too complicated, where \nthey do not make sense. All of that, in my opinion, should be part of a \nwell-run executive branch with reference to regulations that OSHA and \nthe EPA put out right now.\n  I just tried to construct a way to set these panels into existence so \nthat they will be ongoing and each State will have small business input \nwithin their States through this process to get small business input. \nIt will be a small number of businesses--just three. There will be a \ngroup of bureaucrats or agency people who move this along and make sure \nthat the input is given and passed on where it should be. If it works \nright, in our sovereign States a few small business people become part \nof an ongoing dialog regarding regulations that, I think, be it utterly \nsimple, could have a profound effect on what currently is a very bad \nsituation.\n  Who has not heard a small business say that, ``Government regulators \ntreat us like enemies''? If you have not heard it, you have not been \namong them. If you have not heard them say, ``They do not care what we \nthink,'' you have not been among small business people.\n  We are trying in a simple way to see if in time we can get those \nkinds of things wiped away from the scene as far as the regulations, \nand that there be more partnership-type exchange between those that \ncreate the jobs in America, that pay the bills, and those that attempt \nto regulate them and their lives and their businesses sometimes in very \nwasteful and unreasonable ways.\n  So, Mr. President, there may be room to change some of the words to \nmake it very clear what we intended. We will work with Senator \nJohnston's staff and Senator Glenn's staff. We have already talked at \nlength with the chairman of Governmental Affairs, Senator Roth, and his \nstaff. They tend to think this is a good amendment and should be \nadopted.\n  Mr. President, almost all of the small business owners I talked to--\nwho are the people who create almost all of the jobs in my State--told \nme just how smothering this explosion in regulations has become.\n  Further, almost without exception, these small business owners \nidentified the Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] and \nthe Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] as the two Federal agencies \nwhich promulgate the most unreasonable and burdensome regulations.\n  Further, Mr. President, because a great number of new businesses are \nbeing started by women, some of the most vocal critics of EPA's and \nOSHA's unreasonable regulations are women-owned businesses.\n  I believe one of the biggest reasons for these attitudes among \nAmerica's small businessmen and women is that they are just not \nadequately consulted when regulations affecting them are being proposed \nand promulgated.\n  I am not alone in this belief.\n  Last year five agencies--including the Small Business Administration, \nEPA, and OSHA--held a Small Business Forum on Regulatory Reform.\n  Let me quote from the Administration's own report summarizing the \nprincipal concerns identified at the forum:\n\n       The inability of small business owners to comprehend overly \n     complex regulations and those that are overlapping, \n     inconsistent and redundant.\n\n  These panels will be responsible for providing technical guidance for \nissues impacting small businesses, such as applicability, compliance, \nconsistency, redundancy, readability, and any other related concerns \nthat may affect them.\n  These panels will then provide recommendations to the appropriate \nagency personnel responsible for developing and drafting the relevant \nregulations.\n  The panels will be chaired by a senior official of the agency and \nwill include staff responsible for development and drafting of the \nregulation, a representative from OIRA, a member of the SBA Advocate \noffice, and up to three representatives from small businesses \nespecially affected.\n  The panel will have a total of 45 days each to meet and develop \nrecommendations before a rule is promulgated or before a final rule is \nissued. Forty-five days, in the context of rules that are years in \ndevelopment, is not a delay.\n  In fact, these agencies know months in advance that they will be \npreparing these regulations. Sometime during this period, the agencies \ncan seek these panels' advice.\n  This will allow the actual small business owners, or their \nrepresentative associations, to have a voice in the massive regulatory \nprocess that affects them so much.\n  Finally, this amendment will also provide for a survey to be \nconducted on regulations. This idea is analogous to what the private \nsector routinely practices.\n  A customer survey, contracted and conducted with a private sector \nfirm, will sample a cross-section of the affected small business \ncommunity responsible for complying with the sampled regulation.\n  I believe that this panel, working together so all viewpoints are \nrepresented, will be the crux of reasonable, consistent and \nunderstandable rulemaking.\n  Further, my amendment enjoys the support of the National Federation \nof Independent Business.\n  Also, I previously spoke of the Small Business Advocacy Council which \nI set up in my State.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment will help reduce \ncounterproductive, unreasonable Federal regulations at the same time it \nis helping to foster the non-adversarial, cooperative relationships \nthat most agree is long overdue between small businesses and Federal \nagencies.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, a second part of this amendment would greatly aid \nsmall businesses as they deal with these seemingly endless Federal \nregulations.\n  For a further explanation of these provisions, I would like to yield \nto my good friend and chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator \nBond.\n  Let me conclude that the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses wholeheartedly supports this amendment as a bona fide effort \nto get small business involved in a non-advocacy manner but regular and \nordinary involvement in the preparation of regulations that affect \nthem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the National Federation \nof Independent Businesses be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: On behalf of the more than 600,000 \n     members of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     (NFIB), I am writing to express NFIB's support for your \n     legislation, the Small Business Advocacy Act, as an amendment \n     to S. 343, along with Senator Bond.\n       Small businesses have long been at a disadvantage in \n     accessing the regulatory process. They simply do not have the \n     time or resources to closely follow the Federal Register and \n     work with agencies to ensure that regulations are not \n     unnecessarily burdensome. This issue is of such importance \n     that it was voted the number three recommendation in the \n     recent White House Conference on Small Business.\n       Your legislation provides a mechanism, through its \n     establishment of small business review panels, to ensure that \n     the small business voice is heard as regulations are being \n     developed. As a result, regulators are more likely to achieve \n     their implementation goals at a lower cost and with less \n     burden on small businesses.\n       Further, your legislation establishes a small business and \n     agriculture ombudsman \n\n[[Page S 9884]]\n     in federal agencies where small business owners can confidentially \n     report on compliance and enforcement proceedings. The \n     ombudsman can then issue findings and recommendations to \n     improve enforcement activities and ensure that regulations \n     are understandable and reasonable for small businesses.\n       NFIB supports your efforts and will work with you to enact \n     your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald A. Danner,\n                                                   Vice President.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to my friend, the chairman of the Small \nBusiness Committee, Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my very \ndistinguished colleague from New Mexico and the other Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Bingaman, in offering this amendment. I commend Senator \nDomenici for all of the work that he has been doing on the very \ndifficult budget process, and for the great work he has put in this \nearly on this year.\n  He asked if I would join him to listen to the small business people \nwho had come to him in New Mexico and who wanted to share with us in \nWashington the concerns they had about how the Federal Government was \nmaking it far more difficult for small businesses to thrive and even to \nsurvive.\n  We had an excellent field hearing in Albuquerque, NM, where we \nlearned a great deal about the concerns of small businesses about \nexcessive regulations and excessive and abusive enforcement tactics by \nGovernment agencies.\n  Here in Washington those might seem like overused phrases. But \noutside the beltway, in the real world, where the men and women of \nsmall business are trying to earn a living for themselves and their \nfamilies, to create jobs and to improve their communities, they are \nsuffering real harm from precisely those excessive regulations and \nexcessive and arbitrary enforcement.\n  We heard from Ms. Angela Atterbury, owner of a small business in \nAlbuquerque, NM. She told us of a small businessman who was a first-\ntime offender of an OSHA regulation and was fined $8,000; no education \nor explanation, just a fine, which almost put the man out of business. \nShe told us of a small pest-control company transporting one to two \npints of pesticide who must comply with the same regulations as a large \nshipper of chemicals. And a candymaker who cannot legibly print all the \ninformation required by the FDA on the candy bar wrapper.\n  You have to have a separate sheet of paper attached to each candy bar \nto get all the information on it.\n  We also heard from Mr. Gregg Anesi, a small businessman from \nFarmington, NM, who testified that too often there is no practical \nrecourse for a bad regulation or a bad regulator.\n  This is something that we have heard time and time again. Many, many \nsmall businessmen and women have asked us, ``What do you do if you are \nsmall business and you cannot afford to hire a hoard of lawyers, and \nyou cannot afford to carry on a battle with an agency? You have \nsomebody who seems to be overstepping their authority or \nmisinterpreting regulations. How do you get out of it?''\n  This is really a crushing problem for many small businesses who run \nhead on into the Federal Government and feel like they have been hit by \na truck.\n And many, many more small businessmen who were literally drowning in \nthe flood of government regulations.\n\n  The Small Business Committee has held field hearings in several other \nStates since that time, and the message from small business owners at \neach of these hearings is strikingly similar. In my own State of \nMissouri, I heard from Mr. Leon Hubbard, the owner of a small \nhomebuilding company in Blue Springs, MO. Mr. Hubbard persuasively \ndescribes the disproportionately burdensome impact on a company like \nhis of regulatory paperwork obligations. OSHA requires companies like \nhis to have files of Material Safety Data Sheets for all hazardous \nproducts on a home construction site, in spite of the fact that most \nproducts carry their own warning labels and despite a 1992 OSHA study \nthat indicated less than 1 percent of all construction fatalities \nresulted from chemical exposure.\n  We know from other instances where people have been hit by OSHA \nbecause they did not have a safety material data sheet on a bottle of \nDove soap, the kind that any of us may use in household cleaning \nactivities. This is the length to which some of them have gone.\n  He also pointed out the unfairness of OSHA's multiemployer work site \npolicy. Arbitrary enforcement of this rule makes builders like himself \nlegally responsible for the safety practices of employees of \nindependent subcontractors working on the same job site even though he \nmight not have any direct authority over the employees. This means that \none employer could be cited for safety violations of another employer.\n  Another piece of very compelling and interesting testimony came from \nMr. James M. White, senior program director for the Local Initiative \nSupport Corp. in Kansas City describe his frustrations with the \nproblems created for central city redevelopment by the unpredictable \nenforcement of environmental regulations. Mr. White is a senior program \ndirector for a national non-profit organization funded by the private \nsector to provide support to community development corporations. He \ntestified about his personal involvement in six proposed development \nprojects in central Kansas City where the projected development costs \nwere escalated to excessive levels by uncertainty over cleanup \nrequirements under environmental laws. The defensive and over cautious \napproach taken by lenders and others as a result of inconsistencies and \nuncertainties about potential environmental liabilities dramatically \nincrease project costs and reduce redevelopment opportunities. \nFactories and jobs often are driven to locate in distant suburbs rather \nthan in the central city where they would be welcomed by thousands of \njob seekers.\n  As a result of our hearings, Senator Domenici introduced S. 917, the \nSmall Business Advocacy Act--to give small business a greater voice in \ndevelopment of regulations of EPA and OSHA--and I introduced S. 942--to \ngive small business a greater voice in dealing with the enforcement of \nregulations,\n to give small businesses who feel they are being oppressed either by \nexcessive regulations or by the enforcement of them some place they can \ngo, some voice where they can be heard.\n\n  The amendment that Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, and I have \nproposed draws on both bills to produce what we think is a strong \namendment for small business.\n  The part of the amendment drawn from S. 942 is designed to give small \nbusinesses a place to voice complaints about excessive, unfair or \nincompetent enforcement of regulations, with the knowledge that their \nvoices for once will be heard. The amendment sets up regional small \nbusiness and agricultural ombudsmen through the Small Business \nAdministration's offices around the country to give small businesses \nassurance that their confidential complaints and comments will be \nrecorded and heard.\n  I cannot tell you how many times a small businessperson has come up \nto me and said, ``Man, this inspector from OSHA was really tough on me, \nbut I am scared to death because if I complain to his supervisor, I am \ngoing to get it doubly bad the next time.''\n  Well, there ought to be some kind of check, some kind of confidential \nprocess in which he can place that complaint. And if there are others \nlike him who are also being abused by that particular inspector, \nperhaps the ombudsman can do something about it.\n  The ombudsman also would coordinate the activities of the volunteer \nSmall Business Regulatory Fairness Boards, made up of small business \npeople from each region. The board would be able to investigate and \nmake recommendations about troublesome patterns of enforcement \nactivities. Any small business subject to an inspection or enforcement \naction would have the chance to rate and critique the inspectors or \nlawyers with whom they deal.\n  Now, they may not like them all, but you can sure find out, when you \nlisten to the people who are subjected to the inspections and the \nregulations, who are the responsible officials and who are the overly \naggressive and excessively burdensome and overbearing regulators.\n  In dealing with small businesses today, too many times an agency \nseems to assume that everyone is a violator of the rules, trying to get \naway \n\n[[Page S 9885]]\nwith something. Many agencies do a good job of fulfilling their legal \nmandate while assisting small business, but there are some that seem \nstuck in an enforcement mentality where everyone is presumed guilty \nuntil proven innocent. That is not our system. That is not the American \nway.\n  From your experience and mine, we know that most people want to \ncomply with the law if they know what it is. We still need sanctions. \nWe still need enforcement for those who willfully refuse to do so. But \nlet us not assume that everyone wants to violate the law and wants to \noverlook the requirements for safety, for health and other legitimate \nregulatory purposes.\n  I think we ought to let small businesses compare their dealings with \none agency to dealings with another so that the abusive agencies or \nagents can be weeded out and exposed. Agencies should be vying to see \nwhich can fulfill their statutory mandate in ways that help and empower \nsmall business to accomplish their purposes, whether it be safety in \nthe workplace or cleanliness of the environment. The agencies ought to \nbe helping first the people involved to do the job that they want done \nand to do it properly.\n  We need direct feedback, and I think the agencies need direct \nfeedback from small business women and men around the country on how \nwell regulators are doing their job.\n  In my view, the Domenici amendment will for the first time take the \nfight outside the beltway and attack the regulations and the agencies \nwhere they impact people in their day-to-day lives.\n  Now, most of my colleagues in this body have received complaints. If \nyou have not heard thousands of those complaints, you must not be \nlistening because every day they come to Washington to tell the Members \nof Congress how bad they are being treated. Let us give them a chance \nto get a hearing out in the area where they live to identify at the \nlocation where it is happening those agencies or representatives of \nagencies who are overstepping their boundaries.\n  Mr. President, last month the President told the White House \nconference that he wants Government regulators to stop treating small \nbusiness men and women as criminals and start treating them as partners \nor customers. I commend him for that, and I believe this amendment will \nhelp to make that goal a reality and bring much needed relief to small \nbusinesses across the country. I really hope the President will follow \nthrough on his speech to small business and join with the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses in supporting this amendment.\n  I point out, since I am talking about the conference, that this White \nHouse Conference on Small Business which just completed brought a lot \nof good ideas and a lot of information to Washington, and the No. 3 \npriority which the small business delegates put on the agenda was \ndealing with regulation and paperwork. They had a vote of 1,398 who \nsaid the third priority should be amending the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct, making it applicable to all Federal agencies including IRS and \nDOD, and including the following--and this I note parenthetically, that \nthe Dole substitute, this measure under consideration, does just that. \nIt strengthens the Regulatory Flexibility Act. It also does the other \nfollowing things set forth in that priority listing:\n\n       A. Require cost-benefit analysis, scientific benefit \n     analysis and risk assessment on all new regulations.\n       B. Grant judicial review of regulations, providing courts \n     the ability to stay harmful and costly regulations and \n     requiring agencies to rewrite them.\n       C. Require small business representation on policymaking \n     commissions, Federal advisory and other Federal commissions \n     or boards whose recommendations impact small businesses. \n     Input from small business representatives should be required \n     on future legislation, policy development and \n     regulationmaking affecting small business.\n\n  The regulations go on, but I think any of us who travel in our States \nand listen to the small businesspeople will agree that even if you were \nnot fortunate enough to attend the conference, these are the concerns \nof small business.\n  I believe the Domenici amendment helps this excellent substitute that \nis before us to address those needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCohen of Maine and Senator Abraham of Michigan be added as original \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent there be printed in the Record \na letter from Angela Atterbury, of Atterbury & Associates, who is the \nchairperson of my Small Business Advocacy Council, expressing our \nentire New Mexico Advocacy Council support of this amendment.\n  There being no objection the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     Atterbury & Associates, Inc.,\n       For the past two years, the Small Business Advocacy Council \n     has worked to identify solutions to regulatory issues which \n     create unreasonable burdens for small business. Our members, \n     comprised of women and men small business owners, currently \n     are under-represented in the regulatory process. By providing \n     a presence to small business people on a regulatory review \n     panel, Congress would level the playing field toward small \n     business, which often can not absorb the costs or the time \n     required to understand the language of existing regulations.\n       This is what small business wants--an opportunity to act in \n     an advisory capacity and work together with agencies. This \n     would help refute what is seen by small business as the \n     agencies' adversarial position toward them. It would provide \n     a much-needed dose of reality by those of us who live our \n     day-to-day lives outside the Beltway to those who live within \n     its confines, in terms of application, readability, costs and \n     other germane issues. The review panel will also give each \n     side a means to communicate and soften the stance many in the \n     small business community hold of the agencies, that is, that \n     their existence is justified only by levying fines to small \n     business.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Angela Atterbury,\n\n                                                 President, Chair,\n                                  Small Business Advocacy Council.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was very pleased that my friend from Missouri \nmentioned some of the people in our State who testified before his \nsmall business hearing, and I might just in my remaining minute for the \nrecord thank him for mentioning them and refresh his recollection about \nthe farmer who brought to the hearing room all of the attire, from \nboots to an orange jacket, to a headpiece where he had to cover his \nface. And it was because of the newest regulatory schemes that we have \nunder the protection of Agricultural Workers Act. That may not be its \nformal name.\n  What he said was very interesting. I wanted to say this when Senator \nNickles, the great golfer, was in the Chamber. He said, I believe we \ncan prove that every golfer who plays 18 holes of golf on a modern \ngrass course gets exposed to more of that which you are trying to \nprotect farm workers from than in 1 year on the farm, but farmers' \naides will be wearing this attire like they were from outer space. He \nsaid, how would the golfers feel with all of that on them to protect \ntheir legs which are exposed as they wear shorts out on the golf \ncourse.\n  I think those are some of the things that somehow or another, sooner \nor later we are hopeful the point will get across about common sense, \nand we believe our amendment will add a little bit of potential and \npossibility for that happening.\n  Mr. President, I understand Senator Glenn and the staff of \nGovernmental Affairs wants more time to look at my amendment. So, I ask \nunanimous consent that whatever the previous order was, that the \nDomenici amendment be set aside and that it follow in sequence for \ntomorrow morning for the first amendment that would come up tomorrow \nmorning, whatever that might be.\n  Is that satisfactory with Senator Glenn?\n  Mr. GLENN. It is satisfactory to me. All we want to do is have a \nchance to look at it. There is some irritation expressed that we were \neven questioning this.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me ask that it be set aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been set aside for the \nconsideration of the amendment by the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am supposed to be back here to present the rest of my \namendment. I am not going to do that if it is to no avail. \n\n[[Page S 9886]]\n\n  Mr. GLENN. We would be happy to comply with all these things. We have \na number of questions on these. They are legitimate. We will have the \nadministration, the Justice Department, look into this tonight to be \nable to give an answer in the morning. We would not be able to give \napproval or accept this this evening. I think it is a good idea to put \nit off until tomorrow. Then the Senator from New Mexico would not have \nto come back tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the \nSenator from New Mexico controls when his amendment will be called up. \nHe can have it set aside in order to hear the presentation by the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will come up when he calls it.\n  Mr. GLENN. It is subject to being called up either tonight or \ntomorrow; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. We would proceed following \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized to proceed.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized.\n  Will the Senator from New Jersey yield?\n  Mr. ROTH. For the purposes of unanimous consent.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would be pleased to yield without losing my right \nto the floor to the distinguished Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. We will withhold. I understand there will be one more \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1535 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the provisions relating to the toxic release \n                           inventory review)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending Domenici \namendment is set aside. The clerk will report the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     Mr. Baucus, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bradley, Mrs. \n     Boxer, Mr. Simon, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Moynihan, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1535 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 72, strike lines 1 through 15.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment would delete a \nprovision currently in the bill that is unrelated to regulatory reform \nand would greatly weaken a critical environmental law generally known \nas the community right-to-know law, or the Toxics Release Inventory, \ncommonly called TRI.\n  Mr. President, I was the original sponsor of the right-to-know law. I \nam proud that it has proved to be one of the most effective \nenvironmental laws on the books. The right-to-know law has no \nprescriptive requirements. It does not force anyone to do anything \nexcept release information. It is a simple sunshine statute.\n  Mr. President, I would strongly oppose the emasculation of the right-\nto-know law no matter what the vehicle. But this clearly is not the \nproper way to consider such a huge change in the major environmental \nlaw. The right-to-know provision in this bill has been subject to \nhearings or scrutiny in the Environment and Public Works Committee. And \nthe substance of the proposal goes well beyond the changes proposed for \nother types of regulations.\n  Mr. President, as I said, my amendment proposes to delete a section \nof the proposed legislation that reduces the effectiveness of the \nright-to-know law, commonly called TRI, Toxics Release Inventory. Most \nof us who have been here for a while have worked on legislation that \nsometimes turns out to be less effective than we had hoped. The right-\nto-know law, on the other hand, has proven to be even more effective \nthan we expected. It has also proved to be less obtrusive to business \nthan other environmental laws that are on the books.\n  Now, most environmental regulations operate by command and control. \nThey require companies to take specific actions, such as lowering \nemissions, sometimes by a specific date, sometimes by a specific \ntechnology. Some environmental laws require industry to develop \ntechnology that does not yet exist. And these types of prescriptive \nregulations are probably the major reason that industry has been \npushing for this so-called reform legislation.\n  But the right-to-know legislation is quite different. The Toxics \nRelease Inventory imposes no regulatory control. It requires no \npermitting. It sets no standards. It requires no registration, labeling \nor reduction in emissions. It does not even require monitoring by a \nFederal agency. All it requires are estimates of the amount of toxic \nchemicals that facilities release into our environment. And this \ninformation is very helpful to local officials, to fire and emergency \npersonnel and to those who live near the plants. Despite the lack of \nspecific requirements, the right-to-know law has probably led to more \nvoluntary pollution prevention efforts and more environmental cleanup \nthan any other law. The right-to-know law requires companies to list \nthe amount of certain chemicals that leave their facilities through \nair, through water, or shipment to land disposal facilities.\n  Currently, 652 chemicals are required to be disclosed. Each has well-\nestablished adverse health effects or is carcinogenic or toxic.\n  Now, under the law, in deciding which chemicals to include on this \nlist, EPA is not required to do a full risk assessment. On the other \nhand, the law does not restrict companies from releasing these \nchemicals. All that is required--and I make this point over and over \nagain--is disclosure. The right-to-know law has proven effective \nprimarily because it has influenced the voluntary behavior of \ncorporations. First, many companies have voluntarily reduced the \nemissions of harmful chemicals in order to avoid negative publicity. By \nrequiring companies to tell the public the truth about the chemicals \nthey are emitting, the law has created a strong incentive for industry \nto reduce emissions even though, again, they are not required to do so \nby law.\n  Beyond creating the possibility of adverse publicity, the right-to-\nknow law has worked by encouraging businesses to reduce waste for the \nsake of their own bottom line. Company after company has discovered the \nmaterial they were putting out through the stacks or pouring into the \nwater could be recovered and reused. One company in New Jersey cut its \nemissions by 90 percent once they looked at the value of the materials \nthey were simply throwing away. And when we look at what some of the \ncompanies say, it is rather illuminating. This quote from Ciba-Geigy, a \nvery important pharmaceutical manufacturer, in 1993 in the \nenvironmental report that said:\n\n       The initial demand for environmental reporting came from \n     the public. But in responding, we have discovered that the \n     information is extremely useful to our own management. We \n     have learned about our successes, our inadequacies and the \n     gaps in our knowledge. It's a good example of the way in \n     which external pressures ultimately prove of benefit to the \n     environment and to industry.\n\n  Mr. President, lots of these materials are very expensive. And when \nthey are wasted, they have a negative effect on the company's bottom \nline. Yet before the right-to-know law was enacted, perhaps \nsurprisingly many companies simply did not appreciate the extent to \nwhich chemicals were being wasted by emitting them into the environment \nrather than using them in their product manufacturing. The right-to-\nknow law has given many corporations the information they need to \nreduce this waste. As a result, many have redesigned their \nmanufacturing processes, begun recycling chemicals, and taken other \nsteps to reduce waste.\n  This chart helps to demonstrate the impact of the Toxics Release \nInventory. In 1988, 4.8 billion pounds of toxic material were sent into \nthe waste--air, land, or water. In 1992, 4 years later, we had a \ndramatic reduction, down to 3.2 billion pounds, and in 1993, 2.8 \nbillion pounds, a reduction of 2 billion pounds of toxic material being \nemitted into the waste stream in a period of only 5 years. \n\n[[Page S 9887]]\n\n  Now, what is going to happen if the present bill goes into effect as \nis, turns into law? Then the right to know--nothing will be the \npredominant rule. Mr. President, not only is it unfair, costly, \nwasteful, but it will give the companies a chance to relax rules that \nproved beneficial for them and nonbeneficial for the health and well-\nbeing of the residents or those who work in the area.\n  Let me repeat, emissions have been reduced by 42 percent or, as I \nsaid earlier, 2 billion pounds in dangerous chemical emissions. Yet, \nall of this is at risk if the provision included in the bill is enacted \ninto law.\n  Do we really want to change the right to know into knowing nothing? I \nhope not. Should not our citizens be aware of the risks that they and \ntheir families undergo?\n  The chemical industry has acknowledged the value of the right-to-know \nlaw. We can look at the testimony by the Association of Chemical \nmanufacturers. They say:\n\n       The chemical industry can work within the requirements of \n     title III to achieve two important objectives: Improving \n     local emergency planning and informing the public about \n     chemical operations.\n       These objectives are vital to the long-term success and \n     competitiveness of the chemical industry. Facility managers \n     must take the initiative and work directly with local \n     government and communities to make this law work.\n\n  Or someone representing DuPont, Mr. Vernon Rice, said:\n\n       The beauty in the TRI is that a company can decide for \n     itself how it will achieve reductions and can deploy the most \n     cost-effective methods to do so. The law and the regulations \n     that follow provide the incentive that industry then is \n     provided with discretion on how to make the reductions.\n\n  I might add, Mr. President, industry also can decide not to make any \nreductions at all.\n  The bill before us would undermine the right-to-know law by changing \nthe rules for designating those chemicals that must be disclosed. It \nmakes it easier to take chemicals off the list and harder to put them \non.\n  Under the new test, EPA would have to know about emissions and \nexposure levels at plants throughout the country to determine their \nlikely impact. But because the TRI information on that chemical would \nnot exist, EPA would not have enough information to meet the new test. \nThis new standard puts the cart before the horse. This would completely \ndefeat the purpose, intent, and the positive successes of the TRI \nprogram.\n  The TRI list is not perfect and perhaps some chemicals should be \nremoved. Yet, present law has a proven system to consider petitions to \nremove chemicals from the list. Seventeen chemicals have been taken off \nthe list through the petition process.\n  I urge my colleagues in the strongest possible terms to reject this \nspecial interest legislation. It is a paternalistic proposal that would \nhave the Congress tell the American communities that they do not have \nthe right to know about chemicals that could have a fundamental \nnegative impact on their lives. It is a proposal that says to community \nofficials that you need not have a right to know about chemicals that \ncan cause serious harm to your constituents. It is a proposal that says \nto parents, you may be concerned about how toxic chemicals will affect \nyour children, but it is more important that industry should have the \nright to withhold that information about chemicals that they are \nemitting into the atmosphere, into the water, and into the land.\n  This is bad special interest legislation, Mr. President. The section \non the right to know is an exception from the $100 million threshold in \nthe rest of the bill. It has no place in this legislation, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support my amendment to delete it.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we have an hour equally divided, \naccording to the unanimous consent agreement; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time does my side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BRADLEY, Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \nremove the Toxic Release Inventory provisions from the regulatory \nreform bill. On June 28, 1995, I wrote to the majority leader \nsuggesting that this section and the provisions affecting Superfund be \nremoved from S. 343. I said at that time that I was troubled by the \nbill's inclusion of special provisions affecting the effectiveness of \nthe toxic release inventory, TRI, also known as the Community Right-To-\nKnow Act.\n  The Community Right-To-Know Act, which builds on programs pioneered \nby my home State of New Jersey, is considered a complete success by \nalmost all those who have analyzed its performance. In fact, it is \nprecisely the kind of alternative to conventional command-and-control \nregulation which the drafters of S. 343 say they endorse. It requires \nfull community disclosure for a list of chemicals which may prove \nhazardous to human health or the environment, especially in case of \naccidents.\n  In response to required TRI disclosures, and without the need for \nrestrictive regulations, companies have voluntarily reduced their use \nand emissions of chemicals on the TRI list. This form of pollution \nprevention has actually saved companies money, caused them to retool \ntheir operations for greater efficiency and gained them good will in \ntheir communities.\n  And using TRI information, nearby communities have taken the \nprecautions they need to protect themselves in the event of an \nemergency.\n  Unfortunately, the bill would require EPA to replace its current \nhazard-based listing process for the addition of new chemicals under \nTRI with an unworkable, risk-based process which would result in the \naddition of few, if any new chemicals to the TRI list. The bill would \nalso require EPA to remove chemicals from the TRI list if the Agency \ncould not make a showing that a particular chemical was acutely toxic \nto areas beyond a facility's boundaries. Obviously, this kind of \nrestriction on TRI's effectiveness would result in serious emergency \nresponse problems. Even worse, the blll's restrictive language would \neliminate coverage for chemicals which cause chronic health hazards, \nreproductive effects or environmental damage. The result--elimination \nof about 90 percent of the chemicals on the TRI list.\n  The bill would also require the Agency to prove that listed TRI \nchemicals cause harm when they are released to the environment before \nrequiring companies to report their pollution under TRI. But since TRI \nis a full-disclosure statute and not a regulatory one, this standard is \nirrelevant. The purpose of TRI is to let a plant's workers and nearby \ncommunity know what is going on at facilities which are their employers \nand neighbors.\n  Even with TRI, there are still problems with insuring that a \ncommunity receives the information it needs for coping with chemical \nemergencies and discovering bad actor companies. A recent accident in \nLodi, NJ points out the need for an expansion of TRI which puts \nchemical information into a user-friendly form. At the time of the \naccident the community found it lacked the data it felt it needed.\n  I will soon introduce legislation to require centralized information \ncollection and distribution of all the information available on a plant \nor group of plants, including state data, violation and accident \nhistory. While all this information is available now, you have to be \nSherlock Holmes to ferret it out.\n  Mr. President, restricting and usefulness of TRI makes no sense. It \nis a low-cost, nonregulatory way of improving the environment that \nother programs should be copying. And it is exactly the kind of \nprotection that communities like Lodi need.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask if the people in opposition have \ncomments that they would like to make at this juncture, or if there are \nany of those people who are cosponsors of my amendment who are here who \nwould like to add their thoughts. We have cosponsors who are indicated \non the legislation, a significant number of them. If they would like to \nmake any comments, this is the time they are going to have to do it, \nbecause the clock is ticking and I hate to see the time wasted.\n  Unless anyone wants to speak, Mr. President, I will suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will. \n\n[[Page S 9888]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 10 minutes?\n  Mr. ROTH. I will be happy to yield 10 minutes. But first, I want to \nmake three unanimous-consent requests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when Senator \nFeingold offers his amendment regarding equal access, that no \namendments be in order, or in order to the language proposed to be \nstricken; that there be 30 minutes for debate to be equally divided in \nthe usual form; and that when the Senate votes, the vote occur on or in \nrelation to the Feingold amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when Senator \nFeingold offers his amendment regarding peer review, that no amendments \nbe in order, or in order to the language proposed to be stricken; that \nthere be 15 minutes for debate to be equally divided in the usual form; \nand that when the Senate votes, the vote occur on or in relation to the \nFeingold amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when \nSenator Pryor offers his amendment regarding private contractors, that \nno amendments be in order, or in order to the language proposed to be \nstricken; that there be 30 minutes for debate to be equally divided in \nthe usual form; and that when the Senate votes, the vote occur on or in \nrelation to the Pryor amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Jersey. The language now in the Dole-Johnston \nsubstitute, I believe, is well tailored, calculated to achieve that \nresult which all of us want, which is notice to the public of a toxic \nchemical which, under any reasonable scenario, can be expected to do \nsome harm.\n  The problem is under the present statute, a chemical can be or, \nindeed, must be listed by the Administrator of EPA if it is known to \ncause serious chronic health effects. There are a lot of other \nprovisions, but let me reread that: If it is known to cause serious or \nchronic health effects.\n  That phrase is so broad and so all encompassing as to encompass \nordinary table salt, ordinary table salt which, if taken in sufficient \nquantities or, indeed, if ingested regularly in slightly too much \ndegree can and does cause high blood pressure, and it can kill you if \nyou take too much salt. Indeed, people out on boats in the ocean have \ningested too much sea water and have died because of that.\n  I am not suggesting here that the Administrator of EPA is getting \nready to list ordinary table salt as one of the chemicals. That is not \nthe point. The point is that the phrase, as used in the present law, is \nso broad that it does not just look at the reasonable possibility of \nharm to an individual.\n  Rather, it looks at the chemical in an absolute way, without \nrequiring that you consider whether there is any possible danger to the \npublic from the way the chemical is used.\n  So what we have done, Mr. President, is added a few words to this so \nthat when the Administrator makes a determination under this paragraph, \nit shall be based on generally accepted scientific principles, or \nlaboratory tests, or appropriately designed and conducted \nepidemiological or other population studies.\n  That is in the present law. We have added this: ``And on the rule of \nreason, including a consideration of the applicability of such evidence \nto levels of the chemical in the environment that may result from \nreasonably anticipated releases available to the Administrator.''\n  So, in effect, we are saying do not just look at whether ordinary \ntable salt can cause you to be sick, or can cause high blood pressure, \nor can poison you if you take too much of it; rather, look at ordinary \ntable salt, or whatever these other chemicals are, and determine \nwhether using, as we say, the rule of reason, including a consideration \nof the applicability of such evidence, to the levels of the chemical in \nthe environment that may result from reasonably anticipated releases.\n  All we are asking, Mr. President, is that you use common sense, and \nthat you do not just say because a chemical may be potentially harmful \nif ingested in ways that are unlikely--not only unlikely, virtually \nimpossible--but rather use, Mr. Administrator, the rule of reason. I \ncannot think of a more reasonable amendment than to tell the \nAdministrator to use the rule of reason. Does this gut the toxics \nrelease inventory? Of course not. It simply brings a little common \nsense.\n  Now, the amendment goes further. It says that ``any person may \npetition the Administrator to add or delete a chemical, and that the \nAdministrator shall grant any petition that establishes substantial \nevidence that the criteria in subparagraph (a) either are or are not \nmet.''\n  That is the language we added. In other words, you can get a chemical \nput on. If you are, say, an environmentalist and you want to add a \nchemical, you can petition to get it added if you meet that standard, \nor you can get the chemical deleted if you meet that standard. That is \nall the language does, Mr. President.\n  Now, you say, well, why would anybody want it to be off the list? \nWell, first of all, Mr. President, it is not just a question of having \nthese chemicals listed, it is a burdensome and expensive system of \nhaving to report. A chemical manufacturer sells these chemicals across \nthe country, and it might be a very benign chemical in the way that it \nis used. But each one of his vendees would have to report, and on down \nthe line--I forget the amount that you have to have--it is 10,000 \npounds, which for an industry is not very much. You would have to \nreport that, even though there is no real possibility that the chemical \nis ever going to get out.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not think that we have to worry about \nlanguage that asks the Administrator to use the rule of reason in \ndetermining whether to put a toxic chemical on the list. I honestly \nthink that any Administrator knows how to interpret those words.\n  Now, why was it necessary to put these on? Well, because in one day \nthis last year the Administrator listed another 280 chemicals on the \ntoxics release inventory, and the EPA felt that it had no authority, it \nhad no discretion to determine whether there was any danger posed to \nthe public by these chemicals, whether there was any possibility of \nharm. They felt that under this language, they had to list all 280 \nchemicals. Maybe the neighbors are upset and they say, oh, my gosh, you \nhave all these terrible chemicals there that can cause all these \nterrible things --perhaps most of them or perhaps almost all. I do not \nknow about the individual chemicals, Mr. President. But I am told by \nsome people in the EPA--who will not be quoted, I can tell you that--\nthat some of these chemicals are really no problem, should never have \nbeen on the list, but there was not the discretion in the Administrator \nto apply the rule of common sense and reasonableness.\n  Mr. President, this is not some big industry grab to force these \nchemicals on people across the country without warning, this is an \nattempt to apply the rule of reason to a very complicated thing.\n  Look, if the Administrator goes back, and somebody complains about \nthis, the Administrator could say it is a toxic chemical, I think it is \npossible that it might get out, and believe me that ought to be on the \nlist if it is possible the chemical will get out and cause harm. The \nAdministrator has all the authority under this language that he or she \nwould ever need to put that chemical on the list.\n  But, on the other hand, if it is no conceivable danger whatsoever, if \nyou have a table salt kind of chemical, it should not be on the list \nand the Administrator ought to have the discretion to use the rule of \nreason and relieve people of these reporting requirements and relieve \nthe community of the unnecessary fear in which a benign chemical might \npresent.\n  That is all the language does, Mr. President. It is not gutting the \ntoxics release inventory. It is not, in any way, harming the health of \npeople.\n  Why should it be on this bill? Because it is a question of risk, and \nthis \n\n[[Page S 9889]]\ngives to the Administrator the judgment to apply real risk analysis in \norder to put chemicals on the list or take them off.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleague, \nSenator Johnston from Louisiana, for his statement. I hope my \ncolleagues heard his statement, and I hope they will vote against the \namendment of my friend and colleague, Senator Lautenberg.\n  I think the language we have in the bill is good language. I \nunderstand the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey would strike \nthat language. I want to make it perfectly clear that the language in \nthe bill dealing with toxics release inventory review does not gut the \nstatute of toxics release inventory--the TRI, as we have heard. What it \ndoes is introduce an element of common sense.\n  The Senator from Louisiana said, yes, if you have any type of \nchemical listed, it can be listed no matter how minimal that release \nmight be. Even if there is no threat whatsoever under existing \ninterpretation by EPA and others, they can list that chemical and set \nabout a couple things. One, there is an enormous amount of paperwork \nand an enormous expense that consumers will pay for. Consumers are \nfarmers, in many cases, or they might be somebody that may be making \ndrugs for pharmaceutical companies, which, of course, increases the \nmedical costs and so on.\n Every day people have to pay the cost.\n\n  Senator Johnston also mentioned something else. He said these notices \nof release, if there is no real threat to public harm or public health \nand safety, people have a lot of unnecessary fears because of \nunnecessary notifications.\n  What this language does, and I will read it from the bill, \n``including consideration of the applicability of such evidence to \nlevels of the chemical in the environment that may result from \nreasonably anticipated releases.'' Reasonably anticipated releases.\n  In other words, not through the environment that we talked about \nsometime last year during the clean air debate. If somebody was outside \nthe plant gate for 70 years, 24 hours a day, in the prevailing wind, \nmaybe they might one out of a million chance have obtained a disease.\n  This says use common sense. That is what this language is about.\n  Also, it mentioned that if somebody wants to either be put on the \nlist or taken off the list, they must have substantial evidence to do \nso. It is a higher threshold. They have to have substantial evidence to \nbe able to get a chemical off the list, or substantial evidence to put \nthe chemical on the list. Again, common sense.\n  I think that the language we have in the bill is well crafted. It is \nnot radical. It is not extreme. It says we should use common sense. We \ncan save a lot of paperwork, a lot of red tape, and we can eliminate \nunnecessary fears that some people have as a result of overzealous \ninterpretation of the TRI statute.\n  I compliment my colleague from Louisiana and also the Senator from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, and Senator Roth for this section.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Lautenberg amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened with interest to my \ncolleague's review of what this amendment is about within the bill as \nit is structured.\n  The one thing I have not heard is anyone deny this success ratio. \nFrom 1988 until the present day we have reduced toxics being emitted \ninto the air, the water, and on the land by 42 percent--2 billion \npounds in a period of 5 years, 2 billion pounds less of toxic material \nhanging around our kids, hanging around our families, hanging around \nour school yards. Gone.\n  And it does not mean diddly, as we say, in terms of the company's \nresponsibility. We are not arresting anybody. We are not fining \nanybody. What we are saying is that they simply have to report. It is \nsunshine. Let the public know what it is that they ought to be \nconcerned about, in the event of a particular emission.\n  It is great for fire departments. In one city in New Jersey, we had a \nfireman's protective gear melt off his body because of the chemical \nmixture. At least if they know this information, emergency response \npeople can prepare the materials necessary to fight a particular \nrelease, explosion, or fire. What we are doing now is we are saying, \nOkay, the public really does not have a right to know this kind of \nthing.\n  All of these materials that are released are toxic, Mr. President. \nThey do not get out there willy-nilly. This is not an administrator's \ndream of torture.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Very briefly for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Just on the point that the Senator said that EPA is not \narresting anybody.\n  According to ``Inside EPA,'' the weekly report for June 30, 1995, \nthey do say that 3 priority sectors for determining enforcement actions \nwere chosen because of noncompliance histories, toxics release \ninventory releases, and trans-regional impacts.\n  In other words, TRI releases are one of the bases on which they bring \nenforcement actions. Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Say it again, please.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That one of the bases on which EPA brings enforcement \nactions is TRI releases.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. So that it does have something to do with enforcement?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. There is a requirement that they have to file this \ninformation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I mean on enforcement, where they send the \ninvestigators out. In other words, if you have TRI releases, they \nenforce the rules.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If there is an accident that endangers the public \nhealth, yes, someone will look at it.\n  I would love to respond to my friend from Louisiana, but we are using \nmy time and he is in opposition, so I do not want to give him my time \nto oppose this brilliant amendment.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has asked for some time. He has worked \nvery hard on these issues and I would be delighted to yield as much \ntime as he needs, not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think I will not need 10 minutes.\n  I would like to respond, if I can, to the comments of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and to the whole concept of what is really at stake in \nrevamping the Right-to-Know law and its Toxics Release Inventory (TRI).\n  First of all, we should remember that TRI is the Emergency Planning \nand Community Right-to-Know Act of Title III of Superfund. This program \ndoes not have the same breadth of regulatory reform we are reaching for \nin the bill before us. The fact is that this is a nonregulatory \nsunshine law and should be considered separately by the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  In fact, Senator Smith on the Republican side has been doing a very \ngood job of leading the effort to revamp the Superfund program and as \nTitle III of that act this issue could be appropriately considered at \nthat time. To date, however, there have been no hearings on this whole \nquestion of exactly what the impact of revamping the right-to-know law \nwould be. In fact, there has not been a hearing on TRI in the Senate \nsince 1991.\n  Yesterday, I attended a press conference outside this chamber where \nmembers of the firefighter unions of the United States, representing \nseveral hundred thousand firefighters, said, ``Don't do this. Do not \nchange the TRI structure today and thereby put firemen at risk.''\n  What the TRI structure does today is allows fire departments all \nacross this country to be able to plan for what kind of fire they may \nbe going into. Because of the TRI, communities have computerized \nknowledge of precisely what chemicals exist in certain companies, in \ncertain buildings. When the fire department gets an alarm, they simply \npunch the computer and the data comes up on the computer screen \nimmediately so that firemen have the ability to be able to don masks, \nmaybe don protective gear, call in additional help, take special \nmeasures to secure the area, evacuate personnel. All of that knowledge \ncomes about because of a simple concept called Right-to-Know. \n\n[[Page S 9890]]\n\n  The TRI is not a regulation that does away with chemicals. It does \nnot require companies to spend a whole lot of money to comply with \nregulations. It simply makes information available to businesses, to \ncommunities, and to citizens. That information allows citizens to then \ndecide whether they think they are at risk and gives companies the \ninformation they need to help them reduce their wastes before they are \ncreated. It is the best tool to promote pollution prevention that we \nhave in effect today.\n  What is interesting about this, Mr. President, is that just by \nrequiring companies to tell Americans what they are emitting into the \nair or land or water--solely by the requirement to let people know--\ncompanies themselves have made important decisions about reducing \nwastes. So they have voluntarily removed 42 percent since its reception \nin 1988--two billion pounds--of the chemical emissions of this Nation.\n  That is a remarkable success story, Mr. President. It does not come \nabout because we in the Congress have created a whole convoluted \nregulatory structure where companies are required to reduced their use \nof chemicals. All that is required is companies that use large volumes \nof toxic chemicals tell Americans what they are putting into the \nenvironment.\n  More than 2 billion pounds of emissions have been prevented as a \nconsequence of that. That is a success story.\n  It is really interesting to see the chart from the Senator from New \nJersey over there that shows the comments of individual sectors of the \nindustry. The chemical industry itself has found it useful.\n  In point of fact, the former chairman of the Environment Committee, \nSenator Baucus, has yet to have one chemical company coming to them and \nsaying, ``Get rid of TRI.'' It was not an issue in early regulatory \nreform bills or in the past two Congresses Superfund debates. It has \njust been snatched out of the air because clearly a few people decided \nthey thought this got in their way.\n  Mr. President, turning to the standard that the Senator from Oklahoma \ntalked about, what the language in this bill currently does is, in \neffect, it applies a 180-day requirement for this risk assessment to \ntake place. If it does not take place, the chemicals come off. So you \nalready have a sword of Damocles hanging over the process. Because if \nthe Administrator does not want to do it, or if they do not have the \nresources to do it, you may wind up taking out of here an automatic \ncapacity to have a decision. But more important, the language says, \n``on the rule of reason, including a consideration of the applicability \nof such evidence to levels of the chemical in the environment that may \nresult from reasonably anticipated releases.''\n  ``Reasonably anticipated releases'' is the information we get from \nthe TRI. So what they are doing is creating a standard that makes a \njudgment as to whether or not you are going to be able to put something \non the TRI list using information that you have to have from the TRI \nlist in the first place. And since you do not have it from the TRI \nlist, you cannot make the judgment that is required here. That is \ncalled the proverbial Catch-22. It is a way of tying everybody up in a \nprocess that, in effect, kills the TRI concept.\n  They can stand here and say, ``Oh, no, no, no, no; all we are going \nto do is have a little risk assessment,'' but the language of the risk \nassessment itself depends on reasonably anticipated releases being able \nto be determined. And unless you know what the company is emitting, \nthere is no way to know what the reasonably anticipated release is \ngoing to be.\n  So I respectfully submit this is one of those places where, again, \nthe words are so important, and where an awful lot hangs in the \nbalance.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be happy--I do not want to yield on my time, but I \nwill yield on my colleague's time for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator from Delaware yield me 1 minute to ask \na question?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator read, appropriately, the language which was \nadded, which was, ``on the rule of reason,'' et cetera.\n  But the first paragraph in the present law is still there. That is, \n``A determination under this paragraph shall be based on generally \naccepted scientific principles, or laboratory tests, or appropriately \ndesigned and conducted epidemiological''----\n  Mr. KERRY. Epidemiological.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. ``Or other population studies, and/or the rule of \nreason, including consideration of the applicability of said evidence \nthat may result from reasonably anticipated releases.''\n  So all we are giving him is that additionally he may consider \nadditional evidence, including the amount that may be released.\n  Will the Senator agree that is a correct statement?\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend, I understand his reading of it, \nbut it still begs the question here. Because the standard of \n``including,'' which is the most important way to prove what may be the \nharm to a community, is still not available.\n  Second, and this is far more important, let me say to my friend from \nLouisiana, what is critical here is why go through all of these \nincredible hoops when in fact nothing negative is required of the \ncompany unless it uses more than 10,000 pounds and produces more than \n25,000 pounds? You are talking about big producers and big users here.\n  All that is required of these big, 10,000-pound users, 25,000-pound \nproducers, is that they tell people in the community what it is they \nput into the air or water or land. It is irrelevant whether there is a \nrisk or not in terms of the concept of sunshine and right-to-know.\n  What, in effect, the Senator from Louisiana and others are setting up \nhere--whether it is wittingly, purposefully, or not--is a new series of \nhoops which, under the cumulative impact of this bill will allow a \nseries of legal steps to be taken that will prevent people in a \ncommunity from even knowing what one of these big producer companies is \nputting into the air.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, is the Senator saying----\n  Mr. KERRY. Again, I do not want to yield on my time. I reserve my \ntime.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Do I still have any of that minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his minute. Will the \nSenator from Delaware yield him an additional minute?\n  Mr. ROTH. I will yield 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields an additional minute.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I will not use that at this point.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will just use a moment.\n  Mr. President, the real issue here is very, very simple. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana is trying to explain how the test that they have set up \nis reasonable. The issue is whether or not there ought to be a test set \nup for a company that uses 10,000 pounds or more of a chemical or a \ncompany that produces 25,000 pounds or more. The issue is, should that \ncompany automatically tell people in the community what it puts into \nthe air? It is very simple. And, by coming along with this notion we \nare going to go through all of this regulatory process with risk \nassessments and so forth, we are actually applying a series of \nstandards and hoops to jump through that have no relevancy to the \npurpose of letting people know.\n  They are creating a risk-based standard for something that does not \nhave to be risk-based but is simply informational. And, on the basis of \nthat, there are certain chemicals that may be, actually, under their \nstandard, taken off the Toxics Release Inventory which, in fact, have a \nnegative effect on people, but they do not fall under their standard \nbecause of the level of toxicity.\n  So I say again, this is a very simple issue. This is a question of \nwhen Americans are living in a community where a company uses 10,000 \npounds of a specific chemical or produces 25,000 pounds, whether that \ncompany ought to tell the fellow citizens who live in that community \nand who work in the plant, what it is that is being emitted. And by \nvirtue of the law, we have taken 2 billion pounds of that kind of \nchemical out of the environment, away from people, and made life safer. \n\n\n[[Page S 9891]]\n\n  If they turn this clock back, we will make life more hazardous. And \nthere is no rationale for saying Americans should not know what \nchemicals are going into the local environment.\n  I yield the time to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KEMPTHORNE). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield so I can make a further unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. I do not want to continue to use my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Without using the time of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 13 minutes \nthat remain in opposition to the Lautenberg amendment be reserved for \nSenator Lott and 5 minutes reserved for Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I might ask, Mr. President, how much time do I \nhave left on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 1 minute 3 \nseconds.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous-consent request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the conclusion of the debate on the time agreements already \nentered for this evening, the Senate proceed to vote in sequence, with \nthe first vote being the standard 15-minute vote and any remaining \nstacked votes be 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Finally, for the information of all Senators, there could \nbe as many as four rollcall votes beginning as early as 8:30 this \nevening. Therefore, Senators should be on notice of these upcoming \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is now recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1536 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the provisions of titles 5 and 28, United States \n Code, relating to equal access to justice, award of reasonable costs \n  and fees, hourly rates for attorney fees, administrative settlement \n                    offers, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1536 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthe regulatory reform bill legislation that will improve equal access \nto justice under what is known as the Equal Access to Justice Act.\n  I think the thrust of this bill, the thrust of regulatory reform, is \nto rethink the relationship between Government and business and to make \nour system of regulation both more effective and less burdensome, and, \nin some cases, I think we have to stay the hand of Government when we \nbelieve it reaches too deeply into the daily affairs of the American \npeople.\n  As many of us have said on this floor, I think these are goals that \neveryone supports, even though sometimes we may differ on the way to \nactually achieve them.\n  The Equal Access to Justice Act is one effective means for achieving \na measure of reform and should be part of our plans to reduce the level \nof unnecessary Government intrusion in our lives. The Equal Access to \nJustice Act as it now exists was enacted in 1980, with the idea that \nsmall businesses and individuals who have to get into the ring with the \nFederal Government over enforcement of regulations should be able to \nrecover their legal fees and certain other expenses if they end up \nwinning the case.\n  They are tied in this litigation with Government and one party has to \nwin and one party has to lose. And if it is the Government that loses, \nespecially after they have brought the case, I think the Government \nshould bear the burden of the attorney's fees and not the small \nbusiness and not the individual. It is one of a number of fee-shifting \nstatutes in Federal law.\n  I am as proud to say that much of the work on the original equal \naccess law was done by the former Congressman from my home district, \nthe Second Congressional District of Wisconsin, Representative Robert \nKastenmeier when he served on the House Judiciary Committee. I offered \nthe same kind of bill, and got it passed in the State Legislature in \nWisconsin. That is now the law, and has been since 1985, and it is the \nState Equal Access to Justice Act which has been very helpful to \nbusinesses and individuals who have been sued by the State government \nor some of its agencies.\n  The Equal Access to Justice Act gives prevailing parties in certain \nkinds of litigation against the Federal Government the right to seek \nreimbursement of attorney's fees and other costs of litigation from the \nGovernment. The intent of the law has always been to make taking on the \nFederal Government in court somewhat less intimidating although it is \nalways going to be somewhat intimidating.\n  To that end, the act is specifically targeted at assisting \nindividuals and businesses who do not have ready access to the kinds of \nresources available to the Federal Government when it goes to court. \nUnder the current law, the law gives this kind of option--or \nprotection--to a person whose net worth does not exceed $2 million or a \nbusiness that does not have net worth greater than $7 million, or which \ndoes not employ more than 500 people. And there are a couple of other \nminor exceptions.\n  There was another motive for the bill, and that was to help restrain \nthe regulatory hand of the Federal Government when it was going to \ntrial. The authors of the bill believe that if the agency faced the \nprospect of not only having decisions nullified but also having to \nactually pay the attorney's fees of the entity or individual they went \nafter, maybe the agency would think twice before it started the lawsuit \nor the administrative action in the first place.\n  I cannot say for sure in the past 10 or 15 years that this second \ngoal has been reached. However, the Equal Access to Justice law has \nproved to be a bargain based upon the estimates that we have seen. \nOriginally the estimates were that the Equal Access to Justice law \nwould cost about $68 million a year. But according to the \nAdministrative Office of U.S. Courts, annual fee reimbursements have \ntotaled from the Federal Government only about $5 to $7 million between \n1988 and 1992. This is despite the fact that litigants are actually \nmore successful in terms of the active percentage of wins than was \noriginally anticipated.\n  A study done on this examined 629 Federal District and Appellate \nCourt decisions involving EAJA fee award claims during the 1980's. The \nprofessors who did the study pointed out that the Congressional Budget \nOffice in making its estimates had assumed that parties seeking fee \nreimbursement under the act would actually be successful in about 25 \npercent of the claims filed against the Federal Government.\n  However, the professors found that they even had a higher level of \nsuccess, 36 percent and were able to win fees in those cases.\n  Yes. Mr. President, some may well claim that EAJA has had a scant \neffect on controlling overreaching regulation. But I believe it is \nclear that it is another arrow in the quiver of the individual citizen \nor a small business owner when they have to tangle with the Federal \nGovernment in court or in an administrative proceedings.\n  The EAJA generally has served its function well. The purpose of my \namendment this evening is that the act over the course of several years \nhas come to the point where it needs some updating to speed up the \nprocess of awarding attorney's fees to prevailing parties and thereby \nlower the cost of litigation to taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, briefly, this amendment has three major elements.\n  First, my bill raises the current cap on attorney's fees in these \nkinds of situations under the act from the current limitation of $75 to \n$125 per hour. That would bring the rate somewhat in line with the real \nworld.\n  My bill retains the cost-of-living increase as a possible element in \ndetermining an attorney's fee award but it strikes the current language \nthat permits further increasing an award on the basis of a special \nfactor defined by example in the statute as ``the limited availability \nof qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved.''\n  Mr. President, I believe these improvements will actually make suits \nagainst the Government more attractive to attorneys and appropriate \ncases, which in turn should create a larger pool of attorneys available \nto private litigants to try to handle these cases. Therefore, we should \nsee less need for this special factor language, and I think it will \nhelp simplify the process.\n  In addition, my bill makes the method of computing cost-of-living \nincreases to fee awards more specific. And I could detail on that, if \nanybody wishes.\n  But I will move on to say that the second major change my amendment \nmakes in the current law is to eliminate the language that allows the \nGovernment to escape paying attorney's fees, even if the Government has \nlost in court, if the Government can successfully argue that it had a \nsubstantial justification for its action.\n  Mr. President, I am not generally a supporter of the loser pays \nconcept. But I believe that if a small business owner or an individual \nAmerican wins in court--not against another private litigant but \nagainst the Federal Government--and, if the law provides for the \nGovernment to reimburse you for your expenses, then the Government \nshould ante up. I think we should have in effect a loser pays provision \nwhen the Federal Government sues a private party and the private party \nends up winning the case.\n  I realize some people are concerned that eliminating this provision \nwill open the floodgates of our Treasury. But let me refer to a study \nthat by Professor Krent which indicates that this is not the case. He \nindicates that fee awards in the cases we have had during this act were \ndenied in only a small number of cases on the basis of successful \nsubstantial justification argument. Apparently that is because this \ntechnique of the Government to try to avoid paying fees in these cases \nin court is routinely raised by Government attorneys as a way to sort \nof block the private litigant from getting their attorney's fees even \nthough they \n\n[[Page S 9893]]\nhave prevailed in the underlying case against the Government.\n  So this extra way out for the Government really allows the creation \nof another issue at least to more litigation over whether or not there \nwas a substantial justification for the lawsuit to be brought in the \nfirst place, even though the Government lost.\n  The professor suggests that there may even be some cost savings \noffset any increase in awards due to the elimination of the substantial \njustification defense. He admits it is impossible to make an exact \ndetermination of the expense of litigating this issue in case after \ncase. But he believes, based on the evidence of 1 year--between 1989 \nand 1990--that whatever is saved by raising the substantial \njustification defense is not enough to justify the cost of litigating \nthe issue. That is one reason why Professor Krent believes that this \nextra way out for the Government, in his words, ``probably creates a \nperverse incentive to litigate'' on the part of Government attorneys.\n  My amendment specifically addresses the issue of cost by making it \nplain that there is to be no new direct spending to cover these fee \nawards. The amendment also makes it clear that agencies who are \nrequired to pay fee awards have to look to their own budgets. They \ncannot go to the Federal Claims and Judgment Accounts to find the \nnecessary sums. That is in keeping with the original intent of the \nbill. That intent again is to make an agency think twice before it \ncreates regulations and before initiating certain enforcement actions \npursuant to them. I cannot think of anything more consistent with the \noverall purposes of legislation before us than that.\n  The third major change in any amendment sets up a settlement process \nto give the parties a method of resolving the fee issue without \nresorting to further litigation. It creates an opportunity for the \nGovernment, similar to the process in Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, to make an offer of settlement up to 10 days prior to \nthe hearing on the fee claim. If that offer is rejected and the party \napplying for fees later wins a smaller award, there is a negative \nconsequence to the party that did not accept the offer of settlement. \nThat party is not entitled to receive fees or other expenses that are \nincurred after date of the offer.\n  My amendment does not specifically expand the reach of the EAJA. But \nit does require the review of the act and looks ahead to possible \nfuture expansion.\n  We asked both the Justice Department and the Administrative \nConference to review various aspects of where the law could be \nexpanded.\n  My amendment also requires the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts to submit a report within 180 days as it does for the Justice \nDepartment.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court in a 1991 decision, Ardestani versus INS, held \nthat EAJA fees are available only in cases where hearings are required \nby law to conform to the procedural provisions of section 554 of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act.\n  However, Congress had already created a statutory exception. In 1986, \nCongress extended the coverage of the EAJA to include the Program Fraud \nCivil Remedies Act.\n  I think it is reasonable to investigate whether certain agency \nproceedings such as deportation cases that are nearly identical to \nproceedings covered by 554 should also be covered by the EAJA.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude my comments at this point by \nindicating that recently a friend of mine I had not seen since high \nschool just came to visit me in my office here and did not come, \napparently, for any reason other than to visit.\n  But during the course of our visit, he told me a story about what had \nhappened to him recently that made him quite down about pursuing the \nbusiness he is in. He told me that his agency declined to fight a case \nagainst the Department of Education, a case their attorneys believed \nwas winnable, because the board of directors of his group did not \nbelieve it was worth paying large litigation costs over a claim worth \nabout $32,000 even if the agency had a good case.\n  The Department of Education, he told me, had reviewed his \nrehabilitation center, which provided job training and placement \nservices for mentally and physically handicapped people, in 1992. The \nDepartment's reviewer found 10 problem areas, which were later actually \nwhittled down, Mr. President, to just one item. All the Government had \nleft in their case, after they went through this process, was saying \nthat my friend's group had inadequate time sheets.\n  For this and this alone, the Department wanted the center to pay a \nreimbursement of about $115,000. That was later negotiated down to \n$32,000. My friend told me that had he known about the EAJA law, he \nwould have pressed the directors to fight, and because he did not know \nabout it, he just gave up.\n  A few weeks ago, the White House Conference on Small Business \ndiscussed this issue. Mr. Carl Schmieder, a Phoenix, AZ, businessman \nand deputy chairman of the Arizona delegation to the small business \nconference, helped spearhead a resolution endorsing the type of changes \nI am talking about for the EAJA. He said the array of resources \navailable to the Government in litigation can be overwhelming to a \nsmall business owner, and he called the amendment that we are offering \nhere tonight a tremendous step forward.\n  Mr. Schmieder's resolution attracted a lot of support among the \ndelegates to the conference. Although it did not appear on the shortest \nlist of recommendations that came out of the conference, when the \ndelegates drew up a list of priorities, these kinds of changes were \nranked in the top 20 percent of all issues considered.\n  I think individuals and small business owners deserve all the help we \ncan give them, and before I close, let me acknowledge the work of the \nAdministrative Conference of the United States which has been very \nhelpful by conducting research into this issue, making many of these \nrecommendations and providing valuable assistance in preparing the \namendment.\n  We all know unnecessary or overburdening Government regulations can \nbe an obstacle to doing business. The Equal Access to Justice Act was \nconceived to overcome that obstacle, and we in this update that this \namendment provides allow the act to work better than it has in the \npast.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Delaware oppose the \namendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. We have no request at this time for anyone to speak in \nopposition.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1535\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak in favor of the TRI \namendment offered by Senator Lautenberg. I might inquire of the Chair \nhow much time is remaining on that amendment, and I might inquire of \nthe Senator from Delaware, if he is not going to use his time, perhaps \nI could use some of his time on the TRI amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. We are actually checking to see whether there is anyone who \nwants to speak in opposition.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining for those \nspeakers who wish to speak in favor of the Lautenberg amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey, based on the \nunanimous consent agreement, controls 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And how much time has he utilized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ROTH. I will yield 3 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has yielded 3 \nminutes from the time he controls?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might also consume, say, 1 minute of the \ntime controlled by Senator Lautenberg, a total of 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. \n\n[[Page S 9894]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am rising to strongly support the amendment offered \nby the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] who wants to strike the \nso-called TRI provisions from the bill. Under the TRI provisions, the \ntoxics release inventory reporting provisions, currently today in the \nlaw, when a major chemical company emits toxic chemicals into the air \nor water which could cause acute, chronic, adverse health effects to \nthe environment, that company just has to state to the public the \namount of toxic chemicals that is released up into the environment.\n  It does not say to the company you have to put on a scrubber; it does \nnot say to the company you have to clean it up; it does not say to the \ncompany you have to do anything to stop what you are emitting, just \nthat you have to disclose to Americans, disclose to the public the \namount that is being emitted. That is all it is.\n  I might say, Mr. President, that the consequences of this provision \nin the law enacted not too many years ago have been very beneficial. \nFirst, to the public so the public knows what is being emitted, and \nthey can take whatever action they may want to take.\n  It has also been beneficial to the companies. The Chemical \nManufacturers Association has said, as a consequence of this act alone, \nthere has been a 50 percent reduction in chemicals emitted by their \nmembers. Some major chemical manufacturing companies have said it has \nhelped them because they did not know how much they were emitting in \nthe past. This law requires them to disclose what they are emitting. \nNow they know and they are able to change their manufacturing process \nto emit less and to also make their processes much more efficient. It \nhas helped them.\n  It makes no sense, Mr. President, in this bill before us today, a \nregulatory reform bill designed to reform regulations and just make \nsure that regulations are considered more easily and more efficiently, \nto enact a substantive provision to delete the toxics release inventory \nlaw. That is a substantive provision. This is a regulatory reform bill.\n  I might add there have been no hearings on this provision, none. In \nfact, this provision was not even in any bill. It was just suddenly \njammed in in the Chamber. It has had no consideration. Just as we \ndeleted, a couple of hours ago, another substantive provision regarding \nthe Superfund, it makes eminent sense that we should also here tonight \ndelete this substantive provision, the toxics release inventory \nprovision, a provision which is very beneficial to Americans.\n  Essentially, this provision that is now before us, I must say, \ndisrupts the basic concept of right to know which simply says, OK, \nfolks, you have a right to know what is emitted. That's all. It does \nnot in any way tell companies to control what is being emitted.\n  Mr. President, for those reasons we should adopt the Lautenberg \namendment to delete this substantive provision.\n  It is also very ironic; here we are today considering the regulatory \nreform bill to make the regulatory process more efficient with more \ninformation, with risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis. If the \nLautenberg amendment does not pass, we are saying less information is \nbetter. We are saying that the public does not have a right to know \nwhat toxic chemicals are being released. It makes no sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield 1 more minute. I \nhave used 1 minute of the Senator's time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Certainly. I will be happy to yield another minute to \nmy friend from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, again, just to say what this amendment \ndoes, currently a chemical is listed if it has acute, or chronic health \nor environmental effects. The bill before us says, in addition to \nknowing the toxic effects of the chemical, you have to show how much of \nthe chemical is actually being released and if that release will result \nin harmful effects. And you have to show this before it is listed on \nthe TRI. It is a catch-22. It cannot be done.\n  Second, Mr. President, the standard by which a chemical would be \nlisted, that is required to be listed or not, is so vague no one can \nexplain what the standard is. I have read this standard many, many \ntimes, over and over again. I do not know what it says. It is a \nlawyer's paradise. This provision is going to be tremendously \nlitigated. And I just again urge Senators to pass the Lautenberg \namendment, which deletes a substantive provision which the public very \nmuch desires as the right to know which chemicals are being emitted \ninto the atmosphere.\n  And I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nSenator from Mississippi was going to be here at--was that 8?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In response to the Senator from New Jersey, no \ntime had been set. We do have 1 minute remaining under the control of \nthe Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware----\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. I wonder if we could go into a quorum call, if we are \nwaiting for Senator Lott. Is that it?\n  Mr. ROTH. And Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. DOLE. Maybe the Senator from Wisconsin could use some of his time \nwhile we are waiting on that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is my understanding this side still has 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 11 minutes, 35 \nseconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I only have 1 minute remaining. If there is going to be \nany opposition, I would like to reserve that for a response.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, in order to move things along here, I am \ngoing to make this suggestion that we lay the pending amendment aside. \nAnd I assume that is the amendment just offered by the Senator from \nWisconsin, and that I be allowed to, in the sequencing order, present \nmy amendment; and upon completion of my amendment, we will return to \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin and proceed from \nthere. I think that might expedite our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1537 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n  (Purpose: To prevent conflicts of interest of persons entering into \n contracts relating to cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] for himself and Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 1537 to amendment \n     No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the substitute amendment, \n     insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . CONFLICT OF INTEREST RELATING TO COST-BENEFIT \n                   ANALYSES AND RISK ASSESSMENTS.\n\n       (a) Information Bearing on Possible Conflict of Interest.--\n       (1) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``contract'' means any contract, agreement, or other \n     arrangement, whether by competitive bid or negotiation, \n     entered into with a Federal Agency for any cost-benefit \n     analysis or risk assessment under subchapter II or III of \n     chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code (as added by section \n     4(a) of this Act).\n       (2) In general.--This section shall not apply to the \n     provision of section 633(g), when an agency proposes to enter \n     into a contract with a person or entity, such person shall \n     provide to the agency before entering into such contract all \n     relevant information, as \n\n[[Page S 9895]]\n     determined by the agency, bearing on whether that person has a possible \n     conflict of interest with respect to being able to render \n     impartial, technically sound, or objective assistance or \n     advice in light of other activities or relationships with \n     other persons.\n       (3) Subcontractor information.--A person entering into a \n     contract shall ensure, in accordance with regulations \n     prescribed by the head of the agency, compliance with this \n     section by any subcontractor (other than a supply \n     subcontractor) of such person in the case of any subcontract \n     of more than $10,000.\n       (b) Required Finding That No Conflict of Interest Exists or \n     That Conflicts Have Been Avoided; Mitigation of Conflict When \n     Conflict Is Unavoidable.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the head of an \n     agency shall not enter into any contract unless the agency \n     head finds, after evaluating all information provided under \n     subsection (a) and any other information otherwise made \n     available that--\n       (A) it is unlikely that a conflict of interest would exist; \n     or\n       (B) such conflict has been avoided after appropriate \n     conditions have been included in such contract.\n       (2) Exception.--If the head of an agency determines that a \n     conflict of interest exists and that such conflict of \n     interest cannot be avoided by including appropriate \n     conditions in the contract, the agency head may enter into \n     such contract if the agency head--\n       (A) determines that it is in the best interests of the \n     United States to enter into the contract; and\n       (B) includes appropriate conditions in such contract to \n     mitigate such conflict.\n       (c) Rules and Regulations.--No later than 240 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal \n     Acquisition Review Council shall publish rules for the \n     implementation of this section, in accordance with section \n     553 of title 5, United States Code, without regard to \n     subsection (a) of such section.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have only a very few moments. This is a \nvery simple amendment that I am offering tonight. This basically is an \namendment concerning Federal agencies which use private contractors to \nperform cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments.\n  Mr. President, one of my main concerns about the bill that we are \nconsidering is that it is going to place additional burdens upon the \nFederal agencies during a period of downsizing of the number of Federal \nemployees. Should S. 343 become law, the respective agencies throughout \nthe Federal Government are going to have to reorder their priorities to \nallow them to devote a large portion of their resources to cost-benefit \nanalysis, risk assessment, and regulation review. As the Government \ncontinues to downsize in the future, Mr. President, the Federal \nagencies are going to increasingly turn to private contractors to carry \nout the tasks of government.\n  As my colleagues know, I have long been concerned with the use of \nprivate contractors in the Federal Government. During my years in the \nSenate, I have sought to shed light on the increasing role of private \ncontractors and the possible conflict of interest involved with their \nuse.\n  This is no new issue. In 1980, for example, the General Accounting \nOffice examined 156 contracts for regulatory analysis alone and found \nthat 101 of these 156 contracts had a conflict of interest situation. \nBecause S. 343 will likely increase the use of private contractors to \nconduct regulatory analysis for the Federal Government, I believe that \nthis conflict of interest problem cannot and should not be ignored.\n  Mr. President, to illustrate the potential for conflict of interest, \none need only look at the promotional materials published by a few of \nthe private contractors who have contracts with the Federal Government. \nFor example, Mr. President, one of these contractors is a firm known as \nP.R.C. In 1990 the P.R.C. company, a consulting company, had four \ncontracts worth $220 million with the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Here is their promotional material. This material proclaims to the \npossible user of their services, and I quote, ``Under contract to the \nUnited States EPA, P.R.C. has conducted hundreds of regulatory \ncompliance inspections giving us indepth experience with what \nregulators are looking for.''\n  How then, Mr. President, can this particular company be a company \nthat states that they have no bias and that they have no conflict of \ninterest?\n  Here is another company, Mr. President. This particular company is \nanother major contractor with the Environmental Protection Agency. In \n1990-1991, they had 13 contracts worth over $100 million with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. They boast to potential users of their \nservices, in their very beautiful brochure--this is called The Weston \nManagers Design Consulting Company--I quote, ``In daily practice, the \nWeston philosophy has encouraged us to develop and maintain an \nobjective, professional posture relative to public issues so that we \ncan represent either''--and I quote--``the regulated or the \nregulator.'' So that we can represent either the regulated or the \nregulator.\n  How fair, how objective and how free from conflicts of interest, Mr. \nPresident, can a firm be when it is working both sides of the street?\n  Here is another firm, Mr. President, who has millions of dollars of \ncontracts with the Federal Government today, the ICF Co. Their brochure \nis entitled: ``Environment and Energy.''\n  They list their clients. For example, some of ICF's clients are: \nAshland Chemical; Cedar Chemical; Chemical Waste Management; Chevron; \nDow Chemical, SCA Chemical Services; Union Carbide; and Vertec.\n  Now they also list the Government agencies that they work for: the \nDepartment of Commerce; the Department of Defense; the Department of \nEnergy; and, yes, Mr. President, the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  My amendment says that if granting one of these contracts to a \ncompany doing business with the Government creates a conflict of \ninterest, then the agency head has the opportunity to publish notice of \nthe conflict in the Federal Register. This can make us aware that the \ncontract has the potential of a conflict, could be printed in the \nFederal Register and give us fair and just warning of the potential \nthat might exist for a contract.\n  It would require agencies to gather certain information from its \ncontractors that will allow agencies to determine if a conflict of \ninterest actually exists. It would not, Mr. President, prohibit the \nagency, under certain circumstances, from hiring a contractor, even if \na conflict of interest was found.\n  My amendment simply sheds sunlight on the process by ensuring that \nthe agency has considered possible conflicts so that the public is \nassured that potential conflicts of interest are not subverting public \npolicy due to hidden bias in the regulatory analyses process.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin for being an original cosponsor of this amendment that is now \nbefore the Senate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nDelaware has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to my distinguished \ncolleague.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my friend from Delaware. I just want to speak in \nbehalf of Senator Pryor. I just want to say, there is no one on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee who has done more work and stuck with \nthe idea of looking into outside contracting, making sure it was not \nexcessive, cutting down the number of contracts where we go out and pay \nfor very expensive contracts that we should be doing in Government \nitself. He has been following this subject for a number of years and \nbird-dogging that. He deserves a lot of credit for it, and I think the \namendment he is bringing up this evening is an example of making sure \nthat when we do contract out, that it is done legitimately and without \nconflict of interest and without any taint. It is that kind of thing \nthat happens too often in Government which gives Government a bad name.\n  He has been determined for many years to root this out. I want to \ncompliment him for it, and I am glad to be supporting his amendment.\n  I thank my friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have to say to my distinguished friend \nfrom Ohio, he stole the words out of my mouth. I was going to also \ncomment on the excellence and the persistence with which the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas has pursued the problem of conflict \nof interest.\n  I would like to ask my distinguished friend one question. In S. 343, \nin connection with peer review, it is provided that in peer review, \nthat\n\n       shall not exclude any person with substantial and relevant \n     expertise as a participant on the basis that such a person \n     has a potential interest in the outcome if such interest \n\n[[Page S 9896]]\n     is fully disclosed to the agency and the agency includes such \n     disclosure as part of the record, unless the result of the \n     review would have a direct and predictable effect on a \n     substantial financial interest of such person.\n\n  It is my understanding that your amendment has no effect or impact on \nthat section; is that correct?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, let me respond to my friend from Delaware \nby stating, in the original draft of the amendment, we did not \nspecifically exclude peer review. However, in the latest draft, which \nis pending before the Senate, we now have a sentence that states:\n\n       This section shall not apply to provisions of section \n     633(g) . . .\n\n  And I believe that is the peer review section. So peer review is not \nin any way involved in this proposal that I am submitting. I thank the \nSenator for asking that clarifying question.\n  Mr. ROTH. That was my understanding, and I appreciate the answer.\n  I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. I will be happy to accept on our side also.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I may say just a word in thanks to the \nSenator from Ohio and the Senator from Delaware, two extremely capable \nSenators that I have had the privilege of working with in the Senate, \nmore specifically in the Governmental Affairs Committee, for a lot of \nyears. I want to thank them for their endorsement, their kind words, \npatience and perseverance and for them accepting this amendment, \nendorsing it. I will always be grateful.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. The question \nis on agreeing to the amendment No. 1537.\n  So the amendment (No. 1537) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas was to offer the next amendment. The Senator from Texas is \napparently not here. Therefore, under the previous order, the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin is now recognized to offer his second amendment. The \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1538 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n    (Purpose: To provide that an agency may include any person with \n  substantial and relevant expertise to participate on a peer review \n                                 panel)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] for himself and \n     Mr. Pryor, proposes an amendment numbered 1538 to amendment \n     No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 57, strike out line 18 through line 25 and insert \n     in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(B) may exclude any person with substantial and relevant \n     expertise as a participant on the basis that such person has \n     a potential financial interest in the outcome, or may include \n     such person if such interest is fully disclosed to the \n     agency, and the agency includes such disclosure as part of \n     the record, unless the result of the review would have a \n     direct and predictable effect on a substantial financial \n     interest of such person:\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there are many principles I can support \nin the Dole-Johnston legislation, but I do have a serious concern about \npart of the peer review proposal. It is not one of the larger issues at \nwork here, but it is one I feel could have a great deal of impact on \nthe integrity and credibility of the Federal regulatory process.\n  Section 633 of the Dole-Johnston legislation includes a provision \nthat requires the Federal agencies to develop a systematic program for \nbalanced, independent and external peer review that is to be utilized \nto review the scientific risk assessments performed under the \nrequirements of the legislation.\n  I understand that several Senators have serious concerns about the \nlarger issue of peer review and how it is treated in this legislation. \nThere may be a broader amendment offered on that later, though. But the \nconcern of this particular amendment has to do with the few lines \ncontained in the peer review section of the bill that will put new \nguidelines and requirements on Federal agencies as they go about \ndetermining who will serve and who will not serve on these peer review \npanels.\n  It is my understanding that, periodically, a Federal agency is faced \nwith a situation where an individual has been selected as a possible \npeer reviewer and later it is learned that the individual may stand to \nbenefit financially, depending on the outcome of that particular peer \nreview.\n  For example, the person might be a scientist under the employment of \na company or industry that has a considerable financial interest that \nis dependent on the outcome of the review. That is a conflict of \ninterest, and the type that I understand is not all that uncommon of an \noccurrence in our regulatory process. It is kind of important to \nunderstand how current law operates with respect to these kinds of \nsituations.\n  Mr. President, under current law, the agencies have the discretion to \ndetermine if someone with a direct conflict of interest should be able \nto serve on a peer review. As I said, this is permitted sometimes \nbecause there are instances where it may be appropriate and necessary \nto allow individuals with conflicts of interest to serve on a \nparticular peer review panel.\n  However, the Dole-Johnston legislation would go further. It would \nactually usurp the discretion currently enjoyed by the agencies and \nexpressly state that an agency cannot actually disqualify someone \nmerely because they may stand to benefit financially from the outcome \nof the review. This language is on page 57 of the bill.\n  There are three effects of this section. The first effect--the one I \nam trying to amend--is that an agency will no longer have the \ndiscretion to determine on their own whether an individual with a \nconflict of interest should or should not be permitted to serve on the \npanel. The second effect is that should an individual have a conflict \nof interest, the individual must be permitted to serve on the peer \nreview panel so long as the conflict of interest is disclosed and is \nmade part of the record. The result of this is, I believe, at least an \nimprovement that you are going to have the disclosure.\n  I credit the folks that put this together in that regard. But there \nis an area where I think the agencies should have discretion. The \nbottom line is that if someone has a conflict of interest and is \nserving on a panel, that should be part of the record.\n  But there is a further effect. The third effect of the Dole-Johnston \nlanguage is that the only instance where an agency could exclude an \nindividual with a conflict of interest is in the very narrow situation \nwhere the result of the review would have a direct and predictable \neffect on a substantial financial interest of such person.\n  Now, what is a direct and predictable effect? That is a good \nquestion. Under current law, agency officials would be permitted to \ntake a close look at this case and determine if there was enough cause \nplaced on the ties of the individual and the industry being regulated \nto perhaps exclude the individual from the peer review panel. But under \nthis legislation, as it now stands, the only instance in which an \nagency could exclude such an individual is to establish that the \nindividual would predictably and directly benefit from the outcome of \nthe peer review panel.\n  The fact is that not all financial benefits are predictable and/or \ndirect. The amendment I am now offering will change the Dole-Johnston \nlanguage on this issue so that agencies will be allowed to continue to \nemploy peer reviewers with a conflict of interest, at their own \ndiscretion, provided that the conflict of interest is disclosed and \nmade part of the record.\n  So the agencies would continue to be allowed to determine on their \nown when it is appropriate or not to allow someone with a conflict of \ninterest to serve on a review panel. However, \n\n[[Page S 9897]]\nshould the agency decide to allow such an individual to serve on a \nreview panel, my amendment would make it mandatory for the conflict of \ninterest to be disclosed and be made a part of the record.\n  Finally, my amendment makes clear that there is just one circumstance \nin which the agencies will have no discretion as to who can be included \nor excluded from serving, and that in the situation I mentioned before, \nwhere a potential peer reviewer will directly and predictably benefit \nfrom the outcome of the review. In that case, the agency has to exclude \nthe person. I am afraid that the Dole-Johnston bill, as currently \nwritten, will undermine the part of the regulatory process that is \nresponsible for ensuring that risk assessments are performed in an \nobjective and impartial manner.\n  My amendment is strongly supported by the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 53 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In short, let me say that my amendment preserves what \nworks in current law and combines it with the progressive disclosure \nrequirements of the Dole-Johnston bill. This will ensure that we have a \nreview process that is fair, equitable and free from any unnecessary \ninfluence from the industries and entities that are the subject of the \nregulation.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nDelaware has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. We have just received the language of the distinguished \nSenator's amendment. I would like to address some questions to the \nSenator from Wisconsin. As I understand, you are striking out the \nwords, ``shall not exclude'' and inserting in lieu thereof, ``shall \npermit the agency to include.''\n  Now, it is my understanding that your amendment would allow an agency \nto include an individual on a peer review panel that may have an \ninterest in the outcome of the review, is that correct?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I may respond, the version that we \nhave submitted is different than the one the Senator has before him. \nThe language we have submitted indicates the following:\n\n       The agency may exclude any person with substantial and \n     relevant expertise as a participant on the basis that such \n     person has a potential financial interest in the outcome, or \n     may include. . .\n\n  So the agency is allowed the option of either including or excluding \na person who has a conflict of interest in the version we sent up to \nthe desk.\n  Mr. ROTH. We apparently do not have a copy of that version of the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I regret to say that we just received this modified \nlanguage, and we have not had an opportunity to study this matter to \ndetermine exactly what its implications may be. So if it is all right \nwith the leader, I think maybe we ought to set this aside for a moment \nso that we will have the opportunity to review the language and then \nproceed.\n  Instead of that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I ask unanimous consent that the time not be counted against either \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I have two \namendments here that have been cleared. One is proposed by Mr. Baucus \nand myself.\n  It would change ``shall'' to ``may'' in that provision of the bill \nthat states that the authorizing committee may submit to the \nAppropriations Committee changes in the schedule, and that the \nAppropriations Committee then--now it reads ``shall propose those \namendments to the Senate.'' And we want to change that ``shall'' to \n``may.''\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Can the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana say what he is proposing at this time?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I have not proposed it yet. I am proposing an amendment \nthat I thought had been cleared on all sides. It changes--\n  Mr. ROTH. I have not seen it, and we are looking at another amendment \nat this time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thought it had been cleared.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me point out that there is absolutely no \nintention in S. 343 to undermine the integrity of the peer review \nprocess.\n  While I think the concerns of Senator Feingold are unwarranted, I \nbelieve that we are willing to accept the amendment.\n  As I understand the amendment, the Senator is first saying that we \nmay exclude any person with substantial and relevant expertise as a \nparticipant, on the basis that such a person has a potential financial \ninterest in the outcome. But the Senator is also providing that such \nperson may be included if his interest is fully disclosed to the agency \nand the agency includes such disclosure as part of the record.\n  So, as I understand it, the Senator is trying to be more evenhanded \non the matter. Is that correct?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  I want to be fair and make it clear, there is only one exception to \nthat. That would require that the agency not be allowed to let the \nperson stay on in the case where the result would have a direct, \npredictable effect. So a more extreme case, there is no discretion, but \nwe restore the discretion in the more common conflict-of-interest case. \nThat provision is in the Dole-Johnston provision.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, as I understand it, this would add some \njudgment to it. This would let the agency have leeway in determining a \nbalance, and keep the expertise.\n  I believe that is the intent. I am happy to accept it on our side.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am willing to accept the amendment and \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Delaware, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 1538.\n  The amendment (No. 1538) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1536\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8 minutes remaining on the debate on \nAmendment 1536.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to be clear that we have \naccepted Senator Feingold's amendment on the Equal Access to Justice \nAct with reluctance. This is a controversial matter and I still have \nmany concerns. However, as a show of good faith and willingness to work \nwith the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin in the future, we have \nallowed his amendment to pass without comment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 1536.\n  The amendment (No. 1536) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1535\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 1535. Sixteen minutes remain on the debate.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, we had four amendments. \nWe have accepted the two Feingold amendments and the Pryor amendment, \n\n[[Page S 9898]]\nwhich leaves the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Mississippi, Senator \nLott, will be here momentarily. He has 13 minutes. The Senator from New \nJersey has 3 minutes. If he is not here momentarily, we will yield back \nhis time. Then I will move to table the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi has 7 minutes remaining. The Senator \nfrom New Jersey has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after that 10 minutes, then we would be \nprepared to go to a vote on the pending Lautenberg amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. After all time is expired.\n  If the Senator will suspend, Members who are conversing in the aisle \nwill take their conversations to the cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be heard tonight in this brief time \nwe have remaining against the Lautenberg amendment. I understand, after \nthe remarks have been made in the next 8 minutes, there will be a \nmotion to table this amendment.\n  The Lautenberg amendment would strike the provision in the \nlegislation to reform the current petition process regarding adding or \ndeleting chemicals on the Toxic Release Inventory referred to as TRI. \nThe TRI is a list of chemicals emitted by industrial facilities.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, can we have order, please? It is hard \nto hear the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. The TRI is a list of chemicals emitted by industrial \nfacilities as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right to \nKnow Act of 1986. The current TRI language in S. 343, which was worked \nout with the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, does not add a new \npetition process.\n  The language merely strengthens the current TRI language to require \nthat the Administrator of the EPA ``shall grant any petition that \nestablishes substantial evidence that the criteria already in the TRI \nlaw either are or are not met.''\n  As we have gone through this process in the last few days, we have \ncontinued, in my opinion, to make changes that are not strengthening \nthe bill. I am not questioning anybody's motives or characterizing the \namendments. There has continued to be a process that I think is not \nstrengthening this legislation.\n  I want to urge my colleagues here tonight to defeat this amendment. \nWhat we are talking about here is sound science. That is all we are \ntrying to do with their TRI provision. To make this process to involve \nreasonable, sound science, a responsible threshold should be used as \nthe standard upon which TRI informs and protects the public.\n  Having said that, what will this toxics release inventory provision \nin the bill not do? I want to emphasize that.\n  The language in the bill has several important, positive features. \nBut it will not automatically remove any chemical currently listed. It \nwill not remove any of the existing criteria for listing. It will not \nprevent further listings of chemicals. It will not repeal the Community \nRight-to-Know Act. It will not require a new and costly risk \nassessment. It will not require a lengthy elaborate cost-benefit \nanalysis.\n  There is a long list of things that this will not do. It will not \nundermine this law.\n  It will require that EPA prove the chemical is a genuine risk before \nit is listed. The provision will not affect the basic integrity of this \nprogram.\n  In fact, I would assert that it enhances the credibility of the TRI \nlisting by only identifying carcinogens that based on reasonable and \nexpected exposure scenarios will present genuine risk to Americans.\n  I, along with my colleagues who have worked on this, feel that TRI is \nan important and useful statute and should be preserved.\n  The change though is focused and directed at only one aspect of the \nstatute. There are three types of listings within this TRI.\n  The first deals with really nasty chemicals; the second concerns \ncarcinogens; and a third deals with chemicals causing environmental \nproblems.\n  Nothing is proposed to change listing or delisting standards for the \nreally nasty chemicals, the bad chemicals, we all agree should be \nidentified and listed.\n  However, a new criteria is combined with the existing standard for \nlisting in the two remaining categories.\n  A factor which concerns possible exposure by the public in dosages \nwhich are hazardous will be added to existing criteria.\n  This improves a TRI listing by providing the public with accurate and \nmore complete information while avoiding unnecessarily alarming the \npublic.\n  If a chemical is not toxic in any scientific sense, why grossly \nmislead the public and divert resources to this nonrisk?\n  This, in my opinion, is a regulatory abuse, the kind of thing we have \nbeen talking about and debating back and forth all week.\n  I believe the American public has a right to complete and accurate \ninformation. They should not be given incomplete or politicized \nmisinformation.\n  Those who want to remove this provision, in my opinion, are not \nenhancing the protection offered. In fact, while it is not their \nintent, it may actually lead to misleading information.\n  When Congress passed the Right-to-Know Act in 1986, it did not \nenvision that EPA would only consider wild scenarios. But after nearly \na decade of considering just these type of scenarios, it has come time \nI think for Congress to deal with some of the actions that EPA has been \ntaking. And there is one area where we really need it. Let me read what \nEPA itself has said in its own words. It says there is--\n\n       . . . some confusion about roles and the relationship of \n     emissions inventory, hazard assessment, exposure assessment \n     and risk assessment in the development of the TRI listings \n     and subsequent uses of the TRI data . . . sometimes \n     misinterpreted to imply that they are direct measurements of \n     exposure and risk.\n\n  This came from EPA's own Science Advisory Board in a letter to Carol \nBrowner just 5 months ago.\n  I believe Americans will benefit by a more accurate and valid TRI \nlisting. However, there are those who want to perpetuate a process \nwhich misleads as to the risks that are involved and ignoring \nscientific common sense.\n  I firmly believe that the additional standard will make TRI more \naccountable, and I urge that the amendment to delete this language in \nthe bill be defeated.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield whatever time I might have for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I was going to say under the present law \nthe EPA interprets its statute, or feels it must interpret their \nstatute, in such a way as to have no discretion if there is a chemical \nwhich is known to cause chronic health effects. Ordinary table solvent, \nmentioned earlier, can cause chronic health effects, hypertension, \npoison, et cetera. They have not listed that chemical solvent. But they \nfeel that they have no discretion if it causes that, and they have to \nlist those kind of chemicals.\n  All we want to do is put ``the rule of reason'' in interpreting those \nrules. Is that is correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to point out one thing before \nwe respond directly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will Members standing and talking carry their \nconversations to the cloakroom?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank you, Mr. President. It is the end of a long \nday. People are restless. But we have an important matter to settle \nhere. \n\n[[Page S 9899]]\n\n  The fact of the matter is that this has been a very successful \nprogram. We have reduced in 5 years 40 percent of the toxic materials \nemitted. We have go from 4.8 billion pounds a year down to 2.8 billion \npounds a year, a reduction of 2 billion pounds being released into the \natmosphere, the water, the land, whatever waste stream the company \nchooses.\n  Why is it necessary to change it? Mr. President, it is obvious to me. \nIt is necessary to change it to accommodate someone who does not like \nthe chemical that is listed there. We are not talking about chewing gum \nhere. We are talking about chemicals that now are listed as chronic. \nThese chemicals can cause cancer, teratogenic defects, serious or \nirreversible reproductive dysfunctions, neurological disorders, \nheritable genetic mutations, and other chronic health effects.\n  What the Senator from Mississippi wants to do is say unless two-\nthirds of this list--that is the reality--meet the acute test that none \nof those conditions that I just mentioned should permit those materials \nto be listed.\n  These are toxics that are listed here. I would submit to you that it \nwould be a pity to say to the American public that we are taking away \nthe sunshine. We ask you now to accept the ``right to know''--not go \nfrom the ``right to know'' to the ``right to know nothing.'' It is a \nlaw that has very little demand. All they have to do--the manufacturer, \nthe transports--is list the chemicals that you emit into the air, list \nthe chemicals that you emit into the water; list the toxics that you \nstore in wasteland fills.\n  Mr. President, there is very little here that has a negative effect. \nWe have reduced the amount of exposure that our people have to suffer. \nThe thing works well. To leave it there now when this is not a matter \nof regulation--this is a matter of governance. I think it would be a \nmistake honestly to continue to leave the language in there that would \neliminate a program that has been very, very successful. If we are \ngoing to eliminate it, it ought to be through the process of hearings \nand committees and the legislative process instead of sweeping it all \nunder the pretense that we are making regulation and making life easier \nfor our citizens.\n  As a matter of fact, it makes life considerably more hazardous.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and hope that my colleagues will \nnot agree to tabling this amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate to my colleagues this will \nbe the only vote tonight because we were able to take three of the \namendments, the Pryor amendment, and two Feingold amendments we were \nable to work out and accept. So there will just be this one vote.\n  As I understand, Senator Hutchison may be prepared to offer her \namendment, at least the debate tonight on her amendment. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We are almost there. Maybe after the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is a possibility. So we would like, if we could do \nthat tonight, to finish the debate on the Hutchison amendment, and then \nwe would have a vote on that tomorrow morning. But we would have that \nvote at the same time we have a vote on the Glenn amendment, which will \nbe around 11 a.m.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. At 11:15.\n  Mr. DOLE. Whatever. If all time is used. I do not think we need 2 \nhours for sunshine.\n  In any event, I just advise Members this is the last vote tonight.\n  There will be votes tomorrow throughout the day, and I would tell my \ncolleagues the first vote will probably be around 10:45, 11:00, 11:15 \nin the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to table the \nAmendment No. 1535. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas be permitted to offer her amendment, \nlay it down, and it will become the pending business when we come back \nin tomorrow. Tonight we will set it aside for the Glenn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1539 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n(Purpose: To protect against the unfair imposition of civil or criminal \n             penalties for the alleged violation of rules)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Heflin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1539 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenators Heflin, Hatch, Nickles, Craig, and Lott, as well as myself. It \nis the Hutchison-Heflin amendment.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that we will debate tomorrow. It \nis an amendment that is going to try to put into the Administrative \nProcedure Act parameters that would not allow an agency to \nretroactively penalize a business that does not have reasonable notice \nof a regulation. So I think it is going to be an important amendment. I \nthink we will have good bipartisan support for it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we lay it aside.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object. In \nthe original version of this that we asked the Department of Justice to \ncheck out they had objections, and the only reason we cannot debate it \ntonight is there have been substantial changes made to the original, as \nI understand it. We are asking Justice to give us an overnight read on \nthose so we can bring it up tomorrow and see if the changes made were \nadequate, or whether we have to try and debate some change in that. \nThat is the reason it will be put over until tomorrow. We are glad to \naccommodate the Senator from Texas on this.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio is correct \nthat there were objections. I think a number of those have been taken \ncare of. I hope that by tomorrow, perhaps, we can have a short debate \nor even have an acceptance of the amendment. I feel that we have \naddressed many of the concerns in that letter. So we can take it up \ntomorrow and go from there.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe temporarily set aside so we can address the Glenn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to announce to all Members of our \nbody that we are going to dispose of the Glenn amendment tonight.\n  Therefore, we could have votes before 11 tomorrow, I have been \ninformed by the leader.\n  All Members should be aware we could have a vote or more.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Repeat that please.\n  Mr. HATCH. Because we are going to accept the Glenn amendment \ntonight, and the Hutchison amendment is laid down, Members should \nbecome aware that we could have votes before 11 tomorrow.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have a longstanding doctor's \nappointment at 9 o'clock, and could be here by 10:30. Could the Senator \nhelp me on this? I can be here around 10:30. My guess is it would be \nhard to have a vote before 11, anyway.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The only amendment I know that might be ripe for a vote \nis possibly Hutchison.\n  Senator Glenn has 45 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. HATCH. We will certainly try and accommodate the Senator. I \ncannot make that promise. We will do our best.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1540 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n(Purpose: To ensure public accountability in the regulatory process by \n      establishing ``sunshine'' procedures for regulatory review)\n\n  Mr. GLENN.

Mr. President, we have supported regulatory review in \nterms of cost-benefit analysis and OMB review of agency rules. During \nthe 1980's, we had a lot of controversy about OMB interference with \nagency decisions, special access by lobbyists, and finally about \nsecrecy in the Council on Competitiveness.\n  We, throughout all of this on the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nstood for open sunshine, nothing that was going to stop OMB review, and \nwe wanted to introduce fairness.\n  The sunshine language in the Glenn-Chafee bill is consistent with the \nClinton administration Executive order, \n\n[[Page S 9901]]\nconsistent with recommendations of the administrative conference of the \nU.S., also very similar to the OMB public disclosure procedures that \nCarl Levin, one of the cosponsors of this, negotiated with the Bush \nadministration back in 1986.\n  We have a long history on this. We introduced sunshine legislation in \nseveral Congresses.\n  This year's language is a streamlined version of those bills, less \nstrict, avoids criticism--like detailed logging requirements and early \npre-rulemaking release of internal documents. Those requirements are \nnot in this language.\n  But the provisions have two basic parts. First, OMB responsibilities, \nthey must disclose to the public information about the status of rules \nunder review. We need this to enforce the review time limits.\n  Two, OMB must release regulatory review documents and comments to \nagencies as they come in, and to the public; once a rule is proposed, \nagency and OMB analysis and other regular review documents are included \nand documents of people outside of government, records of \nconversations, meetings, review decisions.\n  The second part involves the responsibilities of the rulemaking \nagency. Each agency must keep a publication of rules under review at \nOMB. This matches the OMB lists and is needed to enforce the review \ntime limits.\n  These requirements work. The Clinton administration abides by almost \nidentical procedures now, and given past problems and requirements, the \nnew regulatory reform bill, we should start with an open process.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment. It is my understanding that the \nother side has agreed to accept this amendment.\n  I am certain that Senator Levin, my cosponsor on this, who has done \nas much work in this area through the years as anybody in the Congress, \nand I am sure he has some remarks to make.\n  I am glad to yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank my friend, the Senator \nfrom Ohio, for his tremendous leadership on this issue. He has kept at \nthe forefront, and as a result we will adopt this very important \namendment on openness tonight.\n  This issue began back in 1981 when President Reagan issued Executive \norder 12291, requiring review by the OMB, of all significant rules--\nproposed and final.\n  I favored Presidential oversight because I like accountability in the \nrulemaking process. But that process was being done behind closed \ndoors. We could not even tell the public or find out if or when a rule \nwas being reviewed by OMB. Only insiders with the right phone numbers \non their rolodex knew what was going on.\n  We had hearing after hearing, document requests, battles in the press \nand on the Senate floor, over the critical issue of making the OMB \nreview process subject to the same public disclosure requirements that \nwe impose on rulemaking agencies.\n  It finally took a threat to shut down the dollars for OIRA, the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the office in the OMB \nwhich conducts the review.\n  Now what we finally got was a policy from OIRA in 1986 from this \nadministrator Wendy Gramm in the form of the so-called Gramm memo. That \nopened the door a bit, an important bit, and put written comments in a \nrecord of meetings in a public rulemaking file.\n  We still did not get the public's right-to-know if and when a rule \nwas at OMB for review. But it was at that time, a big step forward.\n  The Clinton administration has issued a new Executive order in 1993 \nthat provided an excellent process for making the OMB review process \nopen to the public.\n  This bill, the bill now that is before the Senate for consideration, \nprovides statutory authority for the President to review rules. It does \nnot, however, provide for any of the openness requirements that we now \nhave in the Executive order and for which we have worked so hard.\n  This amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio puts those disclosure \nrequirements in law. It is an important amendment. There are also, \nthese requirements in the Glenn-Chafee substitute, as there were in the \nRoth bill as reported unanimously by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Again, I want to thank the Senator from Ohio for his stalwart \nleadership on this openness issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Ohio would \nanswer a couple of questions.\n  On page 2 of his amendment, on subsection (C) it states that there \nmust be a record of all oral communications relating to the substance \nof a regulatory action between the director or other designated officer \nand any person not employed by the executive branch of the Federal \nGovernment, and then it also in subparagraph 3 on the same page talks \nabout disclosure to the regulatory agency on a timely basis of a record \nof all communications, et cetera.\n  Now, my question is, does a record of all oral communications mean \nlike a log of calls with a subject matter; or does that mean like a \ntranscript or a summary of the substance of everything that is said?\n  Mr. GLENN. No, not a transcript. This would be rather, who called, \nand the general subject of the conversation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Like I called you about this amendment. To satisfy that \nrecord, you would say the date; call from Johnston; subject is sunshine \namendment. Would that satisfy?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. So, the Senator does not mean by a ``record,'' either a \ntranscript or a summary, but name, date, time, subject matter.\n  Mr. GLENN. General subject, that is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GLENN.\n   Mr. President, the amendment I am offering is required to provide \nsunshine during regulatory review. This amendment is needed to maintain \npublic accountability and trust in government.\n\n  While not a central part of the regulatory reform legislation, the \nbill's Executive oversight provisions ensure that compliance with the \nmany requirements of the bill will be monitored and enforced through \nOMB regulatory review. This power must be exercised in the light of \nday.\n  We have had a lot of experience with OMB regulatory review over the \nlast 15 years. While I think that that review is needed to ensure good \ncost-benefit analysis by the agencies, it should not be used for \nundisclosed lobbying, pressure, and delay. Unfortunately, it has been \nused for those things. We need to put sunshine procedures into law so \nthat it will not happen again.\n  Let me review how we got to this point.\n  A key component of the regulatory process under the Administrative \nProcedure Act [APA] is the requirement that agencies must work to \ninvolve interested parties in the development of rulemaking decisions.\n  Agencies must give the public notice of its proposals, solicit \ncomments on them, and consider those comments in making final \nrulemaking decisions. This public participation has always been key to \nprotecting the integrity of government agency decisions. It has also \nbeen key to creating the agency record that is reviewed by a court upon \na challenge to an agency's final rule decision.\n  These APA public participation principles were largely sufficient for \nmany years. Over the last 20 years, however, the development of \ncentralized regulatory review has created a new layer of \ndecisionmaking, whereby agency regulatory proposals could be reviewed \nand changed before being published for public notice and comment.\n  This regulatory review process, which was created by Presidential \nExecutive order, has been the driving force for cost-benefit analysis \nin agency rulemaking. I have always supported that purpose. In fact, it \nis the potential good that OMB has shown can be provided by cost-\nbenefit analysis and risk assessment that brings us to debate the \npresent legislation. We are building on OMB's regulatory review \nexperience in an effort to place these requirements in law for all \nagencies. I support that purpose. And I am glad that OMB has been here \nover the years helping to develop the principles of cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk assessment.\n  Unfortunately, the OMB regulatory review experience has not been \nwithout its problems. In addition to regulatory analysis, the OMB \nprocess is useful for simply coordinating policies among the \n\n[[Page S 9902]]\nvarious agencies and ensuring consistency with Presidential priorities. \nWhile this, too, is a valid purpose, it proved a useful avenue for \nsecret lobbying, political pressure on agencies, and delays of agency \ndecisions. This is not what regulatory review should be about.\n  Congressional hearings over the last 10 years or more have \nhighlighted complaints about OMB's role in regulations relating to \ninfant formula, lead, ethylene oxide, drinking water, underground \nstorage of toxic chemicals, grain dust, and more. Several court \ndecisions have also focused on some of these cases.\n  The former OMB Director, Richard Darman, even testified before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in 1989 that ``OMB had abused the \nprocess by using delay as a substantive tool'' to control agency \ndecisions.\n  In 1991, our committee had many of the same complaints with regard to \nthe Council on Competitiveness, which was chaired by Vice President \nQuayle, and was supervising the OMB regulatory review process. There \nwere a lot of charges about secret lobbying a lot of refusals to \ndisclose who was meeting with Council representatives on current \nregulatory proposals.\n  I do not believe the solution to these closed processes is to outlaw \nthem. Regulatory review is useful and should not be curtailed. But it \nshould be more open. With openness the process can go forward and the \nAmerican people can be confident in knowing that no secret dealings are \ngoing on behind closed doors.\n  Through the years of our oversight in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, there has been considerable disagreement in the committee \nabout how much sunshine is needed and at what stages in the process. \nThe committee has, however, always agreed on the need for sunshine and \npublic confidence in the regulatory process. In the consideration of S. \n291, Senator Roth's regulatory reform bill that was supported \nunanimously by Democrats and Republican in our committee, we arrived at \na set of requirements that were acceptable to all. They were reduced in \nscope from earlier proposals I have made. They are consistent with \nrecommendations of the Administrative Conference of the United States \nand provisions in current regulatory review order (E.O. 12866). These \nprovisions include openness procedures instituted by OMB in 1986.\n  In other words, while some past proposals have been criticized as too \nintrusive into the prerogatives of the Chief Executive, the sunshine \nprovisions in S. 291 work without raising past concerns. There were no \ncomplaints in committee about intrusion into executive privilege. Past \ncriticisms about forcing early disclosure of information during \nregulatory review was resolved by putting off disclosure until after \nthe completion of regulatory review. Earlier complaints about undue \nadministrative burden, such as detailed logging requirements, were also \naddressed by matching requirements to those currently employed by OMB.\n  The Glenn/Chafee bill, S. 1001, contains the exact sunshine \nprovisions of S. 291. The amendment I offer today is almost identical \nto that language--it is only modified in order to fit into the \nstructure of S. 343. Without this amendment, S. 343 has no public \nprotections during regulatory review. I believe that is a fundamental \nflaw that needs to be addressed. I believe that our bipartisan \nGovernmental Affairs sunshine provisions provide the needed solution.\n  The amendment has two sets of requirements--one for OMB, and one set \nfor the rulemaking agencies.\n  First, OMB must disclose to the public information about the status \nof rules undergoing review. This means that the public should be able \nto learn from OMB what agency regulatory actions are under review. As a \npractical matter, this would entail the production of a single monthly \nlisting of proposed rules under review--as OMB currently prepares \npursuant to E.O. 12866. In this way, the legislation would merely \ncreate a statutory right to information now provided under Presidential \nExecutive order.\n  Second, the public must have access, no later than the date of \npublication of the proposed or final rule, to: (A) Written \ncommunications exchanged between OMB and the rulemaking agency. These \nwould include draft rules and related analyses; (B) Written \ncommunications between OMB and non-governmental parties relating to the \nsubstance of a rule; (C) A record of oral communications between OMB \nand non-governmental parties relating to the substance of a rule--as \nin, who called, when, and on what subject; and (D) A written \nexplanation of any review action and the date of such action.\n  Each one of these requirements is currently the practice of OMB. \nAgain, we expect that these requirements will entail the continuation \nof the current OMB practice of maintaining regulatory review files in a \npublic reading room.\n  Third, as a counterpart to public disclosure, OMB is required to send \nrelevant information to the rulemaking agency to ensure the compilation \nof a full and accurate rulemaking record. OMB must send to the agency: \n(A) Written communications between OMB and non-governmental parties; \n(B) A description of oral communications, and an invitation to \nparticipate in meetings, relating to the substance of a regulatory \naction between the reviewer and any person not employed by the \nexecutive branch of the Federal Government; and (C) A written \nexplanation of any review action.\n  The second part of the amendment requires agencies to: First, give \npublic notice about rules undergoing regulatory review; and second, \ndescribe regulatory review decisions in the relevant rulemaking \nnotices.\n  With these procedures, we should be able to put behind us much of the \nrancor and criticism that dogged OMB regulatory review during the past \n15 years. The Clinton administration has taken an important step in \napplying these procedures in its Executive order. The time is now for \nCongress also to close the book on this issue. We are taking a \nsignificant step forward in moving regulatory reform legislation and in \norder to be successful, it must be accompanied by sunshine.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we do have some concerns about this \namendment on this side. We have some constitutional concerns and some \nothers.\n  We are willing to accept this amendment tonight on the basis that we \ncontinue to work with our distinguished colleague and friend from Ohio \nand others, and we are trying to accommodate over here. So we are \nprepared to accept the amendment if the Senator will urge it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1540) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield? May \nI ask my colleague if we have cleared the Heflin amendment yet? Senator \nHeflin wanted to make Section 706 of the APA applicable to appeals from \nthe court of claims.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding it has not been cleared yet but it \nis being worked on.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9880-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9902-S9903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                         DETENTION OF HARRY WU\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, by now most of America knows of the unjust \ndetention of Harry Wu by the People's Republic of China. Harry Wu is an \nAmerican citizen and human rights crusader. Since June 19, 1995, he has \nbeen detained in China. Consular access to detained American citizens \nis required to be granted within 48 hours under the terms of a 1982 \nagreement with China. But China did not grant access to Mr. Wu until \nJuly 10--21 days later. On July 9, Harry Wu was charged with offenses \nwhich could carry the death sentence.\n  Harry Wu was traveling on a valid American passport, with a valid \nChinese visa. There seems little doubt that he was targeted by the \nChinese Government for his outspoken and brave efforts to describe \nChinese human rights \n\n[[Page S 9903]]\nabuses. Mr. Wu himself suffered almost two decades of imprisonment in \nthe Chinese gulag. His continued imprisonment is an affront to all \nfreedom loving people.\n  Mr. President, our relationship with China is at a critical \ncrossroads. Our relations with China are at the lowest point in years, \nand the list of disputed issues is long: proliferation, human rights, \nTaiwan and trade. We must, however, choose our course carefully. As \nHenry Kissinger said this morning before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee: ``The danger of the existing roller coaster towards \nconfrontation to both China and the United States is incalculable.'' I \nshare Dr. Kissinger's concern over the dangers of a full-scale \nconfrontation.\n  But just as we must not casually move toward a conflict that serves \nneither country, we cannot remain silent in the face of outrageous \nconduct. The most fundamental duty of Government is to protect\n the rights of its citizens--and Harry Wu is an American citizen. I \nurge the Chinese to release Harry Wu, and remove this latest flashpoint \nin our relations.\n\n  A major United Nations Conference on Women is scheduled for September \nin Beijing. I agree with the bipartisan view recently expressed by my \nRepublican colleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and the Democratic \nCongressman from Indiana, Lee Hamilton, when they suggested the United \nNations should quit wasting scarce resources on conferences that spend \nmuch and achieve little.\n  I understand the administration plans to send a senior delegation, \nincluding two Cabinet officers. In my view, it would be wrong for the \nUnited States to participate in the United Nations Women's Conference \nat any level or in any fashion as long as Harry Wu is held. This \nmorning, along with Speaker Gingrich, Chairman Helms, Chairman Gilman, \nand Helsinki Commission Co-Chairs Senator D'Amato and Congressman Chris \nSmith, I sent a letter to President Clinton urging a U.S. boycott of \nthe U.N. Women's Conference as long as Harry Wu is detained. In my \nview, that is the least this Government can do to try to show our \ndispleasure with China's action. It is also the only prudent course in \nlight of the State Department's briefing that they could not guarantee \nthe safety of Americans traveling to the conference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter, and a copy of a \nWall Street Journal article by Nina Shea, ``Free Harry Wu'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our support \n     for your efforts to secure the release of Harry Wu. It is \n     unconscionable that an American citizen traveling on a valid \n     passport with a valid Chinese visa was arrested, detained and \n     charged in violation of accepted international law. \n     Furthermore, it is an outrage that access to Mr. Wu by \n     American officials was not granted according to the terms of \n     the U.S.-P.R.C. Consular Convention of 1982.\n       Harry Wu has undertaken heroic efforts to expose Chinese \n     human rights abuses. For almost two decades, he suffered from \n     the ravages of China's prison system. Today, Harry Wu is once \n     again subject to China's closed prison system, and there are \n     concerns about his health and safety.\n       We are aware that your Administration had planned to \n     participate in the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women, \n     scheduled to be held in September in Beijing. In our view, it \n     would be wholly inappropriate to participate in any \n     international conference in the People's Republic of China \n     while an American citizen is being unjustly detained by the \n     Chinese government. There is ample precedent to deny American \n     participation in international events which only accord \n     prestige to regimes which deserve condemnation--the boycott \n     of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow in the aftermath of the \n     invasion of Afghanistan comes to mind.\n       Accordingly, we urge you to announce the United States \n     government will not participate--at any level or in any \n     fashion--in the upcoming United Nations Conference on Women \n     as long as Harry Wu is detained in China. Anything less would \n     send a tragic signal of disregard for the human rights of an \n     American citizen.\n           Sincerely,\n     Newt Gingrich.\n     Ben Gilman.\n     Chris Smith.\n     Bob Dole.\n     Jesse Helms.\n     Alfonse D'Amato.\n                                                                    ____\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 3, 1995]\n\n                             Free Harry Wu\n\n                             (By Nina Shea)\n\n       On June 19, Harry Wu, a 58-year-old American, was arrested \n     by Chinese authorities at the Kazakhstan border. Mr. Wu's \n     passport was in order and he had recently been issued a \n     Chinese entry visa, valid until Sept. 11, 1995. No \n     outstanding charges or arrest warrants were pending against \n     him. No incriminating evidence was found on him or his \n     American traveling companion at the time of the arrest. No \n     charges have been made public against him to date. While his \n     companion has been expelled from China, he remains held \n     incommunicado at an undisclosed location.\n       The reason the Chinese are detaining Mr. Wu is obvious. In \n     his book ``The Power of the Powerless,'' Vaclav Havel wrote \n     that ``living the truth'' is ``the fundamental threat'' to \n     the post-totalitarian system, and thus it is ``suppressed \n     more severely than anything else.'' Mr. Wu is a bald critic \n     of the repressive human-rights policies of Beijing, and the \n     Chinese fear nothing more than the truth he witnesses.\n       Mr. Wu made a daring trip to China last year to conduct \n     independent investigations into the forcible removal of \n     prisoner organs for transplant and the export of prisoner-\n     produced goods to the U.S. His award-winning documentation \n     aired on American and British television. Mr. Wu's \n     autobiography, ``Bitter Winds,'' is a devastating expose of \n     the Chinese prison work camps, or laogai. Mr. Wu knew well of \n     what he wrote; after criticizing the Soviet invasion of \n     Hungary. He was arrested at the age of 23 for being a \n     ``rightist,'' a charge that was ``corrected'' at the time of \n     his release in 1979, after he had served 19 years in the \n     laogai.\n       Harry Wu is a hero of our time. He is a human rights \n     dissident of the stature of\n      Mr. Havel, Andrei Sakharov and Anatoly Shcharansky. Like \n     them, he suffered for his principles and spoke of the \n     atrocities of dictatorship from personal experience. And \n     like them, he risked all to give relentless voice to \n     others who are victimized into silence. Through the Laogai \n     Institute, the human rights group he founded, Mr. Wu has \n     painstakingly tracked down other deeply traumatized, \n     former prisoners of the laogai who are in exile throughout \n     the world, encouraging them and providing them with \n     opportunities to tell their stories.\n       Mr. Wu's last public appearance in the U.S. was at a Puebla \n     Institute-Wethersfield Institute seminar in New York in May, \n     where he briefed American businesses about continuing human \n     rights persecution against Christian churches in China. At a \n     time when the West would rather believe that China, with its \n     new markets, has changed, Mr. Wu would not let it be \n     forgotten that China's one-party Communist political \n     structure and military apparatus remain intact and \n     operational.\n       In New York, he told the American business community: ``The \n     core of the human rights issue in China today is that there \n     is a fundamental machinery for crushing human beings--\n     physically, psychologically and spiritually--called the \n     laogai camp system, of which we have identified, 1,100 \n     separate camps. It is also an integral part of the national \n     economy. Its importance is illustrated by the fact that one \n     third of China's tea is produced in laogai camps. Sixty \n     percent of China's rubber vulcanizing chemicals are produced \n     in a single laogai camp in Shenyang. One of the largest steel \n     pipe works in the country is a laogai camp. I could go on and \n     on. The laogai system is: ``Forced labor is the means;\n      thought reform is the aim.'. . . The laogai is not simply a \n     prison system; it is a political tool for maintaining the \n     Communist Party's totalitarian rule.''\n       For now, Harry Wu has disappeared once again into China's \n     closed penal system. But the U.S. must not forget him. \n     Because he is an American citizen, and because he embodies \n     the best of the indomitable human spirit, the Clinton \n     administration must take extraordinary steps to secure his \n     release. If Mr. Wu is not freed, the U.S. should withdraw \n     from the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women to be held \n     in Beijing in September. This conference is a world-wide \n     summit on the state of human rights as they pertain to women. \n     Since China lost its bid in 1993 to host the Summer Olympics \n     due to its poor human rights record, it has been eager for \n     the prestige accorded a country chosen for this paramount \n     human rights gathering.\n       At the very time China is violating the human rights of a \n     heroic American citizen, it would be nothing less than craven \n     for the U.S. to lend prestige to China by designating a high-\n     level human rights delegation for the Beijing conference--one \n     to be led by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and United \n     Nations Ambassador Madeleine Albright and Timothy Wirth, \n     assistant secretary of state for global affairs. To conduct \n     international diplomatic business-as-usual on the topic of \n     human rights theory as a guest of the very country that is \n     imprisoning, without any human rights, one of our own \n     citizens would be a cynical betrayal, not only of Mr. Wu but \n     of human rights in general.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9902-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S 9904]]\n\n\n      RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT \n             COMMISSION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 65\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the report containing the recommendations of the \nDefense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) pursuant to \nsection 2903 of Public Law 101-510, 104 Stat. 1810, as amended.\n  I hereby certify that I approve all the recommendations contained in \nthe Commission's report.\n  In a July 8, 1995, letter to Deputy Secretary of Defense White \n(attached), Chairman Dixon confirmed that the Commission's \nrecommendations permit the Department of Defense to privatize the work \nloads of the McClellan and Kelly facilities in place or elsewhere in \ntheir respective communities.

A bill to provide increased access to health care benefits, \nto provide increased portability of health care benefits, to provide \nincreased security of health care benefits, to increase the purchasing \npower of individuals and small employers, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                THE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce on behalf of \nmyself, Senators Kennedy, Frist, Gregg, Jeffords, Gorton, Hatch, \nChafee, Pell, Dodd, Simon, Mikulski, Wellstone, and Lieberman, the \nHealth Insurance Reform Act of 1995.\n  This legislation will make it easier for individuals and employers to \nbuy and keep health insurance--even when a family member or employee \nbecomes ill. And it will allow people to change jobs without fear of \nlosing their health coverage.\n  Despite past State and Federal reform efforts, the lack of poor \nportability of health insurance remains a serious concern for many \nAmericans, particularly those with preexisting health conditions. The \nGeneral Accounting Office estimates that as many as 25 million \nAmericans could benefit from this legislation.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act builds upon and strengthens the \ncurrent private insurance market by, one, guaranteeing that private \nhealth insurance coverage will be available, renewable and portable; \ntwo, limiting preexisting condition exclusions; and, three, increasing \nthe purchasing clout of individuals and small employers by creating \nincentives to form private, voluntary coalitions to negotiate with the \nproviders and health plans.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the American people want us to work \ntogether to fix what is broken in the current system without relying on \nbig Government solutions.\n  The legislation we are introducing today does not impose new, \nexpensive regulatory requirements on individuals, employers or States. \nIt does not create new Federal bureaucracies. It does not create any \nnew taxes, spending or price controls nor does it require employers to \npay for health insurance coverage.\n  While this insurance reform legislation alone will not cure all the \nills of the Nation's health care system, it will in some small and \nimportant ways, I believe, promote greater access and security for \nhealth coverage for all Americans by requiring private insurance \ncarriers to compete based on quality, price, and service instead of by \nrefusing to provide coverage to those who are in poor health and who \nneed it the most.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank all of my cosponsors. Senators Gregg, \nFrist, Jeffords, Hatch and Gorton have all contributed a great deal to \nthis effort. Senator Jeffords has worked particularly hard on the group \npurchasing provisions of the legislation. But I want to especially \nrecognize the contributions of the ranking member of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, Senator Kennedy. He has worked, along with \nhis staff, for many hours, in many ways, to help make this legislation \na bipartisan effort. Senator Kennedy has spent many years on the health \ncare agenda working tirelessly to improve the health care delivery \nsystem. And I am particularly pleased that this is such a strong \nbipartisan bill that we are introducing today. It is not a major piece \nof legislation. As I said, it is not going to be the answer to all the \nills in our health care system. But I think it is a very important step \nforward.\n  I am confident that with the support of the other original cosponsors \nand others, the Labor Committee we will be able to report this \nlegislation favorably in the near future and we can begin to move \nforward, on a bipartisan basis, to make private health insurance more \nreadily available, more secure and more affordable for all Americans. \nMr. President, I intend to work with all of my colleagues to ensure \nthat these reforms are enacted during the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I welcome the opportunity \nto join Senator Kassebaum in the introduction of the Health Insurance \nReform Act of 1995. I would like to pay tribute to her leadership in \nthis area which is of enormous concern to the American people--\naddressing the issue of access to health insurance in a way that is \ngoing to be reasonable for working families in this country.\n  Making health insurance available to working Americans means they \nwill be able to receive the kind of high-quality health care that is \npossible in this country--and that care will be available in the inner \ncities and rural communities of this country. Improving access to \nhealth care is one more way of stressing the obvious importance of \nprevention and demonstrating our commitment to the American people, \nparticularly our seniors, to provide them with the security of health \nbenefits in this diverse and complex Nation.\n  Building on the current health care system is incredibly, incredibly \ndifficult and complex. Many of us have been addressing this issue over \na considerable period of time. I think comprehensive reform of the \nsystem is still a very, very worthy objective.\n  But what we have today is something which, I think, is extremely \nimportant. There will be those who say, ``Well, have we lost our goal \nof trying to deal in a comprehensive way? Should we just come back and \ntry to reform the entire system? Let's just wait for the opportunity to \ndo so.''\n  Senator Kassebaum has said, ``Let us try to find common ground and \nlet us try to make progress in areas where progress can be made. And, \nat a time where we do have diversity on a great many issues that are of \nvery great importance and where there is a difference in viewpoint by \nthe American people, expressed by their representatives--let us put \nthat aside and say that it is more important for families in this \ncountry to have access to health care; it is more important to make \nmeaningful progress to try to address their central needs.'' I think \nshe deserves great credit for these initiatives and for working in a \nvery strong, bipartisan way to try to find common ground on an issue \nwhich is going to make a very important and significant difference in \nthe lives of millions of Americans who have preexisting conditions. \nThis bill will help respond to the real needs and anxieties of millions \nof people.\n  Often we debate and discuss the bottom line issues in terms of cost, \nand that is certainly important. But for those who have a disability, \nwe forget that these people live with a sense of fear and anxiety about \nwhat their future holds and whether they will have coverage for their \nhealth needs, or whether they will be locked into a particular work \nsituation. The reforms in this bill let people know that Congress \nbelieves our working Americans deserve opportunities for moving ahead \nin terms of their career and progress for their families--which have \nbeen limited. It also encourages small businesses to work together to \ntry to leverage the system in a positive and constructive way by using \ntheir purchasing power in the economy to negotiate a more reasonable \ncost for health care.\n  So, even though some might consider this a modest step, I think it is \nan extremely important one. And it is one in which I welcome the \nopportunity to work with Senator Kassebaum and to work with Senator \nJeffords, who, as Senator Kassebaum has mentioned, spends a great deal \nof time on this issue. Many others on our committee \n\n[[Page S 9906]]\ndo also. Senator Kassebaum has mentioned our Republican colleagues. I \nwould like to mention our Democratic colleagues as well. Senator \nWellstone has taken a particular interest and has made important \ncontributions. And generally speaking, all of the members spend time \nand are interested in improving this Nation's health care system.\n  Having been honored with chairing the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee last year, I was enormously impressed with the commitment of \nthe members on the committee when we did move towards a markup on \nhealth care. The markup lasted for a period of some 10 days, long days \nfrom 8 or 9 in the morning until 10 at night. We had virtually complete \nattendance of our committee, Republicans and Democrats, all really \nparticipating in that process, all who went through an extraordinary \nlearning experience. And, as a result of that, there were broad areas \nof bipartisan agreement and there were important areas of difference.\n  For a number of reasons, we were unable to reach final legislation in \nthe U.S. Senate. But nonetheless, I think all of us, as legislators, \ntry and learn from past experiences.\n  One that certainly continues to ring in my mind is the real desire in \nthis body by Republicans and Democrats alike to see progress in this \narea. It is enormously obvious the reason why, and that is because this \nis a matter of ongoing central concern to families in this country. We \nall have seen the results of various polls about the budget, about \ndeficits, about taxes, about priorities, about Medicare and Medicaid \ncuts. A variety of opinions are illustrated in newspapers and on radio \nand television across the country.\n  But one element that shows up in all kinds of studies and reviews is \nthe real desire of the American people for Congress to try and find \ncommon ground; to try and make progress; to try and move this process \nforward. We have a very, very important responsibility to try and do \nso.\n  There are naysayers. There are those who will find reasons to \ncriticize this approach. There will be those who say it goes too far in \nsome areas--and there will be those who say it does not go far enough. \nI want to be one of those to say--I think this is an enormously \nimportant and constructive effort and I am very hopeful that we can \nbuild broad support in the Senate with the introduction of this bill as \nwe move through the hearing process and through the markup.\n  I invite all of the Members on this side, as Senator Kassebaum has \ndone on her side, to join with us to make suggestions and \nrecommendations. The issue of health care is a constantly changing \nlandscape. It is dramatically different from where it was 2 or 4 years \nago. But despite this, there continue to be issues of great concern for \nwhich we all agree something must be done--and those include the issues \nof access, affordability and coverage.\n  What we have tried to do in this bill is to respond in a way, under \nthe leadership of Senator Kassebaum, that we could find the areas of \ncommon stream. We have tried to review what we debated last year and \ntake what was central to the different approaches that were put forward \nin the Senate by Republicans as well as Democrats. Then we have tried \nto take those recommendations and shape them in ways which would be \nmore adaptive to the kind of conditions that we find today--advancing \nthose ideas in a way that really can make an important difference.\n  Mr. President, I welcome the chance of joining today with my \ncolleagues in introducing the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995. To \nreview, I will now summarize and highlight the specifics of the bill.\n   Mr. President, it is a pleasure to join Senator Kassebaum in \nintroducing the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995. This bipartisan \nproposal was developed in close cooperation between our two offices, \nand I commend her for her leadership.\n  The private health insurance market in the United States is deeply \nflawed, and with each passing year, the flaws become more serious. This \nlegislation is designed to remedy some of the worst abuses of the \ncurrent system, and provides protection to large number of families \nvictimized by such abuses.\n  Today, insurers often impose exclusion for preexisting conditions. As \na result, insurance is often denied for the very illnesses most likely \nto require medical care.\n  The valid purpose of such exclusions is to prevent people from gaming \nthe system by purchasing coverage only when they get sick. But too \noften today, the exclusions go too far. No matter how faithfully people \npay their premiums, they may have to start again with a new exclusion \nperiod if they change jobs or lose their coverage.\n  Eighty-one million Americans have conditions that could subject them \nto such exclusions if they lose their current coverage. Sometimes, the \nexclusions make them completely uninsurable.\n  Many employers do not provide health insurance to their workers at \nall, but too often, even those who want to do the right thing can't \nfind an insurer to write the coverage. Sometimes entire categories of \nbusinesses, with millions of employees, are redlined out of coverage. \nEven if a firm is in an acceptable category, coverage may be denied if \nsomeone in the firm--or a member of their family--is in poor health. \nPeople who have paid insurance premiums for years can be canceled \nbecause they have the misfortune to get sick, just when they need \ncoverage the most.\n  One consequence of the current system is job lock. Workers who want \nto change jobs to improve their careers or provide more efficiently for \ntheir families must give up the opportunity because it means losing \ntheir health insurance. A quarter of all American workers say they have \nbeen forced to stay in a job they otherwise would have left, because \nthey were afraid of losing their health insurance.\n  This legislation addresses these problems. Exclusions for preexisting \ncondition will be limited. They cannot be reimposed on those with \ncurrent coverage who change jobs or whose employer changes insurance \ncompanies. Cancellation of policies will be prohibited for those who \ncontinue to pay their premiums. No employers who want to buy a policy \ncan be turned down because of the health of their employees. No \nemployees can be excluded from an employer's policy because they have \nhigher than average health costs. Any employee losing group coverage \nbecause they leave their job or for any other reason would be \nguaranteed the right to buy an individual policy.\n  Small businesses and individuals are particularly victimized under \nthe current system, because they lack the bargaining power of larger \ncorporations. The legislation addresses this problem by encouraging the \ndevelopment of purchasing cooperatives that will have the same kind of \nclout enjoyed by large corporations.\n  Because of concerns about the impact on overall premiums, this \nlegislation does not provide for guaranteed availability of coverage \nfor those who have not been part of an employment group. The bill \nrequires the Secretary of HHS to conduct a study of current State \npractices in this area, to consult with the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners and other appropriate sources of expertise, and \nto provide recommendations for solving this serious problem.\n  I continue to support the goal of comprehensive health reform. I am \nconfident we will find a way to provide health security for all \ncitizens, stop the ominous rise in the number of uninsured, and the \nridiculous soaring cost of health care. This bill is not a \ncomprehensive reform, but it will eliminate some of the worst abuses of \nthe private insurance market and provide greater protection for \nmillions of our fellow citizens.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to join the distinguished \nchair of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Mrs. Kassebaum, in \nintroducing the bipartisan ``Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995''.\n  This bill provides long awaited reforms for this country's health \ninsurance market. I say long awaited because the Senate passed similar \ninsurance reforms a few years ago, but regrettably they failed to \nbecome law. This legislation, with its bipartisan support, reflects \nessential market-based reforms.\n  One of the important things I have witnessed, from my perspective as \na \n\n[[Page S 9907]]\nphysician and now as a member of the Senate Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources, is the absolutely critical role that both employers \nand employees play in the current health care system, and the critical \nrole they must play as we struggle to reform the system to deliver \nhigher quality health care at lower costs.\n  Over the years, employers have directed much of the change in the \nhealth care system. Many employers have been a creative force in \ncontaining health care costs. In fact, as a result of innovative and \naggressive management of health care costs, employers actually saw \ntheir health care costs for 1994 decline 1.1 percent for the first time \nin a decade.\n  However, this success does not mean that the current system is free \nfrom problems. It is not.\n  It is the large employers which have the greatest influence in the \nmarket. Small employers lack the same bargaining power. For example, \nthe large employers reported health care cost decreases averaging 1.9 \npercent, while small employers experienced an average cost increase of \n6.5 percent. Moreover, uninsured rates continue to climb in many States \nand many families are finding it more difficult to obtain health \ncoverage.\n  The system needs to be reformed so that health care is available to \nall Americans.\n  Last year, many of these same insurance reforms became entangled with \nPresident Clinton's heavy-handed approach to health care reform. As a \nresult, Congress again failed to pass these provisions which are \nnecessary to increase access to insurance. Even so, many States moved \nforward with their own reforms. Forty-four States, including my State \nof Tennessee, have passed some type of small group insurance market \nreform. In addition, 27 States have set up high-risk insurance pools to \nincrease access to insurance for individuals.\n  There should be no bar to insurance based on preexisting conditions, \nand no one should have to face the fear that they will lose their \nhealth insurance when they lose their job, change jobs, divorce, or \nbecome sick. Mr. President, this is the focus of this legislation.\n  As a transplant surgeon, I have personally witnessed the obstacles my \npatients face after they have received a new heart and are ready to \nreturn to the work force and productive lives. These reforms go to the \nheart of the problem for families that feel locked into their jobs \nbecause an illness makes it difficult to obtain health insurance. If I \ngive someone a new heart today, they cannot hope to look for a new job \ntomorrow. Rather, they desperately hope to keep their current job to \nmaintain their health insurance coverage. They are trapped. The costs \nof their care prohibit the freedom of movement. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, this bill ensures portability from one group health plan to \nanother.\n  When insurers are allowed to discriminate based on a preexisting \ncondition, a heart transplant recipient becomes a liability to the rest \nof a company's employees. It can even result in an insurer dropping the \nentire employer group altogether. Mr. President, this legislation \nprohibits insurance carriers from refusing to issue a policy or \nrefusing to renew an existing policy. It is my hope that this bill will \nhelp return my patients to work and back to their pretransplant lives.\n  This bill reflects a desire to build a partnership between business \nand Government, not an adversarial relationship. Instead of mandating \nand controlling the health care market, Government should ensure that \nthe market operates efficiently to deliver value to all consumers \nregardless of their health status.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Health \nInsurance Reform Act of 1995, which is being introduced today by \nSenators Kassebaum, Kennedy, Frist, Dodd, Gorton, Mikulski, Gregg, \nPell, Simon, Wellstone, Chafee, Hatch, Lieberman, and myself. I applaud \nSenator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy for their commitment in \ndeveloping, what I believe to be the first truly bipartisan insurance \nreform bill introduced this Congress. As I have stated many times in \nthe past few years, health care reform cannot be successful unless \nRepublicans and Democrats work together.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of a piece of legislation that \nhas been developed in one of the most inclusive processes that I have \nbeen privileged to be a part. This legislation makes great strides in \nlaying a foundation for a well functioning private market, which is \ncritical if we are to be successful in creating a solid health care \nsystem for all Americans.\n  This bill puts into place minimum national insurance reform \nstandards, which transforms the current exclusionary insurance system \ninto one which moves closer to accepting all comers, yet the bill \nallows States a great amount of flexibility to move ahead at a faster \npace if they choose.\n  This bill, assures that if any individual has insurance today even if \nthey get sick, or change or lose their job, they will be able to \npurchase insurance tomorrow.\n  This bill encourages a variety of health plans to compete in the \nmarketplace. Individuals will have choices between managed care plans \nwhich focus on preventative care, as well as, catastrophic plans with \nmedical savings accounts.\n  This bill fixes certain glitches in COBRA so that individuals with \ndisabilities will no longer have to experience a gap in health \ninsurance between the transition from employer to Medicare coverage.\n  Mr. President, I am most grateful for the inclusion of the health \nplan purchasing coalition section of this legislation. I will be \nintroducing legislation next week called the Employer Group Purchasing \nReform Act of 1995, in which health plan purchasing coalitions are the \ncenter piece. I believe very strongly that voluntary private market \ngroup purchasing arrangements, for employers and individuals, is the \nkey to making health insurance not only more accessible but also more \naffordable for all Americans.\n  My legislation will also address the fraud and abuse in employer \ngroup purchasing arrangements called multiple employer welfare \narrangements [MEWA's] under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 [ERISA]. Senators Nunn and Cohen have both held hearings over \nthe past few years which have uncovered ponzi schemes that have left \nmillions of small business owners and their employees sick and without \ninsurance. The legislation will give clear authority to the States to \nshut down group purchasing arrangements that are fraudulent and clear \nauthority to certify health plan purchasing coalitions. In addition, \nthe legislation also begins to level the playing field between insured \nand self-funded health plans in the market by amending ERISA. I look \nforward to the same bipartisan support of this bill as has been \nachieved by Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy.\n  Mr. President, I am very eager to work with Senator Kassebaum, \nchairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, in the next couple \nof months, to report a market reform bill out of committee that can be \nbrought to the Senate floor this session. We must begin to address \nAmericans concern about portability and affordability of health \ninsurance this year and I believe that the Health Insurance Reform Act \nof 1995 is an excellent place to start.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources in cosponsoring today S. 1028, the Health \nInsurance Reform Act of 1995.\n  This important piece of legislation is designed not only to increase \naccess to health care benefits, but also to provide portability of \nthose benefits and to increase the purchasing power of individuals and \nsmall employers who wish to seek insurance.\n  As my colleagues know, the issue of health care coverage for millions \nof Americans remains a critical concern for this Congress and for the \nAmerican people.\n  The bill which we introduce today represents a reasonable and \nsignificant step in extending health insurance to a larger segment of \nthe American population.\n  As my colleagues are aware, for 18 years, I had the privilege of \nserving on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, including 6 years \nas chairman and 6 years as ranking minority member.\n\n[[Page S 9908]]\n\n  We have spent innumerable hours pondering how to improve our Nation's \nhealth care delivery system. There were times when we thought we had \nthe answer, but we could never manage to develop exactly the right \nbill.\n  More recently, last year in the Labor Committee we spent innumerable \nhours considering President Clinton's Health Security Act. Although my \nesteemed colleague and close friend, Senator Kennedy, fought long and \nhard for the President's proposal, that legislation was ultimately \nrejected by the American people and by the Congress.\n  If we learned any lesson from that experience, it was that Americans \ndo not want the Federal Government to have a larger role in shaping \nAmerica's health care system.\n  However, that does not lessen the need for some health care reform, \nand it is clear that insurance market reform is one area in which we \nhave had, and continue to have, a good deal of consensus. We should not \nlet the need for other reforms hold up passage of this much needed \nmeasure.\n  Chairman Kassebaum and her staff are to be congratulated for \ndeveloping the Health Insurance Reform Act based on the lessons we \nlearned last year. It is a narrowly tailored bill which addresses very \nreal problems in the marketplace.\n  This bill will achieve many of the objectives we sought in the areas \nof insurance portability as well as correcting problems with respect to \nthose individuals with preexisting health conditions.\n  I am particularly pleased that the measure is receiving wide \nbipartisan support among the members of the Labor Committee. This is a \nvery good signal that shows we have a viable bill which represents a \nconsensus approach to a difficult and complicated problem.\n  I strongly believe this bill represents the first meaningful and \ngenerally acceptable bipartisan insurance reform proposal in either \nhouse of Congress and I hope it will be enacted swiftly.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy \nand Kassebaum, as well as many of my colleagues on the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, in introducing the Health Insurance Reform Act of \n1995. The reforms included in this legislation would make it illegal \nfor insurers to drop people when they become sick and to discriminate \nagainst individuals with preexisting conditions. While I wish that we \nwere doing much more in Congress to ensure that all Americans have \naccess to affordable, comprehensive health insurance coverage, I view \nthe insurance reforms contained in this legislation as a serious step \nin the right direction. There is no excuse for not doing what we can to \nmake coverage more accessible--especially for people with preexisting \nconditions and disabilities. It is a disgrace that our private \ninsurance system continues to discriminate against precisely the \nindividuals who most need coverage.\n  All working Americans face a growing threat from the uncertainties \ncreated by the health insurance system. Even people with good health \ninsurance coverage cannot count on protection if they lose or change \njobs, especially if someone in their family has a preexisting \ncondition. Our current health care system allows insurers to collect \npremiums for years and then suddenly refuse to renew coverage if \nindividuals or employees get sick. It also allows insurers to routinely \ndeny coverage to different types of businesses from auto dealers to \nrestaurants.\n  The GAO has estimated that as many as 25 million Americans could \npotentially benefit from the insurance reforms included in this \nbipartisan bill. Most of the people who would be helped by this \nlegislation are people who change jobs and currently face preexisting \nconditions or waiting periods with their new health coverage.\n  Many States, including Minnesota, have already enacted standards for \ninsurance carriers, but because ERISA preemption prevents States from \nregulating self-funded health plans, only Federal standards can apply \nto all health plans. More and more employers in Minnesota have been \nchoosing to offer self-funded plans to employees. Such plans now enroll \nabout 1.5 million people, up from 890,000 in 1992, and about 50 percent \nof all privately insured residents. Current estimates also show that \nmore than 400,000 Minnesotans--including 91,000 children--are \nuninsured.\n  I am under no delusions that these insurance reforms will fix our \nbroken health care system. They will not result in universal coverage--\nor anywhere near it--and they will not solve the problem of rising \ncosts. After all, only comprehensive reform will make health care \naffordable for many of the uninsured who simply cannot afford the high \ncost of coverage.\n  While I am committed to fighting for comprehensive reforms that would \ninclude everyone and enable working families to afford health care \ncoverage as good as Members of Congress have, I recognize that this may \nnot happen this year. At the very least, however, we should act on \nreforms that would address some of the most egregious inequities in our \ncurrent system, as well as those that would allow States to expand \naccess and contain costs.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1029. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nestablish and strengthen policies and programs for the early \nstabilization of world population through the global expansion of \nreproductive choice, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n THE INTERNATIONAL POPULATION STABILIZATION AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ACT\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President I rise to join my good friend and able \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Jeff Bingaman. The two of us are \nreintroducing the very important legislation called the International \nPopulation Stabilization and Reproductive Health Act.\n  During the last congressional session, Senator Bingaman and I \nintroduced this bill to call attention to some very vital issues in \nthis country and in the world. Our former colleague, Tim Wirth, \nchampioned these issues while he was in the Senate and, together, he \nand I laid the foundation upon which this bill is built, and then came \nmy colleague from New Mexico, Jeff Bingaman--Senator Bingaman, who I \nthoroughly enjoy, and enjoy working with, his word is his bond. We work \nwell together. He shares the same concerns and commitment to this \ncrucial global issue as I do.\n  I am pleased to be working in a bipartisan fashion with him so we can \nmove forward with an effective public policy on an issue that affects \neveryone in some way, worldwide.\n  The legislation we introduce today builds upon the Programme of \nAction Document adopted by acclamation by 180 nation states in \nSeptember of 1994 at the International Conference on Population and \nDevelopment in Cairo.\n  At the conference, the United States was seen, as always, as the \nworld's leader on population and development assistance. I was a \ncongressional delegate at the conference. There were not a lot of \ncolleagues seeking to go. Senator John Kerry was there and represented \nour country well.\n  I came away much impressed with the leadership and direction \ndisplayed by our Vice President, Al Gore. Then, of course, assistance \ngiven to him by the now Under Secretary of State, former Senator Wirth, \nin guiding the conference and its delegates in developing a consensus \ndocument of a broad range of short- and long-range recommendations \nconcerning maternal and child health care, strengthening family \nplanning programs, the promotion of educational opportunities for girls \nand women, and improving the status and rights of women across the \nworld.\n  We surely do not want to lose our moral leadership role and \nrelinquish any momentum by abandoning or severely weakening our \nfinancial commitment to population and development assistance. The \nUnited States needs to continue its global efforts to achieve \nresponsible and sustainable population levels, and to back up that \nleadership with specific commitments to population planning activities.\n  In my mind, of all the challenges facing this country--and there are \nplenty of them--and around the world--and there are plenty of them--\nnone compares to that of the increasing of the population growth of the \nworld. All of our efforts to protect the environment, I have heard all \nof that in the last few days--protecting the environment, protecting \nthis, protecting the aged, protecting the young--all the things to \nprotect the environment and promote \n\n[[Page S 9909]]\neconomic development around the world are compromised and severely \ninjured by the staggering growth in the world's population.\n  I hope my colleagues realize, of course, that there are currently 5.7 \nbillion people on the Earth. In 1950, when I was a freshman at the \nUniversity of Wyoming, not that long ago, there were 2.5 billion people \non the face of the Earth. Mr. President, 2.5 billion in 1950, 5.7 \nbillion today.\n  If current birth and death rates continue, the world's population \nwill double again in just 40 years. Despite some progress in reducing \nfertility rates, birth rates in developing countries are declining too \nslowly to prevent a cataclysmic near tripling of the human race before \nstabilization can occur.\n  The bill as Senator Bingaman and I propose focuses on a coordinated \nstrategy that will help to achieve world population stabilization, \nencourage global economic development and self-determination, and \nimprove the health and well-being of women and their children.\n  Fundamental to this legislation is a recognition of the fact that \nworldwide efforts to alleviate poverty, stabilize populations, and \nsecure the environment have been undermined by a total lack of \nattention to women's reproductive health and the role of women in the \neconomic development of their families, their communities, and their \ncountries.\n  Under the legislation, global and U.S. expenditure targets will be \nset for overall population assistance, with specific programs to help \nachieve universal access to culturally competent family planning \nservices and reproductive health care; expand programs for treatment \nand prevention of HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases; \nclose the gender gap in literacy and primary and secondary education; \nand increase economic opportunities for women so they can realize their \nfull productivity potential.\n  Other initiatives authorized under this legislation will help to \nreduce global maternal and infant mortality rates, and improve the \noverall health status of women and their children by addressing \nproblems such as unsafe abortion. This is not about abortion. I have \nbeen here a long time. Every time we bring up something that has to do \nwith stabilization of the Earth's population, somebody throws in the \nissue of abortion. That is not what this is about.\n  It is also about harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, \nalong with malnutrition, low immunization rates, and the spread of \ncontagious diseases.\n  There is a real need throughout much of the developing world for \naccess to family planning services, especially as to safe abortion. \nWomen in these countries are desperately seeking ways to take control \nof their reproductive lives and cannot do so because there is a severe \nlack of access to such services.\n  Worldwide, estimates are that 350 million couples want to space or \nprevent another pregnancy but lack the access to a full range of modern \nfamily planning.\n  In addition, any comprehensive family planning initiative must \ninclude access to primary health care with an emphasis on child \nsurvival to reduce infant mortality. In many developing countries, \nparents have a perception that many of their children will not survive \nbeyond their first birthdays. If these parent's fears are allayed, they \nwill not feel much pressure to have more children than they actually \ndesire in order to insure against the possible loss of one or more of \ntheir children before adulthood.\n  This is why for all of these pressing reasons, I join today with my \nfriend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman in introducing \nthis legislation. It is our aim to call attention to global population \nstabilization, to give it focus, and to make it a vital part of U.S. \nforeign aid and development assistance programs. We need to begin to \nmake much-needed policy changes in international population \nstabilization, and the United States needs to take this lead to ensure \nthat these new policy developments are recognized worldwide. This one \nis long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na summary of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Summary: International Population Sta- bilization and Reproductive \n                               Health Act\n\n       The International Population Stabilization and Reproductive \n     Health Act lays the foundation for a coordinated U.S. foreign \n     aid strategy, consistent with the Programme of Action \n     endorsed at the 1994 International Conference on Population \n     and Development. This strategy will: help achieve world \n     population stabilization; encourage global economic \n     development and self-determination; and improve the health \n     and well-being of women and their children.\n       The Act recognizes that worldwide efforts to alleviate \n     poverty, stabilize population, and secure the environment \n     have been significantly undermined by the lack of attention \n     to women's reproductive health and the role of women in the \n     economic development of their families, their communities, \n     and their countries.\n\n\n                         1. policy and purpose\n\n       A.

Mr. President, we are going to hold hearings on this. \nThose hearings will be held in my Subcommittee on Social Security and \nFamily Policy. We are going to take this one very seriously. There is \nno need to talk about what is going to happen to the environment \nbecause of methane gas in cows, and how much propellant is in the \nbottom of the shaving cream can, when the population of the Earth will \ndouble in the next 40 years, and how many footprints will the Earth \nhold. It is very simple.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague who is \nthe prime sponsor of this bill in this Congress, and I am pleased to \ncosponsor the bill with him. I want to compliment him for his \nleadership on this very important issue. He has been a leader in trying \nto deal with the problem of how to stabilize population growth in the \nworld for a very long period of time.\n  Today, we are reintroducing the International Population \nStabilization and Reproductive Health Act. I also believe that this is \na very important piece of legislation and has the potential of \nproviding substantial benefits to this country over the coming decades.\n  I think we have already benefited greatly from the very modest \ninvestment we have made in sustainable development and in population \nefforts.\n  From my perspective, just as the Senator from Wyoming was saying, the \nattention to global population issues and support for worldwide \ndevelopment is critical to our future success here in this country.\n  We have joined, Senator Simpson and I, with Congressman Beilenson and \nCongresswoman Morella, to introduce an earlier version of this in the \nlast Congress, the 103d Congress.\n  The bill we are introducing today, like the previous bill, will focus \nU.S. foreign policy on a coordinated strategy to accomplish three \nthings. No. 1, to achieve world population stabilization; No. 2, to \nencourage global economic development and self-determination for all \nwomen; No. 3, to improve the health and well-being of women and their \nchildren.\n  These three objectives are inseparable. To be successful, U.S. \nforeign policy needs to integrate population strategies and programs \ninto our broader economic and development agenda. The way I see it, the \nU.S. efforts to help develop economies around the world, to promote \ndemocracy around the world, all of those efforts will be futile if we \ndo not first address this issue of the staggering rate of global \npopulation growth.\n  How can we expect underdeveloped countries to pull themselves up when \nthe world's population is growing at a rate of over 10,000 people per \nhour? When the women and men who make up a nation's work force pool do \nnot even have the right to plan their families? And when millions of \nwomen around the world do not have access to basic and lifesaving \nreproductive health care or educational opportunities?\n  The 1994 U.N. International Conference on Population Development, \nwhich Senator Simpson attended and Senator Kerry attended, from this \nbody, focused the world's attention on these issues and began a new era \nin population and development. At that Cairo conference, Senator \nSimpson indicated there was a program of action that was adopted as a \nconsensus document. That program of action is the foundation for the \nlegislation that we are introducing today. It clearly puts human beings \nat the center of development activities and encourages the \ninternational community to address global problems by meeting \nindividual needs. It calls for gender equity and equality, for women to \nhave and exercise choices in their economic and public and family \nlives, and for making reproductive health care available throughout the \nworld.\n  The program of action which was adopted in Cairo recognizes that some \nsignificant worldwide progress has already been made in the last few \ndecades, including lower birth and death rates in most parts of the \nworld, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy, a slight \nrise in educational attainment, and a slight narrowing in the gap \nbetween the educational levels of men and women.\n  However, the Cairo Programme of Action, along with the State of \nPopulation Report, which was released just 2 days ago by the U.N. \nPopulation Fund, also recognized that a tremendous additional amount \nneeds to be done. At the core of both the International Programme of \nAction and the United Nations report are two fundamental concepts. They \nare, first of all, that population, poverty, patterns of production and \nconsumption, and the environment are so closely interconnected that \nnone can be considered in isolation. And, second, that sustained \neconomic growth, sustainable development in population, are \nfundamentally dependent upon investing in people; more specifically, on \nmaking advances in education and in economic status and in the \nempowerment of women.\n  This legislation, which I am very proud to cosponsor with Senator \nSimpson in this Congress, represents a significant step forward. I \nsincerely hope our colleagues in the Senate will give it a careful \nlook. I commend him for scheduling a hearing this next week, at which \nwe can explore the issues in more depth, and I look forward to working \nwith him throughout the rest of this Congress in trying to see this \nlegislation enacted into law.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I certainly concur. I look forward to \nworking with my friend from New Mexico. Hearings will start next week, \nand we will be about our business. That is something that is very \nclear.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Wellstone, and Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 1030. A bill entitled the ``Federal Prohibition of Female Genital \nMutilation Act of 1995''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S 9911]]\n\n\n\n    THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, last September I introduced a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution condemning the practice of female genital \nmutilation [FGM]. I was compelled to react after I read an article in \nthe newspaper reporting the arrest of two men in Egypt who arranged for \nthe filming of this appalling ritual procedure being performed on a 10-\nyear-old girl for the Cable News Network [CNN]. Last October, Senators \nWellstone, Moseley-Braun, and myself introduced legislation that would \nban this practice and today, along with Senator Simpson, we again \nintroduce such legislation.\n  I realize the significance of the ritual in the culture and social \nsystem of the communities in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. \nHowever, I cannot ignore the cruel and torturous nature of this \nprocedure which is generally performed on very young girls who do not \nhave a choice in what is about to happen to them. The immediate effects \nof the procedure are bleeding, shock, infections, emotional trauma, and \neven death because of hemorrhage and unhygienic conditions. As adults, \ncomplications during pregnancy and labor can occur.\n  Although FGM is most prevalent in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, \nit is not confined to these areas. It is estimated that over 80 million \nyoung girls and women have been mutilated in this ritual. Excision and \ninfibulation are the most common practices. Infibulation, which is \npracticed in many countries, entails the excision of all of the female \ngenitalia. The remaining tissue is stitched together leaving only a \nsmall opening for urine and menstrual flow. FGM has no medical \njustification for being performed on healthy young girls and women. In \nEgypt, mothers perpetuate the tradition to shield their girls from lust \nand to make sure they will be accepted in marriage. They believe an \nuncircumcised women cannot control her sexual appetite, or if married, \nlikely to commit adultery.\n  Although I believe this practice is a torturous act when performed on \nany woman, I am most concerned about it being performed on children and \nyoung girls under the age 18--in other words, below the age at which a \nchild can give consent. A child does not have the ability to consent or \nunderstand the significance and the consequence this ritual will have \non her life, on her health, or on her dignity. Young girls are tied and \nheld down, they scream in pain and are not only physically scarred, but \nthey are emotionally scarred for life.\n  Many nations have made efforts to deter the practice of FGM with \nlegislation against its execution as well as creating educational \nprograms for women. The United Kingdom outlawed FGM in 1985 after a BBC \ndocumentary revealed that British doctors were performing the procedure \non children whose families had immigrated. Unfortunately, despite these \ninitiatives, the societal pressures are too much to overcome. Sudan is \na prime example of the failure of honest efforts to deter the practice. \nSudan has the longest record of efforts to combat the practice of FGM \nand has legislated against the procedure. Yet, according to the 1992 \nMinority Rights Group report, 80 percent of Sudanese women continue to \nbe infibulated. Nevertheless, as stated in my sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, it is important that any effort by a nation to curb FGM be \nrecognized and commended.\n  The most successful endeavors to prevent FGM has been at the \ngrassroots level led by women, many of whom have undergone this \nexcruciating operation, with support from the\n World Health Organization, UNICEF, and other international human \nrights groups. African and Arab women have begun to speak out and we \nmust do all we can to support their efforts. They are working under \ndifficult circumstances and often in hostile social environments for \nthe preservation of a woman's health, dignity, and human rights. We \nmust work to support and encourage their efforts to end this violent \ndegradation of female children throughout the world.\n\n  Primarily, we must join other countries in legally banning FGM. As \nimmigrants from Africa and the Middle East travel to other nations, the \npractice of FGM travels with them. The United Kingdom, Sweden, and \nSwitzerland have all passed legislation prohibiting FGM in their \ncountries. France and Canada maintain that FGM violates already \nestablished statutes prohibiting bodily mutilation and have taken \naction against its practice. The United States is also faced with the \nresponsibility of abolishing this specific practice within its borders. \nTraditional child abuse interventions do not sufficiently address the \nproblem.\n  FGM is difficult to talk about, but ignoring this issue because of \nthe discomfort it causes us does nothing but perpetuate the silent \nacquiescence to its practice. The women of Africa and the Middle East \nare standing up against tremendous pressure and defiance to fight for \nthe health and dignity of their sisters, friends, mothers, and \ndaughters. The least we can do is support and encourage their struggle \nand to continue to talk about FGM and to condemn its practice. \nEducation will be our most important and effective tool against FGM, \nand I intend to do my part to educate my colleagues, my constituents, \nand my friends to the horrors of this ritual practice.\n  In hopes to educate the public, our legislation provides for research \non the prevalence of FGM in the United States. Furthermore, our bill \nprovides that medical studies be aware of the ritual and be trained in \nhow to treat effected women, and it will make illegal the denial of \nmedical services to any woman who has undergone FGM procedures in the \npast.\n  Seble Dawit and Salem Mekuria, two African women who are working to \nend FGM, described the challenges to abolishing FGM. ``We do not \nbelieve that force changes traditional habits and practices. Genital \nmutilation does not exist in a vacuum but as part of the social fabric, \nstemming from the power imbalance in relations between the sexes, from \nlevels of education and the low economic and social status of most \nwomen. All eradication efforts must begin and proceed from these basic \npremises.'' \n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the issue of female genital \nmutilation [FGM] was first brought before the Senate last September \nwhen Senator Reid introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \ncondemning this cruel ritual practice and commending the Government of \nEgypt for taking quick action against two men who performed this deed \non a 10-year-old girl in front of CNN television cameras. Last October, \nSenators Reid and Moseley-Braun and I introduced a bill entitled \nFederal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act of 1994. At that \ntime we committed ourselves to working on this issue until legislation \npasses that bans the practice of female genital mutilation in the \nUnited States.\n  The bill we are introducing today would accomplish this goal by \nmaking it illegal to perform the procedures of FGM on girls younger \nthan 18. In addition, this legislation proscribes the following \nmeasures as necessary to the eradication of this procedure: compiling \ndata on the number of females in the U.S. who have been subjected to \nFGM, identifying communities in the United States in which it is \npracticed, designing and implementing outreach activities to inform \npeople of its physical and psychological effects, and developing \nrecommendations for educating students in medical schools on treating \nwomen and girls who have undergone mutilations. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of an act that addresses an issue so crucial to the mental \nand physical health of women and girls.\n  The ritual practice of female genital mutilation currently affects an \nestimated 80 million women in over 30 countries. Although FGM is most \nwidespread in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East, \nimmigrants from practicing groups have brought the custom to wherever \nthey have settled, including the American cities of New York, Seattle, \nPortland, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. This tradition is \nsometimes euphemistically referred to as ``female circumcision,'' a \ndangerously misleading label which encourages us to think of the \nprocedure as nothing more significant than the culturally required \nremoval of a piece of skin.\n  A closer examination of the issue makes it clear that female genital \nmutilation is in fact the ritual torture of \n\n[[Page S 9912]]\nyoung girls. In her Washington Post article, Judy Mann describes female \ngenital mutilation as ``the ritualized removal of the clitoris and \nlabia in girls--from newborns to late adolescents. In its most extreme \nform, a girl's external sexual organs are scraped away entirely and the \nvulva is sewn together with catgut, leaving a hole the size of a pencil \nfor urine and menses to pass through. Her legs are bound together for \nseveral weeks while a permanent scar forms.''\n  In the countries and cultures of its origin, FGM is most commonly \nperformed with crude instruments such as dull razor blades, glass, and \nkitchen knives while the girl is tied or held down by other women. In \nmost cases, anesthesia is not used. Afterwards, herb mixtures, cow \ndung, or ashes are often rubbed on the wound to stop the bleeding.\n  Aside from the obvious emotional and physical trauma which are caused \nby this procedure, it has been estimated that 15 percent of all \ncircumcised females die as a result of the ritual. The long term \neffects dealt with by American doctors who treat mutilated women and \ngirls are listed by the New England Journal of Medicine as including \nchronic pelvic infections, infertility, chronic urinary tract \ninfections, dermoid cysts (which may grow to the size of a grapefruit), \nand chronic anxiety or depression.\n  Although female genital mutilation has sometimes been viewed as a \npurely cultural phenomena, it is clear that no ethical justification \ncan be made for this inhumane practice in any country.\n  The unacceptable nature of FGM by international human rights \nstandards was underscored by the World Health Organization on May 12, \n1993, when it adopted a resolution which highlighted the importance of \neliminating harmful traditional practices affecting the health of \nwomen, children and adolescents. This resolution explicitly cited \nfemale genital mutilation as a practice which restricts ``the \nattainment of the goals of health, development, and human rights for \nall members of society.'' In 1993, the Vienna Declaration of the World \nConference on Human Rights also held that FGM is an international human \nrights violation.\n  Additionally, FGM has already been banned in many Western nations. In \n1982, Sweden passed a law making all forms of female circumcision \nillegal, and the United Kingdom passed a similar law in 1985. France, \nthe Netherlands, Canada, and Belgium have each set a precedent for the \nillegality of female circumcision by holding that it violates laws \nprohibiting bodily mutilation and child abuse. Action has been taken to \nenforce the statutes banning this practice in all the countries I've \njust mentioned.\n  However, due to complex cultural factors, dealing with this issue in \nthe United States require more than making the ritual practice of FGM \nillegal. Immigrant parents in the United States who import a \ncircumciser from their home country or find an American doctor willing \nto perform the procedure claim to do so out of a desire to do the best \nthing for their daughters. In the societies and cultures that practice \nit, FGM is said to be an integral part of the socialization of girls \ninto acceptable womanhood. Often, the mutilations are perceived by a \ngirl's parents as her passport to social acceptance or the required \nphysical marking of her marriageability. In spite of its obvious \ncruelty therefore, FGM is a part of cultural identity. Clearly, female \ngenital mutilation must be dealt with in a manner which takes into \naccount its complex causes and meanings.\n  Because of the complexity of this issue and the lack of available \ninformation regarding FGM in the United States, this bill includes a \nprovision ensuring that research be carried out to determine the number \nof females in the U.S. who have undergone mutilations. This research \nwould also document the types of physical and psychological damage \ndealth with by American medical professionals who treat mutilated \nwomen.\n  The bill also requires that we investigate approaches such\n   as the one used in Great Britain where child protection networks are \nused to identify at risk girls and trained professionals are assigned \nto work with their families.\n\n  Finally, the legislation would ensure that medical students are \neducated in how to treat women and girls who have undergone FGM. In \n1994, the New England Journal of Medicine reported that pregnant women \nwho have undergone infibulation--in which the labia majora are stitched \nto cover the urethra and entrance to the vagina--are at serious risk, \nas are their unborn babies, if treated by physicians who have not been \ntrained in dealing with infibulated women. In fact, untreated \ninfibulated women have double the risk of maternal death and several \ntimes increased risk of stillbirth when compared with women who have \nnot undergone mutilation.\n  The education of medical students regarding FGM is especially \nessential as under this bill it would be considered illegal to \ndiscriminate or deny medical services to any woman who has undergone \nFGM procedures.\n  Passage of a bill banning FGM would have helped Lydia Oluloro who \nfought her deportation and that of her two daughters on the grounds \nthat her sister had threatened to kidnap the girls and have the \nmutilations performed on them if they were forced to return to their \nnative Nigeria.\n  Passage of this bill would also send a clear message to American \nmedical professionals, some of whom reportedly have been offered as \nmuch as $3,000 to perform mutilations on young girls. It would see to \nit that the names of Western doctors who mutilate girls would no longer \nbe passed around in immigrant communities. It would help in prosecuting \ncases resembling the one faced by the Atlanta district attorney in 1986 \nin which an African-born nurse was charged with child abuse after \nbotching a clitoridectomy on her 3-year-old niece, and it would ensure \nthat immigrants are educated as they enter the country regarding the \noperations's illegality and its dangers.\n  Female genital mutilation is the world's most widespread form of \ntorture, yet no other mass dilation of humanity has received so \ncomparatively little journalistic or governmental attention. We in the \nUnited States should make it clear that it is a serious crime if it \noccurs here. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation as an \nessential tool in the struggle against the perpetuation of this heinous \npractice.\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join \nSenator Reid, Senator Wellstone and Senator Simpson as an original \ncosponsor to the Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act \nof 1995.\n  Male circumcision is a procedure with a long history. It is a common, \naccepted practice in the United States for male babies to be \ncircumcised. In the Jewish religion, tradition dictates that a baby boy \nbe circumcised when he is 8 days old in a special ceremony to symbolize \nthe covenant between God and the children of Israel. It is quick, \nrelatively painless, and without long-term consequences--for men.\n  For women, however, circumcision is another matter altogether. The \nprocedure known as female circumcision is not at all benign. It is \nmutilation.\n  Eighty million women worldwide have been mutilated by female \ncircumcision. The procedure is most widely seen in eastern and western \nAfrica, and a number of Middle Eastern countries. And as communities \nfrom African countries immigrate to the United States, we are \ntragically seeing more and more cases of genital mutilation in this \ncountry. That is why this legislation is so important.\n  I am concerned that in this country there are misperceptions that \nthis procedure is part of African and Islamic culture and tradition, \nand that the Government should not interfere. Nowhere in Muslim \nscripture is female circumcision required. It is not practiced in Saudi \nArabia, the cradle of Islam. Historically, the procedure dates back \nbefore the rise of the Moslem religion to the times of the Pharaoh in \nEgypt.\n  In countries where the practice is not universal, female genital \nmutilation is more common among poor, uneducated women, and it is \ninextricably tied to the status of women in the community. In these \nsocieties, women who have not been circumcised are considered unclean, \nand unmarriageable. In communities where the only role for a women is \nto be married and have children, the fear of being labeled \nunmarriageable is enormous and real.\n\n[[Page S 9913]]\n\n  Ironically, that is why women are the strongest supporters of this \npractice. It is the older women who know best about how an \nuncircumcised woman in a traditional village will be treated. Girls are \ntaught that with circumcision, they enter womanhood. Mothers encourage \nthe mutilation because they want their daughters to marry--because \nmarriage is the only access to a meal ticket. And men support the \ncustom because a woman who is circumcised is considered chaste. In \nshort, circumcision is a passport into the only role that some \nsocieties give women.\n  As a woman and a mother, I can't imagine leading a child to this kind \nof torture.\n  I want to raise awareness of this practice. This is mutilation of \notherwise healthy women, pure and simple. We must work together to stop \nteaching girls that undergoing this kind of butchery is essential to \ntheir future.\n  Mr. President, there are very serious health risks associated with \nthe practice of female genital mutilation that do not exist with male \ncircumcision. This practice is most often performed by midwives or \nother women elders with little or no medical training. It is performed \nwithout anesthetic or sanitary tools. Often, the cut is made with a \nrazor blade or a piece of glass.\n  The New England Journal of Medicine has examined female genital \nmutilation as a public health issue. They report that women often \nhemorrhage after the cutting. Prolonged bleeding may lead to severe \nanemia. Urinary tract infections and pelvic infections are common. \nSometimes, cysts form in the scar tissue. The mutilation can also lead \nto infertility.\n  At childbirth, circumcised women have double the risk of maternal \ndeath, and the risk of a stillbirth increases several fold. And because \nthe cutting is performed without sanitary\n tools, female genital mutilation has become a means of spreading the \nHIV virus. There are no records of how many girls die as a result of \nthis practice.\n\n  Mr. President, Sweden, Britain, The Netherlands, and Belgium have \noutlawed this practice. In France, it is considered child abuse. The \nUnited States has an important role to play as well. Two years ago, the \nworld health organization adopted a resolution on maternal child health \nand family planning for health sponsored by Guinea, Kenya, Nigeria, \nTogo, Zambia and Lebanon that highlights the importance of eliminating \nharmful traditional practices, includings female genital mutilation, \naffecting the health of women, children and adolescents.\n  Banning this practice in the United States is just the first step \ntoward eradicating it. Girls must be taught that they will have \nopportunities, both in marriage and outside the home, if they are not \nmutilated. Mothers must believe that their daughters will have a place \nin the community if they are not circumcised. And men must be taught \nthat the terrible health risks involved with the procedure far outweigh \ntheir belief that a circumcised woman is a more suitable bride.\n  I want to commend the Inter-African Committee on Traditional \nPractices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, for their work in \nAfrica over the last 10 years to educate women so that this practice \ncan be abolished. It will take much more than Government statements \nagainst the procedure to eradicate the tradition.\n  Mr. President, no woman, anywhere, should have to undergo this kind \nof mutilation, not to get a husband, not to put food on the table, not \nfor any reason. Female circumcision is, in the final analysis, about \ntreating women as something less than people. It must be stopped. It \nhas no place in today's world.\n  By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Burns, Mr. Craig, Mr. \nStevens, Mr. Kempthorne and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 1031. A bill to transfer the lands administered by the Bureau of \nLand Management to the State in which the lands are located; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9905-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9913-S9915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BLM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \ntransfer the lands managed by the BLM in the various States to State \ncontrol. This bill is not a new one. We have had it in last year. But \nit is a commonsense approach that supports the goal of good government, \nsupports the goal of bringing government closer to the people, and a \nnecessary reform in the way that public lands are managed.\n  Currently, the BLM, the Bureau of Land Management, manages nearly 270 \nmillion acres of land in the United States, most of it, of course, in \nthe West. Wyoming, for example--nearly 50 percent of Wyoming is owned \nby the Federal Government, much of it managed by the BLM. In some other \nStates, it is more--86 percent in Nevada. So when half of your State is \nmanaged by the Federal Government, it has a great deal to do with your \nfuture. It has a great deal to do with the economy and growth, because \nthese are multiple use lands.\n  Let me make a point originally that is very important to this bill. \nWe are talking about Bureau of Land Management lands. We are not \ntalking about Forest Service. We are not talking about wilderness. We \nare not talking about parks--lands that are set aside with particular \npurpose, lands that had a particular character. BLM lands are residual \nlands that were left when the homesteaders came in the West and took \nthe land that is along the river and took the winter feed and took the \nbest land. That land that was left was managed by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Indeed, in the early acts that had to do with managing that land, it \nsaid ``manage it pending disposal.'' The notion was never to maintain \nthem. So we are talking about a fundamental change and that is sort of \nwhat we are doing in this Congress, looking at some fundamental changes \nin the way we operate Government. It moves Government closer to the \npeople, and that is what it is all about. It helps to reduce the size \nand cost of the Federal Government and transfers this function to the \nState as we are talking about transferring others.\n  It would have to do with the budget. It would, indeed, save money for \nthe budget of the United States. There will be less money going to the \nDepartment of Interior. That is just the way it is. So the priorities \nwill have to be established. We heard a lot about not being able to \nfinance national parks, and that is actually going to be the case. So \nwhat it does is set some priorities as to where that money ought to be.\n  There is a fairness doctrine here. The States east of the Missouri \nRiver do not have half of their lands belong to the Federal Government. \nSo there is a fairness question. Why should the State not have these \nlands? There is a question of States rights. Many maintain the \nConstitution does not provide the authority for the Federal Government \nto maintain those lands that have no specific use. I do not argue that. \nOthers say we ought to get control by having the counties do zoning. \nThey do that some in Arizona. That is an idea. I say, let us move them \nback to the States and let the States manage them as public lands. \nThese will be multiple use lands, for hunting, for fishing, for \ngrazing, for mineral development.\n  If you have ever seen a map of the West, you will see a strange \nownership pattern. There are lands spread around over the whole State. \nOne of the most unusual is the checkerboard, what we call the \ncheckerboard, that runs all the way through Wyoming and through much of \nthe West, when every other section was given to the railroads early on, \n20 miles on either side of the railroad. So those checkerboards still \nbelong to the Federal Government with deeded lands in between.\n  These are low production lands. These are not national parks. These \nare very low rainfall, low moisture content areas, so they are very \nunproductive. It takes a great deal of land to support one cow-calf \nunit.\n  Along with the House--there will be an identical bill in the House \nthat will be introduced to transfer these lands to the State. Actually, \nin order to have time to accommodate that, in order to do something \nwith the budgeting, that would be a 10-year period before they would be \ntransferred. But we almost constantly have a conflict between the \nStates, between the users --whatever they are, whether they are \ncommodity users or recreational users--and the Federal land managers. \nAnd these folks do a good job. I have no quarrel with the managers. I \njust think, as many \n\n[[Page S 9914]]\nothers do, the closer you are, with Government, to the people who are \ngoverned, the more likely it is to be a successful effort.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It will help \nreduce the Federal budget. It will certainly increase individual States \nrights. It will keep the BLM lands in public lands so they are \navailable for access for everyone. Finally, and perhaps most important \nof all, it provides fairness and equity for Western States, each of \nwhom would have the option.\n  The time has come for the Federal Government to release the \nstranglehold on the Western States and let us manage our own affairs.\n  I join my colleagues in the effort to reform the way public lands are \nmanaged.\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to compliment Senator \nThomas for bringing this bill forward and opening what I hope will be \nan enlightening discussion.\n  The subject matter of this bill is of great consequence in the \nWestern States. The sheer size and proportion of Federal ownership in \nthe West not only contrasts dramatically with the situation in Eastern \nStates, but it is the source of much of the conflict in this country \nover the use of public lands. A quick look at a U.S. map of government \nlands dramatically illustrates the differences. Sixty to 80 percent of \nmany Western States are federally owned, while the comparison east of \nthe 100th meridian is typically less than 5 percent. Westerners feel \nthis is inequitable, and some claim it is unconstitutional. They feel \nburdened by Federal regulation in their daily lives. They feel burdened \nby Federal regulation in their daily lives. Such sentiment is poorly \nunderstood in nonpublic land States.\n  This bill would improve the balance of State and Federal lands in the \nWest and dissolve some of the source of discontent. It would give \ncitizens more control over their lives through State government. For \nexample, in Idaho BLM controls 12 million acres, or 22 percent of the \nState. Other Federal agencies control an additional 41 percent. \nTransfer of BLM ownership to the State would dramatically change the \nownership equation to one of much fairer balance.\n  Nationwide, the Bureau of Land Management oversees 272 million acres, \nor 41 percent of the total Federal ownership. Nearly all of this is in \nthe West, and it consists largely of those lands remaining in the \npublic domain after the national parks, national wildlife refuges and \nnational forests were set apart and placed under management of other \nFederal agencies.\n  The concept of State management or ownership of Federal lands, in \nthis case the lands of the Bureau of Land Management, has surfaced \nbefore. But there has never been a better time to seriously examine the \nissue.\n  Congress has agreed to balance the Federal budget by 2002. That goal \ndemands that we investigate new ways of doing business throughout the \nFederal Government. It may be that the States can own and manage the \nBLM lands and the underlying mineral estate at much less cost, while \nprotecting the environment and maintaining public access and the many \nuses of these lands and waters.\n  I see no reason why that can't be done, and if it can, it would be \ndesirable in several ways: Management costs would decrease, placing \nless burden on the taxpayers in the long run; management decisions \nwould be made instate with more opportunity for residents to have their \nvoices heard; existing State programs for recreation, grazing, wildfire \nsuppression and environmental protections, such as water quality \nstandards, could be integrated with similar BLM programs for economies \nof scale and consistency.\n  I am cosponsoring Senator Thomas' bill to encourage debate on these \nissues. This bill is a starting point. The considerations in each State \nwill differ, of course, and there are a number of amendments which \nwould be needed to address the situation in the State of Idaho. The \nbill already protects designated wilderness, but we would need to \nprovide for State consideration of more than 900,000 acres recommended \nfor wilderness additions. Our national historic trails, wild and scenic \nrivers, the Snake River Birds of Prey Area, and other areas of special \nconcern must be maintained.\n  I should emphasize this bill would not require State ownership. It \nwould offer the opportunity for States to accept ownership and \nmanagement, only if they elect to do so. Governor Batt, the State \nlegislature, and Idaho interest groups would have 2 years to consider \nwhether to accept the 11 million acres of BLM lands in the State. That \nseems sufficient time for a thorough airing of the pros and cons. \nGovernor Batt has indicated his willingness to explore the \npossibilities.\n  I am sensitive to the fact that mere consideration of this \nlegislation will cause some anxiety among BLM employees, and that \nconcerns me. I will guarantee that employee options will be thoroughly \ndiscussed, and resolution on a fair transition reached, as this bill \nmoves through the legislative process. The bill already provides a 10-\nyear transition period from the time of acceptance by a State to actual \ntransfer of ownership.\n  Some interest groups will immediately attack this legislation as a \nthreat to environmental protections. They should stop and think. These \nsame groups have shown their obvious dissatisfaction with Federal \nownership through appeals and court challenges of management decisions. \nThey have complained to me that the short tenure of Federal managers \nweakens decisionmaking and discourages accountability in the long run. \nThey have argued that the citizens of Idaho support environmental \nprograms and want a greater voice in their management. Potentially, \nthis bill could satisfy all those concerns, and at far less cost to the \ntaxpayers.\n  For all these reasons, I am an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1032. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nnonrecognition treatment for certain transfers by common trust funds to \nregulated investment companies; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     common trust fund legislation\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today together with Senator Baucus, I \nam introducing the Common Trust Fund Improvement Act of 1995--In short, \nthis legislation would allow banks to move assets of their common trust \nfunds to one or more mutual funds without gain or loss being recognized \nby the trust funds or their participants.\n  Bank common trust funds have been used by banks since World War II to \ncollectively invest pools of monies in their capacities as trustees, \nexecutors, administrators, or guardians of certain customer accounts \nfor which they have a fiduciary responsibility. At present, there are \nmore than $120 billion in assets residing in bank common trust funds, \nbut little if any new money is flowing into these common trust funds. \nBy allowing the conversions under this legislation, banks can reduce \ninvestment risk and, in some cases, increase total investment return \nfor their customer accounts by using larger, more diversified and \nefficient investment pools for asset allocation.\n  Mutual funds are the pooling vehicle of choice because they can grow \ninto much larger investment pools than can common trust funds. By law, \nthe participants in a bank's common trust fund are limited to that \nbank's fiduciary customers. Mutual funds can be offered to all types of \ninvestors. Thus, the conversion of bank common trust fund assets into \nmutual funds is really a transitional issue, permitting financial \ninstitutions the ability to provide their existing trust customers with \nthe same efficient and safe investment vehicles that they are providing \nto their new customers. The conversion of their common trust funds into \none or more mutual funds would also benefit banks by providing them \nwith one set of investment pools to manage.\n  This legislation is necessary because it appears that the conversion \nof common trust fund assets into one or more mutual funds would, under \ncurrent law, trigger tax to the participants of the common trust fund, \nan event that could be viewed under State laws as a breach of a bank's \nfiduciary responsibilites. Thus, at present, banks generally are \nfinding it prohibitive to convert their common trust funds into more \neconomically efficient mutal funds.\n  Permitting tax-free conversions of a common trust fund's assets to \nmore \n\n[[Page S 9915]]\nthan one mutual fund would allow the more diverse common trust assets \nto be allocated to several mutual funds according to the appropriate \ninvestment and other objectives of the mutual funds. While the multiple \nconversion feature will benefit all banking institutions, it is \nparticularly significant for small and medium-size banks with smaller \ncommon trust funds; these institutions generally find it far too costly \nto create their own mutual funds, and they are not likely to find a \nsingle third party mutual fund for each common trust fund able to \naccept substantially all the assets of the common trust fund.\n  While this legislation has been estimated to cost less than $100 \nmillion over five years, I am very mindful of the need to ensure that \ntax-law changes, no matter how appropriate and essential, do not add to \nthe federal deficit that we are all trying so hard to eliminate. \nTherefore, it may be necessary to modify this proposal in order to \nreduce its revenue cost to a negligible level. Unfortunately, as is the \ncase with many tax policy changes, modifications to the legislation \nthat address revenue concerns may make the proposal more complex to \nadminister, however, I am willing to make this trade off if it becomes \nabsolutely necessary in order to include this legislation in a revenue \nbill later this year. In addition, I intend to introduce legislation \nsoon--also related to financial institutions--to create financial \nsecuritization investment trusts [FASITs] that should provide the \nnecessary revenue offset to pay for this proposal.\n  My legislation addresses an important business issue for large and \nsmall banks, and an important investment issue for their customers. \nVersions of this legislation have passed the Congress on two separate \noccasions with my strong support in the Senate. Given its modest cost, \nits noncontroversial nature and its widespread support, I am hopeful \nthat this much needed legislation will be enacted this year.\n  Let me make a few short comments to summarize why I believe this \nlegislation to permit conversions of common trust funds into mutual \nfunds without the recognition of gain or loss should be enacted:\n  It will permit all bank customers, not just trust customers, more \noptions for investing their savings.\n  It will make banks more competitive. Many savers are abandoning bank \ncertificates of deposit for the competition, and banks are unable to \noffer their customers an option.\n  Customers are unfamiliar with common trust funds, but do understand \nmutual funds. Therefore, mutual funds are more attractive to them.\n  The conversion is like a merger of two existing registered funds \nwhich allows securities to move intact from one fund to another with no \ntax consequences, so there is no ``sale''. The participant's underlying \ninvestment is unchanged. As a result, we also believe that there should \nnot be a revenue loss associated with this proposal. No revenue would \nbe gained under current law, because banks have a fiduciary duty to \ntheir customers and they would not incur a capital gains tax in order \nto make the conversion unless this law is changed. Therefore, the idea \nthat retaining current law will somehow result in more revenue is \nmisplaced.\n\n\n proposal to permit tax-free conversion of common trust fund assets to \n                        one or more mutual funds\n\n                              current law\n\n  Banks historically have established common trust funds in order to \nmaintain pooled funds of small fiduciary accounts. Under section 584, \ncommon trust funds must be maintained by banks exclusively for the \ncollective investment of monies in the banks' capacity as trustee, \nexecutor administrator, or guardian of certain accounts, in conformity \nwith rules established by the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of \nthe Currency. Common trust funds are not subject to income tax, and \nthey are not treated as corporations. They are a conduit, with income \n``passed through'' to fund participants for tax purposes.\n  Mutual funds are also considered conduits under the Tax Code. Unlike \ncommon trust funds, however, mutual funds are treated as corporations. \nAs a result of this differing tax treatment, it is unclear whether a \nmutual fund may merge with or acquire the assets of a common trust fund \nin a transaction that is tax-free to the common trust fund and its \nparticipants.\n\n\n                           reasons for change\n\n  The economic efficiencies, diversification, and liquidity of mutual \nfunds are key reasons for their popularity and growth in recent years. \nThese are attributes that are not generally found in common trust \nfunds. It would be desirable for banks to convert their existing common \ntrust funds into mutual funds so that bank customers, including trust \nparticipants, may take advantage of the benefits of mutual funds. The \nconversion of its common trust funds into one or more mutual funds \nwould also benefit banks by providing them with one set of investment \npools to manage.\n  Permitting tax-free conversions of a common trust fund to more than \none mutual fund would allow the more diverse common trust fund assets \nto be allocated to several mutual funds according to the appropriate \ninvestment and other objectives of the mutual funds. The multiple \nconversions feature is particularly significant for banks with small \ncommon trust funds, which probably would not be able to find a single \nmutual fund with the same investment objectives of a common trust fund.\n  However, until current law is clarified, it appears that the \nconversion of common trust fund assets into one or more mutual funds \nwould trigger tax to the participants of the common trust fund, an \nevent that could be viewed under State laws as a breach of a bank's \nfiduciary responsibilities. Thus, at present, banks generally are \nfinding it prohibitive to convert their common trust funds into more \neconomically efficient mutual funds.\n\n\n                                proposal\n\n  This proposal would allow a common trust fund to transfer \nsubstantially all of its assets to one or more mutual funds without \ngain or loss being recognized by the trust fund or its participants.\n  The common trust fund would transfer it assets to the mutual funds \nsolely in exchange for shares of the mutual funds, and the common trust \nfund would then distribute the mutual fund shares to its participants \nin exchange for the participants' interests in the common trust fund. \nThe basis of any asset received by the mutual fund would be the basis \nof the asset in the hands of the common trust fund prior to the \nconversion. In a conversion to more than one mutual fund, the basis in \neach mutual fund would be determined by allocating the basis in the \ncommon trust fund units among the mutual funds in proportion to the \nfair market value of the transferred assets.\n  This proposal has been designed to have a minimal cost to the Federal \nTreasury, and versions of this proposal have been passed by the \nCongress on two previous occasions. The benefits of such a change would \nbe felt by customers of large and small banking institutions throughout \nthe country, and has the support of both the mutual funds and banking \nindustries.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9913-1", "month": "07", "year":

LOCAL EMPOWERMENT AND FLEXIBILITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) historically, Federal programs have addressed the \n     Nation's problems by providing categorical financial \n     assistance with detailed requirements relating to the use of \n     funds;\n       (2) while the assistance described in paragraph (1) has \n     been directed at critical problems, some program requirements \n     may inadvertently impede the effective delivery of services;\n       (3) the Nation's local governments and private, nonprofit \n     organizations are dealing with increasingly complex problems \n     which require the delivery of many kinds of services;\n       (4) the Nation's communities are diverse, and different \n     needs are present in different communities;\n       (5) it is more important than ever to provide programs \n     that--\n       (A) promote more effective and efficient local delivery of \n     services to meet the full range of needs of individuals, \n     families, and society;\n       (B) respond flexibly to the diverse needs of the Nation's \n     communities;\n       (C) reduce the barriers between programs that impede local \n     governments' ability to effectively deliver services;

Mr. President, this amendment would eliminate a \nlarge and unjustified administrative burden imposed on employers by an \nill-considered piece of legislation passed 2 years ago. Specifically, \nit would repeal the Medicare and Medicaid coverage data bank, section \n13581 of OBRA 1993, a law that is extremely expensive, burdensome, \npunitive, and in my view, entirely unnecessary.\n  The data bank law requires every employer who offers health care \ncoverage to provide substantial and often difficult-to-obtain \ninformation on current and past employees and their dependents, \nincluding names, Social Security numbers, health care plans, and period \nof coverage. Employers that do not satisfy this considerable reporting \nobligation are subject to substantial penalties, possibly up to \n$250,000 per year or even more if the failure to report is found to be \ndeliberate.\n  The purported objective of the data bank law is to ensure \nreimbursement of costs to Medicare or Medicaid when a third party is \nthe primary payor. This is a legitimate objective. However, if the \nobjective of the data bank is to preserve Medicare and Medicaid funds, \nwhy is it necessary to mandate information on all employees, the vast \nmajority of whom have no direct association with either the Medicare or \nMedicaid Program?\n  Last year, I introduced S. 1933 to repeal the Medicare and Medicaid \ncoverage data bank. Unfortunately, this bill did not pass in the 103d \nCongress, in part because of a questionable Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis that estimated that the data bank would save the Federal \nGovernment about $1 billion. In contrast, the General Accounting Office \nfound that ``as envisioned, the data bank would have certain inherent \nproblems and likely achieve little or no savings to the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs.'' Still, due primarily to the fiction that the data \nbank would save money, S. 1933 was not enacted last year.\n  The GAO report on the data bank law also found that employers are not \ncertain of their specific reporting obligations, because HCFA has not \nprovided adequate guidance. Much of the information which is required \nis not typically collected by employers, such as Social Security \nnumbers of dependents and certain health insurance information. Some \nemployers have even questioned whether it is legal for them under \nvarious privacy laws to seek to obtain the required information.\n  The GAO report further found that employers are facing significant \ncosts in complying with the reporting requirements, including the costs \nof redesigning their payroll and personnel systems. It cites one \ncompany with 44,000 employees that would\n have costs of approximately $52,000 and another company with 4,000 \nemployees that would have costs of $12,000. Overall, the American \nPayroll Association estimated last year that this requirement will cost \nbetween $50,000 and $100,000 per company.\n\n  I would add that the reporting requirement applies only to employers \nthat provide health insurance coverage to their employees. It is \nunconscionable that we are adding costs and penalties to those who have \nbeen most diligent in providing health coverage to their employees. The \nlast thing that the Federal Government should do is impose \ndisincentives to employee health care coverage, which is one of \n\n[[Page S 9926]]\nthe unintended consequences of the data bank law.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the data bank law is that its \nenormous costs have little or no corresponding benefit. The GAO report \nconcluded that ``The additional information gathering and record \nkeeping required by the data bank appears to provide little benefit to \nMedicare or Medicaid in recovering mistaken payments.'' This is in part \nbecause HCFA is already obtaining this information in a much more \nefficient manner than that required under OBRA 1993.\n  For example, OBRA 1989 provides for HCFA to periodically match \nMedicare beneficiary data with Internal Revenue Service employment \ninformation--the Data Match Program. Also, HCFA directly asks \nbeneficiaries about primary payor coverage. To the extent that the data \nbank duplicates these efforts, any potential savings will not be \nrealized. It is clearly preferable to require HCFA to use the \ninformation it already has than to require the private sector to \nprovide duplicative information.\n  The GAO report found that ``the data match not only can provide the \nsame information [as the Data Bank] without raising the potential \nproblems described above, but it can do so at less cost.'' It also \nrecognized that both the data match and data bank processes rely too \nmuch on an after-the-fact recovery approach, and recommended enhancing \nup-front identification of other insurance and avoiding erroneous \npayments. In this regard, it documented that HCFA has already initiated \nthis prospective approach.\n  For these and other reasons, the Labor and Human Resources \nAppropriations report last year contained language prohibiting the use \nof Federal funds for developing or maintaining the data bank. However, \nthis provision by itself did not revoke the requirement that covered \nentities must still provide the required information on the health \ncoverage of current and former employees and their families, This would \nhave resulted in the bizarre situation in which covered employers would \nhave had to report the information, but there would have been no data \nbank to process or retrieve it.\n  Finally, in response to the public outcry about this Federal mandate, \nthe Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] indicated that it will \nnot be enforcing the data bank's reporting requirements in fiscal year \n1995. It stated that in light of the refusal of Congress to fund the \ndata bank, ``we have agreed to stay an administrative action to \nimplement the current requirements, including the promulgation of \nreporting forms and instructions. Therefore, we will not expect \nemployers to compile the necessary information or file the required \nreports. Likewise, no sanctions will be imposed for failure to file \nsuch reports.''\n  This was a major step in the right direction. However, the data bank \nand its reporting requirements are still in the law and are still \nscheduled to be implemented in the next fiscal year. Consequently, this \nyear I have reintroduced my data bank repeal bill, S. 194. I have \nrecently been informed that the CBO has revised its scoring to \nrecognize that the data bank would not save the Federal Government any \nmoney. This removed the only argument in favor of the data bank and the \nonly major impediment to its repeal.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government continues to impose substantial \nfinancial burdens on the private sector without fully accepting its \nshare of the burden to implement a program. We should once again expect \nthe worst case scenario to occur: employers will provide the required \ninformation at substantial administrative burden, there will be no data \nbank in which to make use of it, and even if a data bank were funded \nand established, the information stored could not be used efficiently \nto save Medicare or Medicaid funds.\n  I do not want this repeal to be construed, in any way, as opposition \nto HCFA obtaining the information it needs to administer the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs efficiently, and obtaining reimbursement from \nthird party payors when appropriate. To assure that HCFA has the \ninformation it needs, the bill also requires the Secretary of HHS to \nconduct a study and report to Congress on how to achieve the purported \nobjectives of the data bank in the most cost-effective manner possible.\n  The Secretary's study would have to take into consideration the \nadministrative costs and burden on the private sector and the \nGovernment of processing and providing the necessary information versus \nthe benefits and savings that such reporting requirements would \nproduce. It must also consider current HCFA reporting requirements and \nthe ability of entities to obtain the required information legally and \nefficiently.\n  Too often, Congress considers only the costs savings to the Federal \nGovernment of legislation while ignoring costs to other parties. The \nMedicare and Medicaid data bank is a case in point. Congress required \ninformation on millions of employees to save the Federal Government \nmoney. Yet, it will cost employers more money to comply than the \nGovernment saves. Congress must stop passing laws that impose large, \nunjustified, administrative burdens on other entities. It must consider \nthe impact of its actions on the whole economy and not just on the \nGovernment.\n  In summary, the reporting requirement for the Medicare and Medicaid \ndata bank is duplicative, burdensome, ineffective, and unnecessary. The \nGAO has characterized it as creating an avalanche of unnecessary \npaperwork for both HCFA and employers. It penalizes employers who \nprovide health care benefits to their workers--exactly the opposite \ngoal we should be pursuing. The data bank should be repealed and a more \ncost-effective approach should be found to ensure that Medicare and \nMedicaid are appropriately reimbursed by primary payors.\n  Mr. President, the 90 associations, organizations, and individual \nemployers in this coalition continue to demand repeal of this law. \nTheir message is clear. The Federal Government must stop imposing \nunjustified burdens on the private sector.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                         KYL AMENDMENT NO. 1515\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KYL submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \namendment No. 1487 proposed by Mr. Dole to the bill S. 343, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 75, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       ``(c) In reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute \n     made in a rulemaking or an adjudication, the reviewing court \n     shall--\n       ``(1) hold erroneous and unlawful an agency interpretation \n     that fails to give effect to the unambiguously expressed \n     intent of Congress; or\n       ``(2) if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to \n     an issue, hold arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of \n     discretion an agency action for which the agency has--\n       ``(A) refused or failed to consider a permissible \n     construction of the statute on the ground that the statute \n     precludes consideration of that interpretation; or\n       ``(B) failed to explain in a reasoned analysis why the \n     agency selected the interpretation it chose and why it \n     rejected other permissible interpretations of the statute.\n       ``(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     provisions of subsection (c) shall apply to, and supplement, \n     the requirements contained in any statute for the review of \n     final agency action that is not otherwise subject to this \n     section.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      JOHNSTON AMENDMENT NO. 1516\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1487 proposed by \nMr. Dole to the bill S. 343, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 25, line 19 strike out ``180 days'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``one year''.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 BAUCUS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1517\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON (for Mr. Baucus, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nBradley, Mrs.  Murray, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Reid, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \nGlenn, and Mr. Kennedy) proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1487 \nproposed by Mr. Dole to the bill S. 343, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike out all of section 628 (on p. 42 beginning at line 3 \n     strike out all through line 13 on p. 44) and renumber section \n     629 as section 628.\n       On p. 73 in the table of contents for SUBCHAPTER II--\n     ANALYSIS OF AGENCY RULES, replace ``628.

Mr. President, the Secretary of Energy has \ntransmitted to the Senate legislation to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct of 1982 to create a new funding approach for the Department of \nEnergy's civilian radioactive waste management program. This program \nwas created to meet the Department's obligation under the NWPA to \nprovide for the disposal of spent civilian nuclear fuel in a permanent \ngeologic repository by 1998.\n  To fund the program, the NWPA requires DOE to collect a fee of one \nmill per kilowatt hour on electricity generated by nuclear energy. The \nfee is collected by utilities from their ratepayers in their monthly \nbills and placed into a special nuclear waste fund in the Treasury. The \nfund receives approximately $600 million per year from collections and \ninterest. To date, approximately $9 billion in fees and interest has \nbeen placed in the fund.\n  Although the nuclear waste fund has a balance of about $4.9 billion \nthat was collected from ratepayers for precisely this purpose, the \nmoney is considered to be on-budget, and as such, is subject to \ndiscretionary spending caps under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. Thus, any \nincreases over past spending levels will require spending reductions in \nother DOE programs under the spending cap. As a part of the DOE fiscal \nyear 1995 budget request, DOE proposed that future contributions to the \nnuclear waste fund be set aside in a special off-budget fund for the \nprogram, with one-half of those funds available as a permanent \nappropriation each year. This proposal, which would have required \nlegislative action, was not adopted by the Congress. Instead, increased \nfunding for the program was provided under DOE's discretionary spending \ncaps. In its fiscal year 1996 budget request, DOE has proposed again \nthat a mandatory appropriation be established from the nuclear waste \nfund of $431.6 million per year. The legislation proposed by DOE would \nbe necessary to effectuate that change.\n  I believe that this legislation has no chance of success. There is \nstrong opposition to taking the waste fund off budget for a variety of \nreasons. First in my mind is the limitation on budgetary oversight that \nwould result from such an arrangement. Although DOE will have spent \nover $4.2 billion through the first quarter of fiscal year 1995 on the \nprogram, DOE has conceded that the 1998 deadline for the acceptance of \nspent nuclear fuel will not be met. Both the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board and the General Accounting Office have issued reports that \nare critical of the management of the Yucca Mountain program. Although \nDOE has recently made progress in improving the management of the \nprogram, in the past, overhead has consumed 56 percent of the funding \nfor site characterization.\n  What is needed is more oversight and involvement by the Congress, not \nless. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is considering \nlegislation that would alter the structure of the NWPA and DOE's \nprogram, with the goal of providing for the more efficient use of the \nratepayer's money. Funding and oversight issues will be considered in \nthe context of that legislation. Therefore, although I am not \nintroducing this bill as legislation, I am acknowledging receipt of the \nadministration's proposal and request that it be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows;\n                          Proposed Legislation\n\n       A bill to provide additional flexibility for the Department \n     of Energy's program for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel \n     and high level radioactive waste, and for other purposes.\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Waste Disposal \n     Funding Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NUCLEAR WASTE FUND AVAILABILITY.\n\n       Section 302 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 \n     U.S.C. 10222) is amended by inserting the following after \n     subsection (e):\n       ``(f) Nuclear Waste Fund Availability.--(1) If the \n     condition in subsection (g)(2) is met, the net proceeds from \n     the sale of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation which are \n     deposited in a special fund in the Treasury under subsection \n     (g)(1) may be used by the Department for radioactive waste \n     disposal activities under this Act.

Mr. President, some may wonder, why is anyone still \ntalking about the budget when the budget has been adopted?\n  The reality is that until we act on reconciliation and \nappropriations, we are still a long way from getting our budget \nproblems resolved.\n  In addition, without a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced \nbudget, I believe the political pressure will mount to cause us to move \naway from the direction of a balanced budget. That has been our \nexperience in the past. Legislative answers, such as Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings, which I voted for, hold up until they become too politically \nawkward. And any real move on the budget deficit eventually does become \npolitically awkward.\n  My reason for mentioning all this is that in the midst of the \nstruggle on the budget, I did not get a chance to read carefully the \nZero Deficit Plan put out by the Concord Coalition, headed by two of \nour former colleagues, Senator Warren Rudman and Senator Paul Tsongas.\n  It is an impressive document. Each of us could probably make some \nadjustments, but the staff and officers of the Concord Coalition should \ntake great pride in their solid contribution. The executive director of \nthe Concord Coalition is Martha Phillips, formerly on \n\n[[Page S 9934]]\nthe staff of the House Budget Committee, and the president is Peter G. \nPeterson, the former Secretary of Commerce.\n  The other officers are:\n  Lloyd Cutler, secretary and treasurer; Dr. John P. White, vice chair, \nissues committee; Eugene M. Freedman, vice chair, finance committee; \nDavid Sawyer, vice chair, public relations; Roger E. Brinner, vice \nchair; Hon. Maria Cantwell, vice chair; Dr. John W. Gardner, vice \nchair; Dr. Hanna Holborn Gray, vice chair; Hon. William H. Gray III, \nvice chair; Dr. George N. Hatsopoulos, vice chair; Hon. Barbara Jordan, \nvice chair; Harvey M. Meyerhoff, vice chair; Hon. Timothy J. Penny, \nvice chair; Joseph M. Segel, vice chair; and Paul Volcker, vice chair.\n  In the introduction to their proposal, they have a statement that \nresponds to the question ``Why Balance the Federal Budget?'' I ask that \nthe statement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n                    Why Balance the Federal Budget?\n\n       The Zero Deficit Plan is a plan for our economic future. \n     The goal is to assure a more secure, prosperous future for us \n     and our children.\n       We are not seeking to balance the budget for its own sake. \n     Reducing government spending and increasing taxes means \n     short-term sacrifice. This can only be justified by the long-\n     term economic benefits that will flow from putting our fiscal \n     house in order.\n       Eliminating the deficit will help put the nation back on \n     the path to lasting prosperity and to a rising standard of \n     living in the next century. That larger goal cannot be \n     achieved as long as the nation continues to run large budget \n     deficits in good times and bad, year in and year out.\n       A balanced budget and the nation's economic future are \n     directly linked. There is a tie between budget deficits today \n     and what we can enjoy tomorrow:\n       Because there are only so many hours in each day, the \n     principal way in which Americans can increase their standard \n     of living is for each worker to become more productive: \n     workers must produce more and better goods and services for \n     each hour worked.\n       For workers to become more productive, investments must be \n     made in education and training; in modernized plants, \n     equipment, and productive techniques; in new discoveries and \n     innovations; and in transportation, communications, and other \n     infrastructure.\n       To make these investments, there must be a pool of savings \n     that can be used for this purpose. Historically, the United \n     States has had a particularly low rate of private savings, \n     but, what is worse, the federal government's deficit is \n     financed by soaking up most of the savings we do manage to \n     put away. When the government spends more money than it has, \n     it borrows the rest. Most of the money borrowed comes from \n     private savings.\n       Only if the government stops using up private savings will \n     the money be available for investment. Balancing the federal \n     budget will free up the nation's savings for investments that \n     would increase our productivity,\n      create good jobs, and raise our standard of living.\n       The declining trend in what Americans produce for each hour \n     worked illustrates how serious a problem this has become. \n     From 1946 to 1973, what Americans produced for each hour of \n     work increased 2.9 percent each year. From 1974 to 1994, the \n     increase was only 1.1 percent a year. If productivity had \n     improved as rapidly in the past two decades as it had in the \n     previous three, the median annual family income today would \n     be over $50,500, instead of the $35,000 it is. That $15,500-\n     a-year gap is related to our large federal deficit. But \n     because we never had the $15,500, we don't miss it in the \n     same way we would if we had first enjoyed the income and then \n     given it up. As long as incomes continue to creep up even \n     slightly from one year to the next, the cumulative shortfalls \n     in income remains largely hidden from public indignation.\n       Solving the deficit problem does not automatically \n     guarantee a rosy economic future. Other developments are \n     needed to complement a balanced budget: reduced consumption, \n     increased savings and investment, improved productivity, \n     education, inflation and interest rates at desirable levels, \n     and a favorable worldwide economic climate. But unless we get \n     our deficit problem behind us, we will remain unable to take \n     advantage of these other necessary economic ingredients.\n       We cannot ignore the consequences of deficits much longer. \n     Growing commitments made by one generation to the next cannot \n     be honored on empty pocketbooks. A stagnant long-term economy \n     cannot support retirement payments, medical care, and all the \n     other benefits and services we would like. And it cannot \n     support economic opportunity for today's youth to live as \n     well as their parents' generation.\n       Massive federal budget deficits threaten our economy in \n     other ways as well. They increase the likelihood of \n     reigniting inflation by putting pressure on the government \n     simply to print more money to pay off its debt. The more \n     dollars are printed, the less each dollar in your wallet is \n     worth.\n       As foreign ownership of our resources has grown, so has our \n     dependence on the actions of foreign investors and \n     governments. These entities have come to own more and more of \n     our productive capacity. In addition, foreign investors have \n     bought up almost 20 percent of our government's recently \n     issued debt. As foreign holding of U.S. debt grows, so will \n     U.S. interest payments to foreign nationals.\n       Huge, continual deficits strangle the ability of even a \n     nation as rich as ours to respond when emergencies arise or \n     when new opportunities or problems emerge, including \n     recession. With our government deep in debt and continuing to \n     run huge deficits, we remain unable to shoulder new \n     responsibilities.\n\n\n    how large are our annual deficits and accumulated national debt?\n\n       In 1994, our government spent $203 billion more than it \n     raised in taxes. That deficit amounts to $780 for every \n     single American, or $3,120 for each family of four. That is \n     the sum your government borrowed on your behalf last year, \n     whether you wanted it to or not.\n       The $203 billion deficit was equal to 14 percent of federal \n     spending. For every dollar the government spent, 14 cents was \n     borrowed.\n       The $203 billion deficit was for all government operations \n     in 1994. It included the $57 billion 1994 surplus in the \n     Social Security Trust Fund., and a $1 billion deficit in the \n     Postal Service. This means that all other government spending \n     exceeded other revenues by $259 billion.\n       Our national debt, the net accumulation of all of the \n     annual deficits we have run and all the money we have \n     borrowed from government trust funds, stood at $4.8 trillion \n     in May 1995. That is $18,460 for every single American, or \n     $73,840 for each family of four.\n       The $4.8 trillion debt is equal to 67 percent of our \n     national economic output in 1995 (called the gross domestic \n     product, or GDP). If every American worked from January 1 \n     through September 1 and paid all of his or her earnings to \n     the federal government and spent nothing on food, clothing, \n     shelter, or anything else, the public debt would still not \n     quite be paid off.\n       Some people say there is no line-item in the federal budget \n     labeled ``waste, fraud, and abuse.'' But, in a way, there is. \n     It is called interest on the national debt, and last year it \n     cost our government $203 billion. We spent more on interest \n     than we spent on the entire U.S. military and almost as much \n     as we spent on Social Security. What did we get for it? \n     Nothing--not a single Social Security check, military \n     aircraft or mile of highway--not even a single school lunch.\n       Because annual interest payments on the debt are so large, \n     our government is actually borrowing just to pay interest. It \n     is as if we were running up our MasterCard to pay off our \n     debt to Visa, knowing that next year we will have to borrow \n     even more from American Express to keep the game going.\n\n\n           how did we accumulate a $5 trillion national debt?\n\n       Our nation was born in debt, a consequence of the high cost \n     of fighting the Revolutionary War. Our first president, \n     George Washington, adopted the practice of running generally \n     balanced budgets. President Thomas Jefferson went one step \n     further, pledging the nation to the goal of paying off its \n     debt within one generation. All subsequent administrations \n     for more than the next century and a half following the \n     founders' lead: running infrequent deficits during most wars \n     and deep recessions, and building surpluses to pay down the \n     national debt in times of peace and relative prosperity.\n       The Great Depression of the 1930s led to large deficits \n     when government revenues fell dramatically due to the high \n     number of people out of work, who were no longer paying \n     income taxes. Following on the heels of the depression, World \n     War II required still greater borrowing to mobilize 16 \n     million American troops to fight in Europe and Asia.\n       In the early postwar period, the Truman and Eisenhower \n     administrations and the Congresses with which they worked \n     roughly balanced the budget. Each president presided over \n     three surpluses and five deficits. As the economy boomed, the \n     national debt fell as a percentage of GDP.\n       However, during the 1960s and 1970s, the government began \n     to run deficits continuously. The debt grew slowly and \n     steadily, and by 1980 it was almost $1 trillion. By the \n     beginning of 1993, it had exploded to $4 trillion. And, \n     despite enactment of President Clinton's deficit reduction \n     legislation in 1993, the debt will reach the $5 trillion \n     level by the end of 1995. Since 1980, our debt has grown far \n     more quickly than our economy. Today, the debt is a much \n     greater percentage of GDP than it has been since the 1950s. \n     The 1980s marked the first peace-time economic expansion \n     during which the debt grew faster than the economy.\n       Who is to blame for amassing such debt in times of peace \n     and relative prosperity, a debt that would have shamed our \n     nation's founders? All of us. Presidents Reagan, Bush and \n     Clinton, as well a secession of Congresses, resisted spending \n     cuts and tax increases of the magnitude needed to balance the \n     budget. And voters supported candidates of both parties who \n     kept telling us what we wanted to hear instead of what we \n     needed to hear.\n\n\n                       two visions of the future\n                     What Happens if We Do Nothing?\n\n       If we ignore our mounting debt, if we just wish it would go \n     away and do nothing about it, it will grow and grow like a \n     cancer that will eventually overwhelm our economy and our \n     society. The interest we owe on the debt will skyrocket. We \n     will continue our vicious \n\n[[Page S 9935]]\n     cycle of having to raise taxes, cut spending, and borrow more and more \n     and more to pay interest upon interest. Our productivity \n     growth will remain stagnant; more of our workers will have to \n     settle for low-paying jobs; and our economy will continue its \n     anemic growth. America will decline as a world power.\n       Sometime early in the next century, we will have to \n     confront in the fundamental truth that low productivity and \n     slow economic growth have failed to generate enough goods and \n     services to satisfy all of our demands. Working people will \n     be required to pay an ever larger share of their earnings to \n     support a growing retired population and to pay the exploding \n     interest on the debt that the older generation accumulated. \n     Eventually, working people will refuse to submit to the \n     crushing burden forced upon them by their elders. They will \n     vote for leaders who will slash entitlement programs, even on \n     the truly needy, rather than raise taxes still further. \n     Millions of elderly people who thought that they could count \n     on their retirement benefits will find that the resources are \n     not there to meet their needs. There will be a generational \n     conflict pitting American against American, child against \n     parent, in a way that our nation has not seen before.\n\n\n             What Happens if We Instead Balance the Budget?\n\n       We could, on the other hand, do the right thing: we could \n     refuse to let our leaders continually borrow and spend and \n     borrow and spend; insist that they stop wasting our money and \n     our children's money on programs that do not work and on \n     entitlement payments for the well-off who do not need them; \n     insist that what spending is done is\n      paid for now, out of current taxation. If we do this, our \n     deficits will disappear; our debt will shrink; our \n     interest payments will become more and more manageable; \n     our businesses will invest; our economy will renew its \n     rapid growth of earlier years; and more of our people will \n     find employment in higher-paying jobs. Our society will \n     continue to flourish, and the American dream will be \n     restored to our children and to our children's children.\n\n\n                        do we have to start now?\n\n       Yes. Every year we delay deficit elimination, the problem \n     gets worse. And every year we muddle through with halfway \n     measures, we slip deeper into debt. Even a smaller deficit \n     adds to our mounting national debt and pushes up interest \n     payments.\n       Some argue that the economy is headed into recession and \n     that this is the wrong time to launch a serious deficit \n     reduction campaign. the same voices were heard opposing \n     deficit reduction in 1993, when the economy was recovering \n     from a severe recession, and opposing a serious run at the \n     deficit in 1994 because an election was approaching. There \n     will always be excuses for postponing the tough choices \n     required to balance the budget. But until we get control over \n     our deficits and our debt, we will not control our economic \n     destiny.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Then, they outline their principles for the deficit \nelimination.\n  Those principles strike me as being eminently sound. It is of no \nsmall significance that they do not ask for a tax cut.\n  Why both political parties are so enamored of a tax cut when we have \nthis huge deficit simply defies all logic.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record their principles of deficit \nelimination at this point.\n  The material follows:\n            What Are Our Principles for Deficit Elimination?\n\n       From the experience of past deficit reduction attempts, the \n     views of our members, and the economic needs of the country, \n     we have derived the following principles for deficit \n     elimination:\n       1. Balance the budget by the year 2002, and aim for a \n     surplus thereafter.\n       2. Distribute short-term sacrifice fairly and equitably \n     among Americans of all ages and income groups, except for the \n     very poor.\n       3. Enact policy changes right away, but phase them in \n     gradually to accomplish steady deficit reduction while \n     minimizing short-term economic dislocations.\n       4. Cut defense spending prudently, according to a realistic \n     assessment of the military capability needed to counter \n     threats to our national security today and in the foreseeable \n     future.\n       5. Control entitlement growth.\n       6. Contain mounting health care costs.\n       7. Keep revenue increases to a minimum, but if revenues \n     must rise, the increase should come from energy, luxury, and \n     alcohol and tobacco taxes.\n       8. Enforce deficit elimination with credible mechanisms, \n     including a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n       9. Avoid gimmicks. Use conservative economic projections.\n       10. Attract and deserve broad public support with a sound, \n     realistic deficit elimination plan.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Finally, I simply want to commend the Concord Coalition, \nagain, for a very constructive effort. I believe that their program is \nmore solid than the one adopted and, particularly if combined with a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment, could really move our Nation \nin the direction that we ought to go.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9933-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE ANTIOCHIAN ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN ARCHDIOCESE OF NORTH \n                                AMERICA\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Prof. Richard Uray of the University of South Carolina \nCollege of Journalism and Mass Communication for being inducted last \nweek into the South Carolina Broadcasting Association's Hall of Fame.\n  Rick's public induction signals what we've all known for a long \ntime--that he is one of the most dedicated broadcasting professionals \nthat South Carolina has ever had. We have known privately for years \nthat he ranks up there \n\n[[Page S 9936]]\nwith the likes of John Rivers, Walter Brown, Henry Cauthen, Betty \nRoper, Joe Wilder, Bill Saunders, and Dick Laughridge, among others. \nNow, everyone in the State will know.\n  Rick Uray has been teaching and influencing the lives of broadcasters \nfor more than 40 years. After receiving degrees from Kent State \nUniversity and the University of Houston, he came to South Carolina \nduring the year in which I was first elected to the Senate. That year, \n1966, he became the chairman of the broadcasting sequence at the USC \nCollege of Journalism and began teaching the art of broadcasting to \nhundreds of South Carolina's best students. Also in 1966, Rick started \na 30-year link with the South Carolina Broadcasting Association when he \nbecame the organization's executive manager.\n  Mr. President, as the leader of the SCBA, Rick Uray has been a \ntestament to true professionalism.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to honor a \nwoman who has distinguished herself in her lifetime. Frances Wilhelmine \nGodejohn will celebrate her 100th birthday on July 26. Born and raised \nin St. Louis, MO, she comes from a colorful heritage and represents a \nwonderful example of someone who worked long and hard to support \nherself, living a life of honesty and probity. She is a devout \nChristian.\n  Frances Wilhelmine Godejohn was born in St. Louis, MO, on July 26, \n1895. Her father, William Mathias Godejohn, was born in Washington, MO, \nin 1859. Prior to settling in St. Louis, he worked on a railroad \nconstruction project in New Mexico where he was shot by Indians, \nvisited Yellowstone before it became a national park, and homesteaded \nin Montana. Her mother, Mary Elise Dallmeyer, was born in Gasconade \nCounty, MO. Both William and Mary's fathers were born in Germany.\n  Frances Godejohn completed the eighth grade in 1909, then went to \nRubicam Business School, where she graduated in 1911. She began a \ncareer as a legal secretary that lasted until her retirement in 1972. \nPrimarily, she worked for William H. Allen, first when he was an \nattorney, then when he served as a judge on the St. Louis Court of \nAppeals from 1915 to 1927, then again when he was a lawyer until his \ndeath in 1952.\n  Frances Godejohn worked in the corporate headquarters for Pevely \nDairy from 1952 to 1960, when she formally retired. Not content in \nretirement, she resumed work as a legal secretary, first for David \nCampbell, until he died, and then for Edmund Albrecht. She finally \nretired in 1972, after breaking her leg while getting off the bus on \nher way to work.\n  Still spry and alert, Frances Godejohn regularly attends the \nPresbyterian Church, reads, follows the St. Louis Cardinals, \ncorresponds with her many relatives and is a source of inspiration to \nall who know her.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9936-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9936-S9937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE FORGOTTEN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, I was pleased to note an \narticle in the magazine, the Jerusalem Report, a magazine whose quality \nof reporting I have come to appreciate. The article concerns the \nArmenian genocide.\n  Titled ``The Forgotten Genocide,'' the article deals not only with \nthe genocide but the delicate matter of relations between Israel and \nTurkey.\n  It is a frank but sensitive discussion of the problems that have been \nfaced by a people who, in many ways, had an experience similar to the \nJewish experience.\n  I am pleased The Jerusalem Report has published this article by Yossi \nKlein Halevi, and I hope it is the first of many steps to bring about a \ncloser relationship between Israel and Armenia. I also add the strong \nhope that the relationship between Armenia and Turkey can improve \nbecause both countries can benefit from that improvement.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n                         The Forgotten Genocide\n\n                        (By Yossi Klein Halevi)\n\n       Every night at 10 o'clock, the massive iron doors of the \n     walled Armenian compound in Jerusalem's Old City are shut. \n     Any of the compound's 1,000 residents who plan to return home \n     from the outside world past that time must get permission \n     from the priest on duty. The nightly ritual of self-\n     incarceration is in deference to the monastery, located in \n     the midst of the compound's maze of low arched passageways \n     and stone apartments with barred windows.\n       Yet the seclusion is also symbolically appropriate: \n     Jerusalem's Armenians are consecrated to historical memory, \n     sealed off in a hidden wound. Every year, on April 24--the \n     date commemorating the systematic Turkish slaughter in 1915 \n     of 1.5 million Armenians, over a third of the total Armenian \n     nation, many of them drowned, beheaded, or starved on desert \n     death marches--the trauma is publicly released, only to \n     disappear again behind the compound's iron doors.\n       The genocide remains the emotional centerpoint of the \n     ``Armenian village,'' as residents call the compound. In its \n     combined elementary and high school hang photos of 1915: \n     Turkish soldiers posing beside severed heads, starving \n     children with swollen stomachs. On another wall are drawings \n     of ancient Armenian warriors slashing enemies, the \n     compensatory fantasies of a defeated people.\n       While elders invoke the trauma with more visible passion, \n     young people seem no less possessed. ``There is a sadness \n     with me always,'' says George Kavorkian, a Hebrew University \n     economics student.\n       In a large room with vaulted ceilings and walls stained by \n     dampness, 89-year-old Sarkis Vartanian assembles old-\n     fashioned pieces of metal type, from which he prints \n     Armenian-language calendars on a hand press. Vartanian is one \n     of Jerusalem's last survivors of the genocide. Though the \n     community has a modern press, it continues to maintain his \n     archaic shop, so that he can remain productive.\n       Vartanian tells his story without visible emotion. In 1915, \n     he was living in a Greek-sponsored orphanage in eastern \n     Turkey. Police would come every day and ask who among the \n     children wanted to go for a boat ride. Vartanian noticed that \n     none of those who'd gone ever returned. One day, strolling on \n     the beach, he saw bodies. He fled the country, and made his \n     way with a relative to Jerusalem, joining its centuries-old \n     Armenian community.\n       When he finishes speaking of 1915, he relates some humorous \n     details of his life, a man seemingly at peace with his past. \n     But suddenly, without warning, he begins to sob. For minutes \n     he stands bent with grief. Then, just as abruptly, he turns \n     to the dusty boxes of black metal letters and carefully \n     assembles a line of type.\n       Even more than grief, Armenians today are driven by \n     grievance: outrage at Turkey's refusal to admit its crime, \n     let alone offer compensation. Though there has been some \n     international recognition of the genocide, a vigorous Turkish \n     public-relations campaign claiming the genocide is a myth has \n     created doubts. The Turks insist that the numbers of Armenian \n     dead have been exaggerated, that no organized slaughter \n     occurred, and that those who did die perished from wartime \n     hardships--the very arguments used by Holocaust \n     ``revisionists,'' notes Dr. Ya'ir Oron, author of a just-\n     published book tracing Israeli attitudes to the Armenian \n     genocide.\n       Perhaps the most forceful rebuttal to Turkish denial came \n     from the former U.S. ambassador to Turkey, Henry Morgenthau, \n     an eyewitness to the massacres, who wrote in 1917: ``The \n     whole history of the human race contains no such horrible \n     episode as this.'' Despite the overwhelming number of similar \n     eyewitness testimonies, the Armenians must continually prove \n     that their mourning is justified.\n       Many of Israel's 4,000 Armenians--who live in Haifa and \n     Jaffa as well as in parts of the Old City's Armenian Quarter \n     just outside the monastery compound--feel an almost pathetic \n     gratitude to those Jews who acknowledge them as fellow \n     sufferers. One afternoon, George Hintlian, an Armenian \n     cultural historian, took me to the obelisk memorial in Mt. \n     Zion's Armenian cemetery. I laid a small stone on the \n     memorial, the Jewish sign of respect for the dead. ``Thank \n     you,'' said Hintlian with emotion, as though I'd performed \n     some unusual act of kindess.\n       While historians attribute the genocide to Turkish fears of \n     Armenian secession from the Ottoman empire, Armenians \n     themselves say the Turks were jealous of their commercial and \n     intellectual success. We're just like the Jews, they say. \n     Indeed, Armenians see the Jewish experience as a natural \n     context for their own self-understanding. They envy the \n     recognition our suffering has earned; they even envy us for \n     having been killed by Germans who, unlike Turks, have at \n     least admitted their crimes and offered compensation.\n       Like the Jews, say Armenians, they too are a people whose \n     national identity is bound \n\n[[Page S 9937]]\n     up with religion, whose members are scattered in a vast Diaspora and \n     whose homeland--politically independent since 1991 but \n     economically dependent on neighboring Turkey--is surrounded \n     by hostile Muslim states. And while some Armenians sympathize \n     with the Palestinians, others privately concede their fear of \n     Muslim fundamentalism.\n       But for all their affinity with the Jews, Armenians are \n     deeply wounded by Israel's refusal to recognize the \n     genocide--a result, says Oron, of Turkish pressure. Israel \n     looks to Turkey as an ally against Muslim extremism, and owes \n     it a debt for allowing Syrian Jews to escape across its \n     territory in the 1980s. And so no government wreath has ever \n     been laid at the Mt. Zion memorial. And Israel TV has \n     repeatedly banned a documentary film about the Armenians, \n     ``Passage to Ararat.''\n       Though there are cracks in the government's silence--on the \n     80th anniversary of the massacre this past April 24, for \n     example, Absorption Minister Yair Tsaban joined an Armenian \n     demonstration at the Prime Minister's Office--the ambivalence \n     persists. Last year, the Education Ministry commissioned Oron \n     to write a high school curriculum on the Armenian and Gypsy \n     genocides. But then, only two weeks before the curriculum was \n     to be experimentally implemented, the ministry abruptly \n     backtracked. A ministry-appointed commission of historians \n     (none of them Armenian experts) claimed that Oron's textbook \n     contained factual errors about the Gypsies and didn't present \n     the Turkish perspective on the Armenians. A spokesman for the \n     ministry says a new textbook will be commissioned.\n       While Oron is careful to avoid accusing the ministry of \n     political motives. Armenians are far less reticent. Says \n     Hintlian: ``Obviously there is Turkish pressure. If the Turks \n     get away with their lie, it will strengthen the Holocaust \n     deniers, who will see that if you are persistent enough a \n     large part of humanity will believe you.''\n       So long as the Turks claim the genocide never happened, the \n     Armenians will likely remain riveted to their trauma.\n       Bishop Guregh Kapikian is principal of the Armenian school. \n     When he speaks of 1915 his head thrusts forward, voice \n     quivering. His cheeks are hollowed, his chin ends in a white-\n     goateed point--a face gnawed by grief and sharpened by rage.\n       Kapikian, born in Jerusalem, was 3 when his father, a \n     historian, died of pneumonia, having been weakened from the \n     death march he'd survived. Kapikian eventually become a \n     priest--``to be a soldier of the spirit of the Armenian \n     nation.''\n       Are you concerned, I ask, that your students may learn to \n     hate Turks?\n       ``The Turks have created hatred. Our enemy is the whole \n     Turkish people.''\n       But didn't some Turks help Armenians?\n       ``They weren't real Turks. Maybe they were originally \n     Christian, Armenian.''\n       If Turkey should someday admit its crimes, could you \n     forgive them?\n       ``They can't do that. They're not human. What can you \n     expect from wild beasts?''\n       There are other Armenian voices.\n       George Sandrouni, 31, runs a ceramics shop outside the \n     compound. He sells urns painted with clusters of grapes, \n     tiles with horsemen and peacocks, chess boards garlanded with \n     pale blue flowers.\n       As a boy, he feared everyone he knew would disappear. The \n     son of a man who survived the genocide as an infant, \n     Sandrouni grew up with no close relatives, all of whom were \n     killed in 1915. He resolved that when he married he would \n     have 20 children, to fill the world with Armenians.\n       Now expecting his first child, he has become ``more \n     realistic, less paranoid.'' He says: ``The Turks have to be \n     educated about the genocide. But we also have to learn how to \n     deal with our past. I won't teach my children about the \n     genocide as something abstract, like mathematics. I'll teach \n     them that other people suffer; that some Turks helped \n     Armenians; that evil is never with the majority. I'll try to \n     keep the horror from poisoning their souls.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9936-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                CBO ESTIMATES ON INSULAR DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on June 30, 1995, I filed Report \n104-101 to accompany S. 638, the Insular Development Act of 1995, that \nhad been ordered favorably reported on June 28, 1995. At the time the \nreport was filed, the estimates by Congressional Budget Office were not \navailable. The estimate is now available and concludes that enactment \nis now available and concludes that enactment of S. 638 would result in \nno significant cost to the Federal Government and in no cost to State \nor local governments and would not affect direct spending or receipts. \nI ask that the text of the CBO estimate be printed in the Record.\n  The text follows:\n                                      Congressional Budget Office,\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed S. 638, the Insular Development Act of 1995, as \n     reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on \n     June 30, 1995. CBO estimates that S. 638 would result in no \n     significant cost to the federal government and in no cost to \n     state or local governments. Enacting S. 638 would not affect \n     direct spending or receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would not apply.\n       S. 638 would restructure as agreement for making payments \n     to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). \n     Presently, the federal government is obligated to make annual \n     payments of $27.7 million to CNMI. S. 638 would maintain that \n     funding commitment but would expand the purposes for which \n     those funds could be spent. Based on a 1992 agreement reached \n     between CNMI and the federal government, CNMI would receive a \n     declining portion of those funds for infrastructure \n     development through fiscal year 2000. The remaining funds \n     would be used for capital infrastructure projects in American \n     Samoa in 1996 and in all insular areas in 1997 and \n     thereafter. (Insular areas include Guam, the Virgin Islands, \n     American Samoa, CNMI, the Republic of Palau, the Federated \n     States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands.) Of the funds designated for 1997 and thereafter, $3 \n     million would be designated for the College of the Northern \n     Marianas in 1997 only, and $3 million would be allocated each \n     year to the Department of the Interior (DOI) for either \n     federal or CNMI use in the areas of immigration, labor, and \n     law enforcement. Additionally, beginning in fiscal year 1997, \n     DOI would be required to prepare and update annually a five-\n     year capital infrastructure plan for insular projects.\n       CBO estimates that the reallocation of funds that would \n     occur under this bill would have little, if any, effect on \n     the rates at which such funds are spent. CBO has no reason to \n     expect that infrastructure funds used by other insular areas \n     would be spent at a rate different from those used by CNMI. \n     Also, based on information provided by the DOI, CBO estimates \n     that\n      the bill's capital infrastructure planning requirement would \n     result in no significant cost to the federal government.\n       S. 638 also would gradually apply the minimum wage \n     provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to CNMI, \n     which would require enforcement activity by the Department of \n     Labor (DOL). The department expects that it would continue to \n     receive annually $800,000 of the CNMI funds allocated to DOI \n     for immigration, labor, and law enforcement purposes. DOL \n     uses these funds to train CNMI officials to enforce labor \n     laws, while providing additional temporary enforcement \n     assistance. Based on information from the DOL, CBO expects \n     that DOL would continue to receive these funds under this \n     bill and that they would be sufficient to conduct FLSA \n     enforcement. Therefore, we estimate that no additional costs \n     to the federal government would result from this provision.\n       Additionally, S. 638 would require that DOI continue to \n     submit annually to the Congress a report on the ``State of \n     the Islands,'' as well as a report on immigration, labor, and \n     law enforcement issues in CNMI. The bill also would make \n     several clarifications to existing law and would require \n     cooperation in immigration matters between CNMI and the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service. CBO estimates that \n     these provisions would result in no significant cost to the \n     federal government.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.

From its origins with 150 \nstudents in an old abandoned elementary school, Albuquerque Technical-\nVocational Institute has matured to become New Mexico's second largest \nhigher educational institution with 20,000 students at three campuses, \nand an additional satellite campus planned in Bernalillo County's South \nValley.\n  The development of Albuquerque's silicon mesa and high-tech economic \nexpansion would have been impossible without the high-tech training \nprovided at T-VI. T-VI wisely seeks out the counsel of the business \ncommunity to ensure that its programs and training facilities are \nstate-of-the-art. T-VI is a leader in technical education in New \nMexico, placing its graduates in working environments that have helped \nto expand the state's economy and enrich the community.\n  In a community noted for its cultural diversity, T-VI has become a \nmodel of educational advancement. T-VI graduates are at work in a \nvariety of technical careers, trades and professions throughout New \nMexico.

Mr. President, a longtime friend of mine, Lawrence \nHansen, vice president of the Joyce Foundation, sent me a copy of a \nspeech made by Deborah Leff, the president of the Joyce Foundation, on \nthe occasion of the 75th anniversary of the League of Women Voters of \nthe State of Illinois.\n  The subject of her address is campaign financing.\n  It contains material that would be startling to most citizens though, \nunfortunately, not startling to those of us who serve in the Senate.\n  While the bulk of her remarks are about campaign financing, I want to \nquote one item that is not. She says:\n       I am saddened by the media's increasing tendency to \n     exploit, entertain and titillate, leaving us less informed \n     about public affairs and more cynical about politics.\n\n  She announces that the Joyce Foundation will make a 3-year, $2.3 \nmillion special study on money and politics.\n  While the emphasis of her project will be the State of Illinois, \nclearly she draws lessons from what has happened at the national level, \nand we should draw lessons beyond the State of Illinois.\n  For example, she says:\n\n       In 1976, the average cost of winning a seat in the U.S. \n     House of Representatives was less than $80,000. Last year, it \n     leveled off at $525,000. Between 1990 and 1992 alone, the \n     cost of winning a House seat jumped by 33 percent. In fact, \n     45 House candidates in 1994 spent over $1 million each.\n\n  On PACs, Ms. Leff says:\n\n       To understand the competitive effects of the current \n     campaign finance system, consider the giving habits of \n     political action committees--PACs. Last year, PACs \n     distributed close to $142 million to House candidates, three-\n     quarters of which went to incumbents. To appreciate the \n     enormity of this bias, it's worth noting that the winning \n     candidates last year raised more money from PACs than their \n     challengers generated from all sources, including from PACs, \n     individual contributors, their own donations and loans.\n\n  She is concerned, as we should be concerned, the present system of \nfinancing campaign makes our political institutions unrepresentative. \nShe observes:\n\n       The skewed distribution of political money is not just a \n     problem for challengers. There's another--and some would \n     argue more pernicious--side to this imbalance. The campaign \n     finance system favors wealthy candidates over poor \n     candidates, male candidates over female candidates, and white \n     candidates over African-American and Latino candidates. And \n     this bias continues to be reflected in the composition of \n     many legislative bodies.\n       Although less than one-half of one percent of the American \n     people are millionaires, there are today at least 72 \n     millionaires in the U.S. House of Representatives and 29 in \n     the U.S. Senate. (And these figures don't include Michael \n     Huffington, who spent $5 million of his own money to win a \n     House seat in 1992 and an additional $28 million last year in \n     his failed bid to become a Senator.) There is something \n     terribly wrong when millionaires are over-represented in the \n     ``People's House'' by a factor of 3,000 percent and in the \n     Senate by a factor of more than 5,000 percent.\n\n  The president of the Joyce Foundation also notes something every one \nof us knows to be the fact:\n\n       Candidates' increased reliance on television ads has led to \n     less informative and more mean-spirited campaigns. We are \n     told that attack ads work; they must, because why else would \n     candidates invest so much money in this stuff? But who really \n     benefits and at what cost to the political system? The public \n     is fed slivers of information, often deceptively presented. \n     Real issues are not discussed. The most obvious victim, of \n     course, is a political tradition that once prided itself in \n     allowing serious candidates to debate serious issues in a \n     serious way.\n\n  Then, she says something that I do not know to be a fact, but, as far \nas I know, it is accurate. She tells her audience:\n\n       The United States is the only major democracy that neither \n     restricts the amount of money candidates can spend on \n     broadcast advertising nor regulates their access to and use \n     of this powerful medium. As a result, the quality of the \n     nation's political discourse has declined sharply. And so, \n     too, has the public's confidence in the veracity and judgment \n     of our leaders.\n\n  A minor correction I would make to her speech is that she refers to \n$100 million being spent to defeat health care. Newsweek magazine uses \nthe figure $400 million, and I believe that Newsweek magazine is \ncorrect.\n  She also notes:\n\n       In 1992, half of all the money raised by congressional \n     candidates--$335 million--was provided by one-third of 1 \n     percent of the American people.\n\n  Deborah Leff has a number of illustrations of the abuses. They \ninclude references to my friend, the former speaker of the Illinois \nHouse, Michael Madigan, and the current speaker of the Illinois House, \nLee Daniels. What Michael Madigan and Lee Daniels are doing is using \nthe present system. I do not fault them for that. But what Ms. Leff is \nsaying is that the system should be changed, and I agree with her.\n  She does not call for any specific program of change.\n  My own belief is that at the Federal level, we have to have dramatic \nchange, and it will not come about without the President of the United \nStates really pushing for change. The system I would like to have is a \ncheck-off contribution of $3 or $5 on our income tax that would go to \nmajor candidates for the Senate and the House, and no other money could \nbe spent. Then, in a State like Illinois, instead of spending $8 \nmillion or $10 million on a campaign, the candidates could spend $2 \nmillion, and have some required free time made available by radio and \ntelevisions, not for 30-second spots, but for statements of up to five \nminutes by the candidates in which there is a serious discussion of the \nissues.\n  I ask that the full Deborah Leff speech be printed in the Record, and \nI urge my colleagues of both parties and their staffs to read the \nDeborah Leff speech.\n  The material follows:\n  Speech of Deborah Leff, President, the Joyce Foundation at the 75th \nAnniversary Convention of the League of Women Voters of Illinois--June \n                                2, 1995\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       I am delighted to be here this evening and to play a small \n     role in celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of \n     the League of Women Voters. No organization in this century \n     has contributed more to expanding informed citizen \n     participation in the political process and can legitimately \n     claim more victories for democracy than the league. Yours is \n     a proud legacy, and I salute you.\n       Through the years the Joyce Foundation has frequently \n     partnered with the league. We have labored together to \n     simplify the Nation's voter registration laws--and despite \n     some unseemly footdragging here in the land of Lincoln and \n     several other States, we have made real progress. I read in \n     the newspaper a few weeks ago that in the few months since \n     the Motor Voter Act was put into effect early this year, two \n     million new voters have been registered. Two million. It's a \n     wonderful number. And you should be very proud.\n       Joyce also stood with the league in its efforts to \n     institutionalize presidential debates, and happily that has \n     occurred.\n       Two years ago, we supported the ``wired for democracy'' \n     project. This collaborative effort, involving the national \n     league and a number of State and local chapters, has been \n     exploring ways of making greater use of communication \n     technologies to meet the informational needs of citizens.\n       And last year we joined forces with you in an ambitious \n     experiment to make the Illinois gubernatorial race more \n     issue-oriented. The goal was to enable the people of Illinois \n     to identify their major policy concerns, frame an issues \n     agenda, and engage the candidates for Governor in a \n     conversation about their visions and plans for the State's \n     future. That the candidates took less notice of these \n     citizens' messages than they should have only confirms how \n     desperately we need new and inventive ways for reconnecting \n     people and their elected representatives. The ``Illinois \n     voter project'' was a valiant and useful attempt to bridge \n     that gulf, and Joyce was glad to play a part.\n\n\n                         a crisis of confidence\n\n       Will Rogers once wrote, ``I don't make jokes, I just watch \n     the government and report the facts.'' And although we have \n     much to celebrate tonight, there are a lot of facts to \n     report. And, unfortunately, they're not funny. A terrible \n     malaise has settled over our democracy. The fact is millions \n     of our fellow citizens are fed up with politics. They feel \n     left out, disconnected, unheard, unappreciated and powerless. \n     And in frustration and anger, they are abandoning the system \n     in droves. The signs of discontent are myriad. I'll mention \n     only a few:\n       Three our of four Americans today say they ``trust \n     government in Washington'' only ``some of the time'' or \n     ``almost never.'' In the mid-1960s, only 30 percent--rather \n     than 75 percent--of Americans felt that way. (Roper \n     Organization) \n\n[[Page S 9939]]\n\n       Nearly 60 percent of us believe that ``the people running \n     the country don't really care what happens to us.'' (Louis \n     Harris)\n       Public approval of Congress almost reached rock bottom in \n     1994.\n       The Roper organization reports that millions of citizens \n     have withdrawn from community affairs over the last 20 years. \n     In 1973 one in four American adults said they attended a \n     public meeting on community or school business during the \n     year. Two years ago, only 13 percent of us claimed we had \n     attended such forums.\n       And from a relatively high point in the early 1960s, voter \n     turnout in national elections has declined by nearly a \n     quarter. In State and local elections, the trends are even\n      worse. Only 37 percent of Chicago's voters bothered to \n     participate in February's mayoral and aldermanic primary \n     election; and just over 40 percent went to the polls in \n     April's general election, marketing the lowest turnout in \n     a city election in more than a half century.\n       I wish I could report that these discontents were traceable \n     to a single cause, to some easily identified and manageable \n     condition. But clearly, as everybody in this room recognizes, \n     that is not the case.\n       We know, for example, that economic anxieties are taking a \n     toll on our civic life. Millions of Americans have grown \n     pessimistic about getting ahead in a rapidly changing \n     economy. Many are struggling just to stay even, and they \n     blame government for their plight.\n       We know that the breakdown of traditional institutions, \n     like families and schools, and an accompanying rise in social \n     pathologies have deepened the public's despair about the \n     political system.\n       We know that civic education is in a deplorable state and \n     that the ranks of those voluntary organizations that have \n     traditionally and energetically labored over the years to \n     fill this vacuum are today greatly depleted.\n       As some of you know, I worked for the news media for years. \n     I respect the news media, and I often admire it. But I am \n     saddened by the media's increasing tendency to exploit, \n     entertain and titillate, leaving us less informed about \n     public affairs and more cynical about politics.\n       We know that technology, television, and talk radio can \n     reinforce our isolation and exacerbate social divisions \n     rather than fostering the cooperative, tolerant, and generous \n     spirit which a democracy requires.\n       And then there's the issue of money in politics--an old and \n     spirited demon with which both the league and the Joyce \n     Foundation have done battle off and on over the years. As \n     Senator Bill Bradley recently noted,\n       ``Make no mistake, money talks in American politics today \n     as never before. No revival of our democratic culture can \n     occur until citizens feel that their participation is more \n     meaningful than the money lavished by pacs and big donors.''\n       The fundamental problem, Bradley says, is that ``the rich \n     have a loudspeaker and everyone else gets by with a \n     megaphone.'' And, of course, he's absolutely right. The Joyce \n     Foundation believes that overhauling the campaign finance \n     system is as urgent a piece of unfinished business on the \n     Nation's crowded policy agenda as any other.\n       You know, Eleanor Roosevelt once wrote, ``I think if the \n     people of this country can be reached with the truth, their \n     judgment will be in favor of the many, instead of the \n     privileged few.'' We want a Government for the many, a \n     Government where the concerns of the citizenry are respected \n     and addressed. And for that reason, the Joyce Foundation \n     decided last year to launch a 3-year, $2.3 million special \n     project on money and politics.\n       Campaign finance reform is not a sexy issue. It doesn't get \n     enough attention from the media, and it doesn't get enough \n     attention from foundations. But I want, in my remaining time \n     with you, to talk about why this problem is so critical to \n     the future of America, and why it must be taken on.\n\n\n                              the problem\n\n       As you know, the financing of political campaigns is \n     governed by a patchwork of laws and regulations. Federal \n     candidates operate under one set of rules; State and local \n     candidates under others. The variations among jurisdictions \n     are endless, but these systems have one thing in common: they \n     don't work very well. Let me briefly discuss their most \n     obvious deficiences, leaving to last what I regard as the \n     most compelling argument for reform.\n  Problem 1: The current system has allowed campaign costs to rise to \n                           prohibitive levels\n\n       The cost of running for public office has skyrocketed over \n     the past 20 years, especially at the Federal and State \n     levels. Few campaign finance laws make any effort to restrain \n     spending.\n       In 1976, the average cost of winning a seat in the U.S. \n     House of Representatives was less than $80,000. Last year, it \n     leveled off at $525,000. Between 1990 and 1992 alone, the \n     cost of winning a House seat jumped by 33 percent. In fact, \n     45 House candidates in 1994 spent over $1 million each.\n       The same pattern can be seen here in Illinois. Five State \n     Senate candidates spent more than $500,000 each in their 1992 \n     campaigns. The 20 most expensive Senate races that year cost \n     over $5 million.\n       These trends have had three effects. First, they have \n     rendered public service unaffordable for a growing number of \n     qualified citizens of ordinary means.\n       Second, the escalating costs of campaigns are making it \n     easier for wealthy and well-connected citizens to win public \n     office.\n       And third, those willing to pay the price of admission find \n     themselves spending more time begging than meeting voters, \n     doing their policy homework, and governing.\n\nProblem 2: Under the current campaign finance system, money, more than \n       any other factor, determines who wins and loses elections\n\n       As a general rule, candidates who raise and spend the most \n     almost always win. Cash--not the qualifications, character \n     and policy views of candidates--has increasingly become the \n     currency of democracy.\n       In last year's election, House incumbents on average \n     outspent their opponents by nearly 3-to-1 ($572,388 vs. \n     $206,663), and despite the public's anger with Congress and a \n     higher than usual turnover in the House, 90 percent of the \n     incumbents survived. In fact, 72 percent of House incumbents \n     running in last fall's election outraised their challengers \n     by $200,000 or more, and 23 percent outdistanced their \n     opponents by at least $500,000. If a challenger did not spend \n     at least $250,000--and fewer than one-third of last year's \n     challengers reached that threshold, his or her chances of \n     winning were only one in a hundred.\n\nProblem 3: The current campaign finance system has made elections less \n                              competitive\n\n       The current rules tilt so heavily in favor of incumbent \n     officeholders that most challengers cannot hope to win. As a \n     result, large numbers of elections that should be competitive \n     rarely are.\n       In 1994, less than one in three congressional races were \n     financially competitive. In fact, four out of five House \n     incumbents faced challengers with so little money--typically \n     less than 50 percent of the amount available to the \n     incumbent--that they did not pose a serious threat.\n       To understand the competitive effects of the current \n     campaign finance system, consider the giving habits of \n     political action committees--PAC's. Last year, PAC's \n     distributed close to $142 million to House candidates, three-\n     quarters of which went to incumbents. To appreciate the \n     enormity of this bias, it's worth noting that the winning \n     candidates last year raised more money from PAC's than their \n     challengers generated from all sources, including from PAC's, \n     individual contributors, their own donations and loans.\n       The real losers, of course, are voters. As elections become \n     less competitive and as the range of candidate and policy \n     decisions voters must make narrows, there is less and less \n     reason to go to the polls. Under the circumstances people \n     cannot be entirely blamed for staying away.\n Problem 4: Because of the campaign finance system's inherent biases, \n        many of our representative institutions remain terribly \n                           unrepresentative.\n\n       The skewed distribution of political money is not just a \n     problem for challengers. There's another--and some would \n     argue more pernicious--side to this imbalance. The campaign \n     finance system favors wealthy candidates over poor \n     candidates, male candidates over female candidates, and white \n     candidates over African-American and Latino candidates. And \n     this bias continues to be reflected in the composition of \n     many legislative bodies.\n       Although less than one-half of one percent of the American \n     people are millionaires, there are today at least 72 \n     millionaires in the U.S. House of Representatives and 29 in \n     the U.S. Senate. (And these figures don't include Michael \n     Huffington, who spent $5 million of his own money to win a \n     House seat in 1992 and an additional $28 million last year in \n     his failed bid to become a Senator.) There is something \n     terribly wrong when millionaires are over-represented in the \n     ``people's house'' by a factor of 3,000 percent and in the \n     Senate by a factor of more than 5,000 percent.\n       When 64 House and Senate candidates can reach into their \n     own pockets and give their campaigns a $100,000 shot in the \n     arm, as occurred last year, it takes your breath away. Twelve \n     of these candidates, let me add, invested more than $1 \n     million each in their campaigns.\n       These financial disparities are not limited to just rich \n     and poor candidates. In 1991, white candidates for the \n     Chicago city council raised five times more money than \n     African-American candidates and one and a half times more \n     than Latino condidates. If African-Americans had to run \n     regularly against white or Latino candidates in racially and \n     ethnically mixed wards, they would likely operate at a severe \n     financial disadvantage. And given the importance of money, \n     their chances of being elected from such wards would at best \n     be problematic.\n       As I am sure you know, never in the long history of this \n     city has an African-American represented a predominantly \n     white ward. And were it not for the voting rights act which \n     has helped to mitigate the financial disadvantages \n     experienced by minority candidates, the city council would \n     almost certainly be less representative of Chicago's \n     diversity than it is today.\n\nProblem 5: The current campaign finance system has made legislators and \n candidates too financially dependent on a small number of legislative \n                                leaders.\n\n       The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of political \n     action committees established and controlled by Federal and \n     State legislative leaders. These entities, which attract \n     enormous amounts of special interest money, provide an \n     alternative way of getting \n\n[[Page S 9940]]\n     money to favored candidates. However, these conduits--which are \n     perfectly legal--also allow leaders to solidify their \n     positions within their party caucuses, exercise greater \n     control over members and increase their influence over a \n     range of legislative matters.\n       This trend has not only accelerated the decline of \n     political parties but has led to an unhealthy financial \n     dependence by many rank and file legislators on their leaders \n     and, according to some experts, to a dimunition of their \n     independence. There was a time, of course, when leaders \n     earned the loyalty of their followers; today, loyalty is \n     increasingly a purchasable commodity. That is not a good \n     development.\n       In 1994, Federal leadership PACS distributed more than $3.6 \n     million to congressional candidates. But what has occurred in \n     Illinois makes the growth and reach of Federal leadership \n     PACS look trivial in comparison. Last year, Michael Madigan, \n     then the speaker of the Illinois house, controlled a $5.3 \n     million war chest, and his Republican counterpart, Lee \n     Daniels, the current speaker, had $2.5 million at his \n     disposal. Much of this nearly $8 million was directed to \n     candidates in\n      23 pivotal legislative races in which the candidates on \n     their own had already raised $4.5 million\n       Although I have not seen a detailed analysis of how these \n     leadership funds were distributed last year, I can tell you \n     what occurred in 1992. The Democratic House candidates \n     running in 21 targeted races that year received on average \n     $81,000 from the Madigan fund. Of all the money spent by \n     those candidates, nearly 60 percent came from this single \n     source. It is not hard to believe that those Democrats who \n     won feel a special debt of gratitude for the speakers \n     generosity.\n\n   Problem 6: The current campaign finance system has coarsened the \n                   political dialogue in this country\n\n       Costly broadcast advertising has driven up campaign costs. \n     But that is not the only problem. Candidates' increased \n     reliance on television ads has led to less informative and \n     more mean-spirited campaigns. We are told that attack ads \n     work; they must, because why else would candidates invest so \n     much money in this stuff? But who really benefits and at what \n     cost to the political system? The public is fed slivers of \n     information, often deceptively presented. Real issues are not \n     discussed. The most obvious victim, of course, is a political \n     tradition that once prided itself in allowing serious \n     candidates to debate serious issues in a serious way.\n       The United States is the only major democracy that neither \n     restricts the amount of money candidates can spend on \n     broadcast advertising nor regulates their access to and use \n     of this powerful medium. As a result, the quality of the \n     Nation's political discourse has declined sharply. And so, \n     too, has the public's confidence in the veracity and judgment \n     of our leaders.\n\n  Problem 7: The campaign finance system has driven people out of the \n   electoral process and reduced their role to voting on election day\n\n       The last 30 years have witnessed what can only be described \n     as a hostile take-over of the election process by highly paid \n     and often unaccountable professional operatives. The campaign \n     finance system has spawned an industry of pollsters, ad \n     producers, time-buyers, professional fundraisers, direct-mail \n     specialists and spin-doctors. Their exorbitant demands on \n     campaign resources require that ever increasing amounts of \n     money be raised. It is a trend that leaves little room in \n     campaigns for the citizen-volunteers who were once the \n     backbone of most campaigns. The ascendancy of political \n     consultants has robbed our politics of the fun, hoopla, and \n     sadly, much of the substance once commonly associated with \n     campaigns.\n\n   Problem 8: The campaign finance system all too often elevates or \n     appears to elevate private interests over the public interest\n\n       Of all the system's shortcomings, this by far is the most \n     serious. When citizens on a large scale harbor suspicions \n     about the fairness and integrity of policymaking and \n     regulatory processes, as is clearly the case today, it casts \n     doubts on the legitimacy of the political system itself.\n\n\n                               vignettes\n\n       Hardly a week passes without some news report about how \n     special interest money is being used to skew policy \n     priorities, shape legislation and influence regulatory \n     decisions. Elected officials may find the suggestion \n     offensive, but a growing number of Americans are convinced \n     that those who pay the piper also call the tune. Let me give \n     you some examples.\n       Tort Reform. When Illinois State legislators on one side of \n     the tort reform debate accept nearly $2 million in campaign \n     contributions as well as business contracts from the Illinois \n     State Medical Society, and lawmakers on the other side accept \n     nearly half a million dollars from the Illinois Trial Lawyers \n     Association and tens of thousands of dollars from individual \n     members, what are we to think? Would it be unfair\n      to conclude that the public interest may not have been the \n     paramount consideration in this debate? I don't think so.\n       Clean Water. In 1994, 273 PACs associated with industries \n     bent on weakening the Clean Water Act contributed nearly $8 \n     million to Members of the U.S. House Representatives. Those \n     serving on the committee with jurisdiction over the bill \n     alone received $1.2 million. So far, the industries' efforts \n     appear to be paying off. Water quality standards have been \n     rolled back. As a foundation committed to cleaning up the \n     Great Lakes, we are all too aware that money talks . . . and \n     it may speak loudly enough to drown out 25 years of progress \n     on environmental issues.\n       Pesticides. The environmental working group--one of our \n     foundation's grantees--issued a report late last year showing \n     that sponsors of legislation designed to weaken Federal \n     pesticide laws received $3.1 million in contributions from 44 \n     industry-supported PACs. This represented nearly a 100-\n     percent increase over donations made during a comparable \n     period two years earlier. What accounted for this sudden \n     spurt of generosity? Industry was reacting to a Federal court \n     decision that threatened to ban dozens of cancer-causing \n     pesticides. In the end the pesticide industry got largely \n     what it wanted. Whether the Americans people won is another \n     matter altogether, money talks.\n       Guns. Last year the National Rifle Association poured $3 \n     million into the campaigns of Congressional candidates who \n     support that organization's agenda--an agenda, I might add, \n     which is at odds with the majority of the American people. \n     The NRA targeted for defeat four Members who had voted in \n     favor of last year's assault weapons ban. Three, including \n     Speaker Tom Foley, lost.\n       More recently Speaker Gingrich appointed a task force to \n     review current Federal laws pertaining to guns, including the \n     Brady bill and the assault weapons ban. All six Members \n     appointed by the speaker are outspoken opponents of gun \n     control, and four received significant NRA financial support \n     during the last election. Will this panel give people who \n     want to quell the epidemic of gun violence a chance to be \n     heard? And if it does, will it listen to what they, and so \n     many others have to say? Or will they be--if you'll excuse \n     the expression--shot down by the influence of money?\n       State Contracts. In fiscal year 1992, the State of Illinois \n     contracted with businesses and individuals for $4.6 billion \n     worth of goods and services. A third of those contracts--$1.6 \n     billion--were awarded to campaign contributors of statewide \n     candidates. And about $437 million in State business went to \n     contributors on a non-bid basis. According to the Illinois \n     State-Journal, the dollar amount of the non-bid contracts \n     awarded contributors was six times greater than the value of \n     the contracts awarded non-contributors. For the more \n     enterprising among us, I think there's a message here. Money \n     talks.\n       Health Care. Despite solemn promises from nearly all \n     quarters, the American people didn't get health care reform \n     last year. In the end, reform was swallowed up in a sea of \n     dollars.\n       I doubt we will never know how much money was at play. It \n     is conservatively estimated that in 1993 and 1994 the medical \n     professions, insurance industry, pharmaceutical companies and \n     an assortment of business interests spent $100 million to \n     influence the outcome of the health care debate.\n       There are some things, thanks to disclosure, that we do \n     know. For example, we know that during the last election \n     cycle health care-related industries poured at least $25 \n     million into the campaign coffers of Members of Congress. \n     One-third of that largesse was directed to Members serving on \n     the five House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over \n     health care issues.\n       We know that in 1992 and 1993 at least 85 Members availed \n     themselves of 181 all-expense paid trips sponsored by health \n     care industries--trips designed to help Members learn about \n     health care in out-of-the-way places where distractions\n      could be kept to a minimum. Places like Paris, Montego Bay, \n     and Puerto Rico.\n       We also know that health care interests hired nearly 100 \n     law, public relations and lobbying firms to do their bidding \n     at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue--and that these firms in \n     turn brought 80 or so former high-ranking Federal officials \n     on board, including recently retired Members of Congress, to \n     give their efforts greater authority.\n       We know that the health insurance association of America \n     spent millions to produce and air its ``Harry and Louise'' \n     ads--a strategy that almost single-handedly led to a 20-point \n     drop in public approval of the Clinton proposal.\n       We know that the tobacco industry spent millions more to \n     scuttle a proposed $2 tax on cigarettes, the revenue from \n     which would have helped finance a new health care system.\n       We know that the national federation of independent \n     businesses spent even more to kill a mandatory employer tax \n     designed to help pay for universal health care coverage.\n       We are told that all the pushing and shoving by competing \n     interests around health care reform was a textbook \n     demonstration of democracy at work. We may not like the \n     results, we are told, but this is how a democracy functions \n     and should function.\n       This is not how a democracy functions. The analysis \n     overlooks one critically important fact. The interests of \n     those with the largest stake in reform--the 39 million \n     Americans without health insurance, the 80 million with pre-\n     existing medical conditions, and the 120 million with \n     lifetime limits on their health insurance policies--were \n     grossly underrepresented. Those most in need of help didn't \n     have an army of lobbyists on capitol hill, couldn't afford \n     television ads, and were in no position to contribute \n     millions of dollars to Members of Congress. On every front, \n     they were heavily outgunned.\n       When the definitive history of this episode is written, one \n     conclusion will be impossible \n\n[[Page S 9941]]\n     to avoid: in the great debate over health care reform, money didn't \n     just talk, it roared.\n\n\n                           cash constituents\n\n       Defenders of the current system are quick to point out that \n     suspected overreaching is not proof of official wrongdoing. \n     They are right. But the absence of indictable offenses is a \n     flimsy defense for practices that bring about widespread \n     distrust of the political system.\n       In the final analysis, what counts is what people believe, \n     and most people believe they are being shortchanged by a \n     system which puts them into one of two classes: cash \n     constituents or non-cash constituents. Cash constituents have \n     regular access to elected officials; non-cash constituents \n     don't. Cash constituents are willing to pay to play; non-cash \n     constituents can't afford to.\n       If you remember no other statistic I cite tonight, let me \n     offer one that's worth storing away for future reference. In \n     1992, half of all the money raised by congressional \n     candidates--$335 million--was provided by one-third of 1 \n     percent of the American people.\n       Unbelievably, things could get worse. For example, in the \n     name of deficit reduction, Senate Republicans recently tried \n     to scrap the public finance system for presidential \n     candidates--arguably, the most important and durable reform \n     coming out of the Watergate era. The effort was narrowly \n     beaten back.\n       Congress has already passed legislation that would \n     significantly reduce the budget of the Federal Election \n     Commission. Unless President Clinton vetoes this bill, the \n     agency's ability to ensure financial disclosure by political \n     candidates and committees will be severely crippled. In an \n     unusually blunt letter to Members of Congress, the\n      commission's chairman recently warned that a deep cut could \n     lead ``the public, fairly or not, to suspect that Congress \n     is punishing the agency for doing its job.''\n       Now, if these developments were not enough for one season, \n     G. Gordon Liddy, the former Nixon aide and mastermind of the \n     Watergate break-in 23 years ago, has just been honored with \n     the freedom of speech award by the national association of \n     talk show hosts. It's enough to make you question the Bible's \n     assurances about the meek inheriting the earth.\n\n\n                       the foundation's approach\n\n       In the face of all these problems, what is the Joyce \n     Foundation's strategy? Our goal is to make the issue of \n     campaign finance a more prominent part of the public policy \n     agenda. And we are seeking to do that through projects \n     emphasizing expanded news media coverage, public education, \n     fresh analyses of campaign finance practices and improved \n     disclosure and regulation. Through the work of our grantees, \n     we hope to create incentives that will help persuade \n     lawmakers to face up to and finally meet their \n     responsibilities.\n       I should quickly add that the foundation is not promoting \n     any particular reform approach. But we believe that reform, \n     if it is worthy of that name, must at a minimum control the \n     costs of campaigns, increase political competition, encourage \n     voting and restore the public's confidence in the fairness of \n     elections and in the integrity of the policymaking process. \n     Two foundation-supported projects designed to move us in \n     these directions deserve mention tonight.\n       The Illinois Project. Twenty years have elapsed since \n     Illinois last overhauled its campaign finance system. It is \n     time to do it again. Here is a system in which the only \n     limits are the sky itself. In Illinois, there are: no limits \n     on the amount of campaign money candidates can raise; no \n     limits on the sources of campaign contributions; no limits on \n     the amount of money candidates can spend; no limits on the \n     size of contributions individual and institutional donors can \n     make; no limits on the vast war chests candidates can \n     accumulate and carry over from one election to the next; no \n     limits on candidates' use of campaign funds for personal and \n     non-campaign related expenses; and no limits on leadership \n     PACs.\n       The only restrictions worth noting are those intended to \n     inhibit public access to and understanding of the financial \n     disclosure reports that candidates and committees are \n     required to file periodically with the State board of \n     elections. And, if perchance, you even rummage through these \n     records, you'll quickly discover that it's virtually \n     impossible to figure out, beyond names and addresses, who the \n     State's political high rollers really are. Illinois has the \n     distinction of being one of a handful of States that still \n     does not require candidates to list the occupation of their \n     contributors.\n       Illinois' campaign finance system makes the federal system \n     look relatively tame, if not pristine. And that is why the \n     Joyce Foundation is supporting a 2-year, $200,000 examination \n     of this system by the State's leading public affairs \n     magazine, Illinois Issues.\n       By this fall, the magazine's project staff will have put \n     the finishing touches on a vast computerized database that \n     will include all contributions of $25 or more made to \n     legislative and statewide candidates since 1990. And as much \n     occupational information about donors as can be independently \n     obtained will also be incorporated into the database.\n       This reservoir of information will enable Illinois Issues \n     to begin answering a question that should intrigue us all: \n     Who is giving how much to whom for what purposes and with \n     what effects? Detailed and customized profiles of individual\n      candidates, interest groups, regions and districts will be \n     developed. These reports, which will be made available to \n     the States news media, are certain to shed light on the \n     often murky financial behavior of candidates and donors \n     alike. Citizens wishing direct access to the database will \n     be able to get it at relatively low cost through an on-\n     line information network.\n       In addition, the magazine has assembled a distinguished \n     panel of citizens who over the next year and a half will \n     examine various alternatives for reforming the State's \n     campaign finance rules. This task force which is comprised of \n     scholars, journalists, political practitioners, and civic \n     leaders--including Senator Paul Simon, two university \n     presidents and your own Cindy Canary--is expected to \n     formulate and advance a set of reform recommendations late \n     next year. But before doing so, the panel will consult with \n     and collect testimony from a diverse cross-section of \n     interested Illinoisans as well as carefully weigh the reform \n     experiences of other jurisdictions across the country.\n       Money, Politics and the Public Voice. As angry as people \n     are about the influence private money exerts on our politics, \n     there is no groundswell of popular support for one reform \n     approach or another. Indeed, there is no clear and loud \n     public demand for change--at least not the kind of impatient \n     outcry elected officials are inclined to take notice of and \n     heed.\n       The foundation is convinced that reform will come more \n     quickly if the public is brought into this debate in a much \n     bigger way. But this is not small challenge. After all, just \n     how do you clear a space at the policymaking table and pull \n     up a chair for the American people? Well, that's the riddle \n     the League of Women Voters education fund, in partnership \n     with the Benton Foundation and the Hardwood group, have set \n     out to answer over the next 2 years. And the Joyce Foundation \n     is betting nearly half a million dollars that this unusual \n     consortium will help solve that mystery.\n       About a year from now thousands of citizens, armed with \n     background and discussion materials, will meet in \n     neighborhoods and communities across America to learn about \n     the campaign finance problem, to debate various reform \n     options, and to clarify and make known to their elected \n     Representatives the changes they want and are willing to \n     support. These will not be undisciplined rap and complaint \n     sessions but instead structured and expertly facilitated \n     conversations that we hope and believe will yield the kind of \n     reasoned and considered policy judgments that the political \n     community will find difficult to dismiss.\n       It is our hope that other groups--like the American \n     association of retired persons, the American association of \n     community colleges and the university extension system--will \n     eventually join the campaign, adding to the league's \n     considerable organizational reach and enabling the project to \n     host at least one forum in each of the country's 435 \n     congressional districts.\n       To ensure that every step of this process is fully \n     amplified, including the final results and public \n     interactions between project participants and elected \n     officials, the project is developing an aggressive public \n     information and media outreach strategy. In addition, video, \n     teleconferences, computers and other communication \n     technologies will be used to connect the project's \n     participants with each other, the news media and \n     policymakers.\n       To date, the league-led project team has hired a staff of \n     seasoned organizers, engaged the services of a professional \n     communications firm, assembled an advisory panel of campaign \n     finance experts and completed an exhaustive review of the \n     vast literature on this subject. In the coming days, it will \n     launch a series of focus groups in order to get a better fix \n     on what people know and don't know about the campaign finance \n     problem, how they talk about it, and how they would fix it, \n     were it in their power to do so. These insights will aid in \n     the development of the project's\n      educational materials and a deliberative process designed to \n     assist non-experts work through a complex policy problem \n     like campaign finance.\n       The two projects I've briefly sketched out are ambitious, \n     complex, expensive and labor intensive. If they are to \n     succeed, the sponsors will need all the help they can garner. \n     I know the ED fund and Illinois Issues would warmly welcome \n     your participation and assistance, and I hope you will be \n     able to offer some of each in the coming months.\n       Although this organization's plate is always full and this \n     year is no exception, I would strongly encourage you to leave \n     a little room for campaign finance reform. Your reputation \n     for raising public consciousness on important issues, for \n     educating and mobilizing citizens and for talking sense to \n     lawmakers could make a huge difference in ending those \n     campaign finance practices that often make the realization of \n     the league's own policy goals needlessly difficult. So I hope \n     you will join us; the water's fine and sure to get a lot \n     warmer in the next year.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       If I sound perturbed about the problem of money in \n     politics, it's because I am. It's a problem, after all, that \n     hits very close to home. This year the foundation will award \n     nearly $6 million in grants to scores of organizations that \n     are working tirelessly and in most cases with limited \n     resources to repair and reserve the environment for future \n     generations. These nonprofit organizations are in no position \n     to compete financially with \n\n[[Page S 9942]]\n     those interests whose commitments to environmental protection often \n     take a backseat to other economic considerations.\n       It's not a fair fight, when the congressional co-sponsors \n     of amendments to the Safe Water Drinking Act get 60 times \n     more money from businesses supporting the bill than from pro-\n     environmental groups. And it's even less fair, when the co-\n     sponsors of the private property owners bill of rights get \n     300 times more money from the bill's industry supporters than \n     from pro-environmental groups. For this reason, in addition \n     to all the others I've discussed, the foundation has a keen \n     interest in cleaning up the campaign finance system. If the \n     playing field were more level, I know that our conservation \n     grantees and those working in other areas, like gun violence, \n     could more than hold their own against the forces that oppose \n     them. But as things now stand, every fight involving the good \n     guys is uphill these days, and that's not right.\n       In conclusion, let me say this. The continuing debate on \n     campaign finance reform is more than a squabble over how to \n     revise the rules of the road. The debate is really about \n     fundamentals and first principles; it is at bottom a struggle \n     for the soul of the American political system. And that is a \n     struggle which people who yearn for a more open, \n     participatory and accountable politics--people like you and \n     me--dare not take lightly, walk away from or lose.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9938-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         LIVESTOCK GRAZING ACT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I recently wrote a letter to the \nprincipal author of the Livestock Grazing Act outlining my concerns \nover this bill. I ask that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    July 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pete: The purpose of this letter is to let you know \n     that I have added my name as a cosponsor of S. 852, the \n     ``Livestock Grazing Act.'' Livestock operators are a vital \n     part of Montana's economic base. It is my belief that S. 852, \n     as originally drafted, offers the security that ranchers need \n     to remain viable during these uncertain economic times.\n       The men and women who make their living off the land form \n     the backbone of Montana. Without the rancher, many small \n     communities would simply cease to exist. Absent ranching, the \n     wide open spaces that provide elk winter range, wildlife \n     corridors and critical wildlife habitat would be jeopardized \n     by subdivision and development. In short, ranching is \n     fundamental to preserving much of what makes Montana, ``the \n     last, best place.''\n       As you move to Energy Committee markup of S. 852, I ask \n     that you satisfy three specific concerns that are critical to \n     my support of this legislation. These concerns are as \n     follows:\n\n\n                        1. public participation\n\n       While the federal public lands are essential to many \n     livestock operators, they are also deeply valued by the \n     general public. Clean streams and healthy wildlife \n     populations are just as important to Montana's sportsmen as \n     predictability and security in the federal grazing rules are \n     to the rancher. S. 852 must ensure that the public is granted \n     full participation in the decision-making process affecting \n     the use and management of these lands. If it does not, I will \n     work to see that comprehensive public participation is \n     assured before this legislation reaches a final vote on the \n     Senate floor.\n       We must not lose sight of the fact that these are public \n     lands; they belong to all of us. Ranchers, hunters, \n     fishermen, birdwatchers, motorized recreationists and every \n     other segment of\n      the user public must be granted an equal seat at the table. \n     Montana has already worked with the BLM to identify and \n     select individuals interested in working together to \n     improve our public range lands. Just last week, the BLM \n     and the Governor of Montana jointly appointed 45 \n     individuals to three advisory councils to begin this \n     important work. S. 852 cannot deprive these Montanans of \n     their fundamental democratic right of participation.\n\n\n               2. more on-the-ground work, less paperwork\n\n       With over 30 percent of our land base in federal ownership, \n     many Montanans interact on a daily basis with federal land \n     managers. Perhaps our biggest criticism with all federal land \n     management agencies is the ever-increasing allocation of \n     limited resources to paperwork and bureaucracy rather than \n     actual work in the field. The men and women who work for \n     these agencies share this sentiment, and are frustrated by \n     it.\n       Having spent a rainy day working with ranchers, \n     conservationists and government personnel to rehabilitate a \n     stream in the Blackfoot Valley, I have seen firsthand how \n     much good can be done with a little start-up money and a few \n     strong backs. As the budgets of our land management agencies \n     continue to shrink, their resources must be directed to the \n     field, rather than to increased bureaucracy and paperwork. S. \n     852 must deemphasize paperwork and get the money to the \n     allotment level where we can see tangible benefits come from \n     our tax dollars.\n\n\n                             3. Stewardship\n\n       Over 70 percent of BLM grazing lands in Montana are rated \n     good to excellent, while less than 5 percent is in poor \n     condition. These numbers demonstrate that our public lands \n     grazers are largely good stewards of the land. Still, there \n     is room for improvement. S. 852 must include a mechanism that \n     gives permittees increased responsibility for bringing the \n     public range into good to excellent condition. Such solutions \n     cannot be rigidly imposed by those who are removed from the \n     land and the unique challenges that exist on each allotment. \n     We will see improvement only if these solutions come from the \n     permittee. S. 852 should encourage innovative local \n     stewardship.\n       In closing, I look forward to working with you on this very \n     important issue to our states. It is my belief that the \n     fundamental thrust of S. 852, coupled with these \n     recommendations, will serve to promote responsible public \n     lands stewardship while providing the necessary security that \n     our ranchers need to remain viable in Montana and throughout \n     the West.\n       With best personal regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Max Baucus.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/13/senate-section/article/S9942-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            EDMUNDO GONZALES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.
